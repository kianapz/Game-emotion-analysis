@Hazure_ow,"if they dont release pve or 3rd person mode or something on that level, i dont think anybody will come back from rivals to play Overwatch again.",0
@Frandrago,Groundbreaking changes = We have a competitor now and we're doing the usual of copying stuff that works and you like from them to incorporate in our games then act like it was totally our intentions before it came out anyway.,1
@cornnutz7797,Never like OW but I would actually play it if they added PvE,0
@kaoslim,I wish more videos like this had summary commentsâ€¦. Hereâ€™s to wishing!,0

@Eeveethegamer26,"They're gonna be introducing $70 bundles, and you have to buy the bundles to get skins ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",0
@mvtta,"As someone who genuinely adores Overwatch, even now, I am so stoked Rivals created competition for them.",0
@hellohello-yi8yr,Its a balance update where they reduce bap recoil by 60% due to fatigue again,0
@Anziilife,Smells like a last death-cramp after the Rivals (see what I did there?) smashed them repeatedly for the last 6 weeks straight.,0
@Oldenburg93,"I just hope they don't try and make it the same as Rivals. I personally don't care for rivals. Watched a few streams but that's it. There are definitely things they need to work on, I'm just hopeful they still keep it feeling like Overwatch if that makes sense",0
@mohammadalhusaini810,I literally canâ€™t feel optimistic even if i wanted to,0
@starboyaddy4494,I luv how they never put on paper wat they are gonna do or doing,0
@Malao558,"The exact contents of this livestream will be:

Thank you for playing!",0
@KRaimix,"So 0,005 s differences coming",0
@g_eazyu9990,After six years I uninstall overwatch and itâ€™s already dead. marvels is the new best thing ever,0
@piccaro0901,We know theyâ€™re in the kitchen but we donâ€™t know if theyâ€™re cooking.,0
@angelgae3128,"3:55 - ""Let's make a great game."" So they admit that they WEREN'T trying before.",0
@joshuahandhand8959,The overwatch dev team is incapable of turning this ship around.,0
@elyjahheaven,Damn i can't wait for the new kiriko bodypaint skin. The livestream will be good,0
@TheGGod,Omg where getting more disappointing news,0
@masterweapon334,Boy who cried wolf is crying wolf (yet again),0
@Samuraithekid,"haha Flats I saw your comment under the tweet ""Are we, so back?""",0
@Re-Equalizer,Is it possible that they finally got the kick in the ass they needed? We'll find out.,0
@MyraChappell,"i saw a small leak so dont know if its true but i think there bring back old sr, hero ban, and 6 v 6 so its nothing new just old shit",0
@robnoel9306,"Yes, something is coming. The end.",0
@KKJazz,is it just me or Flats lookin' skintier ðŸ‘Œ,0
@SoggyHotDoggy,"Weâ€™ll see if itâ€™s actually something major (prolly not) 

But even if it is, with how Blizzard has evaporated their goodwill, you gotta wonder if itâ€™ll even matter on the off chance that it IS majorâ€¦. The link ending in PVE is pretty hilarious tho",0
@glazedbelmont,"The fact that this skin was in the shop for 23 hours before the announcement is such a fuck-up from Blizzard, hope they actually refund people because otherwise a handful of people just got scammed out of 20$",0
@BethPlayingGames,"Rivals will either make or break Overwatch tbh. Blizzard needs compeition because they have become lazy in the hero shooting space without any. Nothing drives innovation or change quite like another game breathing down your neck. I enjoy both games, and I really want both to succeed! I think they are similar but different enough that both can co-exist but drive each other to pump out good updates and positive community aimed content. I think the OW team knows a lot of people will be lost to Rivals full time, instead of flopping between both games, and they are scrambling to give us a big flashy moment to dangle the carrot back over our heads. I'm hoping it truly is groundbreaking, otherwise its going to be such a fat L for the game if it ends up being extremely underwhelming. But we shall wait and see on Feb 12th!",0
@fractalelf7760,I have zero hope for anything anymore with OWâ€¦. Management canâ€™t get their head out of their asses.,0
@Pikachu-qr4yb,Venture 2nd skin,1
@ElDuderino2112,"Things will change, but itâ€™s Overwatch. Blizzard has shown since day one they canâ€™t balance this game. Thatâ€™s not going to change suddenly.",0
@TheDeadAreLiving,"Some want to stay with the current 5v5 format while others want the 6v6 so for something never before seen and groundbreaking how about 5v6 with the one team being slightly buffed to make it more even, this way you get to choose what format you want to play as. Hey you never know it might happen. lol",0
@ornerycollop4670,They are announcing they decided they canâ€™t handle the load of balancing the game so they are cancelling PvP,0
@TNTspaz,It's super obviously just gonna be them trying to overhype bringing back 6v6,0
@theeagle7552,New Kiriko skin and Hazard buff. Trust,0
@heartbreak1740,i swear to gpd if they bring back PVE like how it was supposed to be it will be game of the year. like it would be BG3 levels of work but it would be game of the year,0
@kamixakadio2441,You *KNOW* these changes ain't gonna be groundbreaking..,0
@watnoisy1995,"we are all going to tune in and go back to Marvel Rivals. I know its like a joke at this point but I genuinely just don't think Overwatch is that fun anymore. The game itself is just stale. If they really want to boost their player count, they should invest in entertainment like LOL for Arcane or Marvel movies/shows for Rivals. Like Overwatch had HUGE potential with their story but what do they do? SKINS and dumb player balances. I remember crying over Bastion's cinematic film...like thats the stuff that will keep people coming.",0
@iDclul101,"say it with me chat: ""if it aint PVE, it ain't something to see""",0
@joshmo4859,Its 4v4,0
@aliaxang5165,"I have feeling some completely new game mode or change to c9re game will come
Maybe something similar to deadlock with ability upgrade or item buying or something ðŸ¤”",0
@calza1990,I could go on and on but let's keep it basic.... I'm skeptical.,0
