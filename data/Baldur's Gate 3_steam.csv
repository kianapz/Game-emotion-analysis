"One of the most detailed and freedom-giving RPGs I’ve ever played. I created a total of 3 different characters, and each of their adventures was completely unique. Since I didn’t like the outfits in the game, I added various gothic clothing and hair mods. This way, my characters looked amazing and I could roleplay exactly as I wanted. I also really enjoyed the combat system based on DnD rules, as it gave a sense of being strategic and creative. The game's story is very captivating, its fantastical world, and music are perfect. BG3 is a fantastic game that I will play again and again.

"This is probably going to be one of the best games for the next decade, the voice acting is sublime and the writers seemed to have made deals with the devil in order to make such a good tale. 10/10",True,45,4
"I don't know how they pulled it off. After seeing Baldur's Gate III listed as Early Access many years ago I thought to myself ""Good luck, there's no way this lives up to the older Baldur's Gate games"" as those games were a huge part of my teenage years and turned me on to DnD in general. I kept hearing great things about the Early Access game from friends that never played the originals but I still held out until it was fully released. I have never been happier to eat my words. Not only does this game FEEL like a Baldur's Gate game, it's the best of all of them. The amount of freedom in this game makes me feel EXACTLY like I felt while playing the older two games. I constantly think to myself while playing, ""They thought of everything!"" This is completely worthy of the Baldur's Gate name and worth every penny at full price. Bravo!",True,58,1
"I started playing this game a year and a few months after it was launched and immediately got into character creation which took me over an hour not to mention building my Dream Guardian. Since purchasing it at full price, I was weary to buy a game for 60 bucks, but it has been the best 60 bucks I've spent in a LONG time. 

The whole game itself doesn't hold your hand during the game, but it does help you build up your skills and learn how to play as you go which is great for those who haven't played CRPG turn based game before. I have basically played this nonstop since October to pass time and as you can see with my 527 hours on record, I absolutely LOVE this game. The options for responses and endings are endless. I'm thoroughly blown away with the voice acting and, yes, the mod options. There are many people who hate playing with mods, but to me it adds a lot to the game and enhances my game play experience making me want to play it more. I have done numerous campaigns and as of January 2025, I'm doing my 2nd durge campaign trying to play a somewhat evil character which is hard as I've cried from being evil to pixels haha. 

Overall, I think this game may be the best game I've ever played and I love how Larian and the VA's show their active participation in the community along with Larian giving us FREE updates and gives modders the toolkit. This company could've charged $100 or more for this game with the amount of work and thought put into it along with the (again) FREE updates, but they didn't. They have shown they care more for the player's experience and making a game that out beats other new games and certain *ahem developers AHEM Bethesda* by giving us a game that is completed at release (from what I've been told by other gamers who played this at release). I recommend this game to anyone who wants a rich, fulfilling game that doesn't have any extra catches outside the initial price.",True,34,1
"The replayability of this game is insane, Larian did an amazing job giving us exactly what we wanted and maybe even a little more. This game has taken over my life and I love it so much, lol, and showing no signs of putting it down any time soon!",True,25,0
"I have played this game for 6 hours (2h on character creator), never played this type of game before.. can say I am impressed and enjoying it a lot.

18 hours in the game: I think that I'm addicted. The stories are surprising and wholesome. I feel like a hero in this game, living for the good of the people.

50 hours: I finally finished act 1. And oh boy did I turn from good to evil with every step I took. I didn't mean to be... How was I supposed to know that pulling the wrong lever, I'll be catapulting a gnome to space. That wasn't my fault.

80 hours: Yes! Give me your gold. All the shiny trinkets you have. Give me your soul and all the power you hold. Give me more... MORE!

100 hours: How dare you look down on me, thinking like you could ever defeat me?! Hit me with all you got, it will never be enough!

120 hours: ... *only screams echo in the darkness* ...

130 hours: *Muahahaha-*
You may call me the blood queen,
but your agenda is also driven by greed.
The battle you lost, your advisors lied.
Your heroes are dead, your city is mine.
No evil as dark or vengeance as red,
have never been seen as I took the kings head.",True,20,12
"Look, there are a lot of reviews about this game, and I don't think I can add some interesting new views to that,

Instead, I'll just share that I have over 476 hours played in the game on GoG. I like the game so much I paid for it again on steam, full price, because I felt like supporting the developers some more. You might really, _really_ enjoy this one. :-D",True,24,0
"At first, I was hesitant to buy this game because of its price, but after playing it twice for a total of 260 hours, I still want to come back for a third playthrough, I can confidently say it’s worth every penny and more.

[h3]The customization:[/h3]
The game offers a wide selection for customization, allowing you to choose your race, background, and class, with the option to multiclass. You can even customize your voice, body type and your wiener. Dialogues are influenced by your origin, race, and class. Wizards and sorcerers can make fun of each other, drows can intimidate others, and companions might banter with you about whose god is the better one.

If you don’t want to create your own character, you can play as one of the 7 Origin characters. I recommend creating your own character or trying ""The Dark Urge"". He is unique as he is the only Origin character who doesn’t appear in the story, offering a unique playthrough you won’t experience on a normal playthrough.

The animations and facial expressions are impressive as well, they bring life to both human and non-human races. Even characters like dragonborns have expressive facial expressions.

[h3]Companions:[/h3]
The game features a huge cast of companions (10), each with their own distinct personalities and backstories. Over time, these companions evolve from strangers in your party to allies, friends, or romantic interests. Companions dynamically react to your choices and to each other, leading to surprising dialogues and conflicts. Bringing specific companions to encounters can change how they unfold, and you can influence their fate—helping them stay on their path or stray away from it. The voice acting is also phenomenal. Romances also features options for polymorphic or same-sex relationships, (so no one missies out on Shadowheart or Halsin).

Spoiler Alert: If you don’t want to miss an easily missable companion:[spoiler]When you meet a drow named Minthara, and if you get into a fight, switch to non-lethal combat and knock her out instead of killing her.[/spoiler]

[h3]Open World and Exploration:[/h3]
The game does an amazing job with its story, covering a wide range of topics, with its central themes being trauma, trust, and personal growth. There are three acts, each offering many beautiful and memorable locations to explore. Its open-world design lets you roam freely, and NPCs dynamically react to your actions. 

The world feels alive, with consequences for your actions. After 200+ hours, I’m still finding hidden dialogues and secret details that surprise me, making me appreciate the developers’ attention to detail.

[h3]Gameplay and Mechanics:[/h3]
The game offers many difficulty options, from ""Explorer"" for those who just want to enjoy the story to ""Tactician"" for the min-maxers. You can also play the game solo or in co-op, giving you the opportunity to experience the story with your friends.

Combat is highly creative, with spells and abilities that interact with the environment. For example, you can set up explosive barrels before an ambush or use water to create electrified surfaces. Players can tackle obstacles in numerous ways—combat, stealth, magic, or conversation. This variety ensures you can tailor the story to your own playstyle.

[h3]Flaws:[/h3] 
[list]
[*]As with many open-world games, bugs can arise due to its complex and detailed structure. For example, after killing a character, NPCs might still refer to them as alive. In one instance, I exposed a thief disguised as a guard, only to have him arrest me for stealing. 
[*]The ""non-lethal combat"" system, while great for roleplay purposes, doesn’t change much regarding the story. Knocked-out characters are treated as dead in most cases, with only a few exceptions.
[*]Lastly, the game struggles to provide a meaningful ""evil"" playthrough. While you can roleplay as morally grey or chaotic, the ""evil with purpose"" path is underdeveloped. Choosing the evil route frequently locks you out of story content, companions, and loot, making it less rewarding compared to good or morally ambiguous paths.
[/list]

[h3]Modding:[/h3]
The game supports modding through its official tools. You can download mods for quality-of-life improvements, like new hairstyles or face shapes, to more substantial additions such as new classes or playable races. For those who enjoy customizing further, mods like the ""handsome Lae'zel"" option let you adjust her appearance (though Bae'zel is already pretty stunning as she is!).

[h3]Overall:[/h3]
Baldur's Gate 3 is a masterpiece that combines rich storytelling, deep customization, and endless possibilities for creativity. Whether you like D&D or completely new to the genre, this game offers an unforgettable RPG experience that will keep you coming back for more.",True,9,0
"Okay, let's be clear: I'm a button-mashing, adrenaline-fueled action RPG kind of gamer. Give me fast-paced combat, flashy spells, and a story that unfolds at breakneck speed. Turn-based strategy? That's for... other people.  I only bought Baldur's Gate 3 because of the hype; I figured I'd check it out, maybe play for an hour, and then move on.  I was spectacularly wrong.
 
This game somehow managed to grab my attention and refuse to let go. The story is surprisingly engaging, full of unexpected twists and turns. The characters are well-written, the dialogue sharp and witty, and the sheer number of choices available is overwhelming in the best possible way.
 
The combat, initially a confusing mess of dice rolls and ability checks, slowly transformed into a deeply satisfying strategic challenge. The feeling of outmaneuvering a tough enemy with a perfectly planned sequence of actions is incredibly rewarding, even for someone who usually prefers to just hack and slash their way through a game.
 
The sheer amount of content is staggering. Seriously, the replayability alone makes this game worth the price of admission. There's so much to explore, so many different paths to take, and so many ways to play.  I went in expecting a quick playthrough, and instead, I found myself completely lost in a rich and rewarding world.
 
Highly recommended – even if you're an action RPG purist like me, and even if you only bought it because of the hype. You might just surprise yourself.",True,14,0
"This is a very enthralling game, not without flaws of course.  I encountered many bugs during my playthrough that required me to reload a previous save.  I also find the last part of the game to feel very underdeveloped compared to the first two acts.  Despite that, it's one of those games that as soon as I finished I wanted to immediately play again and see how my choices would change things in its vast world.  One of those RPG's that I will come back to, many, many times.",True,4,0
"Is it epic RPG – without a doubt. Is it game that will be mentioned in 10-15 years line and put in the same league as the original Planescape Torment or Fallout 1 – without a doubt. Is it perfect game – well… no, it isn’t and has its problems.

✅[list]
[*] Multitude of options in character creation and fine-tuning chosen class.

[*] Game looks great and despite the fact that Larian was using their usual engine, they’ve managed to keep the essence of D&D world and its original look.

[*] Epic soundtrack and great sound effects.

[*] Massive maps full of POI, secrets, hidden bosses.

[*] All of the initial companions are great. Believable backgrounds, expressive personalities with their own views and goals.

[*] In-game freedom and possible paths. There are no “invisible walls” known from other games. If you’ve the means to get into tower by air, nothing  will stop you from doing so.

[*] Creativity is rewarded not punished.

[*] Every location, every fight  has “n+1” possible combinations depending on: your build, your companions, how you got to that place, who is your friend or enemy etc.

[*] Exploration is highly recommended – items, additional paths, hidden spells are there to be found.

[*] Every build is viable. You can fight your way through your enemies, bluff, sneak past them or use some magical spells with various results. You decide how you want to play.

[*] You can play as an evil character and it’s not half baked as usual. Compelling and genuinely interesting albeit disturbing story.

[*] Multiple game endings, some of them are obvious while others are more hidden.

[*] Consequences of your decisions reach far and are interdependent.

[*] Achievements connected to the story; are rewards for exploration and challenging yourself.

I had to click on each spell to be able to verify if my wizard already knew it or if I could learn it. Spells should have some marker that would allows us to distinguish whether they are learned or not.

❌[list]

[*] Larian set level cap to lvl 12. Everything is fine, except for the fact that if you explore and “lick every wall”, you will reach it at the beginning of act 3 (as I did; I got it in the refugee camp). Throughout the rest of the act, you'll collect enough XP to level up to at least level 14.... 

[*] In Act 3 you will only explore lower city of Baldur’s Gate.

[*] Pre-made characters (that also can play role of companions) are more polished than those you can get in Act 2 & 3.

[*] Act 2 boss fight seems forced, which really put me off the game for a while. Up to this point everything had multiple possible solutions and suddenly we are forced into unavoidable fight, that also skips many of possible preparations mechanics (ofc if you didn’t decide to do same as game and play unfairly).

[*] Unfortunately, 2 of the achievements are only for playing game on hard or very hard. [/list]",True,4,0
"The game is flagged as 'Supported' on the Steam Deck but it's a blatant lie. If you use the Dock and multiple controllers, you'll be unable to play split screen until you make some changes to the configuration, which is poorly documented and which really ruins the fun, just after you paid 60.- 

Short fix:

SteamDeck=0 %Commannd% --skip-launcher

The fact that it's so easy to fix, but that Larian has not bothered fixing this in a year, really is a mark against the studio. Worse though, is the 'end turn' being bind to Y. Not hold Y to end turn... just one moment of muscle memory can ruin your combat encounter. Thanks for nothing.",False,4,0

"Baldur's Gate 3 is more than just a game to me—it's been a lifeline during one of the darkest periods of my life. Its rich world and incredible storytelling provided a refuge when I needed it most, and even now, on my 10th playthrough, it continues to amaze me with its endless depth and intricate details.

The dynamic characters are what make this game truly extraordinary. Each companion feels so alive, with unique personalities, compelling backstories, and complex motivations that evolve as the story unfolds. I’ve fallen in love with all of them for different reasons, and their interactions remind me of the nuances and shades of gray in real-life relationships.

The writing is simply masterful. The game doesn’t just tell a story—it draws you into a world where your choices genuinely matter. It challenges you to think critically, to see the nuance in every decision, and to empathize with perspectives you might not have considered before.

Even after hundreds of hours, there’s still so much to discover. The level of detail in Baldur's Gate 3 is mind-blowing. From hidden paths and secret dialogues to subtle character moments you might miss the first time around, it’s clear that this game was crafted with love and care by a team who poured their hearts into every pixel.

Baldur's Gate 3 has given me more than entertainment—it’s given me a space to heal, to explore, and to grow. It’s a masterpiece that has set a new standard for RPGs, and I can’t recommend it highly enough to anyone who loves immersive storytelling and unforgettable adventures.",True,3,1
"For a few years, I was not excited at all about gaming and this experience really changed everything for me. Gave me new faith in the industry. Such a touching return to the DnD experience of my youth. Can't believe I got to play a drow gloomstalker and actually crawl the underdark. Incredible voice acting and great story. Bravo.",True,2,0

"This is my FIRST Time playing a game like this, in the first point, I was very confused and didnt understand the game mechanics but now I already have 70+ hours and I LOVE THE GAME!
The story, the graphics, the work put into this game is just amazing!!! 
I wish I tried this game earlier,
and I also love that we can even play with up to 4 friends :3
Everything I search in a game is in this game

"Baldur's Gate 3 is an unequivocal masterpiece that captivates players by seamlessly merging role-playing depth with critical decision-making, all set against a backdrop of compelling storylines and consequential moral choices. This game stands out as a pinnacle of narrative-driven gameplay, where every decision you make carries weight and significance, drawing you deeper into its intricately woven tales.

The game boasts a high level of replayability, thanks to its brilliantly crafted origin characters who are not only deeply beloved but whose fates can dramatically unfold within the game itself—often with fatal consequences. These characters enhance the richness of the experience, making each playthrough uniquely engaging.

The dialogue in Baldur's Gate 3 is both heart-tugging and wrenching, crafted to pull at the player’s emotions and challenge their moral compass. Coupled with skills that are as colourful and explosive as they are effective, the game delivers a sensory feast that is as visually stunning as it is emotionally stirring. The world itself is mesmerising and enchanting, filled with breathtaking vistas and environments that invite exploration and adventure.

Players are bound to fall in love with everything Baldur's Gate 3 offers. At the heart of its allure is the game's focus on choices and consequences. Each decision a player makes feels impactful, fostering a genuine sense of agency that few games achieve. This element of choice ensures that players are not merely passing through a story but actively shaping it, grappling with their conscience and the moral dilemmas that arise from their actions.

Overall, Baldur's Gate 3 is more than just a game; it's a profound interactive experience that resonates on multiple levels. Players are not only entertained but are also invited to reflect on the ramifications of their choices, making it a truly immersive and thought-provoking adventure. Whether you're a seasoned fan of role-playing games or new to the genre, Baldur's Gate 3 is a remarkable journey that is not to be missed.",True,1,1
"an intricate world knitted together with uncanny freedom and grasping narratives inherited from divinity series, but equipped with a more balanced combat system and great cutscenes. though some dnd rules can be galling at times, they don't overshadow this mindblowing experience in any extent. definitely worth to experience",True,1,0
"[h1][i]Generationally[/i] Good.[/h1]

The sheer depth of this experience of a game is absurd; All the characters (down to the easiest to miss) are compelling and feel alive, the world and journey you take is complex and reactive, and the sharp writing sews it all together into a breathing and immersive world with weight behind every choice you make. 

What a treat.",True,1,0
"One of my favorite games of all time. If you've ever been curious about Dungeons and Dragons, and don't have a group, this is a great entry point.

I love how the game lets you play exactly how you want to, with so many classes, races, sub-classes, etc. The amount of different dialogues for your choices is insane, I feel as if you could play this game over 10 times and still experience the game completely differently every single time.

"After a bit over a hundred hours of logged gameplay on my save I've finished my first playthrough.
I've yet to see everything the game has to offer but I did cover most of it, and if there's something to be said about the game is that it is one of the largest, fullest game-worlds I've ever had the pleasure of exploring. Along with that enormousness comes the option to do basically almost anything you'd think to do in any given situation with how the game systems and the story / dialogue options are so fleshed out. A hundred different ways to approach each fight and a dozen dialogue options to prevent that same fight in the first place. This kind of game comes once in a decade if not lifetime and I'm glad to have given it a chance. Larian Studios smashed it out of the park with this one. They deserve all the praise they're getting and more.

With the aim of seeing her friends again, she embarks on a long journey with her students.",True,1,0

"One of the best CRPGs I ever played, though I had to play the majority of it on easy mode since this was my very first DND style RPG. Some of the fights were extremely difficult. I did my first playthrough as a Bard, which was very enjoyable! Normally tough fights like that would make me move on from a game, but the story alone kept me going, and I'm so glad I made it all the way to the end! Looking forward to my 2nd playthrough in the future! Perhaps I'll try as a wizard or something!",True,1,0
"The story spans over three long acts that took me around 45 hours to complete, playing like an obsessive speedrunner.  Act 1 is mostly wilderness and the learning arc which is kinda hard if you are not familiar with dnd genre, Act 2 is the spooky part, and Act 3 is like urban adventuring ig. The game feels slow lots of times, since the first act had me chasing down several different leads to solve the same problem, and Act 2 presents more questions than it answers right up until the final set of confrontations. But discovering exciting new areas, strong side quest writing, and those consistently fun combat encounters meant I never lost motivation. 10/10 would recommend",True,1,1
There's nothing I can say about this game that hasn't already been said much better by others. Larian accomplished something very special with Baldur's Gate 3 - the attention and care they've given the game and the community has secured its legacy for years to come.,True,1,0
"I have played this game for nearly 300 hours and I've never gotten past the beginning of Act 2. I cannot stop making new characters. It's actually a problem lol. Every time I'm faced with a new dialogue I wonder what it would be like in different circumstances. I'm certain I'll never see all of the many different options and details this game has to offer. You could play it over and over again, which is something really unusual for me as someone with ADHD. Highly recommend this game.",True,1,0
"Great game, loving the story and gameplay so far.  My one gripe with the game is the combat.  In normal DND, the DM manages combat and balance, tweaking the campaign to be just the right difficulty.  However, there is no magical DM controlling your game.  Some combat encounters feel impossibly difficult, and feel completely up to chance.  Even on normal difficulty, one bad luck round of combat can lead to your party's quick demise.  On particularly tough encounters, you will most likely have to reload multiple times in order to succeed.  It often feels that you just got lucky that one attempt and was victorious.
Other than these gripes with combat, the game feels great to explore and learn about the world.",True,1,0

"Honestly bought the game because of the hype and had a hard time actually getting into it. My first 10 hours of gameplay just didn't feel that fun. 

A few months later, a friend got the game and ask me to join her. I completely rediscovered the game. What a freaking masterpiece. I study programming in game development and honestly this has breathed into me a new love for the craft. 

The pacing is amazing, the characters, even dead npc who's lore you discover through a random book or piece of equipment are all written with such care and love. The gameplay, while new for me was super fun to learn and figure out. I love that our characters level up but we also learn and get better. In two weeks, I racked up about 100hrs of playtime, while still going to school, working and managing my household. I have my own solo run on top of my multiplayer one and every decision, action and interaction brings something different. Yesterday, we cried while having a moment with Karlach. I adore Gale's story line and it's shocking to me how video game faces can have this many emotions and how the voice acting is so poignant. 

This game has officially reached my unchanging top 5 of best video games ever. This feels like it was a labour of love, dedication and respect for the player and their project. I haven't not felt like a ""customer"" when playing a game in so long and it's incredibly refreshing to be seen as a player and a human who will play their game.

I highly recommend this game. (Try and play with someone for your first few hours because it makes the learning curve less intimidating but maybe that's just me).

This game is hands down amazing, an art piece at that. There is so many different things to do and complete, the only reason to stop playing is burn out.

It's one of those games that leaves you feeling empty after finishing it.

There's no point in listing the pros because they're practically all aspects of the game.

The downside is the quality of the production at the time of release and the state after years of patching. There are still bugs, and they're very basic, like in the UI or problems with completing achievements (I couldn't complete one on a gamepad while playing on PC. I had to switch to the keyboard).

I have several playthrough's going and each one feels completely different because of how impactful minor choices are to the overall story and how it plays out.

If only I had the time I would play through this game with every class, well worth the funds. Also, I'm still waiting patiently for the crossplay that was promised on launch.

"After nine months, I have finally finished my first playthrough of Baldur's Gate 3 and I truly cannot express the feeling of sadness that came as I approached the end. Not because it was a bad ending or anything mind you, but because I really did not want it to be over. 

Baldur's Gate 3 without a shadow of a doubt is one of the greatest games ever made. From start to finish, this game was a flawless experience that I cannot recommend enough, and is the first game since Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2 to remind me what video games are capable of. I could talk for days about this game and the way it made me feel, but most of that has been said before, I think it's best the less you know about it.

I write these reviews more for myself than anything, as I mentioned there's over 600,000 positive reviews on this game as is. Despite this, I still felt the need to express how phenomenal of an experience this was, and I think that's worth something. 

The easiest 10/10 I have ever given, I am still blown away by what I just played.",True,1,0
"""I'm not the type for CRPGs"" & ""i bet it's overrated"" is what kept me from playing since release. I thought i wouldnt touch an RPG until the next TES. I bought it 4 days ago, I'm 26 h in and sowewhere near the end of ACT I and HOLY SHIT! It blew me away, one of the best RPGs and one of the best games I have ever played!",True,1,0
This game is the dream for DnD lovers and anyone who likes a great story with astonishingly good writing.,True,1,0

"Baldur's Gate 3 is an incredible RPG that everyone should try at least once. I've yet to fully finish a single campaign as I have six ongoing, some with friends, but very close to finishing across some. The game absolutely deserves all the awards and recommendations it's received, and is one you'll find yourself able to play again and again and again (especially with the game now having mods and the soon-to-be-included additional subclasses)",True,1,0
There is so much to do in this game that there is no way you could become bored with it. The fact that actions have consequences either immediately or later is great to have in a game. With it being turned based besides being DnD related was what drew me to this game.,True,1,0
"You'll not regret buying this game. 
Story and characters are immersive. 
High replay value/multiple play troughs.
And Larian being passionate in creating this game, and great support as well.
Would recommend Divinity series as well!",True,1,0
"I purchased this game solely because my boyfriend and I were looking for games we could play together, but neither of us were particularly keen on many of the 'couple' orientated video games. I had never played DnD before, and I wasn't keen of CRPG's. But he offered to purchase it for me so I decided to give it a go. 

This game ended up changing my life. I am not kidding. 

First things first, the graphics are amazing. I almost feel like I could reach out and touch the characters. The characters are real in their reactions, and are complex. I love that they will react differently to you depending on how you treat them, and there are consequences if you do not treat them right. I laughed and cried while playing the game. 

BG3 is immensly replayable. I have played 2.5 times so far, and no playthrough was exactly the same. Your choices matter, and the pacing (except for Act 3) flows really well. Each quest and interaction matters in the long run.

As for Larian, they deserve the awards for community support. 

The characters in this game will stay with me for a long time. Whether you are playing alone or with friends, I recommend this game.",True,1,0
