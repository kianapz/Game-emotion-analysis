"One of the most detailed and freedom-giving RPGs I’ve ever played. I created a total of 3 different characters, and each of their adventures was completely unique. Since I didn’t like the outfits in the game, I added various gothic clothing and hair mods. This way, my characters looked amazing and I could roleplay exactly as I wanted. I also really enjoyed the combat system based on DnD rules, as it gave a sense of being strategic and creative. The game's story is very captivating, its fantastical world, and music are perfect. BG3 is a fantastic game that I will play again and again.

"I don't know how they pulled it off. After seeing Baldur's Gate III listed as Early Access many years ago I thought to myself ""Good luck, there's no way this lives up to the older Baldur's Gate games"" as those games were a huge part of my teenage years and turned me on to DnD in general. I kept hearing great things about the Early Access game from friends that never played the originals but I still held out until it was fully released. I have never been happier to eat my words. Not only does this game FEEL like a Baldur's Gate game, it's the best of all of them. The amount of freedom in this game makes me feel EXACTLY like I felt while playing the older two games. I constantly think to myself while playing, ""They thought of everything!"" This is completely worthy of the Baldur's Gate name and worth every penny at full price. Bravo!",True,60,1
"I started playing this game a year and a few months after it was launched and immediately got into character creation which took me over an hour not to mention building my Dream Guardian. Since purchasing it at full price, I was weary to buy a game for 60 bucks, but it has been the best 60 bucks I've spent in a LONG time. 

The whole game itself doesn't hold your hand during the game, but it does help you build up your skills and learn how to play as you go which is great for those who haven't played CRPG turn based game before. I have basically played this nonstop since October to pass time and as you can see with my 527 hours on record, I absolutely LOVE this game. The options for responses and endings are endless. I'm thoroughly blown away with the voice acting and, yes, the mod options. There are many people who hate playing with mods, but to me it adds a lot to the game and enhances my game play experience making me want to play it more. I have done numerous campaigns and as of January 2025, I'm doing my 2nd durge campaign trying to play a somewhat evil character which is hard as I've cried from being evil to pixels haha. 

Overall, I think this game may be the best game I've ever played and I love how Larian and the VA's show their active participation in the community along with Larian giving us FREE updates and gives modders the toolkit. This company could've charged $100 or more for this game with the amount of work and thought put into it along with the (again) FREE updates, but they didn't. They have shown they care more for the player's experience and making a game that out beats other new games and certain *ahem developers AHEM Bethesda* by giving us a game that is completed at release (from what I've been told by other gamers who played this at release). I recommend this game to anyone who wants a rich, fulfilling game that doesn't have any extra catches outside the initial price.",True,34,1
"This is probably going to be one of the best games for the next decade, the voice acting is sublime and the writers seemed to have made deals with the devil in order to make such a good tale. 10/10",True,46,4
"I have played this game for 6 hours (2h on character creator), never played this type of game before.. can say I am impressed and enjoying it a lot.

18 hours in the game: I think that I'm addicted. The stories are surprising and wholesome. I feel like a hero in this game, living for the good of the people.

50 hours: I finally finished act 1. And oh boy did I turn from good to evil with every step I took. I didn't mean to be... How was I supposed to know that pulling the wrong lever, I'll be catapulting a gnome to space. That wasn't my fault.

80 hours: Yes! Give me your gold. All the shiny trinkets you have. Give me your soul and all the power you hold. Give me more... MORE!

100 hours: How dare you look down on me, thinking like you could ever defeat me?! Hit me with all you got, it will never be enough!

120 hours: ... *only screams echo in the darkness* ...

130 hours: *Muahahaha-*
You may call me the blood queen,
but your agenda is also driven by greed.
The battle you lost, your advisors lied.
Your heroes are dead, your city is mine.
No evil as dark or vengeance as red,
have never been seen as I took the kings head.",True,20,12
"At first, I was hesitant to buy this game because of its price, but after playing it twice for a total of 260 hours, I still want to come back for a third playthrough, I can confidently say it’s worth every penny and more.

[h3]The customization:[/h3]
The game offers a wide selection for customization, allowing you to choose your race, background, and class, with the option to multiclass. You can even customize your voice, body type and your wiener. Dialogues are influenced by your origin, race, and class. Wizards and sorcerers can make fun of each other, drows can intimidate others, and companions might banter with you about whose god is the better one.

If you don’t want to create your own character, you can play as one of the 7 Origin characters. I recommend creating your own character or trying ""The Dark Urge"". He is unique as he is the only Origin character who doesn’t appear in the story, offering a unique playthrough you won’t experience on a normal playthrough.

The animations and facial expressions are impressive as well, they bring life to both human and non-human races. Even characters like dragonborns have expressive facial expressions.

[h3]Companions:[/h3]
The game features a huge cast of companions (10), each with their own distinct personalities and backstories. Over time, these companions evolve from strangers in your party to allies, friends, or romantic interests. Companions dynamically react to your choices and to each other, leading to surprising dialogues and conflicts. Bringing specific companions to encounters can change how they unfold, and you can influence their fate—helping them stay on their path or stray away from it. The voice acting is also phenomenal. Romances also features options for polymorphic or same-sex relationships, (so no one missies out on Shadowheart or Halsin).

Spoiler Alert: If you don’t want to miss an easily missable companion:[spoiler]When you meet a drow named Minthara, and if you get into a fight, switch to non-lethal combat and knock her out instead of killing her.[/spoiler]

[h3]Open World and Exploration:[/h3]
The game does an amazing job with its story, covering a wide range of topics, with its central themes being trauma, trust, and personal growth. There are three acts, each offering many beautiful and memorable locations to explore. Its open-world design lets you roam freely, and NPCs dynamically react to your actions. 

The world feels alive, with consequences for your actions. After 200+ hours, I’m still finding hidden dialogues and secret details that surprise me, making me appreciate the developers’ attention to detail.

[h3]Gameplay and Mechanics:[/h3]
The game offers many difficulty options, from ""Explorer"" for those who just want to enjoy the story to ""Tactician"" for the min-maxers. You can also play the game solo or in co-op, giving you the opportunity to experience the story with your friends.

Combat is highly creative, with spells and abilities that interact with the environment. For example, you can set up explosive barrels before an ambush or use water to create electrified surfaces. Players can tackle obstacles in numerous ways—combat, stealth, magic, or conversation. This variety ensures you can tailor the story to your own playstyle.

[h3]Flaws:[/h3] 
[list]
[*]As with many open-world games, bugs can arise due to its complex and detailed structure. For example, after killing a character, NPCs might still refer to them as alive. In one instance, I exposed a thief disguised as a guard, only to have him arrest me for stealing. 
[*]The ""non-lethal combat"" system, while great for roleplay purposes, doesn’t change much regarding the story. Knocked-out characters are treated as dead in most cases, with only a few exceptions.
[*]Lastly, the game struggles to provide a meaningful ""evil"" playthrough. While you can roleplay as morally grey or chaotic, the ""evil with purpose"" path is underdeveloped. Choosing the evil route frequently locks you out of story content, companions, and loot, making it less rewarding compared to good or morally ambiguous paths.
[/list]

[h3]Modding:[/h3]
The game supports modding through its official tools. You can download mods for quality-of-life improvements, like new hairstyles or face shapes, to more substantial additions such as new classes or playable races. For those who enjoy customizing further, mods like the ""handsome Lae'zel"" option let you adjust her appearance (though Bae'zel is already pretty stunning as she is!).

[h3]Overall:[/h3]
Baldur's Gate 3 is a masterpiece that combines rich storytelling, deep customization, and endless possibilities for creativity. Whether you like D&D or completely new to the genre, this game offers an unforgettable RPG experience that will keep you coming back for more.",True,10,0
"Look, there are a lot of reviews about this game, and I don't think I can add some interesting new views to that,

Instead, I'll just share that I have over 476 hours played in the game on GoG. I like the game so much I paid for it again on steam, full price, because I felt like supporting the developers some more. You might really, _really_ enjoy this one. :-D",True,25,0
"Okay, let's be clear: I'm a button-mashing, adrenaline-fueled action RPG kind of gamer. Give me fast-paced combat, flashy spells, and a story that unfolds at breakneck speed. Turn-based strategy? That's for... other people.  I only bought Baldur's Gate 3 because of the hype; I figured I'd check it out, maybe play for an hour, and then move on.  I was spectacularly wrong.
 
This game somehow managed to grab my attention and refuse to let go. The story is surprisingly engaging, full of unexpected twists and turns. The characters are well-written, the dialogue sharp and witty, and the sheer number of choices available is overwhelming in the best possible way.
 
The combat, initially a confusing mess of dice rolls and ability checks, slowly transformed into a deeply satisfying strategic challenge. The feeling of outmaneuvering a tough enemy with a perfectly planned sequence of actions is incredibly rewarding, even for someone who usually prefers to just hack and slash their way through a game.
 
The sheer amount of content is staggering. Seriously, the replayability alone makes this game worth the price of admission. There's so much to explore, so many different paths to take, and so many ways to play.  I went in expecting a quick playthrough, and instead, I found myself completely lost in a rich and rewarding world.
 
Highly recommended – even if you're an action RPG purist like me, and even if you only bought it because of the hype. You might just surprise yourself.",True,14,0
"The replayability of this game is insane, Larian did an amazing job giving us exactly what we wanted and maybe even a little more. This game has taken over my life and I love it so much, lol, and showing no signs of putting it down any time soon!",True,26,0
"This is a very enthralling game, not without flaws of course.  I encountered many bugs during my playthrough that required me to reload a previous save.  I also find the last part of the game to feel very underdeveloped compared to the first two acts.  Despite that, it's one of those games that as soon as I finished I wanted to immediately play again and see how my choices would change things in its vast world.  One of those RPG's that I will come back to, many, many times.",True,4,0
"Is it epic RPG – without a doubt. Is it game that will be mentioned in 10-15 years line and put in the same league as the original Planescape Torment or Fallout 1 – without a doubt. Is it perfect game – well… no, it isn’t and has its problems.

✅[list]
[*] Multitude of options in character creation and fine-tuning chosen class.

[*] Game looks great and despite the fact that Larian was using their usual engine, they’ve managed to keep the essence of D&D world and its original look.

[*] Epic soundtrack and great sound effects.

[*] Massive maps full of POI, secrets, hidden bosses.

[*] All of the initial companions are great. Believable backgrounds, expressive personalities with their own views and goals.

[*] In-game freedom and possible paths. There are no “invisible walls” known from other games. If you’ve the means to get into tower by air, nothing  will stop you from doing so.

[*] Creativity is rewarded not punished.

[*] Every location, every fight  has “n+1” possible combinations depending on: your build, your companions, how you got to that place, who is your friend or enemy etc.

[*] Exploration is highly recommended – items, additional paths, hidden spells are there to be found.

[*] Every build is viable. You can fight your way through your enemies, bluff, sneak past them or use some magical spells with various results. You decide how you want to play.

[*] You can play as an evil character and it’s not half baked as usual. Compelling and genuinely interesting albeit disturbing story.

[*] Multiple game endings, some of them are obvious while others are more hidden.

[*] Consequences of your decisions reach far and are interdependent.

[*] Achievements connected to the story; are rewards for exploration and challenging yourself.

😐
I had to click on each spell to be able to verify if my wizard already knew it or if I could learn it. Spells should have some marker that would allows us to distinguish whether they are learned or not.

❌[list]

[*] Larian set level cap to lvl 12. Everything is fine, except for the fact that if you explore and “lick every wall”, you will reach it at the beginning of act 3 (as I did; I got it in the refugee camp). Throughout the rest of the act, you'll collect enough XP to level up to at least level 14.... 

[*] In Act 3 you will only explore lower city of Baldur’s Gate.

[*] Pre-made characters (that also can play role of companions) are more polished than those you can get in Act 2 & 3.

[*] Act 2 boss fight seems forced, which really put me off the game for a while. Up to this point everything had multiple possible solutions and suddenly we are forced into unavoidable fight, that also skips many of possible preparations mechanics (ofc if you didn’t decide to do same as game and play unfairly).

[*] Unfortunately, 2 of the achievements are only for playing game on hard or very hard. [/list]",True,4,0
"The game is flagged as 'Supported' on the Steam Deck but it's a blatant lie. If you use the Dock and multiple controllers, you'll be unable to play split screen until you make some changes to the configuration, which is poorly documented and which really ruins the fun, just after you paid 60.- 

Short fix:

SteamDeck=0 %Commannd% --skip-launcher

The fact that it's so easy to fix, but that Larian has not bothered fixing this in a year, really is a mark against the studio. Worse though, is the 'end turn' being bind to Y. Not hold Y to end turn... just one moment of muscle memory can ruin your combat encounter. Thanks for nothing.",False,4,0

"Baldur's Gate 3 is more than just a game to me—it's been a lifeline during one of the darkest periods of my life. Its rich world and incredible storytelling provided a refuge when I needed it most, and even now, on my 10th playthrough, it continues to amaze me with its endless depth and intricate details.

The dynamic characters are what make this game truly extraordinary. Each companion feels so alive, with unique personalities, compelling backstories, and complex motivations that evolve as the story unfolds. I’ve fallen in love with all of them for different reasons, and their interactions remind me of the nuances and shades of gray in real-life relationships.

The writing is simply masterful. The game doesn’t just tell a story—it draws you into a world where your choices genuinely matter. It challenges you to think critically, to see the nuance in every decision, and to empathize with perspectives you might not have considered before.

Even after hundreds of hours, there’s still so much to discover. The level of detail in Baldur's Gate 3 is mind-blowing. From hidden paths and secret dialogues to subtle character moments you might miss the first time around, it’s clear that this game was crafted with love and care by a team who poured their hearts into every pixel.

Baldur's Gate 3 has given me more than entertainment—it’s given me a space to heal, to explore, and to grow. It’s a masterpiece that has set a new standard for RPGs, and I can’t recommend it highly enough to anyone who loves immersive storytelling and unforgettable adventures.",True,3,1
"For a few years, I was not excited at all about gaming and this experience really changed everything for me. Gave me new faith in the industry. Such a touching return to the DnD experience of my youth. Can't believe I got to play a drow gloomstalker and actually crawl the underdark. Incredible voice acting and great story. Bravo.",True,2,0
"Understand there is a lot of effort put into this game in terms of production values but it's not a game that can be recommended to most people as being a fun game. 

There are few things that it does very well (eg. voice acting, most of the animation) but so many that are a step back from similar games released in the past such as  Divinity: Original Sin games (eg: boring gameplay in general, luck based combat, uneven tone of the story etc.) 

However, it is a great game if all you care about is to play a computerised version of D&D 5e rules. And if you love the CRPG genre then you might like it if you go in with low expectations.",False,4,0

I wish I tried this game earlier,
and I also love that we can even play with up to 4 friends :3

"Baldur's Gate 3 is an unequivocal masterpiece that captivates players by seamlessly merging role-playing depth with critical decision-making, all set against a backdrop of compelling storylines and consequential moral choices. This game stands out as a pinnacle of narrative-driven gameplay, where every decision you make carries weight and significance, drawing you deeper into its intricately woven tales.

The game boasts a high level of replayability, thanks to its brilliantly crafted origin characters who are not only deeply beloved but whose fates can dramatically unfold within the game itself—often with fatal consequences. These characters enhance the richness of the experience, making each playthrough uniquely engaging.

The dialogue in Baldur's Gate 3 is both heart-tugging and wrenching, crafted to pull at the player’s emotions and challenge their moral compass. Coupled with skills that are as colourful and explosive as they are effective, the game delivers a sensory feast that is as visually stunning as it is emotionally stirring. The world itself is mesmerising and enchanting, filled with breathtaking vistas and environments that invite exploration and adventure.

Players are bound to fall in love with everything Baldur's Gate 3 offers. At the heart of its allure is the game's focus on choices and consequences. Each decision a player makes feels impactful, fostering a genuine sense of agency that few games achieve. This element of choice ensures that players are not merely passing through a story but actively shaping it, grappling with their conscience and the moral dilemmas that arise from their actions.

Overall, Baldur's Gate 3 is more than just a game; it's a profound interactive experience that resonates on multiple levels. Players are not only entertained but are also invited to reflect on the ramifications of their choices, making it a truly immersive and thought-provoking adventure. Whether you're a seasoned fan of role-playing games or new to the genre, Baldur's Gate 3 is a remarkable journey that is not to be missed.",True,1,1

"[h1][i]Generationally[/i] Good.[/h1]

The sheer depth of this experience of a game is absurd; All the characters (down to the easiest to miss) are compelling and feel alive, the world and journey you take is complex and reactive, and the sharp writing sews it all together into a breathing and immersive world with weight behind every choice you make.

"After a bit over a hundred hours of logged gameplay on my save I've finished my first playthrough.
I've yet to see everything the game has to offer but I did cover most of it, and if there's something to be said about the game is that it is one of the largest, fullest game-worlds I've ever had the pleasure of exploring. Along with that enormousness comes the option to do basically almost anything you'd think to do in any given situation with how the game systems and the story / dialogue options are so fleshed out. A hundred different ways to approach each fight and a dozen dialogue options to prevent that same fight in the first place. This kind of game comes once in a decade if not lifetime and I'm glad to have given it a chance. Larian Studios smashed it out of the park with this one. They deserve all the praise they're getting and more.

"One of the best CRPGs I ever played, though I had to play the majority of it on easy mode since this was my very first DND style RPG. Some of the fights were extremely difficult. I did my first playthrough as a Bard, which was very enjoyable!

Looking forward to my 2nd playthrough in the future! Perhaps I'll try as a wizard or something!",True,1,0
"The story spans over three long acts that took me around 45 hours to complete, playing like an obsessive speedrunner.  Act 1 is mostly wilderness and the learning arc which is kinda hard if you are not familiar with dnd genre, Act 2 is the spooky part, and Act 3 is like urban adventuring ig. The game feels slow lots of times, since the first act had me chasing down several different leads to solve the same problem, and Act 2 presents more questions than it answers right up until the final set of confrontations. But discovering exciting new areas, strong side quest writing, and those consistently fun combat encounters meant I never lost motivation. 10/10 would recommend",True,1,1

"I have played this game for nearly 300 hours and I've never gotten past the beginning of Act 2. I cannot stop making new characters. It's actually a problem lol. Every time I'm faced with a new dialogue I wonder what it would be like in different circumstances. I'm certain I'll never see all of the many different options and details this game has to offer. You could play it over and over again, which is something really unusual for me as someone with ADHD. Highly recommend this game.",True,1,0
"Great game, loving the story and gameplay so far.  My one gripe with the game is the combat.  In normal DND, the DM manages combat and balance, tweaking the campaign to be just the right difficulty.  However, there is no magical DM controlling your game.  Some combat encounters feel impossibly difficult, and feel completely up to chance.  Even on normal difficulty, one bad luck round of combat can lead to your party's quick demise.  On particularly tough encounters, you will most likely have to reload multiple times in order to succeed.  It often feels that you just got lucky that one attempt and was victorious.
Other than these gripes with combat, the game feels great to explore and learn about the world.",True,1,0

"Honestly bought the game because of the hype and had a hard time actually getting into it. My first 10 hours of gameplay just didn't feel that fun. 

A few months later, a friend got the game and ask me to join her. I completely rediscovered the game. What a freaking masterpiece. I study programming in game development and honestly this has breathed into me a new love for the craft. 

The pacing is amazing, the characters, even dead npc who's lore you discover through a random book or piece of equipment are all written with such care and love. The gameplay, while new for me was super fun to learn and figure out. I love that our characters level up but we also learn and get better. In two weeks, I racked up about 100hrs of playtime, while still going to school, working and managing my household. I have my own solo run on top of my multiplayer one and every decision, action and interaction brings something different. Yesterday, we cried while having a moment with Karlach. I adore Gale's story line and it's shocking to me how video game faces can have this many emotions and how the voice acting is so poignant. 

This game has officially reached my unchanging top 5 of best video games ever. This feels like it was a labour of love, dedication and respect for the player and their project. I haven't not felt like a ""customer"" when playing a game in so long and it's incredibly refreshing to be seen as a player and a human who will play their game.

I highly recommend this game. (Try and play with someone for your first few hours because it makes the learning curve less intimidating but maybe that's just me).

This game is hands down amazing, an art piece at that. There is so many different things to do and complete, the only reason to stop playing is burn out.

It's one of those games that leaves you feeling empty after finishing it.

There's no point in listing the pros because they're practically all aspects of the game.

The downside is the quality of the production at the time of release and the state after years of patching. There are still bugs, and they're very basic, like in the UI or problems with completing achievements (I couldn't complete one on a gamepad while playing on PC. I had to switch to the keyboard).

I have several playthrough's going and each one feels completely different because of how impactful minor choices are to the overall story and how it plays out.

"After nine months, I have finally finished my first playthrough of Baldur's Gate 3 and I truly cannot express the feeling of sadness that came as I approached the end. Not because it was a bad ending or anything mind you, but because I really did not want it to be over. 

Baldur's Gate 3 without a shadow of a doubt is one of the greatest games ever made. From start to finish, this game was a flawless experience that I cannot recommend enough, and is the first game since Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2 to remind me what video games are capable of. I could talk for days about this game and the way it made me feel, but most of that has been said before, I think it's best the less you know about it.

I write these reviews more for myself than anything, as I mentioned there's over 600,000 positive reviews on this game as is. Despite this, I still felt the need to express how phenomenal of an experience this was, and I think that's worth something. 

The easiest 10/10 I have ever given, I am still blown away by what I just played.",True,1,0
"""I'm not the type for CRPGs"" & ""i bet it's overrated"" is what kept me from playing since release. I thought i wouldnt touch an RPG until the next TES. I bought it 4 days ago, I'm 26 h in and sowewhere near the end of ACT I and HOLY SHIT! It blew me away, one of the best RPGs and one of the best games I have ever played!",True,1,0
This game is the dream for DnD lovers and anyone who likes a great story with astonishingly good writing.,True,1,0

"Baldur's Gate 3 is an incredible RPG that everyone should try at least once. I've yet to fully finish a single campaign as I have six ongoing, some with friends, but very close to finishing across some. The game absolutely deserves all the awards and recommendations it's received, and is one you'll find yourself able to play again and again and again (especially with the game now having mods and the soon-to-be-included additional subclasses)",True,1,0
There is so much to do in this game that there is no way you could become bored with it. The fact that actions have consequences either immediately or later is great to have in a game. With it being turned based besides being DnD related was what drew me to this game.,True,1,0
"You'll not regret buying this game. 
Story and characters are immersive. 
High replay value/multiple play troughs.
And Larian being passionate in creating this game, and great support as well.
Would recommend Divinity series as well!",True,1,0
"I purchased this game solely because my boyfriend and I were looking for games we could play together, but neither of us were particularly keen on many of the 'couple' orientated video games. I had never played DnD before, and I wasn't keen of CRPG's. But he offered to purchase it for me so I decided to give it a go. 

This game ended up changing my life. I am not kidding. 

First things first, the graphics are amazing. I almost feel like I could reach out and touch the characters. The characters are real in their reactions, and are complex. I love that they will react differently to you depending on how you treat them, and there are consequences if you do not treat them right. I laughed and cried while playing the game. 

BG3 is immensly replayable. I have played 2.5 times so far, and no playthrough was exactly the same. Your choices matter, and the pacing (except for Act 3) flows really well. Each quest and interaction matters in the long run.

As for Larian, they deserve the awards for community support. 

The characters in this game will stay with me for a long time. Whether you are playing alone or with friends, I recommend this game.",True,1,0
"My personal indicators of a worthy game are emotional.
THIS GAME EVOKED A LOT OF EMOTIONS.
I felt joy (genuinely at the end), and I got furious (to the point of nervous squealing), and I felt the spirit of battle within me—shouting battle cries and thinking long and hard about the best course of action. I worried and suffered—basically, the full range of emotions (which is more than enough for a turn-based RPG).

THE GAME IMMERSES YOU SMOOTHLY AND GRADUALLY. It’s quite difficult to achieve this at the beginning, but if the gameplay clicks with you, you’ll get so immersed that you won’t be able to stop. Personally, I speedran it in 8 days after my second attempt.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO THOSE WHO CAN’T AFFORD TO SPEND 5+ HOURS A DAY (the number is approximate, give or take an hour) FOR FULL IMMERSION.

I THINK THIS IS THE BEST GAME, THE BEST STORY, THE BEST ADVENTURE IN MY ENTIRE GAMING EXPERIENCE.

I definitely recommend it to people who love experiencing emotions that you can’t feel in real life.
DIALOGUES ARE A MASTERPIECE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT.
Every conversation, every choice, every line—it’s like you’re writing the story yourself. You can be a hero, a scoundrel, a joker, or even a complete psycho—the game has your back. And yes, there’s romance that will make your heart race (or, on the contrary, make you laugh until you cry if you choose the wrong words).

CINEMATIC QUALITY AT ITS FINEST.
Every scene, every dialogue, every battle—it’s like a mini-movie. The camera work, the music, the characters’ emotions—everything is so meticulously crafted that you forget you’re playing a game. You’re not just playing—you’re living in this world.",True,1,0
"First of all, the story, chef's kiss. I have played about 6 campaigns and I still find small things that I haven't discovered before. There's so much to do, there's so much to see. The game is brimming with content, and looks absolutely stunning. I would highly recommend this game, it's a masterpiece. <3",True,1,0
"Playing Baldur's Gate since BG1, big fans of the gaming system and I'm still enjoy of my  4th playthrough",True,1,0
Wanna murder your followers and spread xenophobia; this is your game. Do you wanna smash the heads of those xenophobic losers wanting to execute a tiefling child; this is your game. Do you wanna sleep your way to end of your game as the Baldur's Gate's biggest slot; this is your game.,True,1,1
10/10 best game I've ever played and will play for the forseeable future. Don't think any RPG can tie together a story and let you do this much. A true labor of love.,True,1,0
"This is by far the best turn-based RPG I have ever played. This game is highly replayable, with multiple story endings that keep things fresh. Without a doubt, the money I spent on this game was worth every penny. The characters and storytelling are top-tier, setting a new standard in the market. On top of that, the graphics and music are exceptional, creating a truly immersive experience. I only wish there were more games like this available. Unfortunately, I don't think you'll find a better one at the moment. If you get the chance, I highly recommend buying this game, especially during sales.",True,1,0
This game is so great! The visuals are stunning and the characters are so unique. The combat is intuitive and the quests are fun.,True,1,0
"A pretty good continuation of the Baldur's Gate series. Very close to the originals in concept, just updated graphics. all-in-all, a solid game.",True,1,0
"Play this game normally and enjoy the rich story. Then play it again but push all the boundaries and try to break everything (it's great fun). Once you've figured out what makes it tick, play it again on honor mode. This is the way.",True,1,0
"Closest game to D&D 5e, with some mechanics that are gamified and can be a bit annoying at times, but overall it offers a good gameplay experience. The story is engaging, and you can easily enjoy multiple different playthroughs. Sleep is important for story progression. Be aware, however, of some bugs in Act 3 that are still present, which may require you to reload.",True,1,0
"the first 2 hours, I want to refund this game. too difficult. 
after 5 hours, I've learn the game mechanics, it's really fun.",True,1,0
"Don't be fooled by my in game hours - I have over 500 hours on it on my PS5. 

Literally the best game. I cannot stress this enough. Hiiiighly recommend. Bought it on Steam so I can force my friends to play with me, to watch me fuck the bear (Tho, we need an option to fuck Kar'niss, but I digress) 

The only issue I have with it is the body types. I just wanna be a petite lil guy without the titties, mods don't have my back on it quite yet. One day, hopefully o7",True,1,0
"Got the game for the pretty vampire, stayed (and cried) for the characters' stories. 10/10 game, for sure.",True,1,0
"Engaging game with great story, voice acting and near endless build possibilities for your characters.
Highly recommend, would BG3 again",True,1,0
"One of my favourite games ever made. All the choices you make have an impact on the story, endings and characters. You can play as your own character, or one of the origin characters. There are tons of romance options. The environment and music is beautiful. Character customisation is great (although the heads are presets). All the classes are very fun too. 

Lots of things to do in this game, one playthrough of 100% (all quests, treasures etc) took me 120 hours, but the game has replayability and I have played it 5 times. The other characters have different stories so therefore they behave differently with the quests, environments and storylines. It has both good and bad moments, if you laugh like crazy or cry your eyes out within the span of 30 minutes while playing this game I would not be surprised. Amazing game.

The game is semi-open world, so you have 3 different acts which are different zones basically, you can not go back but the game will warn you so you don't have to worry about missing out on content.",True,1,0
"this game is so good i put 200+ hours into a pirated copy, bought the full game, then put in another 200 hours (and counting)",True,1,0
"Im addicted and need an intervention but everyone I talk to the game about is either in the same state as me or I drag into playing with me D:

11/10 but really addictive and I always find something new, once you are done with a vanilla play through totally play with mods",True,1,0
"within act one, i was able to fulfill my fantasy of bein' a sharpshooting, dual-crossbow-wielding, smooth-talking Drow cowgirl, enhanced by the arcane symphonies of the lute strapped to my chest. and!! i got to throw a dead squirrel at a racist, loathsome, pencil-nosed lizard lady!! 

10/10. my '23 GOTY. (੭*ˊᵕˋ)੭* ੈ♡‧₊˚",True,1,0
"If you plan on getting this game do not, i repeat, DO NOT mod it through the official mod manager. The mods stick PERMANENTLY and even if you delete the folders, game, and everything, they will just redownload themselves.
That being said, do you like D&D? Do you crave a game that is packed full of content? Then this game is for you. The gameplay is fun, the story is so good you will want multiple replays of it, the absolute freedom this game gives to the player is unparalleled by anything i've seen so far. There is a very good reason it got the game of the year award when it came out.",True,1,0

"An Absolute Masterpiece – A+++

Baldur’s Gate 3 is not just a game; it’s an experience that redefines what RPGs can achieve. From the moment you start, it grabs you with its rich storytelling, complex characters, and breathtaking world.

Story & Writing: Every dialogue feels meaningful, and the choices you make ripple throughout the story in profound ways. The branching paths ensure no two playthroughs are alike.

Characters: The companions are some of the best-written and most memorable in gaming history. You’ll laugh, cry, and argue with them as if they were real people.

Gameplay: The turn-based combat is deep, strategic, and incredibly rewarding. Whether you’re a seasoned D&D fan or a newcomer, you’ll find the mechanics easy to learn and endlessly enjoyable to master.

Visuals & World-Building: The game’s environments are nothing short of stunning, from dark dungeons to sunlit forests. Every corner feels alive and brimming with detail.

Music & Sound Design: The score is phenomenal, and the voice acting is absolutely top-notch. It brings the world to life in a way that few games manage.

Verdict: Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t just the best RPG I’ve played in years—it’s a landmark in gaming history. Whether you’re here for the story, the combat, or just exploring a beautifully crafted world, this game delivers on every front.

There is nothing to complain about. As close to a 10/10 as you can get with modern gaming.,True,1,0
Wyll's and Karlach's actors may be worst in the history of acting. Great game besides these two clowns.,True,1,0
I won't pretend this game is a masterpiece for me like it is for many (mostly because the combat doesn't mesh well with my brain) but god this game has SO MUCH you can do and you tell how much heart and soul went into it.,True,3,1
"The greatest game of all time, I waited a bit to write a review because I know my hours are gonna keep skyrocketing. I bought it originally on Xbox and had to get it on PC for more mods and the graphic upgrade. There are so many different things I've experienced in this game that no game has offered me, the music from the first time I started the game was iconic. I felt like I had heard Down By The River a million times the first time I heard it. Perfect atmosphere to start the game. So many great scenes with well made, sung, and timed songs. 
No game has ever offered the level of immersion this game gives between dialogue specific to your race, class, affiliation. When and if you've interacted with a character who seemed so minor could come back into play 12 hours later. Larian really outdid themselves in every regard with this game. The game is about to be releasing its final update so its about to be in its complete state, so new fans won't be aware of the love Larian put into this game from EA to the final update. Rewriting the least popular character, adding a new follower, giving us more endings that didn't need to exist for the game to be an all timer but do because in this game they should.
You can really feel the blood, sweat, and tears put into this game. It's a game for gamers. And in the age of companies discussing charging you for ""how many hours you played their game"" it's refreshing to see a company that isn't that way. My only wish is that we get a BG4, or some form of DLC(I read no more updates, that doesn't mean we cant get some DLC lmao).
Regardless I'm more than glad I played Baldur's Gate 3 and I cannot recommend it enough. And if you can't get enough content the Main 6 VA's have done playthroughs of the game and DnD sessions on YouTube.",True,1,0
very awsome game. very addictive. i don't like turn based game but this game made me fall in love with it,True,1,0
"I don't usually like single player games, especially extremely long ones, but this is probably the BEST game I've ever played. The story is amazing and it is very fun to play, and is very customisable too!
It is very time consuming, though. You need at least an hour or two each session to really get through it. 
I've been recommending this game to everyone since I started. I'm almost finished with it now, but will probably do a few more play-throughs of it in the future. 
I got this on sale, but after playing I'd even recommend buying it full price.",True,3,0
"Some of my favorite games are Skyrim (all) and Fallout (all) and I often go back to those. BG3 has a richer relationships and interactions, which I'm a huge fan of. I fell in love with BG3 and keep playing it over and over. Best characters ever! I wish they could or would release DLC to make it even more in-depth. But they did a wonderful job. The voice acting is incredible and characters are exactly what I've wanted from a game.",True,1,0
"Larian did the series justice.  

As a fan of the old games, I was pleasantly surprised by how much consideration it pays the series. I had thought I had been spoiled on most everything, but there was still far more in there. The game is worthy of all flowers its received.",True,4,1
"bought this at full price because some doucher chinese american sexpat with a napoleon complex who lives in japan said it would ""make me better at DND"". I tried refunding it initially, but gave in because I was pestered enough to play it.

that said, it was fun. played it twice. I tend to like sim elements in games and I did a whole-ass evil playthrough stealing and killing whatever I wanted to. good communism simulator. 10/10.",True,1,0
"An outstanding game, very well-written and very reactive - full of consequences.

There are, perhaps, better-written RPGs (like Planescape: Torment, Arcanum, Fallout New Vegas, or even Baldur's Gate 2 - I can see a pattern here; and being just a notch below the best-written games ever made is meant as high praise). 
But the writing is constantly very, very good, and the overall structure of the story delivers satisfying reactions to the many action a player can effect on the game world. In terms of size, we've never had a story this good, this large, and this reactive - ever.

Whenever the game fought me on a choice, I felt like it was perfectly natural, and, in the end, the story wrapped up so well I simply didn't feel the need to reload and make different choices just before the end. It felt proper - and very satisfying.

Because I wanted everything to be done Right, I found it very stressful to play the game not knowing what the consequences of my actions will be. So, I watched two streams play the game before I was ... able to. And still, I re-did the first act 3 times, and the second act twice, with a full game time precisely double my save time (159 hours in the save, 320 hours in the game). So, if you're like me ... either watch the game played first, or play with a friend. This is the only 'negative' I can say about the game.

The game had been a bit rough at launch (nowhere near as buggy as BG2 at launch, but hey); by now it's all fixed up, optimised, and smooth-going. The developer has been amazing post-launch, as well. Instead of releasing paid DLCs or content packs, they've kept adding huge chunks of fully-integrated content, in normal patches. Like: fleshing out the endings, adding a very reactive prologue, and adding more customisation options, as requested by players.

So: outstanding experience, and a must-play.",True,1,0

"There are good games and great games, and then there are games that change the gaming industry entirely, and raise the bar to another level. Baldur’s Gate III is that rare case that charts its own route, building on the best of what came before it and breaking new ground. With how responsive the game is to the specifics of your created character, it could be explored virtually forever with endless new stuff to discover tucked into millions of little corners. The world is intricate and wonderous enough to want to live in it, and the characters are so intriguing that you cherish every conversation and want to save them all, from themselves (and good luck doing that!). It’s an explosion of the imagination so powerful that it’s unthinkable that Larian was able to fit it all into one game, but they did. So, gather your party and venture forth!",True,1,0
"It's BG3... amazing characters and romances, fun gameplay and combat, absolutely gorgeous, interesting plotpoints, tons of freedom, and just an absurd amount of content. It has its flaws but at the day, there's a reason it swept the awards and maintains such a huge and dedicated fanbase.",True,1,0

It has so many places you can explore and on my second play through I managed to find other places I had not come across the first time. I fell in love with all of the characters, Their strengths and weaknesses and how they desire power or commit atrocities or maybe just their complete goodness. This game can be easy with mods, but I know it can be a huge challenge if you play a higher difficulty and fail to plan properly. I loved the access I had to mods and the customization i was given, even on vanilla I could appreciate the limitless customization options I was given for my character. This game takes a lot of strategy and some brains if you're playing on hard because you have to really use the classes each to their own advantage. It's a great game. Try it.

The discord community that exists for the game is incredible, so if your new, go check that out for information and help or for other players to quest with. Play solo or with a party.

"Its BG3, everyone have already said how great it is and it does deserve its hype but I do wanna bring forth a few things to keep in mind, this is a bit nitpicky cause the game is otherwise so enjoyable there's little to complain about. 

Act 3 is unpolished and at times feels unfinished, understandable for such an ambitious game by a studio that had never done a game of this scale, but it left some of the conclusions to some character arcs feel... unfinished, and parts of the ending a bit rushed. Still love it, but the fall in Act 3 stops it from being a 10/10 to me. 

Otherwise it lives up to the hype and is a very strong 9/10 with great story, characters, gameplay and graphics.",True,0,0

"If you like DnD and would like to play a solo campaign, baldur's gate 3 is the game for you. Romance? Check. Combat? Check. Idiotic moments? Check. Countless hours of sidequests? Check. The negative part is that mods may break the game, especially the ones not in the native mod engine. I've lost a 50+ hours game because of the mods breaking.

Combat is not as good as Divinity Original Sin 2. But the story choices have way better mechanics. The narration over and the cinematic scenes are much improved as party members are now contributing to the conversation sometimes. Lots of beginning of the game customisation but not much later on as it is just levelling up 12 times and follow a job path unless you know specifically what you want from the other parts which would mostly involve following someone else's build. Short Rest Long Rest mechanic makes no sense here as they don't have much consequences.,True,0,0

"This is a fantastic adaptation of the D&D 5e ruleset, with a compelling story and depth of characters and setting that isn't just fun on it's own, but should be able to help inspire DMs for new approaches at their own table. There's so much content that multiple playthroughs are easily justifiable and enjoyable, and enough of your choices matter to keep things fresh. At almost 1000 hours I'm STILL finding new options and interactions, and that's without every playing as one of the other companion origins.

Which, by the way, Larian is great at. Jumping off from the narrative chops of Divinity: Original Sin, they origin characters are deep and nuanced and interesting, with incredible stories that intertwine with each other and the main plot in beautiful ways. It's a shame WotC split ways with them, because they're a FANTASTIC studio that I'm definitely going to be watching closely going forward. And that says something; I'm not in the habit of caring much about particular studios, but Larian joins Owlcat as a name that instantly grabs my attention.",True,0,0

"Its actually scary how well thought out and well made this game is, with everything you can do being explored. The amount of times you'll go ""I'll just try doing this, theres no way the game thought of that"" because no other games released up to this point had the time to explore it, and then you find out the game actually has something for your specific action is ridiculous

As far as the RPG side goes: from character customisation to classes to attributes, its amazing and based on DnD 5th edition. It really hits that feeling of progression, customisation and growth you'd want out of an rpg which gets you attached to your character but also wanting to do multiple playthroughs to explore the other possible builds/playstyles. It fully encourages you to be creative in your build to craft whatever playstyle you want.

As far as the story side goes: Game is fully voiced to a crazy degree and so much effort has gone into the story, writing and characters Im actually baffled at how good it is. They cooked

As far as the gameplay goes: The game embraces letting you play however you want, so go nuts and have a good time doing what you want to. The turn based combat in this game is incredibly enjoyable and the different difficulty options will have you finding exactly the kind of experience you want from that turn based combat",True,0,0

"Baldur's Gate 3 is highly praised for its deep storytelling and character choices, making it a standout RPG. If you enjoy immersive narratives and tactical gameplay, it's definitely worth adding to your collection.

"10/10 – A True RPG Masterpiece!

Baldur's Gate 3 is everything an RPG fan could ever dream of. Incredible storytelling, deep character customization, and tactical combat that’s both challenging and rewarding. Every decision feels impactful, with a world that’s alive and full of secrets to discover. The replayability is through the roof, and the cooperative multiplayer mode is a blast. Larian Studios has outdone themselves – this is easily one of the best RPGs of all time. It was the game of the year for a reason people!",True,0,0
"This is it. We finished the game in Coop and what can I say? It's my all time favorite game now. I've been playing D&D for more than 20 years and this is the closest you can get to the table top experience. The graphics are beautiful, the music is great, the storylines are well written but the best thing is the player freedom you have. It's unmatched. 10/10

In our nearly 60h we encountered only one really strange bug where I could not join a save game. We figured that that it was due to unusual location between act 2 and 3. The solution was to load in another savegame and then load into the most reccent one.

The freedom that this game gives you is just unmatched and roughly around the mid of the game playthroughs start to get really different. We got rid of Astarion very early on in the game and the game adapter to it as to all of our choices.

A great coop rule we had to ensure smooth gameplay was the idea that we stick to our decisions and dont load. This lead to a dead dog accidently killed which sharpend our sense early on.

The only problem is that after playing Baldur's Gate 3 you are spoiled and a lot of games feel very very outdated. 

Thank you Larian Studios.",True,0,0

Also, I've never been bored playing through Act 1, multiple times in different ways. I didn't want to review the game until I'd made it further, but Life interrupts and Steam keeps prodding me for a review. It is excellent. Play it if you can. Persist. Learn the systems and the lore. Fall into the nerd wormhole and buy the D&D books at Barnes and Noble, just to better understand the world and the mechanics of it. It's probably the best game I've ever played.

"The thing which really makes this game special for me is how it handles failure. If you fail a skill check or make a ""bad"" dialogue choice, for the most part you can continue on well enough but you'll simply be presented with a different (sometimes more interesting or entertaining) situation, and sometimes the impact won't be apparent until many hours later.

I really encourage anyone playing for the first time to try just rolling with your choices, and not save scumming to try and get your perfect preferred result every time.

"I dont typically write reviews for games, but if you too were like me and believed that ""oh this game is clearly well made and good, but its just not for me"" youre wrong. youre wrong and it is.

I have never played anything like this, Itll probably be a long time before I ever play anything like this again.

If the price tag is putting you off, you dont wanna sink £60 into a game you might not like. Just know that i'm sure people would play double or triple the price for this game. It is genuinely just that good. 80 hours in and theres no way i've found or done even half of all the content in this game, and with a modding scene that is kept alive and supported by the devs, its an experience you are missing out on, and a game that will just keep you coming back even when youve got much better things to do.

I come from an era when creating characters took time—20 minutes or more—rolling and re-rolling stats until they were just right. Back then, we didn’t even have character visuals; we had to imagine what they looked like. Yes, I’m an old-school gamer, and I wear that proudly.

For those unfamiliar with what makes a real RPG, check out classics like Alternate Reality: The City and Dungeon, Richard Garriott's Ultima Series, Phantasie 1, 2, and 3, the Wizardry Series, and the Advanced D&D Gold Box series, to name a few. I’m not saying there haven’t been great RPGs since those days—The Elder Scrolls series, for example, comes close to greatness—but Baldur’s Gate 3 is a breath of fresh air in the RPG genre.

"Baldur's Gate 3, for acts 1 and 2, truly blew past my expectations. Playing as a dark urge, I did feel a connection to my time with Baldur's Gate 2. Nostalgia is quite a dopamine hit. The voice acting is some of the best in any video game I've played. Easily up there with Mass Effect and Witcher 3. The quest lines, for the most part, are deep and have truly wonderful payoffs. 

Act 3 was too much all at once and some of the quest lines felt they needed a little more time to bake. The game engine is wonderful, till it's not. Combat, with more than 15-20 toons on the field was tedious. Baldur's Gate city had massive load times. Still, with these issues, the Bhaal quest line (good alignment) was quite well done. Shadowheart's quest in the city left me teary eyed (played from the Selunite side). Astarion, one of the most fun and deadly characters in the game, had one of the most epic end quests I've played. 

And Lae'zel has one of the best arcs in the game. I grew to enjoy this powerhouse of a character.

"Not much I can say about this game that others haven't. One of the best RPG's ever made. choices hold weight and the story weaves itself around them. Took me 86 hours(and several restarts) to beat this game, and it was worth every moment. If you've been waiting to play this game, do yourself a favor and pick it up already.

Pros;
- engrossing story and great cast of characters
- insane build variance and choice make it absurdly replayable.

Cons;
- changing your party can be inconvenient and tedious
- auto-saves aren't frequent, so you'll need to be mindful to save often",True,0,0
"After spending an ungodly amount of hours on this game, I can confidently say it has to be my favorite. Even though I've only done one and a half playthroughs I've experienced so may different events which is what makes it so fun. Knowing that every time you play you can get so many different outcomes is what makes this game so enjoyable.",True,0,0
"this is my first game review ever - i love this game. the behemoth of content will make this game last for at least a decade - even longer now that mod support is available. this took away dragon age: origins (2007) as my favorite game of all time. i never thought another rpg could match in quality or labors of love but i'm eating my words and it gives me hope for this genre & for people like me who enjoy it on almost a spiritual level. 

if you enjoy choice, agency, variety, comedy, pain, angst, difficulty, deep interaction or prefer complete avoidance, magic, blood, progression, avant-garde themes, humanity, philosophy, being against-the-grain, all the things that make you FEEL - the investment & effort you put into this game will never feel like a waste. i have 300 + hours on playstation but bought a new gaming laptop just for this game & the mods. the value is WORTH IT. as a pc player - controller is the best way to play but keyboard & mouse provides more options & ease with the hotbar. there are minor crashes & glitches but nothing out of the norm or game-breaking so far.

you will not enjoy this game if you don't give all the mechanics & lore a study & shot. this is not a game that deserves any sort of criticism if you do not see it at it's full potential. you cannot half-ass this game. but of course, it's playable - but it's like if you decide to microwave your oatmeal instead of cooking it over a pot. it's like if you decide to take the expensive bottle of champagne & mix it with sunny d instead of fresh orange juice. i can totally see someone not enjoying it if they feel like it's too convoluted, but because of the attention to detail it's why it must be fully appreciated. 

i also want to note - larian as a studio is just highly impressive. i have never been personally too invested in developers or publishers but the way they interact with the community is highly respectable. there is such a passion behind every interaction and update and patch notes and choice the studio makes with the game. they keep teasing me by saying this is the last update and now come to find out there's new classes on the way, for free !? i have not been able to finish this game because they keep adding new content and my head-canon is to play the ""ultimate"" version.

other convincing notes:

- my first baldur gate game - no prior lore knowledge needed
- never played dnd - still felt immersed

- not good a math, terrible even, have to count with my hands & don't enjoy heavy strategy - but the combat is not going to make you feel like you're playing chess, so don't be afraid

- you literally don't have to do anything you don't want to do, if you want to skip past the first chapter you can, but just like life every action has a reaction, isn't that crazy enough ?

small criticisms:

- why THREE gnome / dwarf races ??
- why do all my companions want to f me, what if i want to be their best friend ....
- if you progress in the story too quickly, some dialogue feels like it falls short, but this is why you must take your time
- gale trusts me too fast, i just met the dude & in 10 minutes he trusts me with his life

art like baldur's gate 3 is one of the few rare things that made me feel glad that i'm alive & can be given the chance to experience.

also i just really want to be put on the patch 8 play test list.

please, sven.

"My feelings on Baldurs Gate 3 are very similar to my thoughts on Divinity Original Sin 2.

A great, immersive RPG in the truest sense. Larian's gameplay style in both this game and Divinity Original Sin 2 is some of my favorite in the industry. It's SO deep and has so many small intricacies and interactions it makes for a really engaging experience. Not only that, but the dialogue has just as many of those intricacies. So much so that you'll probably never see every written line in this game.

I wont spoil anything. I think Divinity has a better story than this and better companions. This game suffers a bit more from the DnD 'quirkiness' factor that just doesn't appeal to me. Look me in the eyes and tell me Astarion is in any way better than Fane. I implore you.",True,0,0

The options for dialogue and choice are plentiful, giving about as much control over the story as you can hope for, and while there are some events where there is a clear evil path vs good path, there is still plenty of gray area that you can fall into without feeling railroaded like many other series. I will say that there isn't a lot of hand-holding, so for people who aren't familiar with D&D and/or Larian game mechanics, the learning curve can be really steep (though I did find the gameplay to be more intuitive than Divinity II: Original Sin). It's also extremely dense, particularly in Act 3; I'm about 120 hours in and I still have numerous quests left to complete before the endgame. Overall, I would say this is one of the best computer games to capture the experience of playing a TTRPG campaign, and while not perfect, it definitely deserves all of the accolades it has received.",True,0,0

I hadn't made it all the way through Act 1 (whatever that is.. they never make it clear where you're really at in the story...

When you drop a bomb it drops it 9 feet from where you're standing and half the time won't even blow up what you're trying to blow up.

The class, character variety and accessibility is one of the best I've seen in an RPG today, and you can multi-class after a certain level to unlock other abilities to branch out into a completely unique build.

Although if you really want a ""normal"" experience through this game, pick ""Custom"" difficulty, and change the first two options to ""Balanced"" and increase the ""Proficiency Bonus"" to 2 or 3 (even 4, I honestly find it perfect at this number).

"Pretty amazing game. Just a few minor gripes really. I think the game could do a better job at weening in new players to the genre. Lots of systems just aren't really explained well, if at all.  I also think Act 3 was a bit rushed.  I've never actually had the complaint of a game being too long but BG3 actually feels a bit too long. I found myself getting fatigued in Act 3.  I believe i was over 150+ hours into the game towards the end of Act 2.  Personally i think they could have just stopped with Act 2 and the game would would have been very close to perfection. Act 3 just feels a little bit jumbled and rushed in comparison to the first 2 acts. I think they could have let it cook a bit and released it down the road as DLC. 

That being said it is easily one of the best RPGs ever made. The amount of freedom you have in both game play, character building, and story progression is astonishing. I've never played an RPG that lets you  approach encounters in so many unique ways with all the different dialogue and combat options. I really liked the idea of using the environment in the game. Knocking enemies off cliffs or toppling statues on top of them. I would have liked to see them lean into that sort of system even more.  The music, voice acting, animations, and world design are all fantastic and the writing team did a tremendous job tying it all together. Easy recommendation at any price really.

"Lost track of time during my in-game hours, forgot about food and cannot tell if i remembered to breathe when it was first released. BG3 is pure bliss and joy! 10/10 for story, gameplay, customization and mechanics. Hats off to the devs for fleshing out the characters and environment in beautiful detail.

One of the best games of all time. Nearly 200h of content and worth multiple plays. Decent co-op. Even at full price this is a great value.,True,0,0

"So many different ways to play. So many choices not only affect the current part of your story, but also the future, and your companions attitudes.",True,0,0
"An instant classic, easily S-tier game. Genre-defining, clearly a must-play for anyone who even remotely likes 1) role-playing games 2) the sword coast fantasy setting, or 3) D&D.

It is one of the rare games that is not only totally worth full price, it would probably actually be worth the $70 or even $80 price we're seeing on some AAA titles now. it's absolutely incredible.",True,0,0
"One of the best games of the last decade, even before mods made it twice as fun.  Don't stop, get it get it.",True,0,0
"I started new run after less than 10 hours in game because I found out you can play background chars like dark urge. And ended my first run now, after 109 hours... insane for single player game. It was a hell ride. I loved that game, choices you can make, soundtrack, dialogue options, approach to combat.... ahhh. Then I started to hate it, because every time I clicked play, suddenly hours started to slip away like minutes... and now I love it. I've tried to complete what I could and I can say it's worth the money, every damn cent. Thank you Larian Studios and Karlach, my love <3",True,0,0
"solid 9/10

just finished my first play through of this game and honestly. its amazing. im at a loss for words for how thorough and just genuinely impressed the developers were with this game. i have never really been into turn based games or even anything DnD related. but their take on this game was just fantastic. i fell in love with the character design and all the minor things you could do with your party members and in the open world. from the social interactions, to being able to dye your armor colors, the emotional depth you feel on your throws, the connection you build with your character and parties all throughout the game. ive genuinely been missing out on a single player game for so long to play, since i usually am just playing competitive shooters etc. this is my mark at 121 hours and end of my first run. this was amazing, and has truly left me starstruck. oh and the soundtracks have been one of the most amazing parts of this game. they truly get you in sync with literally whatever you are doing. when youre fighting it increases the intensity, your sneaking it makes you really feel like a rogue, even if youre just sitting idle and on your phone or something it is truly music to the ears.

SPOILER [spoiler]the only real big complaint i have is the end of act 3 when fighting the netherbrain. in act 2 and 3 they make you go around and gather your allies for the final fight of the absolute and when it comes down to actually doing the fighting summoning them after doing the questlines/throws in dialogue made it feel extremely underwhelming. it might just be my pov having no prior background to games like this but summoning one creature at a time per turn just felt super meh whereas the winged horror just uses one move to summon like 15 extra fighting targets. i just feel like its just a missed opportunity to spin it into the ""war"" aspect like how it was leading up to with all that prior preparation.[/spoiler]

SPOILER 2 [spoiler]my only other complaint was the lack of freedom post game. i just really wish after i finally finished catching up with party members the world would have opened back up to an open world to see how baldurs gate was healing. i was interested in visiting the higher area of baldurs gate to see what that was like and what was there since when you try to go it forces you to turn around. or even the option to go back to previous areas like act 1 and act 2. what is going on in the grove? how are they fairing? when you mess up with halsin, how is he doing in the shadowlands? why cant i talk to shadowhearts parents even after having them live? why cant i go back and talk to duke ravenguard? even then, all of your party members break off into their own adventures and i did read online there was not going to be a baldurs gate 4 or any upcoming dlc. it just kinda sucks youre on the adventure with whomever you romanced/buddied with but dont really get to experience it. i chose lae'zel as my partner because i was interested in freeing the githyanki and wanted to destroy vlaakith but you just dont get to do that. so it just kinda falls short in that aspect.[/spoiler]",True,0,0
