"I was banned for ""map hacking,"" even though I didn’t cheat—I was simply using the Imperial Spies ability from the Chinese civilization. During the match, I was dominating my opponent, and they started flaming me in chat before reporting me. Somehow, that led to me getting banned.

I submitted a ban appeal, but the response took so long that the ban is effectively over by the time they rejected it. When I asked for more information to understand what triggered the ban and how to avoid it in the future, they refused to provide any details, claiming it would ""jeopardize the integrity of their moderation system."" As a result, I have no idea what I did that caused the ban.

It’s hard to recommend a game where you can get banned simply because you’re winning and other players report you out of spite. The slow appeal process and lack of transparency make it clear: play at your own risk.

"i was kinda disappointed on aoe 3 and so didn't expect aoe 4 to be this good, the story-telling, the game mechanics is just perfect (the controls feels better on aoe2 though). while aoe 2 is perfect, aoe 4 is just the next level that it almost made me feel the spark of the old times of aoe2. definitely worth it to buy it.",True,37,1

"I've played RTS games for 18 years now (started when I was 4 with the original starcraft). I was always horrible at playing multiplayer. This is without the doubt the best RTS game to start playing multiplayer if you always wanted to give multiplayer a shot but were scared of being bad at it (like me!).

The players in ranked and quick matches are not some high level players! For the most part they are like me and you who just play this game for fun and not for being overly competitive. While the campaign is nothing really to write home about (though the cutscenes are pretty cool), I cannot recommend this game enough if you wanted to ever have a go at RTS multiplayer that is not overly sweaty!

But don't just take my word for it! Here is a very great video on the topic if you have some free time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl4myN8q_KM&t=3237s&ab_channel=CloudCuckooCountry

"When I heard about Age of Empires IV (AoEIV) I couldn't wait to play it, since playing all of the previous entries had gave me one of the most memorable experiences I had ever had in gaming. And here is what I have to say:

I love how AoEIV had taken the time and effort to bring us a historically-accurate stories that are tied to the gameplay. I really enjoyed the aesthetic of it; it certainly makes the game so unique with their colors, their sound design and the way you can experience the gameplay and the cinematics. I think this is the part that I love the most.

Each of the civilizations feel unique, although not as unique as in Age of Empires III (AoEIII), in my opinion, with exceptions, naturally. I think it a bit as a combination between Age of empires II (AoEII) and AoEIII, leaning a little bit towards AoEII, which, by the way, is my favorite Age of Empires due to several reasons. The strategies and battles are surely good and I enjoy having different kinds of the same group of units, each with different functions. The walls' mechanics are also a good addition and adds a lot in terms of strategies and siege.

I know for a fact that many of the updates have solved many of the issues that player the player base have experienced by now and I applaud this; it was actually the bugs that led me to abandon the game some time ago, hoping for it to get better after some updates. And it really happened, even releasing a DLC. Reading this DLC's reviews, which I won't buy at least for now, shows me that AoEIV may be in a limbo where instead of taking advantage of what it is, it is just a bit nervous about the steps they need to follow to earn new and old fans of the series.

One of the things I don't like at all is that there's too little focus on the single-player experience. What I loved about AoEII was the different heroes, scenarios and setting of the campaigns, and that is also one of the things that made AoEII so memorable for many people; the amount of content that you could experience on your own was tremendous and adding the multiplayer was just perfect for all types of players. AoEIV is lacking heavily on this side: there's only half the campaigns for each of the civilizations that you can play. This is, you can't have a designed single-player experience focused on each civilization, which I find upsetting. Even more: I believe that releasing a DLC with single-player DLC-civ's campaigns before having the base game civ's ones is unforgivable.

The game really wants to push you into multiplayer, which, of course, is a big part —maybe even the most important part— of these types of game. And even though I understand why this has been done, I think that leaving the single-player experience ins such a small featuring is something that takes too big a hit on the experience.

Finally, I want to say that I played all the campaigns but I was not able to get one of the achievements due to a long-known bug. The game has been out for years by now and I think that having this bug, something so small, still lingering in the game after all the feedback is so embarrassing. 

With that being said, I think that the game is a good one and for the time I played it I had fun. It obviously had a new and good idea of what to do and what it wanted to be, but I think that the execution is a half-baked product that leaves aside a great portion of the players. I think that the game can continue with this fresh appearance and twist on the series, which I think is amazing, but it also has to take into consideration all of the accomplishments made by previous games to be better that the sum of its parts.

Solid game, but it still needs some work.

"They really did good job even with the DLC, I would recommend it, I have almost 2k in AOE 2 (HD + DE) and this game offers a lot of stuff new, unique civs with a lot of different of units and buildings with unique technologies for each civ (similar to every AOE I guess but even though tons of civs exist in aoe2 in AOE IV feels more diverse, campaigns are really good graphics are great, and I run it with Linux on proton, which runs really faster with more FPS than on windows 10, I get some crashes though but it is normal since the game don't support Linux officially. until now i have it only in campaigns and single players.",True,9,1
"Hit something above 300h lately and still not bored of the game.

"If you're looking for Age of Empires 2 with new graphics, this is pretty much it. It may have been released in 2021 but it plays like it's from 2001. The story mode is good with full videos before each mission that attempts to tell you about the history of the next mission, but.. The voice sounds like it's AI getting a lot of names/words mispronounced. I put this game on the same shelf as Iron Harvest which was also released in 2021. Recommended as a good time sink for a few days, but something i'll now uninstall and not pick up again. Probably worth it at 50% discount.",True,3,1

"I really wanted to love Age of Empires IV, but it just didn’t feel right. The game is much more fast-paced than older titles, leaving no room for slow, strategic building. Instead of clear, familiar icons, everything is replaced with confusing symbols, making simple tasks frustrating.

Worse, there’s no option to save multiplayer games, forcing matches to be rushed instead of carefully planned. It feels like the game is designed for quick, action-heavy play rather than deep strategy. Like many modern games, it’s also been simplified too much, losing the charm and depth that made Age of Empires great for me.",False,1,0
"- If you want to play and be stressed of how toxic players can be, then this game is for you. No cooldown for players who prematurely quit early to mid game. 

- hope developers can create some kind of cooldown for players who bluff around ranked matches like not doing anything or purposely sabotage your ranked match as a teammate. 

but overall, I still recommend this game because there aren't that many RTS games out there like this one.",True,1,0
"No Save option for multiplayer games with my friends this is stupid. This is a basic feature, why is it not in the game. If I want to max out the AI and play with my friends in a big multiplayer game why cant we come back and play for 2 hours a night throughout the week. AOE II has this and it is a game that is older than me by at least 4 years. Some games we play can last 8 hours in AOE II, and we save and come back. Its fun because you play the game differently every time. I like seeing how the map changes after hours of playing an online game with multiple people, you cant do this in this game and it blows.

Would Love to play a new AOE game but they make it hard when the best the franchise has and will ever be was in 1999.",False,2,2

It is really fun.  The characters don't make a noise when you click on them but that's a good thing.  Combat is a bit static but its getting better.  Also the 360 map orientation is a plus and the custom skirmishes is awesome.  All in all its a classic with some umph.,True,4,0
"AOE 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The gameplay is engaging and historical focus is fascinating.

"I absolutely loved Age of Empires 2, 3 was very meh, but this is just garbage.  Whoever the art director of this game should never ever touch the development of a video game again.  
What you don't see from the pre-selected screenshots they show, is that a lot of your units look too similar and hard to distinguish when you're actually micro-managing in combat.  The Turks for example, their combat units and builder units look 90% the same, meaning you'll grab a bunch of your villagers and bring them along with your army.
Most of the gameplay is the same as the previous ones with a few changes, the worst is they took out orders for your units.  You can't use defensive posture anymore, so its just the ""one size fits all"", and then stand ground breaks if you move so you have to keep constantly clicking it.
Overall they didn't improve the genre or add anything new or great to it, and its just a worse overall UI experience compared to the predecessor made over 2 decades ago.  Why do modern games suck so bad these days?

"I just love this game so much. 

I bought it basically from the nostalgia of AOE III. It has quite a few differences from it, but they are mostly welcome. They were able to fix a few glitches and exploits players used to use way too much in multiplayer gaming, and that has made the game so much more fluid and overall better. 

I loved the new addition as well of mew ways of winning a match, such as capturing sacred sites and/or building a wonder. 

The only thing I miss from AOE III is the method to earn XP in a match. I miss having the XP showing up everytime you built something, killed a unit or whatever. In this game, you get the XP at the end of the match, and it isn't directly attached to all the things you make in the match,; it's a standard value attached to a specific challenge, a victory, a defeat, earning a mastery from a civ, etc. 

But overall, I just love it.",True,0,0

"Don't buy this game, very little updates, extreme bugs for a game that came out in 2021.

You know its bad when ""pro"" games use a mod to access more advanced settings to play.

No reconnect features.

Constant server sync issues causing outright disconnects or odd unit behavior such as pathing directly into objects (causing them to go no where) instead of pathing around them, or a weird back and forth jittery movement that will not alleviate. The server sync issues also do not get solved over time, the server needs to ""catch back up"" to real time but it will never. This also causes some weird player sync issues where a player could lag and be playing a game 10 minutes in the past.

I have a 5800x3d and a rtx 3090 with 32gb of ram and this game is installed on a NVME ssd, aint no way my PC is going to experience ""frame lag"" that the game says I am, its a server desync issue for a fact.",False,3,0

"This was a great game, however updates have been making it less and less enjoyable over the past two years. The developers are highly catering toward high level competitive players, to say nothing of casual or medium level players, which has led to changes that are often hard to keep track of. In 2024, they completely altered the interactions between all artillery, which was not fun to discover considering I do not read patch notes. Generally you can see the trend of the developers changing the game based off pro player's feedback, who play extremely differently compared to the vast majority of players.

On the other hand, the building mechanics are incredibly fun, the soundtrack is immaculate, and the historical authenticity is refreshing. Unlike Age of Empires 2, the civs are all extremely unique to one and another and each one takes an amount of learning to be proficent. 

Despite that, if you buy this game don't expect to enjoy any of those because even in casual lobbies people WILL hate on you for trying to play the game defensively and relaxed. Regarding the multiplayer, expect to see a lot of England and China as they are extremely unbalanced, and its much easier to play and win with those civs compared to others.

Brick walls seem to have no real damage reducing properties against archers. Archers can shoot right though brick walls and kill units standing on the ground on the other side.

"50/50 whether it even launches. 

It goes to black screen and does nothing. The black screen is actually no signal sent from the PC to the monitor. My monitor reports No Input Signal.

I have to use Task Manager to end task to close down AoE4. .... Yet sometimes it launches.


I've noticed when using Task Manager to close AoE4, that power usage is high when it had black screened. 

I get the same thing in Rise of Nations if I have MSI Afterburner running. RoN will not launch with Afterburner running, and Task Manager is needed to close it. Task Manager shows power usage as very high in this case. 

I have tried running AoE4 without MSI Afterburner running but it makes no difference. Am not sure if there is something running on my PC that is conflicting. There is nothing unusual open on my PC.

I made a refund request at 11.3 hours, with Steam. I had played AoE4 for about one hour and twenty minutes since I had bought it. ... I had played the rest of the time during free weekends. .....
