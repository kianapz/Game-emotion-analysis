"I was banned for ""map hacking,"" even though I didn’t cheat—I was simply using the Imperial Spies ability from the Chinese civilization. During the match, I was dominating my opponent, and they started flaming me in chat before reporting me. Somehow, that led to me getting banned.

I submitted a ban appeal, but the response took so long that the ban is effectively over by the time they rejected it. When I asked for more information to understand what triggered the ban and how to avoid it in the future, they refused to provide any details, claiming it would ""jeopardize the integrity of their moderation system."" As a result, I have no idea what I did that caused the ban.

It’s hard to recommend a game where you can get banned simply because you’re winning and other players report you out of spite. The slow appeal process and lack of transparency make it clear: play at your own risk.

"I've played RTS games for 18 years now (started when I was 4 with the original starcraft). I was always horrible at playing multiplayer. This is without the doubt the best RTS game to start playing multiplayer if you always wanted to give multiplayer a shot but were scared of being bad at it (like me!).

The players in ranked and quick matches are not some high level players! For the most part they are like me and you who just play this game for fun and not for being overly competitive. While the campaign is nothing really to write home about (though the cutscenes are pretty cool), I cannot recommend this game enough if you wanted to ever have a go at RTS multiplayer that is not overly sweaty!

But don't just take my word for it! Here is a very great video on the topic if you have some free time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl4myN8q_KM&t=3237s&ab_channel=CloudCuckooCountry

"When I heard about Age of Empires IV (AoEIV) I couldn't wait to play it, since playing all of the previous entries had gave me one of the most memorable experiences I had ever had in gaming. And here is what I have to say:

I love how AoEIV had taken the time and effort to bring us a historically-accurate stories that are tied to the gameplay. I really enjoyed the aesthetic of it; it certainly makes the game so unique with their colors, their sound design and the way you can experience the gameplay and the cinematics. I think this is the part that I love the most.

Each of the civilizations feel unique, although not as unique as in Age of Empires III (AoEIII), in my opinion, with exceptions, naturally. I think it a bit as a combination between Age of empires II (AoEII) and AoEIII, leaning a little bit towards AoEII, which, by the way, is my favorite Age of Empires due to several reasons. The strategies and battles are surely good and I enjoy having different kinds of the same group of units, each with different functions. The walls' mechanics are also a good addition and adds a lot in terms of strategies and siege.

I know for a fact that many of the updates have solved many of the issues that player the player base have experienced by now and I applaud this; it was actually the bugs that led me to abandon the game some time ago, hoping for it to get better after some updates. And it really happened, even releasing a DLC. Reading this DLC's reviews, which I won't buy at least for now, shows me that AoEIV may be in a limbo where instead of taking advantage of what it is, it is just a bit nervous about the steps they need to follow to earn new and old fans of the series.

One of the things I don't like at all is that there's too little focus on the single-player experience. What I loved about AoEII was the different heroes, scenarios and setting of the campaigns, and that is also one of the things that made AoEII so memorable for many people; the amount of content that you could experience on your own was tremendous and adding the multiplayer was just perfect for all types of players. AoEIV is lacking heavily on this side: there's only half the campaigns for each of the civilizations that you can play. This is, you can't have a designed single-player experience focused on each civilization, which I find upsetting. Even more: I believe that releasing a DLC with single-player DLC-civ's campaigns before having the base game civ's ones is unforgivable.

The game really wants to push you into multiplayer, which, of course, is a big part —maybe even the most important part— of these types of game. And even though I understand why this has been done, I think that leaving the single-player experience ins such a small featuring is something that takes too big a hit on the experience.

Finally, I want to say that I played all the campaigns but I was not able to get one of the achievements due to a long-known bug. The game has been out for years by now and I think that having this bug, something so small, still lingering in the game after all the feedback is so embarrassing. 

With that being said, I think that the game is a good one and for the time I played it I had fun. It obviously had a new and good idea of what to do and what it wanted to be, but I think that the execution is a half-baked product that leaves aside a great portion of the players. I think that the game can continue with this fresh appearance and twist on the series, which I think is amazing, but it also has to take into consideration all of the accomplishments made by previous games to be better that the sum of its parts.

Solid game, but it still needs some work.

"They really did good job even with the DLC, I would recommend it, I have almost 2k in AOE 2 (HD + DE) and this game offers a lot of stuff new, unique civs with a lot of different of units and buildings with unique technologies for each civ (similar to every AOE I guess but even though tons of civs exist in aoe2 in AOE IV feels more diverse, campaigns are really good graphics are great, and I run it with Linux on proton, which runs really faster with more FPS than on windows 10, I get some crashes though but it is normal since the game don't support Linux officially. until now i have it only in campaigns and single players.",True,9,1

"I really wanted to love Age of Empires IV, but it just didn’t feel right. The game is much more fast-paced than older titles, leaving no room for slow, strategic building. Instead of clear, familiar icons, everything is replaced with confusing symbols, making simple tasks frustrating.

Worse, there’s no option to save multiplayer games, forcing matches to be rushed instead of carefully planned. It feels like the game is designed for quick, action-heavy play rather than deep strategy. Like many modern games, it’s also been simplified too much, losing the charm and depth that made Age of Empires great for me.",False,1,0
"- If you want to play and be stressed of how toxic players can be, then this game is for you. No cooldown for players who prematurely quit early to mid game.

AOE II has this and it is a game that is older than me by at least 4 years. Some games we play can last 8 hours in AOE II, and we save and come back. Its fun because you play the game differently every time. I like seeing how the map changes after hours of playing an online game with multiple people, you cant do this in this game and it blows.

"I absolutely loved Age of Empires 2, 3 was very meh, but this is just garbage.  Whoever the art director of this game should never ever touch the development of a video game again.  
What you don't see from the pre-selected screenshots they show, is that a lot of your units look too similar and hard to distinguish when you're actually micro-managing in combat.  The Turks for example, their combat units and builder units look 90% the same, meaning you'll grab a bunch of your villagers and bring them along with your army.
Most of the gameplay is the same as the previous ones with a few changes, the worst is they took out orders for your units.  You can't use defensive posture anymore, so its just the ""one size fits all"", and then stand ground breaks if you move so you have to keep constantly clicking it.
Overall they didn't improve the genre or add anything new or great to it, and its just a worse overall UI experience compared to the predecessor made over 2 decades ago.  Why do modern games suck so bad these days?

I bought it basically from the nostalgia of AOE III. It has quite a few differences from it, but they are mostly welcome. They were able to fix a few glitches and exploits players used to use way too much in multiplayer gaming, and that has made the game so much more fluid and overall better. 

I loved the new addition as well of mew ways of winning a match, such as capturing sacred sites and/or building a wonder. 

The only thing I miss from AOE III is the method to earn XP in a match. I miss having the XP showing up everytime you built something, killed a unit or whatever. In this game, you get the XP at the end of the match, and it isn't directly attached to all the things you make in the match,; it's a standard value attached to a specific challenge, a victory, a defeat, earning a mastery from a civ, etc. 

But overall, I just love it.",True,0,0

No reconnect features.

Constant server sync issues causing outright disconnects or odd unit behavior such as pathing directly into objects (causing them to go no where) instead of pathing around them, or a weird back and forth jittery movement that will not alleviate. The server sync issues also do not get solved over time, the server needs to ""catch back up"" to real time but it will never.

"This was a great game, however updates have been making it less and less enjoyable over the past two years. The developers are highly catering toward high level competitive players, to say nothing of casual or medium level players, which has led to changes that are often hard to keep track of. In 2024, they completely altered the interactions between all artillery, which was not fun to discover considering I do not read patch notes. Generally you can see the trend of the developers changing the game based off pro player's feedback, who play extremely differently compared to the vast majority of players.

On the other hand, the building mechanics are incredibly fun, the soundtrack is immaculate, and the historical authenticity is refreshing. Unlike Age of Empires 2, the civs are all extremely unique to one and another and each one takes an amount of learning to be proficent. 

Despite that, if you buy this game don't expect to enjoy any of those because even in casual lobbies people WILL hate on you for trying to play the game defensively and relaxed. Regarding the multiplayer, expect to see a lot of England and China as they are extremely unbalanced, and its much easier to play and win with those civs compared to others.

"50/50 whether it even launches. 

It goes to black screen and does nothing. The black screen is actually no signal sent from the PC to the monitor. My monitor reports No Input Signal.

I have to use Task Manager to end task to close down AoE4. .... Yet sometimes it launches.


I've noticed when using Task Manager to close AoE4, that power usage is high when it had black screened. 

I get the same thing in Rise of Nations if I have MSI Afterburner running. RoN will not launch with Afterburner running, and Task Manager is needed to close it. Task Manager shows power usage as very high in this case. 

I have tried running AoE4 without MSI Afterburner running but it makes no difference. Am not sure if there is something running on my PC that is conflicting. There is nothing unusual open on my PC.

I made a refund request at 11.3 hours, with Steam. I had played AoE4 for about one hour and twenty minutes since I had bought it. ... I had played the rest of the time during free weekends. .....

"In its current state AOE4 has a lot to offer with it's asymmetrical factions. It is a throwback to the 90s style RTS games in the best way. I've not played the campaigns yet but have played  with all the factions.

Sound is good and I haven't had any issues, the sounds supplement the game well. 

Graphics are adequate and nothing more, I would've loved to see better model detail or model individuality.

Performance has been solid without slowdowns on my PC 

Gameplay is fun and the rock paper scissor mechanics are complicated by upgrades and unique units. It does feel a bit slow compared to StarCraft 2.

The 8 factions offer different styles of play and are unique beyond just a graphical  re-skin. These are the best part of the game and I hope that more are added over time and further balancing is done for competitive multiplayer.

I would like for the online matches to possibly get a speed boost or more villagers to start in order to speed up the game. Blizzard did this with SC2 and really improved the early game allowing for 8-15 minute RTS games which is amazing.

Some negatives; basics like hotkey rebinding, U.I information such as upgrades or visual tells of unit upgrades as well as some unit modeling need to be addressed, but I am confident Microsoft and relic will continue to support this game. 

Overall, pleasantly surprised and really enjoying the game and different factions.

"Pleasant surprise. Age of Empires II is a classic, no doubt - and I play it since I was a little kid. Age Of Empires III, on the other hand, I feel that I was alone in the journey of loving it, and maybe it isn't everyone's cup of tee. I was afraid Age of Empires IV would let me down, but the truth is that I'm loving it. I'm enjoying playing with every single civilization and discover its potential. It's beautiful, fun and respectful with your loyalty fans. Perfect? I bet not, but I don't care.",True,1,1

"[h1] Age of Empires IV: A Hilarious Historical Romp [/h1]

I've always been a fan of history, but let's be honest, sometimes it can be a bit dry. That's where Age of Empires IV comes in! This game takes historical battles and injects them with a healthy dose of humor and chaos.

First off, the campaigns are a blast. You get to relive iconic moments like the Norman Conquest and the Hundred Years' War, but with a few unexpected twists. Watching knights trip over their own armor and siege engines misfire never gets old.

And the civilizations? Oh, the civilizations! Each one has its own unique quirks and animations that are guaranteed to make you chuckle. The Mongols packing up their entire civilization and moving it across the map? Genius! The English longbowmen with their ridiculously oversized hats? Hilarious!

But the real fun starts in multiplayer. There's nothing quite like teaming up with friends to unleash historical mayhem on your opponents. Whether you're sending a horde of elephants charging into their base or building a wall of castles just to annoy them, the possibilities for shenanigans are endless.

Sure, there might be a few historical inaccuracies here and there, but who cares? Age of Empires IV is all about having a good time and rewriting history in the most ridiculous ways possible. If you're looking for a game that's both entertaining and educational (sort of), look no further. Just be prepared to laugh until your sides hurt.",True,0,0

" Age of Empires if you like RTS you must play all of them                                                                                                        15 Critical things AOE2 and AOE3 players need to know going into AOE4

1. Resource drop points are back from AOE2, which means resource upgrades were moved from the market back to the stockpile buildings. You'll be building wood camps, mining camps, and granaries again.
2. There are now super boars on the map that give a ton of food when hunted, but need a bunch of gatherers to take down.
3. No more batch training unless you're the Mongols or the Russians. Build more barracks, archery ranges and stables as a result.
4. All civs age up the same way the AOE3 Asian Dynasties do: You pick one of two wonder options (You can only pick one unless you're the Chinese), you build the wonder, you age up. The only exception is the abbasid, who add upgrades to a wonder they start with in age 1 instead.
5. There's a new influence mechanic that boils down to something similar to the Hausa: If you build certain buildlings in proximity with one another, you get bonuses. Farms near granaries are an example.
6. AOE2 Wonder Victory is back, where if you build a wonder (Not the age up wonders, a bigger more expensive one) and hold it for a set time you win the game. With this, turtling is now a viable strategy again.
7. AOE3 Trade Monopoly Victory is now Sacred Site Victory, where if you can capture all the sacred sites with monks and keep at least one unit on each of them until the 10 minute timer runs out, you win the game. This is mostly a counter strategy to 6, valuing aggressive play and map control. (Stack villagers on the points to hold them longer if you're going for the final countdown)
8. Markets are different, where you build trade caravans and have them cross the map going to specific trade buildings rather than town centers to make gold.
9. Walls are actually awesome now, and you can stack ranged troops on stone walls to deter enemies. Any archers on walls get 2/3rd damage reduction. You actually need siege equipment to take stone walls down too, adding extra layers of strategy to siege gameplay.
10. Farms don't cost anything to reseed anymore. No more wasting a bunch of wood on farm regrowth.
11. Animals don't decay now, so don't worry about your villagers killing a bunch of sheep by accident anymore.
12. You can't wall with buildings anymore, as your units and enemy units can go between them. This means no more units getting stuck, but this also makes walls even more important than before.
13. No more infinitely burning buildings, as they will eventually burn down if lowered to around a quarter health without being repaired.
14. Siege weapons are no longer dragged by horses, which is a big regression on their aesthetic from AOE3. I hope they end up changing it eventually. They do still have AOE3 setup times though, so you can't kite with them like in AOE2.
15. Sheep will now follow scouts around, but move extremely slowly and have barely any vision without them. No more sheep scouts in the early game.",True,2,0

"As a person who have played all the Age of Empires titles before this, despite how nostalgic and rightfully great the olders games were, this one is a true success. First game was what i played growing up, second was my very early teenagers years and years after that i got to play the third one, which took a bit of getting used to tho it prepared me for the fourth one. How a top-down game manages to be so immersive is beyond me, only another kind i saw that did it this good was Darkwood. Combat feels as competitve as it was back in the second game and even if you play it to relax, the music and sound design gets your blood pumping as if you were fighting.",True,1,0
