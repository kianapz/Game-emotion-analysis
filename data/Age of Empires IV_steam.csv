"I was banned for ""map hacking,"" even though I didn’t cheat—I was simply using the Imperial Spies ability from the Chinese civilization. During the match, I was dominating my opponent, and they started flaming me in chat before reporting me. Somehow, that led to me getting banned.

I submitted a ban appeal, but the response took so long that the ban is effectively over by the time they rejected it. When I asked for more information to understand what triggered the ban and how to avoid it in the future, they refused to provide any details, claiming it would ""jeopardize the integrity of their moderation system."" As a result, I have no idea what I did that caused the ban.

It’s hard to recommend a game where you can get banned simply because you’re winning and other players report you out of spite. The slow appeal process and lack of transparency make it clear: play at your own risk.

"i was kinda disappointed on aoe 3 and so didn't expect aoe 4 to be this good, the story-telling, the game mechanics is just perfect (the controls feels better on aoe2 though). while aoe 2 is perfect, aoe 4 is just the next level that it almost made me feel the spark of the old times of aoe2. definitely worth it to buy it.",True,38,1
"I've played RTS games for 18 years now (started when I was 4 with the original starcraft). I was always horrible at playing multiplayer. This is without the doubt the best RTS game to start playing multiplayer if you always wanted to give multiplayer a shot but were scared of being bad at it (like me!).

The players in ranked and quick matches are not some high level players! For the most part they are like me and you who just play this game for fun and not for being overly competitive. While the campaign is nothing really to write home about (though the cutscenes are pretty cool), I cannot recommend this game enough if you wanted to ever have a go at RTS multiplayer that is not overly sweaty!

But don't just take my word for it! Here is a very great video on the topic if you have some free time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl4myN8q_KM&t=3237s&ab_channel=CloudCuckooCountry

"When I heard about Age of Empires IV (AoEIV) I couldn't wait to play it, since playing all of the previous entries had gave me one of the most memorable experiences I had ever had in gaming. And here is what I have to say:

I love how AoEIV had taken the time and effort to bring us a historically-accurate stories that are tied to the gameplay. I really enjoyed the aesthetic of it; it certainly makes the game so unique with their colors, their sound design and the way you can experience the gameplay and the cinematics. I think this is the part that I love the most.

Each of the civilizations feel unique, although not as unique as in Age of Empires III (AoEIII), in my opinion, with exceptions, naturally. I think it a bit as a combination between Age of empires II (AoEII) and AoEIII, leaning a little bit towards AoEII, which, by the way, is my favorite Age of Empires due to several reasons. The strategies and battles are surely good and I enjoy having different kinds of the same group of units, each with different functions. The walls' mechanics are also a good addition and adds a lot in terms of strategies and siege.

I know for a fact that many of the updates have solved many of the issues that player the player base have experienced by now and I applaud this; it was actually the bugs that led me to abandon the game some time ago, hoping for it to get better after some updates. And it really happened, even releasing a DLC. Reading this DLC's reviews, which I won't buy at least for now, shows me that AoEIV may be in a limbo where instead of taking advantage of what it is, it is just a bit nervous about the steps they need to follow to earn new and old fans of the series.

One of the things I don't like at all is that there's too little focus on the single-player experience. What I loved about AoEII was the different heroes, scenarios and setting of the campaigns, and that is also one of the things that made AoEII so memorable for many people; the amount of content that you could experience on your own was tremendous and adding the multiplayer was just perfect for all types of players. AoEIV is lacking heavily on this side: there's only half the campaigns for each of the civilizations that you can play. This is, you can't have a designed single-player experience focused on each civilization, which I find upsetting. Even more: I believe that releasing a DLC with single-player DLC-civ's campaigns before having the base game civ's ones is unforgivable.

The game really wants to push you into multiplayer, which, of course, is a big part —maybe even the most important part— of these types of game. And even though I understand why this has been done, I think that leaving the single-player experience ins such a small featuring is something that takes too big a hit on the experience.

Finally, I want to say that I played all the campaigns but I was not able to get one of the achievements due to a long-known bug. The game has been out for years by now and I think that having this bug, something so small, still lingering in the game after all the feedback is so embarrassing. 

With that being said, I think that the game is a good one and for the time I played it I had fun. It obviously had a new and good idea of what to do and what it wanted to be, but I think that the execution is a half-baked product that leaves aside a great portion of the players. I think that the game can continue with this fresh appearance and twist on the series, which I think is amazing, but it also has to take into consideration all of the accomplishments made by previous games to be better that the sum of its parts.

Solid game, but it still needs some work.

"I really wanted to love Age of Empires IV, but it just didn’t feel right. The game is much more fast-paced than older titles, leaving no room for slow, strategic building. Instead of clear, familiar icons, everything is replaced with confusing symbols, making simple tasks frustrating.

Worse, there’s no option to save multiplayer games, forcing matches to be rushed instead of carefully planned. It feels like the game is designed for quick, action-heavy play rather than deep strategy. Like many modern games, it’s also been simplified too much, losing the charm and depth that made Age of Empires great for me.",False,2,0

AOE II has this and it is a game that is older than me by at least 4 years. Some games we play can last 8 hours in AOE II, and we save and come back. Its fun because you play the game differently every time. I like seeing how the map changes after hours of playing an online game with multiple people, you cant do this in this game and it blows.

"I absolutely loved Age of Empires 2, 3 was very meh, but this is just garbage.  Whoever the art director of this game should never ever touch the development of a video game again.  
What you don't see from the pre-selected screenshots they show, is that a lot of your units look too similar and hard to distinguish when you're actually micro-managing in combat.  The Turks for example, their combat units and builder units look 90% the same, meaning you'll grab a bunch of your villagers and bring them along with your army.
Most of the gameplay is the same as the previous ones with a few changes, the worst is they took out orders for your units.  You can't use defensive posture anymore, so its just the ""one size fits all"", and then stand ground breaks if you move so you have to keep constantly clicking it.
Overall they didn't improve the genre or add anything new or great to it, and its just a worse overall UI experience compared to the predecessor made over 2 decades ago.  Why do modern games suck so bad these days?

I bought it basically from the nostalgia of AOE III. It has quite a few differences from it, but they are mostly welcome. They were able to fix a few glitches and exploits players used to use way too much in multiplayer gaming, and that has made the game so much more fluid and overall better. 

I loved the new addition as well of mew ways of winning a match, such as capturing sacred sites and/or building a wonder. 

The only thing I miss from AOE III is the method to earn XP in a match. I miss having the XP showing up everytime you built something, killed a unit or whatever. In this game, you get the XP at the end of the match, and it isn't directly attached to all the things you make in the match,; it's a standard value attached to a specific challenge, a victory, a defeat, earning a mastery from a civ, etc.

No reconnect features.

Constant server sync issues causing outright disconnects or odd unit behavior such as pathing directly into objects (causing them to go no where) instead of pathing around them, or a weird back and forth jittery movement that will not alleviate. The server sync issues also do not get solved over time, the server needs to ""catch back up"" to real time but it will never.

"This was a great game, however updates have been making it less and less enjoyable over the past two years. The developers are highly catering toward high level competitive players, to say nothing of casual or medium level players, which has led to changes that are often hard to keep track of. In 2024, they completely altered the interactions between all artillery, which was not fun to discover considering I do not read patch notes. Generally you can see the trend of the developers changing the game based off pro player's feedback, who play extremely differently compared to the vast majority of players.

On the other hand, the building mechanics are incredibly fun, the soundtrack is immaculate, and the historical authenticity is refreshing. Unlike Age of Empires 2, the civs are all extremely unique to one and another and each one takes an amount of learning to be proficent. 

Despite that, if you buy this game don't expect to enjoy any of those because even in casual lobbies people WILL hate on you for trying to play the game defensively and relaxed. Regarding the multiplayer, expect to see a lot of England and China as they are extremely unbalanced, and its much easier to play and win with those civs compared to others.

"50/50 whether it even launches. 

It goes to black screen and does nothing. The black screen is actually no signal sent from the PC to the monitor. My monitor reports No Input Signal.

I have to use Task Manager to end task to close down AoE4. .... Yet sometimes it launches.


I've noticed when using Task Manager to close AoE4, that power usage is high when it had black screened. 

I get the same thing in Rise of Nations if I have MSI Afterburner running. RoN will not launch with Afterburner running, and Task Manager is needed to close it. Task Manager shows power usage as very high in this case. 

I have tried running AoE4 without MSI Afterburner running but it makes no difference. Am not sure if there is something running on my PC that is conflicting. There is nothing unusual open on my PC.

I made a refund request at 11.3 hours, with Steam. I had played AoE4 for about one hour and twenty minutes since I had bought it. ... I had played the rest of the time during free weekends. .....

"In its current state AOE4 has a lot to offer with it's asymmetrical factions. It is a throwback to the 90s style RTS games in the best way. I've not played the campaigns yet but have played  with all the factions.

Sound is good and I haven't had any issues, the sounds supplement the game well. 

Graphics are adequate and nothing more, I would've loved to see better model detail or model individuality.

Performance has been solid without slowdowns on my PC 

Gameplay is fun and the rock paper scissor mechanics are complicated by upgrades and unique units. It does feel a bit slow compared to StarCraft 2.

The 8 factions offer different styles of play and are unique beyond just a graphical  re-skin. These are the best part of the game and I hope that more are added over time and further balancing is done for competitive multiplayer.

I would like for the online matches to possibly get a speed boost or more villagers to start in order to speed up the game. Blizzard did this with SC2 and really improved the early game allowing for 8-15 minute RTS games which is amazing.

Some negatives; basics like hotkey rebinding, U.I information such as upgrades or visual tells of unit upgrades as well as some unit modeling need to be addressed, but I am confident Microsoft and relic will continue to support this game. 

Overall, pleasantly surprised and really enjoying the game and different factions.

"[h1] Age of Empires IV: A Hilarious Historical Romp [/h1]

I've always been a fan of history, but let's be honest, sometimes it can be a bit dry. That's where Age of Empires IV comes in! This game takes historical battles and injects them with a healthy dose of humor and chaos.

First off, the campaigns are a blast. You get to relive iconic moments like the Norman Conquest and the Hundred Years' War, but with a few unexpected twists. Watching knights trip over their own armor and siege engines misfire never gets old.

And the civilizations? Oh, the civilizations! Each one has its own unique quirks and animations that are guaranteed to make you chuckle. The Mongols packing up their entire civilization and moving it across the map? Genius! The English longbowmen with their ridiculously oversized hats? Hilarious!

But the real fun starts in multiplayer. There's nothing quite like teaming up with friends to unleash historical mayhem on your opponents. Whether you're sending a horde of elephants charging into their base or building a wall of castles just to annoy them, the possibilities for shenanigans are endless.

Sure, there might be a few historical inaccuracies here and there, but who cares? Age of Empires IV is all about having a good time and rewriting history in the most ridiculous ways possible. If you're looking for a game that's both entertaining and educational (sort of), look no further. Just be prepared to laugh until your sides hurt.",True,0,0

" Age of Empires if you like RTS you must play all of them                                                                                                        15 Critical things AOE2 and AOE3 players need to know going into AOE4

1. Resource drop points are back from AOE2, which means resource upgrades were moved from the market back to the stockpile buildings. You'll be building wood camps, mining camps, and granaries again.
2. There are now super boars on the map that give a ton of food when hunted, but need a bunch of gatherers to take down.
3. No more batch training unless you're the Mongols or the Russians. Build more barracks, archery ranges and stables as a result.
4. All civs age up the same way the AOE3 Asian Dynasties do: You pick one of two wonder options (You can only pick one unless you're the Chinese), you build the wonder, you age up. The only exception is the abbasid, who add upgrades to a wonder they start with in age 1 instead.
5. There's a new influence mechanic that boils down to something similar to the Hausa: If you build certain buildlings in proximity with one another, you get bonuses. Farms near granaries are an example.
6. AOE2 Wonder Victory is back, where if you build a wonder (Not the age up wonders, a bigger more expensive one) and hold it for a set time you win the game. With this, turtling is now a viable strategy again.
7. AOE3 Trade Monopoly Victory is now Sacred Site Victory, where if you can capture all the sacred sites with monks and keep at least one unit on each of them until the 10 minute timer runs out, you win the game. This is mostly a counter strategy to 6, valuing aggressive play and map control. (Stack villagers on the points to hold them longer if you're going for the final countdown)
8. Markets are different, where you build trade caravans and have them cross the map going to specific trade buildings rather than town centers to make gold.
9. Walls are actually awesome now, and you can stack ranged troops on stone walls to deter enemies. Any archers on walls get 2/3rd damage reduction. You actually need siege equipment to take stone walls down too, adding extra layers of strategy to siege gameplay.
10. Farms don't cost anything to reseed anymore. No more wasting a bunch of wood on farm regrowth.
11. Animals don't decay now, so don't worry about your villagers killing a bunch of sheep by accident anymore.
12. You can't wall with buildings anymore, as your units and enemy units can go between them. This means no more units getting stuck, but this also makes walls even more important than before.
13. No more infinitely burning buildings, as they will eventually burn down if lowered to around a quarter health without being repaired.
14. Siege weapons are no longer dragged by horses, which is a big regression on their aesthetic from AOE3. I hope they end up changing it eventually. They do still have AOE3 setup times though, so you can't kite with them like in AOE2.
15. Sheep will now follow scouts around, but move extremely slowly and have barely any vision without them. No more sheep scouts in the early game.",True,2,0

How a top-down game manages to be so immersive is beyond me, only another kind i saw that did it this good was Darkwood.

"I was banned for ""map hacking,"" even though I didn’t cheat—I was simply using the Imperial Spies ability from the Chinese civilization. During the match, I was dominating my opponent, and they started flaming me in chat before reporting me. Somehow, that led to me getting banned.

I submitted a ban appeal, but the response took so long that the ban is effectively over by the time they rejected it. When I asked for more information to understand what triggered the ban and how to avoid it in the future, they refused to provide any details, claiming it would ""jeopardize the integrity of their moderation system."" As a result, I have no idea what I did that caused the ban.

It’s hard to recommend a game where you can get banned simply because you’re winning and other players report you out of spite. The slow appeal process and lack of transparency make it clear: play at your own risk.

"I've put 80 hours into Age of Empires IV, and while it’s a bit different from Age of Empires II, I’ve really enjoyed it. The game brings fresh mechanics, new civilizations, and updated visuals, but it still retains that classic RTS feel. If you’re coming from AoE2, expect some changes—things like the new tech trees, a more streamlined economy, and a focus on both macro and micro strategies.

The single-player campaigns are solid and provide a good mix of historical storytelling and RTS action. The battles feel epic, and the game does a great job of mixing accessibility with depth. The AI can be a bit predictable, but it’s still fun to play against in custom matches.

I don’t play ranked, so I can’t speak to the competitive scene, but I’ve had a lot of fun with the casual matches. The progression system feels rewarding, and the different playstyles of the civilizations keep things interesting.

Overall, if you’re a fan of the series or RTS games in general, Age of Empires IV is definitely worth checking out. It’s not just a rehash of the older games, but a solid evolution of the series that’s worth sinking some hours into.",True,25,0
"My entry into the RTS genre and I cant stop playing. The depth and dynamics of this game keep you learning and force you to adapt. The DEVS have made small mistakes in the past but I truly believe they actively listen to the community. The most recent updates are exactly what the game needed.

See you on ladder boys!",True,22,1
"Definitely a worthy successor to Age of Empires 2. As I review this, the devs are still pushing big changes to the overall meta, with siege units being massively nerfed, cavalry being buffed too much and subsequently nerfed, etc. with long-reaching implications for match-ups between civs. Fortunately, the devs are very quick to release things like mid-season patches to institute much-needed changes, and while it can be frustrating to see things shaken up so much lately, I quite like the direction the game is heading in.",True,16,1
"I've played RTS games for 18 years now (started when I was 4 with the original starcraft). I was always horrible at playing multiplayer. This is without the doubt the best RTS game to start playing multiplayer if you always wanted to give multiplayer a shot but were scared of being bad at it (like me!).

The players in ranked and quick matches are not some high level players! For the most part they are like me and you who just play this game for fun and not for being overly competitive. While the campaign is nothing really to write home about (though the cutscenes are pretty cool), I cannot recommend this game enough if you wanted to ever have a go at RTS multiplayer that is not overly sweaty!

But don't just take my word for it! Here is a very great video on the topic if you have some free time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl4myN8q_KM&t=3237s&ab_channel=CloudCuckooCountry

"The game successfully balances classic RTS elements with modern improvements, offering a satisfying and deep experience. The graphics are good, with detailed environments and beautifully designed units that bring the historical settings to life.

The gameplay is rich and engaging, offering a variety of civilizations, each with unique playstyles and strengths. Whether you're leading the Mongol hordes, defending as the English, or commanding the powerful Delhi Sultanate, each faction feels distinct and provides strategic depth. The campaigns are incredibly well-crafted, combining historical narratives with challenging missions that push you to think critically and adapt your strategies.

The game's AI is impressively competent, and the multiplayer experience is smooth and rewarding, making it a great choice for both solo play and competitive sessions. Additionally, frequent updates and expansions continue to enrich the game, adding new civilizations, maps, and features to keep the community engaged.

Overall, Age of Empires IV is a fantastic evolution of the RTS genre, with polished mechanics, a rich historical setting, and a wealth of content that will keep you coming back for hours. Whether you're a seasoned strategist or new to the series, this game is a must-play.",True,13,1
"[h1] I have Praise for this game, but I also need to Rant about it... [/h1]

I have been playing Age of Empires since the late 90s as a little kid. To see a fourth game finally release with modern graphics is so awesome. Now, I can type a lot, in great detail. To avoid this, I'm simply doing a short list of praise and rant of the things I like the most, and the worst things about the game in Dec of 2024.

[b] Praise: [/b] Nostalgia is real and it feels great. I love these games and playing a modern one has been a real treat. There is plenty to do with PvE if you're not really a PvP type of gamer. There's a lot of single-player campaigns and tons of custom game options. Graphics are pretty and the mechanics feel smooth. There's a lot of uniqueness to each civilization.

[b] Rant: [/b] I'm typing this review immediately after having been kicked from a 3v3 PvP game with two of my friends VS. three other players. It is absolutely infuriating when one of your friends gets automatically kicked if they disconnect for a few seconds, and now they have to wait around for the others to finish (and probably lose) their game. But it is 100% even more aggravating to be the one that somehow loses connection to the game, gets kicked, and now has to watch as your friends have to play 2v3. It happens too often, and it sucks so much. It's not even anyone's fault that they get kicked, but you still feel bad and you're left with this awful feeling of letting your teammates down. It has been over 2 years, Relic Entertainment, please do SOMETHING about this! Rant over.

Do I recommend this game? 
Yes, if you're a casual PvPer and enjoy PvE real-time strategy games. 
No, if you're a competitive PvPer and you don't want to get kicked from a game for accidental disconnections or a sudden spike of drawn-out latency.",True,9,0
I love the game play and would give it a positive but after 54 hours of play and maybe finished 10-15% because my saves are no longer available 2 days or more later I've come to loath this version. I consistently loose my saved games and no longer care to play it. Many have said its because of updates but I've gone weeks with out updates and still after a few days go to load my game and it says unavailable.,False,27,4
"When I heard about Age of Empires IV (AoEIV) I couldn't wait to play it, since playing all of the previous entries had gave me one of the most memorable experiences I had ever had in gaming. And here is what I have to say:

I love how AoEIV had taken the time and effort to bring us a historically-accurate stories that are tied to the gameplay. I really enjoyed the aesthetic of it; it certainly makes the game so unique with their colors, their sound design and the way you can experience the gameplay and the cinematics. I think this is the part that I love the most.

Each of the civilizations feel unique, although not as unique as in Age of Empires III (AoEIII), in my opinion, with exceptions, naturally. I think it a bit as a combination between Age of empires II (AoEII) and AoEIII, leaning a little bit towards AoEII, which, by the way, is my favorite Age of Empires due to several reasons. The strategies and battles are surely good and I enjoy having different kinds of the same group of units, each with different functions. The walls' mechanics are also a good addition and adds a lot in terms of strategies and siege.

I know for a fact that many of the updates have solved many of the issues that player the player base have experienced by now and I applaud this; it was actually the bugs that led me to abandon the game some time ago, hoping for it to get better after some updates. And it really happened, even releasing a DLC. Reading this DLC's reviews, which I won't buy at least for now, shows me that AoEIV may be in a limbo where instead of taking advantage of what it is, it is just a bit nervous about the steps they need to follow to earn new and old fans of the series.

One of the things I don't like at all is that there's too little focus on the single-player experience. What I loved about AoEII was the different heroes, scenarios and setting of the campaigns, and that is also one of the things that made AoEII so memorable for many people; the amount of content that you could experience on your own was tremendous and adding the multiplayer was just perfect for all types of players. AoEIV is lacking heavily on this side: there's only half the campaigns for each of the civilizations that you can play. This is, you can't have a designed single-player experience focused on each civilization, which I find upsetting. Even more: I believe that releasing a DLC with single-player DLC-civ's campaigns before having the base game civ's ones is unforgivable.

The game really wants to push you into multiplayer, which, of course, is a big part —maybe even the most important part— of these types of game. And even though I understand why this has been done, I think that leaving the single-player experience ins such a small featuring is something that takes too big a hit on the experience.

Finally, I want to say that I played all the campaigns but I was not able to get one of the achievements due to a long-known bug. The game has been out for years by now and I think that having this bug, something so small, still lingering in the game after all the feedback is so embarrassing. 

With that being said, I think that the game is a good one and for the time I played it I had fun. It obviously had a new and good idea of what to do and what it wanted to be, but I think that the execution is a half-baked product that leaves aside a great portion of the players. I think that the game can continue with this fresh appearance and twist on the series, which I think is amazing, but it also has to take into consideration all of the accomplishments made by previous games to be better that the sum of its parts.

Solid game, but it still needs some work.

Worse, there’s no option to save multiplayer games, forcing matches to be rushed instead of carefully planned.

"“A Worthy Successor to a Legendary Series”

Age of Empires IV delivers everything I hoped for as a fan of the franchise. It beautifully blends the nostalgic feel of classic Age of Empires games with modern innovations that make it stand out as a top-tier RTS for both veterans and newcomers.

The campaigns are engaging and full of historical depth, offering unique scenarios that make each mission feel fresh. The cinematic storytelling and documentary-style videos add an educational layer that’s surprisingly fun. The civilizations feel distinct, each with their own strategies and mechanics—mastering them is a rewarding challenge.

Multiplayer is incredibly satisfying, with smooth matchmaking and balanced gameplay that keeps me coming back for more. The graphics strike a perfect balance between stylized and realistic, while the sound design (especially the music) immerses you in every battle.

If you’re a fan of strategy games or the Age of Empires series, this is a must-play. It respects its roots while pushing the genre forward. Highly recommended!",True,1,0

"I absolutely loved Age of Empires 2, 3 was very meh, but this is just garbage.  Whoever the art director of this game should never ever touch the development of a video game again.  
What you don't see from the pre-selected screenshots they show, is that a lot of your units look too similar and hard to distinguish when you're actually micro-managing in combat.  The Turks for example, their combat units and builder units look 90% the same, meaning you'll grab a bunch of your villagers and bring them along with your army.
Most of the gameplay is the same as the previous ones with a few changes, the worst is they took out orders for your units.  You can't use defensive posture anymore, so its just the ""one size fits all"", and then stand ground breaks if you move so you have to keep constantly clicking it.
Overall they didn't improve the genre or add anything new or great to it, and its just a worse overall UI experience compared to the predecessor made over 2 decades ago.  Why do modern games suck so bad these days?

I bought it basically from the nostalgia of AOE III. It has quite a few differences from it, but they are mostly welcome. They were able to fix a few glitches and exploits players used to use way too much in multiplayer gaming, and that has made the game so much more fluid and overall better. 

I loved the new addition as well of mew ways of winning a match, such as capturing sacred sites and/or building a wonder. 

The only thing I miss from AOE III is the method to earn XP in a match. I miss having the XP showing up everytime you built something, killed a unit or whatever. In this game, you get the XP at the end of the match, and it isn't directly attached to all the things you make in the match,; it's a standard value attached to a specific challenge, a victory, a defeat, earning a mastery from a civ, etc.

"Very great RTS game! The key differences between this one and a game like sc2 are a few incredibly great game design features that allow for alot more strategy.
1. Resources are generated on the map relatively {""diffused""?} with games like sc2 you fight for a location to expand to while in AOE4 you basically fight over the whole map at all times. it is more of a game of fighting for space rather than a particular location allowing for alot more diversity in the ways games are played.
2. The ability to wall for relatively cheap allows you to section off parts of the map in order to slow your opponent down or harass or play more defensively. alot of RTS games have defensive structures but the ability to wall in the way AOE4 allows you to is just brilliant.
3. Having the food/wood/gold resources instead of just min/vespene or mass/energy allows for more strategies where denying just gold or just food can work. turns the games more into denying resources on the map and getting advantage through attrition of a particular resources.

all 3 of things are what make AOE4 a far more strategic, slower paced, and positional RTS. No other RTS game has been able to make strategic and positional play as important as it is in AOE4. AOE4 feels more like chess while Starcraft 2 feels more like a pingpong match.",True,0,0

Wonder no more, cause this game is exactly that, a love project that gets the best from the two-best selling games of the franchise and combines them into a unique package full of flavour and uniqueness.

Each civilization brings something new to the table, making them distinct from one another, unlike the first two installements of the franchise, the way of aging up is also different, requiring the construction of Landmarks (Similar to Minor Gods in Age of Mythology).

"This is a review I may come back to update after I put more time into it (Currently around 1300 ELO). I'm largely focusing on the multiplayer component (the singleplayer ranges from mediocre to pretty good if you get the dlc). Games like this are a big investment of time and energy and like most investments carry some risk. A bad patch or taking the game in a bad direction (catering solely to casuals/competitive/reddit) can alienate players. Thankfully I can say that this game is on a great trajectory, the game really reminds me of how DotA2 used to be. Of course this could all change but right now the game is firmly in its golden age.

AoE4's largest strength to me is its focus on macro strategy rather than things like micro and build perfection etc. Focusing on the broad strokes such as having a strong game plan, countering units, flexibility, and game knowledge are highly impactful and will often be the deciding factors in winning a game. Situations such as in  Starcraft where you can pretty much lose the game instantly because of failing to react to banelings do not exist in  this game. That being said it still retains a very punishing nature - if you fail to address the enemy properly or don't scout key information you will likely lose. This is great because it creates a back  and forth and wards off cheesey one dimesional strategy.

You can't talk about RTS games without cheese coming up. Cheese exists  in AoE4 but as I mentioned if you see the cheese you can react  and beat it pretty much every time. Some people don't believe  in  cheese but I do think  it exists  in this game. There are some simple but very effective strategies that require more effort to counter than they do to perform. Again, if you are good enough you can beat these things however I think it can be annoying at lower levels and seeing the same strategies repeatedly.

I think the last thing worth mentioning is the overall design in the game. The visuals and audio are fantastic. Animations are mocapped and fun to watch, plenty of audio hooks that flow seamlessly, and  in general it is a very well made polished experience. The civilization design is incredibly incredibly well done. All the civs feel very distinct and have a myriad of strategies. Their visual design is distinct and fun but at the same  time consistent so  that you can recognize commonalities across them (structures and units have key distinguishing features that make them intuitively recognizable during gameplay). This isn't even to mention how their design changes as they progress through the ages, everything from how they speak to how they look changes. And all of it is historically authentic to some degree (old languages that become more modern as you age up etc). There is clearly a huge amount of effort put in here and it is probably the games biggest strength overall.

Overall AoE4 is a great game that is in its prime right now. I'm not even an RTS player but as it stands this is a game that is absolutely worth the time I am investing in it. That being said I have been burned by many games that take a nosedive in design and I can never rule out something like that happening.",True,0,2

On the other hand, the building mechanics are incredibly fun, the soundtrack is immaculate, and the historical authenticity is refreshing. Unlike Age of Empires 2, the civs are all extremely unique to one and another and each one takes an amount of learning to be proficent. 

Despite that, if you buy this game don't expect to enjoy any of those because even in casual lobbies people WILL hate on you for trying to play the game defensively and relaxed. Regarding the multiplayer, expect to see a lot of England and China as they are extremely unbalanced, and its much easier to play and win with those civs compared to others.

"Garbage if playing against the computer. Playing with friends is fun, but playing against the computer is a joke.

If you do buy AoE4 then note the caveat that you may be disappointed with your purchase.",False,1,0
"This game used to be fun and enjoyable. I really like the story line but am unable to progress. I dont understand how the recent reviews are ""VERY POSITIVE""??? The game is almost unplayable due to the new balance of damage. The villagers are dumb as rocks, not fixing an almost destroyed wall they are standing next to, and agro to enemies. Have to hand hold every single unit, including villagers, so they do not go wandering off to fight by themselves in the wilderness. Brick walls seem to have no real damage reducing properties against archers. Archers can shoot right though brick walls and kill units standing on the ground on the other side. Nothing but villagers will throw fire down to damage wall pillagers. Cant upgrade armies while the computer seems to keep upgrading/getting stronger. All the missions are based on lucky D20 rolls, not skill. There is more.

I understand that the anti cheat function is there for the multiplayer function which is understandable but some of us don't like playing online nor like multiplayer functions. it makes absolutely no sense to have it on the single player campaign functions. It seems the game designers forget its the customers who decide whether a product is fun or not. I don't see any professional aoe games happening anytime soon as it is not that fun due to game designers assuming that is what most customers want. this is a waste of money and a disappointment of a game. i bought this game assuming it would be fun like the previous aoe games but it seems that this game has a nanny or nun watching over it to make it crap!,False,1,0
"50/50 whether it even launches. 

It goes to black screen and does nothing. The black screen is actually no signal sent from the PC to the monitor. My monitor reports No Input Signal.

I have to use Task Manager to end task to close down AoE4. .... Yet sometimes it launches.


I've noticed when using Task Manager to close AoE4, that power usage is high when it had black screened. 

I get the same thing in Rise of Nations if I have MSI Afterburner running. RoN will not launch with Afterburner running, and Task Manager is needed to close it. Task Manager shows power usage as very high in this case. 

I have tried running AoE4 without MSI Afterburner running but it makes no difference. Am not sure if there is something running on my PC that is conflicting. There is nothing unusual open on my PC.

I made a refund request at 11.3 hours, with Steam. I had played AoE4 for about one hour and twenty minutes since I had bought it. ... I had played the rest of the time during free weekends. ..... My refund request was denied because of my time in the game. That was even though I explained to Steam about free weekend time spent playing maybe over the last two years.

How could I recommend it?",False,0,0
This game is so lag's. The old AOE 2007 had better picture quality. This AOE doesn't really offer anything. They have taken away treasures. The AI players don't help when pushing help on the map. You can't ask for tribute from your teammates. I will keep playing the old version!,False,0,0

"In its current state AOE4 has a lot to offer with it's asymmetrical factions. It is a throwback to the 90s style RTS games in the best way. I've not played the campaigns yet but have played  with all the factions.

Sound is good and I haven't had any issues, the sounds supplement the game well. 

Graphics are adequate and nothing more, I would've loved to see better model detail or model individuality.

Performance has been solid without slowdowns on my PC 

Gameplay is fun and the rock paper scissor mechanics are complicated by upgrades and unique units. It does feel a bit slow compared to StarCraft 2.

The 8 factions offer different styles of play and are unique beyond just a graphical  re-skin. These are the best part of the game and I hope that more are added over time and further balancing is done for competitive multiplayer.

I would like for the online matches to possibly get a speed boost or more villagers to start in order to speed up the game. Blizzard did this with SC2 and really improved the early game allowing for 8-15 minute RTS games which is amazing.

Some negatives; basics like hotkey rebinding, U.I information such as upgrades or visual tells of unit upgrades as well as some unit modeling need to be addressed, but I am confident Microsoft and relic will continue to support this game. 

Overall, pleasantly surprised and really enjoying the game and different factions.

Update: After 1 month and an update the I am happy that there appears to be quick responses from the devs as well as a roadmap for upcoming content. Still pleased with the game and happy to say that after more time with the game I am really starting to enjoy some of the small strategies and intricacies. They still haven't corrected all the issues described above but the game plays well and I've have almost no issues in multiplayer.

"[h1] Age of Empires IV: A Hilarious Historical Romp [/h1]

I've always been a fan of history, but let's be honest, sometimes it can be a bit dry. That's where Age of Empires IV comes in! This game takes historical battles and injects them with a healthy dose of humor and chaos.

First off, the campaigns are a blast. You get to relive iconic moments like the Norman Conquest and the Hundred Years' War, but with a few unexpected twists. Watching knights trip over their own armor and siege engines misfire never gets old.

And the civilizations? Oh, the civilizations! Each one has its own unique quirks and animations that are guaranteed to make you chuckle. The Mongols packing up their entire civilization and moving it across the map? Genius! The English longbowmen with their ridiculously oversized hats? Hilarious!

But the real fun starts in multiplayer. There's nothing quite like teaming up with friends to unleash historical mayhem on your opponents. Whether you're sending a horde of elephants charging into their base or building a wall of castles just to annoy them, the possibilities for shenanigans are endless.

Sure, there might be a few historical inaccuracies here and there, but who cares? Age of Empires IV is all about having a good time and rewriting history in the most ridiculous ways possible. If you're looking for a game that's both entertaining and educational (sort of), look no further. Just be prepared to laugh until your sides hurt.",True,0,0

" Age of Empires if you like RTS you must play all of them                                                                                                        15 Critical things AOE2 and AOE3 players need to know going into AOE4

1. Resource drop points are back from AOE2, which means resource upgrades were moved from the market back to the stockpile buildings. You'll be building wood camps, mining camps, and granaries again.
2. There are now super boars on the map that give a ton of food when hunted, but need a bunch of gatherers to take down.
3. No more batch training unless you're the Mongols or the Russians. Build more barracks, archery ranges and stables as a result.
4. All civs age up the same way the AOE3 Asian Dynasties do: You pick one of two wonder options (You can only pick one unless you're the Chinese), you build the wonder, you age up. The only exception is the abbasid, who add upgrades to a wonder they start with in age 1 instead.
5. There's a new influence mechanic that boils down to something similar to the Hausa: If you build certain buildlings in proximity with one another, you get bonuses. Farms near granaries are an example.
6. AOE2 Wonder Victory is back, where if you build a wonder (Not the age up wonders, a bigger more expensive one) and hold it for a set time you win the game. With this, turtling is now a viable strategy again.
7. AOE3 Trade Monopoly Victory is now Sacred Site Victory, where if you can capture all the sacred sites with monks and keep at least one unit on each of them until the 10 minute timer runs out, you win the game. This is mostly a counter strategy to 6, valuing aggressive play and map control. (Stack villagers on the points to hold them longer if you're going for the final countdown)
8. Markets are different, where you build trade caravans and have them cross the map going to specific trade buildings rather than town centers to make gold.
9. Walls are actually awesome now, and you can stack ranged troops on stone walls to deter enemies. Any archers on walls get 2/3rd damage reduction. You actually need siege equipment to take stone walls down too, adding extra layers of strategy to siege gameplay.
10. Farms don't cost anything to reseed anymore. No more wasting a bunch of wood on farm regrowth.
11. Animals don't decay now, so don't worry about your villagers killing a bunch of sheep by accident anymore.
12. You can't wall with buildings anymore, as your units and enemy units can go between them. This means no more units getting stuck, but this also makes walls even more important than before.
13. No more infinitely burning buildings, as they will eventually burn down if lowered to around a quarter health without being repaired.
14. Siege weapons are no longer dragged by horses, which is a big regression on their aesthetic from AOE3. I hope they end up changing it eventually. They do still have AOE3 setup times though, so you can't kite with them like in AOE2.
15. Sheep will now follow scouts around, but move extremely slowly and have barely any vision without them. No more sheep scouts in the early game.",True,2,0
