It's hard to wrap up all my thoughts about this game. This playthrough took me two months, and I was so close to starting another one right away. It's so hard to move on from such a well crafted world and all those iconic characters. Please play this if you still haven't, it's an experience unlike any other. One which I'll never forget.

"I’ve been interested in Cyberpunk 2077 since it was announced in 2012, and I followed it closely since. It has been a rollercoaster, honestly. I was there on day one and decided to wait with my review all these years until after CDPR would have kept its promise to fix it.  

[b]Five years later,[/b] the modding scene has grown so much it's on the homepage of NexusMods. A DLC and many patches have come out, and with CP77 basically being a benchmark tool, it was about time I made my way back to Night City.  

[h1]Unique promise[/h1]  
Cyberpunk 2077 is not just a ""first-person shooter RPG."" [b]The things it excels at are what make it such a noteworthy experience.[/b]  
It all begins with a well-presented - although simple - story that is brought to life by the [b]very strong performance of the actors.[/b]  

It all happens inside of Night City, which is one of the most [b]detailed and captivating maps[/b] out there, likely because it wasn't made just for the game but has a long history and revisions of its tabletop counterpart. The game has a [b]distinct aesthetic[/b], fitting the genre like a glove, and every area feels alive, full of diversity, and things to see.  

It's all complimented by a [b]better take on hacking[/b] that's quite a step up compared to Watch Dogs and [b]solid gunplay and gun handling[/b] that could almost rival Destiny, which excels at it. Each weapon feels different and delivers a reason to use it over others simply for how it handles.  

The [b]side missions[/b], much like in The Witcher 3, are standouts, with storylines expanding multiple missions that can even unlock more endings when completed.
The [b]side activities[/b] are many, yet not so varied, much like in The Witcher 3 often being a point of interest with enemies in it. 

When Cyberpunk puts all these things together and does them well, [b]it genuinely is one of the most memorable experiences you could get in gaming.[/b]  

The issue is when it [i]doesn't[/i].  

[h1]Cutting corners[/h1]  
CP77 was introduced at first with many promises during some keynotes held by CDPR, and then to the masses with a gameplay footage of 40m of a tailor-made demo in 2018. 

Is this uncommon in the gaming industry? No. 
When TLOU2 was shown, Naughty Dog had nothing on their hands and also made a demo environment to showcase what they aimed the game to be like. Many choices had to be finalized in regard to the experience, and so had the design of the characters shown.
There is a spectacular documentary on it on YouTube.  

[b]The issue with CP77 was that it was an unachievable goal.[/b]  

But this is not just about the broken promises; it's also about the ones that were kept, with shortcuts. Even after the many improvements of 2.0, and dropping the old-gen consoles, the game still suffers greatly and has many bugs.
I was actually shocked to find so many, after hearing people talk about it so well compared to at lunch. I think that with time, a good pair of rose-tinted glasses, and with so much exposure to CP77 in ways I'll go over later, time has smoothed out some of those sharp edges in the general opinion that are still there.

[i]For example:[/i]  
The game had promised an [b]origin system[/b] that could be compared to Dragon Age: Origins, and while it does have a slightly different beginning based on your starting faction, for the rest of the story, it'll just be adding an extra dialogue option that you can use, with no impact besides a different sentence. In Origins, people who, for example, knew the family you came from would make comments and have extra dialogues because of it, a completely different level of immersion.

Staying on the [b]story[/b], there aren't many options for roleplaying, with most simply leading to extra endings based on what side missions you've completed. This is true for both the game and DLC.
I had story missions that bugged, telling me to make a call while preventing me until a restart of the game, or even main story bosses bugging with infinite health at 1% left.  

During the story - and that famous demo - the one and only [b]car chase[/b] is present. I'm happy to report that in the DLC, another one has been added, yet much like the story, it's heavily scripted. On a harder difficulty, when I didn't destroy one of the cars chasing me fast enough, it would just self-implode. Additionally, after the chase, I was given control over the vehicle that now had popped wheels and was a nightmare to drive. 

Everything around the [b]cars[/b] suffers in general from how it has been implemented. I have seen the cars either literally waiting on me when I was too far during a race, or worse, teleporting right behind me to make it challenging instead of proper rubber banding. This is the same as it was when it launched. At some point, other contestants hit civilians on the sidewalk, and the police started chasing me.  
I am happy to say though that general vehicle combat has been added!

Speaking of [b]the police[/b], it's great they patched it and now it won't spawn in front of your face anymore, but they still do: a bit further. Additionally, there's an achievement in the DLC to bring the wanted level to the max; this can be done only by killing civilians, attacking the police doesn't increase it, and there are no real differences between wanted levels 1 and 5. No helicopter or insane chase to escape them, it's worse than in Need For Speed Most Wanted from 2005! I'm not sure why they'd highlight such a weak point.  

Speaking of [b]civilians,[/b] they now finally run away from you during crimes, but they are still simpler than in GTA 3 and are nowhere near the promised complexity with day-night cycles even Morrowind had. Instead, if you look at them long enough, they either despawn or go in circles. Their nav-meshing seems to have issues too, since I've often seen them walking over benches and other parts of the map.

[b]All these examples are just what I noticed. Overall, the game is still just not a very polished experience and nowhere where I hoped it would be by now.[/b] I understand a project like No Man's Sky is smaller and requires fewer resources to elevate to the level it's at today, nevertheless, I can't say I didn't expect that from CDPR as a way to make up the wrong.

[b]Phantom Liberty[/b]

Much like the base game, its well-written story is brought alive by its performance, with the last small piece of the map of Night City, Dogtown, being now open and around 30h of content; a good expansion, especially for the new ending which I'll see as canon for my character.
I would not say it's at the level of Heart of Stone of The Witcher 3, let alone Blood and Wine. 

[h1]Forever installed[/h1]  
The smartest thing CDPR did with CP77 was update it to support many experimental features, making its way into many benchmarks nowadays.  
It's one of the few games with [b]full path tracing, ray tracing, every possible type of AI upscaling, and frame generation available.[/b] It's a wonderful benchmark for graphics cards and there hasn't been a video in the last 3 years at least that didn't show the game at some capacity.
Even now, with DLSS 4, the fact they updated the game to support the Transformer Model earlier than Nvidia released the drivers made it so that I could test it out and see all the issues the CCN model had with the path tracing gone.  
[b]They are genuinely doing a great job in this aspect.[/b]  

[h1]The Tower[/h1]  

To anyone who praises this game as one of the best ever made: I'm happy for you. I strongly suggest playing some of the games CP77 said it would be like.

[b]It's crazy how, 5 years later, my opinion on it hasn't changed.[/b]  
The game is not what was promised, despite the impressive work done, and it seems like it never will be, but it's not a bad game.
It's just not what I bought.
And that will always be bittersweet.

"For me this was an amazing game.
I completed all the achievements, did all the endings and have seen everything the game has to offer. And it was amazing.
Honestly, This is probably one of the best story games ever done. Night City is absolutely brutal and nobody ever gets a happy ending. You have to make very hard permanent choices, no matter what you choose night city will never let you win.

"[i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] is quite the dish. Of course, I had to wait for the controversy to cool down before diving into this tasty-looking treat after that tragic launch. But to be fair, I'm happy to say I enjoyed most of my meal.

There's a lot to compliment on this plate: To start, everything is so delicately detailed that it's almost like a sensory overload - you don't even know where to look first. You can see that Night City has been carefully crafted to feel as lively as possible. The vibes and atmosphere this game delivers almost feel surreally alien, yet at the same time, you can vaguely imagine our future ending up similarly to the one depicted in the game. The combat feels undeniably superb, with every aspect of it working like a charm. The motion capture and acting carrying the game are significant selling points, too. A great range of topics are also covered, including loyalty, principles, business, religion, capitalism and more. It also contains many pop culture references, which is also a massive bonus in my eyes. And, of course, the story was great, too. Everyone blaming a city and corporations for all their problems, but never themselves, is a pretty funny plot. You also get some leeway in your choices while avoiding the overwhelm of too many branching decisions in the story. However, I think I had the most fun playing the side missions.

Despite this, the gameplay doesn't have as much depth as I was expecting. By this, I mean there wasn't much variety in smaller mission types, and unique or special gameplay mechanics were very few. For all it's worth, I expected more for such a high price. Thanks to me, my friends and this game's extensive marketing, my expectations skyrocketed. Yet, it feels like you're mostly paying here for the graphics, details and, of course, [b]Keanu Reeves[/b].

Some other noteworthy thoughts include the disappointment of not being able to play purchased Braindances. I'm sure they would've been a nice addition. Another issue was the romance options. But this isn't primarily a dating simulator, so I can look the other way. However, certain characters were definitely pushed more than others. For instance, some felt like predetermined romantic interests for your character. One thing I can't ignore, though, is the fact that you can change your penis size - even though you're never gonna get to see it in action. As disheartening as this may sound, it was probably just a clever marketing gimmick. Curiously, I think this game is like a mix of [i]Grand Theft Auto[/i] and [i]Far Cry[/i] but with a futuristic and sci-fi twist. Due to this, my dad would probably have a blast with this if he could play first-person shooters.

All in all, Cyberpunk 2077 is a pretty solid game, and I can recommend it to anyone with the computational capacity to run it at max graphics and experience it in its full cyberpunk glory.",True,5,0

"Wowie, this game quickly climbed into my top 5 games of all time. Cyberpunk is the most visually immersive and one of the most detailed games I have ever played, the graphics are fantastic and the world building is something else.

It's not just simple futuristic aesthetics. I can feel the unique culture from within Night City, the different groups/gangs, the way people act, the slang they use, it all brings so much life to the world of Cyberpunk.

Now, the story is just great, along with the amazing side missions and quests and gigs and and and... and don't let me get started on the Phantom Liberty expansion, LEVELS. The characters are really great as well, so many personalities to form connections with and plus, who doesn't want to play a game along side Keanu Reeves? Not to mention Idris Elba.

Really love the weapons and different play styles this game offers, from heavy assault with the baddest guns in town, to full on melee with your sharpest katana paired with your netrunning/hacking skills, or even take a stealth approach, the choice is yours.

Character customisation is just a delight and I enjoyed creating my different people.

I also really love the different routes you can take: Nomad, Streetkid, Corpo, which offers different dialogues and can have an impact your play style if you really want to enjoy the role playing part to the fullest.

Sickness all around, I have so much more to say, but this was it for now. 100% Recommend. Also recommend the anime, Cyberpunk Edgerunners. So heartbraking and it just adds to the world of Cyberpunk. I am glad to have joined this journey and I look forward to what comes next.",True,2,0

I got this game a few years back, 2023 I think. It had taken me 3 years to buy it due to the state CD Projekt had released it in.

PL released and it took me another year to hop back on because of other releases. 
Holy. Shit. Do I wish I had played through sooner. 
2.0 is a fantastic update and by extension 2.2. Phantom Liberty? Fucking incredible. I haven't even completed the DLC yet but I needed to say a few words about it.

STUNING GAME - it is definitely what I expected after so long time of development and huge advertising. It has so much to explore like no OTHER game on the market. It does not feel LINEAR in any way. Night city is a REAL city - full of life and many different places to visit. I have never played such a good game and I hope that CD Project will make another game like this EVEN if we have to wait 5 years for that. Their imagination regarding of humans future is excellent and I strongly believe that our world will look something similar to what we can see in this game.

"[h3]Cyberpunk 2077: A Fully Realized Experience[/h3]
Cyberpunk 2077 has finally become the game it should have been from the start! The developers are still actively working on it, which is always a great sign.

Cyberpunk is truly a breathtaking and vibrant world, full of incredible detail. The number of side quests and stories is mind-blowing and adds a depth that's rarely found in other games! The main story is equally rich, packed with emotion, and filled with unforgettable characters, including the legendary Johnny Silverhand, who turns out to have a surprisingly compelling backstory.

The gameplay allows you to tackle missions however you like, whether through stealth, hacking, or action, while the RPG elements let you craft your own unique playstyle. On top of that, there are countless ways to play thanks to the various modules. The soundtrack is phenomenal, perfectly complementing this gritty and futuristic world.

What’s truly astonishing is the community's work on mods, which take the game to the next level. It enriches the experience like never before (and I highly recommend trying them).

Cyberpunk 2077 est finalement devenu le jeu qu’il aurait toujours dû être depuis longtemps ! Les développeurs continuent de travailler dessus ce qui fait toujours plaisir !
Cyberpunk est vraiment un monde magnifique et vivant, rempli de détails. Le nombres de quêtes et histoires secondaires sont bluffant et ajoute vraiment une profondeur qu'on trouve rarement dans les jeux !
L’histoire principale est aussi très riche, pleine d’émotion, et peuplée de personnages inoubliables, comme le bon vieux Johnny Silverhand qui au final est un personnage avec un beau background !

Le gameplay vous permet d’aborder les missions à votre manière, que ce soit par la furtivité, le hacking ou l’action, tandis que les éléments RPG vous permettent de façonner votre style de jeu. Vous avez aussi d'innombrable manière de jouer rien qu'avec les modules. La bande-son est phénoménale, complétant parfaitement ce monde futuriste et sombre.

Fully immersive and detailed environment -- night city it beautiful, sometimes I catch myself in awe just staring at the scenes in front of me.

Would be nice if the police system was developed better and if there were more places and people to interact with as you traveled through the city -- there are a lot of people and cars but the interactions are very shallow outside of jobs, gigs and the main story. Would be nice to have more romance options and after update 2.2, would be nice to have additional dialogue/interaction during the romancing between V and his/her partner in the apartment than the same thing over and over.

"Cyberpunk 2077 is not like many other games, at least for the first play through, maybe even the second. 

Your first play through will be filled with trying random things, having a great time, and also hearing a lot of really good dialogue and voice acting. It's going to make you want to play it again, and again, and eventually you will start to skip through it, but the gameplay still keeps you around, something keeps sucking you back in. 

Night City. That's what keeps you coming back in, once she gets her claws in you, you're never truly going to leave. Night City will chew you up, spit you out, you can rise to the highest highs, and fall to the lowest lows, experience the loss of so many people close to you. Yet you will still come back for more, just one more run, just one more build, just one more gig.

So wake up and go burn this city Samurai, burn your name into her so deeply she never forgets it. But remember, she can just as easily burn you. So in the end, whats more worth it to you?

It runs great, it looks great, it plays great, the story's great, the sandbox and worldbuilding is fantastic, the variety is there, and the DLC gives you something that feels like a separate game entirely while still being distinctly Cyberpunk. You owe it to yourself to play it.

While the launch was filled with so much bugs that it would make india look clean.

How about the fact that the world doesn't really react to your ""choices"" too much or the fact you can't join up with different gangs to get more backstory.

There is a lot of replayability here from the amount of builds you can have to some differing options depending on gender, you can become so strong that it makes far cry 2's malaria look like rat's piss in comparison

I've enjoyed almost everything about playing cyberpunk, the DLC was a crazy good story on it's own... I've had more then enough side missions and places to explore and I'm heading toward endgame with around 70+ hours of gameplay on my save file.

The game offers exceptional morally-ambiguous storytelling, immersive dystopian world-building, and extremely fun FPS gameplay. The versatility of the different cybernetic builds you can choose to focus on for combat alongside the weight of the choices you're forced to make HOOKED me into this game. Exploring Night City, engaging with the NPCs, the music, and the graphics are also amazing aspects of this game. I'd recommend getting the base game with the PL expansion as it feels like a seamless extension to the entirety of Cyberpunk. It also goes on sale frequently which is 100% worth the purchase.

A couple years later, around 2022, I got the game on sale, tried playing it, and didn't enjoy it. I ultimately refunded the game and moved on. That was until earlier last year, when I saw a lightly used copy of the game for the Xbox Series X in a gamestop for 15 bucks. I figured it was worth a shot since it was so cheap, plus having the physical media was cool.

I finally got past the ""boring"" beginning part of the game, and it opened up to be this insanely beautiful experience. I have not had this much fun playing a game in a long time. For months this was the only game I touched, and it was well worth it. Back then, I wouldn't have told you to go a mile close to the storepage, now? I can't recommend this game enough. For how emotionless the city is, and how scary the world appears to be, it's hard not to grow appreciation for V, Johnny, and all of the other people you meet that burst with color. I can't remember being so heartbroken after beating the game since RDR2. I seriously sat in my chair for a solid 30 minutes in silence to process everything. It sounds like a loser thing to do but, I seriously fell in love with the game.

While I can't blame anybody for being hesitant about buying it, they truly have polished it and turned it into what the game should've been when it released. While I can't justify the major f*ckup from CDPR, the fact that they actually fixed it instead of moving on earned them my respect for sure. Aside from that, this game is easily one of my favorite games ever. Nothing in this game was boring, at all. I've beat it once on both PS5 and XSX, and have been achievement hunting and trying to 100% the game on PC for 94 hours. You will love this game, I promise. Give it a shot.

"On launch, this was a turd at 3/10. I uninstalled and did not think about it for years. Now, after the studio rehabilitated the game, this is a masterpiece and one of the best games ever created. 10/10. The world building is stellar, the voice acting is probably one of the best you will ever get, soundtrack is unforgettable and an instant download, artwork is fantastic. This world is so real that you can escape to it after finishing the main story just to unwind. The devs are still updating and adding content, which is always interesting to check on.

Excellent writing and open world. Although there are few bugs here and there game is very enjoyable.

"It is a rare thing for a game to transcend mere entertainment and become an experience—one that leaves an imprint on your soul. There are bad games, okay games, good games, great games, and even legendary games. But then there are the few that redefine what gaming can be. The ones that, when the credits roll, leave you feeling like a part of yourself has been left behind in that world.

For years, I held Red Dead Redemption 2 in that regard—a masterpiece, an unforgettable journey. And now, after all the struggles, all the setbacks, Cyberpunk 2077 has earned its place beside it. This game had one of the most disastrous launches in history, rightfully criticized to no end. It was broken, nearly unplayable. And yet, against all odds, CD Projekt Red refused to let it die. They rebuilt it, refined it, and with Phantom Liberty, they didn’t just fix a game—they cemented a legacy.

Experiencing this world now, in its fully realized form, is nothing short of breathtaking. This isn’t just one of the best games of our time—it’s one of the greatest ever made. You do not get better than this. Thank you, CD Projekt Red, for proving that redemption is possible, that passion triumphs, and that Cyberpunk 2077 was always meant to be legendary.",True,1,0

"[h1]OVERALL 9/10 - after 1300 hours on record.[/h1]

[h3]Plot: 8/10 [/h3]
- Great storyline; some stories seem ""raw"", lack ending or variety.

[h3]Character development: 7/10 [/h3]
- Some characters are wonderful, having background stories, different attitude towards your game choices, and act naturally; some other characters appear to be too scripted or boring, lacking variety or context/background/reaction.

[h3]World: 8/10[/h3]
- Although the world is nicely made with tons of decorations and variable areas/districts, after some time the map becomes limited/repetitive, causing lost interest. Great part is that you can see the world changing around you like TV news or NPC dialogues as you progress different parts of the story.

[h3]Roleplay: 6/10[/h3]
- The game definitely has a better roleplay than some games such as ex.: Sekiro, Metro, and Red Dead Redemption 2, but it still lacks the effects of the decisions a player makes. Your actions affect the game but in such a way that allows you to not care enough most of the time and still get the benifits. 

[h3]Gameplay: 8/10[/h3]
- Physics are pleasing; amount of things you are able to do is limited but is still somewhat satisfying. 
[i]=[Possible to make it better with some mods][/i]


[h3]Variety of playstyle: 8/10[/h3]
- It is a pretty versatile game in terms of builds and playstyle you can choose. Of course it is nothing close to Skyrim, but it gives enough of combination of decisions, builds, weapons, and approach to the game to keep the interest for couple of playthroughs.

[h3]Combat: 6/10[/h3]
- Nice but terrible, to sum it up. Looks great, having some awesome finishers or skills but overall has a lot of issues such as silencers and throwables detection. 
[i]=[Some mods make it better][/i]


[h3]Optimization: 9/10[/h3]
- Game has experienced enormous amount of patches and fixes since release and considered to be optimized. Regardless of the optimization it is quite demanding of the device's performance. You are likely to experience infrequent game crashes too. 

[h3]Character customization: 7/10[/h3]
- Significant amount of variations but at the same time pretty limited too. 
[i]=[Mods help a lot][/i]


[h3]Sound: 9/10[/h3]
- Great dialogues, specifically appraise different cultures and languages present in the game in different regions; game story music is wonderful, especially V's theme and Johnny's theme; radio music is nice but feels like it lacks variety or ability to customize after you listen to it for some time.

"I won't take too long beating the same dead horse that's already been beating a 1000 times before. Unless you've been living under a rock, you know the game had a disastrous launch, you've likely heard that CDPR lied & how now it's been experiencing a massive redemption arc the past couple years. 

[h3]And yes, it's TRUE.[/h3] CDPR hid, deceived, misled and outright actively LIED about the state of the game on release, lied about features and the way systems worked in the game. What is also true is that YES, they have made insane progress attempting to redeem this game and they DID redeem the game as a product if you can separate experience from the scummy/lying practices they exhibited 4 years ago.

[h3]If you can get past the past and focus on what the game offers you now, you're going to get one of the most technically impressive and impacting experiences you'll have in a long time. It's really an extraordinary game now. Now, let's focus on the actual review:[/h3]

[b]Positives:[/b]

1) Flat out, the game has what is in my opinion, at MINIMUM Top 5 writing for a video game ever. CDPR's unbelievably talent in this department only has gotten better and these guys ACED it here. The game understands and respects the power of immersion and goes the extra mile with all the small details. When the game sucks you in, you are IN.

2) Visually, it absolutely is as stunning as everyone has said it is. Top 3 all time from a graphical standpoint for me personally. From the under the hood technical capabilities of the game's lighting and fidelity, but also from the handcrafted world. It's constantly stunning at every step of the journey.

3) Really enjoyable and varied approaches to game-play with several different ways to build your character & approach objectives. It's also got that classic Morrowind feel where the game will let you become comically OP if you so choose. It won't restrict you. Wanna take a fast paced, physical melee approach, jumping over buildings and dashing at lightning speed in-between enemies?  You can. Wanna be a stealth operator, covertly subverting security systems, utilizing an arsenal of tools to avoid detection and taking out enemies with silent, precise strikes? You can. Wanna be an over the top, godlike net-runner who can drop every enemy in a building before even stepping foot in it? You can.

[b]Negatives:[/b]

1) The game world, while aesthetically, one of the best looking I've ever played, can sometimes feel a bit static & lacking in interactivity. There isn't a ton of interactivity and if you're coming from something like a Rockstar game world and expecting the same here, you won't get that.

2) The traffic is unfortunately still kinda horrible lol. The AI for drivers randomly just breaks and cars will just stop and stay stopped in the middle of the road and at stoplights. They've advertised that police chases are now fixed but honestly, it's still extremely underwhelming. You can be in the slowest of cars and instantly lose pursuers with basically zero resistance once you get a few streets away from the scene of the crime.

[h3]EXTRA: Also will shout out here, that Phantom Liberty, the expansion for the game takes all the positives of this game and basically DOUBLES it. Honestly the best content in the game and a must buy.[/h3]",True,1,0

"The most immersive video game world I've ever experienced. There is no reason to not at least try it out.

Version 2.2 is CDPR at its peak. Shame that the game didn't release in this state in the first place, however the path towards it at least shows that they are willing to make a product they're proud of. Hopefully CDPR will continue to create great games in the Cyberpunk universe, just with an acceptable launch this time, now that they have a working baseline for the game.

"Before this game, I was simply running with the edgers. By the end, I was edging with the runners. Words can not express how much punk my cyber was doing as I punched the final boss to death. The only way this game could be better is if they added the entirety of the North American continent so I can continue my edging streak all across America.

"A while ago, I pre-ordered this game on PlayStation. At release, the experience was pretty bad.
But over time, many people said the developers did a great job fixing the game.
So, I decided to buy it again along with Phantom Liberty. And the difference was like day and night (in version 2.2). The gameplay was butter-smooth, and I didn’t experience any bugs.

I almost finished the main campaign and jumped into the DLC—everything was great.
But then version 2.21 was released.

Now, the game feels just like it did at launch. LODs don’t load correctly, so NPCs look like they have about 40 polygons and no animations—they just float around. But the worst part? After every quick load, at some point, the game enters extreme slow motion (x1000) and eventually crashes. Every quest now crashes the game at some point (I’m currently stuck on Auto Fixer). Roads disappear constantly, and I just sit there waiting for the game to crash after 5–10 minutes (I can’t even bring up Task Manager to force-quit).

I’m just amazed at how a tiny patch can ruin everything and bring the game back to its release state.

"TL;DR: 8/10, buy on sale

Pro:
+++ [spoiler]Sex with Judy[/spoiler]
++ [spoiler] You can make friend with a Vendor Machine [/spoiler]
++ Immersive story, engaging characters, and a well-designed map make Night City a joy to explore
+ Main story's a bit short, but there's a shitload of side quests to keep you busy.
+ It offers a wide range of choices when it comes to weapons and skill trees, allowing you to tailor your playstyle - whether that's stealth, gunplay, or melee combat.
+ It has amazing Mod support, extending the game's replay value.


Con:
-- Driving still SUCKS (at least for me). It feels like ice skating in a car - slippery, unresponsive, and completely lacking in weight or traction. It's a disappointment, especially since driving is such a big part of the game.
- Optimization is still subpar. I've encountered some game freezes and lag, particularly when entering crowded areas.


I think CDPR kinda redeem themselves after all these years of effort on Cyberpunk 2077, but it's still far away the game they promised in the first place. The current full price might be a bit steep for some players. Grab it on sale, and you'll likely feel like you've gotten your money's worth.

"It's unfortunate that many people were turned off by Cyberpunk 2077 because of its rough launch. I played it for the first time about two years after its release, following the 2.0 update, and aside from a couple of minor visual bugs, the experience has been incredible.

What immediately stood out to me was the game’s world because it’s simply the best I’ve ever played. Night City is not just visually stunning with its neon aesthetic, but it feels alive. Driving through the streets, taking in in the vibrant atmosphere, is an experience I'm sure you'll enjoy.

With the addition of the Phantom Liberty DLC, the game now offers two main story lines, both of which are fantastic. They've got well-developed characters and, most importantly, feature epic and emotional moments that make the story unforgettable.

The combat feels amazing, especially in the late game, where you can dominate enemies with ease after getting strong weapons and cyberware. However, the difficulty curve can be a bit uneven because you start off feeling weak, but by the end, you’re almost too strong, especially against some bosses.

Even after 125 hours in this game, I plan on coming back to try out different life paths and, more importantly, to make different decisions and see the new endings I can get. Admittedly, replaying the intro and going through the same early events can feel a bit tedious, but I’m still excited to dive back in. Plus, there are mods available that let you skip the intro if you really want to.

Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 has truly become a classic in my eyes, and I have to shout out my bro, Johnny Silverhand. If you haven’t played the game or revisited it since the 2.0 update, I can confidently say it’s 100% worth giving it a shot, as is the Phantom Liberty DLC. While it might not change your life, it will definitely leave a lasting impression and keep you coming back for more.

"A Masterpiece of Storytelling and Immersion

Cyberpunk 2077 is a stunning achievement that sets a new benchmark for immersive gaming experiences. From its richly detailed open-world setting to its compelling narrative, this game delivers on multiple levels, making it a must-play for RPG enthusiasts and fans of futuristic storytelling alike.

World-Building and Atmosphere
Night City feels alive in every sense of the word. The attention to detail is phenomenal—neon-lit skyscrapers, bustling streets, and the layered history of its districts create a world that feels authentic and immersive. The city is not just a backdrop; it's a character in itself, brimming with life, danger, and intrigue.

Storytelling and Characters
The narrative is a standout feature. Cyberpunk 2077 offers a gripping story with deep, complex characters that leave a lasting impression. V’s journey, shaped by your choices, feels personal and impactful. The performances—especially Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand—are top-notch, adding depth and emotional weight to the story.

Gameplay and Customization
The gameplay is incredibly engaging, blending fast-paced action with RPG mechanics. The freedom to customize your playstyle—be it stealth, hacking, or all-out combat—ensures that no two playthroughs are the same. The array of cybernetic enhancements and weaponry offers endless possibilities for experimentation.

Visuals and Audio
Visually, Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece. The lighting, textures, and attention to small details make Night City a visual feast. The soundtrack is equally impressive, perfectly complementing the cyberpunk aesthetic with its pulsating beats and atmospheric tracks.

Post-Launch Improvements
CD Projekt Red's commitment to improving the game post-launch deserves recognition. The updates have not only addressed initial issues but have also enhanced the overall experience, adding new features, content, and improved performance.

Conclusion
Cyberpunk 2077 is more than just a game; it's an experience. With its incredible storytelling, immersive world, and engaging gameplay, it stands as a testament to what ambitious game development can achieve. If you haven’t visited Night City yet, now is the perfect time.

"All things considered, the way this game launched is worthy of all the negative technical criticism surrounding it. However what was not technical is absolute gold. The city, the atmosphere, the ambient music, the radio music, the score, the characters, the writing, all of it was genuinely trendsetting and puts most open world games released in its wake to shame. It's been 4 years of updates and DLC, and I think it's pretty telling that this game still pulls numbers today. I'm playing through it now and falling in love with the world again, nothing in the gaming landscape comes close to replicating the feeling of reading Neuromancer and the ambient calm of Blade Runner (in certain parts; all things considered this game is diametrically opposed to the tone and style of BR).

"Across gaming platforms, I have over 800 hours in cyberpunk. Finished Phantom Liberty tonight after choosing reed in firestarter. I never write serious reviews, only jokey comments. But CDPR have created the greatest game, and potentially the greatest fictional story-line, of all time. take that with no pinches of salt, and as no exaggeration. Red Dead Redemption 2, widely considered as one of the best story games ever - to which I used to agree to be the number 1 - has absolutely nothing on this piece of writing. Love, Betrayal, Redemption, Hope, Evil, Lies, and genuine feelings. To complete a story like that is heart-breaking - gut wrenching if you will, but to complete it and then have that song play? with that piano? and that background visual of Myers and Hansen? Poetry. This review will end up in a tiktok talking about how the writer waffles about a game. But this isn't a game, its a fucking film, where you can blow someone up from blinking every so often. This game is so completely unrealistic, yet so realistic that it appears as a warning. 

Not only have CDPR put out the greatest composition of human emotion in the form of audio and visuals, but the comeback that came with it?? I was driving the bandwagon of C2077 haters in 2020. I quit the game after the braindance tutorial. I got a noti for 2.0 Update and tried it again. I will never be the same

🔹 Incredible Storytelling: The main narrative and side quests are top-tier, packed with emotional depth, memorable characters, and tough choices that actually matter.
🔹 Vibrant Open World: Night City feels alive—neon-lit streets, bustling markets, shady back alleys—every district has its own personality.
🔹 Deep RPG Elements: Perks, cyberware, and builds feel meaningful, allowing for a playstyle that fits YOU. Want to be a stealthy netrunner? A cyber-enhanced brawler? A gunslinging merc? The choice is yours.
🔹 Combat & Driving Overhaul (2.0 Update): Gunplay feels snappier, melee is brutal, and driving is finally smooth and responsive (with actual police chases!).
🔹 Phantom Liberty Expansion: If you love spy thrillers and action-packed missions, this DLC is an absolute must. Idris Elba’s performance is phenomenal!

Yes, Cyberpunk 2077 had its flaws at launch, but what matters is where it is now—a breathtaking, gripping, and polished RPG that truly delivers on its promise. If you were hesitant before, NOW is the perfect time to jump in.

The Story is amazing, the NPCs have so much personality and are unique and you just have to love them! I cared deeply for the side-quests. Even though I normally get burned out rather fast in other games when it comes to optional content, I simply had to help these people. No burnout in sight!

You can customize your version of V however you want, being able to change your mind almost at any point! And due to that, the replayability is also very great in my opinion 

A must try for anyone who likes well written characters, a (intentionally) messy and beautiful world and a game to completely lose yourself in <3",True,1,0
"[h3] The love of gaming and respect for players, congratulations LCD Project. [/h3]


[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]
Two particularly important things to say about Cyberpunk 2077.

1: It's been a very long time since I've been so sad to finish a game.
This game is fantastic, the story is perfect and, in my opinion, Cyberpunk is in the same category as Mass Effect.
It's evidence that today's devs can still make games the old- style way. Devs who neglect single-player games in favor of multiplayer, such as Call of, should take a lesson from Cyberpunk.
There's never been a Call of to rival Cyberpunk.
I could hate Cyberpunk because this universe makes me nauseous, the model of what the world can become if we don't fight against all this wokist ideology and other leftist stupidity.
But it's not disturbing to evolve in this universe, because this game is in no way wokist.
We have a choice of road(Nomad, Corpo...) from the start of the game, and choosing one is already a sign of the fight against Wokist ideology.
We can fight this ideology, the degenerate universe we're stuck in, by choosing what we want to be and who we want to follow.

2:I'm going to close this interlude on the wokism that's destroying gaming right now by telling you about the second thing that I think is great about Cyberpunk.
Character creation: it may come as a surprise to talk about this for a gamer of my generation, since I belong to the free generation, the one that saw the possibility of creating a character that suits us.
But today, creation is undermined by this wokist ideology that wants everything to be for them, and like them, we no longer see many games in which we have the freedom to be what we want to be.
This also shows LCD Project's talent, as it's not easy to offer this option in a game, as it requires a lot of work.
Allowing us to create our own character isn't incredible, but it's a nice sign of respect.
LCD Project respects us, they respect who we are even if we don't have the same ideas as them, the same taste or the same orientation, that's not saying much but in this wokized world it's wonderful.
THANK YOU !!!

The choices:
Choices have a real importance in this game, I've never felt such importance in the choices I made during the game and especially at the end.
I remained true to my choices throughout the game, and I'm a very tough person who always assumes his choices and his positions, but in this game I suffered for my choices, despite that I assume them and I don't want to change them.
I never thought a game could make me feel something so strong, offer so much freedom in our decisions and have so much impact on our evolution in the game.
Sorry, Johnny.

I'd also like to talk about gunfighting, because that's also something fabulous about this game.
The weapons are wonderful, there's something for every taste, and those who know me well can well imagine that I went there with my big machine gun.
But in Cyberpunk I fell in love with shotguns, and I boosted my character for ultra-fast reloading because there are only two bullets in my toy.
Two bullets with ultra-high damage, it hurts, I shoot in all directions in close combat, enemies do backflips and scatter all over the ground, I'm totally ecstatic.
It's even better than my cock.

See you in 2078!!!

[h1] Graphic design: [/h1]
Today, the game is bug-free and never lags with my configuration.
I'd expected the map to be bigger, but the work really is of the highest quality.
LCD Project has done an excellent job.

[h1] Playtime: [/h1]
100 hours to finish the story mode with all the sub-missions, it's fabulous, this game is worth its price and really deserves to be bought and played.


[h3] I hope that LCD Project doesn't sink any further into wokist ideology, and that they continue to amaze us with their talent.
Let us be what we want to be, love us as we are and we'll love you for what you give us. [/h3]

"Cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing game that fully delivers on its promise of an immersive, futuristic RPG experience. From its stunning open world to its engaging gameplay and memorable characters, everything comes together in a way that makes it one of the best games I’ve played.

World & Atmosphere – Night City is Incredible
The world is absolutely breathtaking. Night City feels alive, with insane attention to detail, neon-lit streets, and a dark, dystopian atmosphere that pulls you in completely. Exploring the world is pure joy, whether you’re driving through the city or sneaking through high-tech buildings.

Story & Characters – A Strong Narrative
The main story is fantastic, with plenty of twists, emotional moments, and tough decisions. V is a great protagonist, and their story is engaging from start to finish. Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) adds a unique dynamic, and his interactions with V are a highlight of the game.

The side characters are well-written, with standout moments from Panam, Judy, River, and Rogue. Side quests don’t feel like filler—they add depth to the world and its inhabitants, making every interaction feel meaningful.

Gameplay – Fun and Engaging
The combat is excellent—gunplay feels great, hacking adds depth, and cyberware upgrades allow for tons of customization. Whether you prefer stealth, brute force, or a mix of both, the game lets you approach missions however you want.

Driving feels smooth, and exploring Night City never gets old. The RPG mechanics are well-done, with a good balance of progression, skill upgrades, and gear customization.

Final Thoughts – A Must-Play
Despite its rough launch, Cyberpunk 2077 has been polished into an excellent RPG. The world, story, and gameplay all come together to make an immersive and unforgettable experience. If you love open-world games with deep storytelling and exciting gameplay, this is definitely worth playing.

A fantastic game, and one I highly recommend!",True,2,0

"Cyberpeak 2077 - Das beste Story-Game, was ich jemals gespielt habe!

Ja, das Spiel ist katastrophal gelauncht, aber dieses Review bezieht sich auf den Jetzt-Zustand auf PC und das GAME IST GEFIXXT.

Cyberpunk überzeugt mit seiner herausragenden Optik. Die Leuchreklamen, die Werbung, das Setting und vor allem die hohe Anzahl an NPCs lassen die Stadt (Night City) lebendig erscheinen. Es ist bemerkenswert, wie CD Projekt es geschafft hat, eine First-Person-City so massiv rüberkommen zu lassen. Man fühlt sich wirklich wie in einer dystopischen, futuristischen Megastadt, in der die Corps mehr Macht als Behörden oder Regierungen haben. Ein Grafikspektakel, das es so definitiv noch nicht gegeben hat. Die Welt so detailliert und immersiv, dass man sich wie ein Zeitzeuge vorkommt, wobei die Performance nicht schlecht ist. Die Werbung, die quasi überall zu finden ist, beinhaltet geilen Erwachsenenhumor und scheint darzustellen, wo wir uns als Gesellschaft hinbewegen. Im Allgemeinen ist das Setting von Cyberpunk sehr interessant. Dynamisches Wetter und vor Allem das Night-Life machen das Spiel nochmals atmosphärischer.

Night City ist nicht einfach nur eine dahingeklatschte Stadt, sondern hat Struktur. Es gibt verschiedene Viertel, in denen man verschiedene Leute antrifft. Pacifica ist zwar paradisisch, jedoch traut sich dort kein Polizist hin und es herrscht pures Chaos. Verlassene Shopping Malls, Skyscraper usw. Am Copo Plaza leben die Konzerner, die Reichen. Wolkenkratzer, fliegene Taxis und große Straßen. Die Badlands, eine Wüste, die Night City umgibt, ist voller Normaden und Plünderer, die die Menschen bedrohen. Jeder einzelne Distrikt ist verschieden und hat viel Neues zum Entdecken.

Es gibt so viel zutun, so viele Anpassungsmöglichkeiten. Das fängt schon bei den äußerlichen Merkmalen der Charaktererstellung an, wo man wirklich alles (auch das Genital) beliebig anpassen kann. Eine quasi unendlich große Auswahl an Kleidungsstile. Außerdem kann man sich mehrere Wohnungen (von billiig bis zu hoch luxuriös) kaufen und immer wieder Neues entdecken. Ein Porsche in Night City um 2077? - Gibt es, in gleich zwei Varianten und noch viele andere Autos. Genial ist auch, dass man diese zu jeder Zeit zu sich rufen kann (Taste V). Wer aber von langem Fahren aus GTA5 genervt ist, wird hier seinen Spaß haben, da es Quick-Travel gibt.

Hacken ist einfach nur grandios und simple gelöst. Man kann Gegner entweder leise und auffällig umbringen oder mit viel Aufruhr. Die ""Quickhacks"" sind einfach zu verstehen und es gibt so viele von ihnen, dass ich auch nach 70h immer noch nicht alle kenne. Autos kontrollieren, Gegner zum Suizid ""hacken"" und Granaten über gehackte Kameras aktivieren. Man kann seine Quickhacks erweitern und modifzieren. Waffen und Granaten gibt es auch ohne Ende. 

Bei den sogenannten Ripperdocs kann man seinen Körper anpassen und upgraden, wodurch man Fähigkeiten wie Double Jump oder Klingen statt Fäuste freischalten kann. Das Kämpfen ist also super individuell und fördert dutzende Spielstile. Looten kann man mögen oder nicht, aber das Lootsystem in diesem Spiel ist einfach nur perfekt. Allgemein ist die Menüführung extrem einfach und man findet sich schnell zurecht.

Der Skill-Tree ist einer der komplexesten, die ich je gesehen habe, was aber gut ist. Man hat verschiedene Bereiche, auf die man seinen Charakter leveln kann. So z.B. Hacken, Weaponhandling oder Movement. Jeder Bereich beinhaltet um die 30 Upgrades, die man frei wählen kann. Es gibt aber auch Upgrades, die man durch reines Spielen freischaltet und nicht auswählen kann.

Es gibt viele Dinge, die man in der Open-World tun kann. Bars, Clubs, JoyToys (xD), Autorennen, Verbrecherjagden und vieles mehr.

Nun zu dem, was das Spiel zu einem wirklichen Meisterwerk macht: Die Charaktere und die Story

Die Charaktere sind tiefgreifend und jeder hat seine eigene Story, die nahezu perfekt übermittelt wird. Sie haben Emotionen in Form von Mimik und Gestik, die man in kaum einem Spiel erlebt. Das Interagieren mit den Charakteren ist ebenfalls sehr gängig gestaltet und ruft verschiedene Reaktionen hervor. Humor, Ernsthaftigkeit und Bezüge zu vorher Passiertem machen die Konversationen lebendig und unterhaltsam. Vor allem die Charaktere Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves), Jackie und Panam sind perfekt geschriebene Charaktere, die einen durch die Story begleiten.

Die Story ist das Herzstück des Spiels. Sie ist komplex, aber dennoch gut verständlich, wenn man gut aufpasst. Anders als in vielen anderen Spielen ist die Story jedoch nicht vorhersehbar, was einen sowohl schocken als auch faszinieren kann. Es gibt verschiede Anfänge der Story und verschiedene Wege, wie die Story endet. Das Auge fürs Detail hatten die Entwickler. So unterhalten sich NPCs über Geschehnisse, die durch die Story in NC passiert sind und auch Narichtensender, die man in jedem Fahrstuhl unausweichlich hört, thematisieren Story Relevantes.

Man kann Side-Gigs machen, die einen mehr in das Stadtleben eindringen lassen. Auch Nebenmissionen mit eigenen Charakteren gibt es, die sowohl spannend sind als auch dazu beitragen, die Welt von 2077 zu verstehen.

Was ich auch bemerkenswert finde, ist die Synchro, sowohl auf Deutsch als auch auf Englisch. Man erkennt auf beiden Sprachen viele bekannte Synchronsprecher. Das Auge fürs Detail ist nicht nur bei der Story mit an Bord, sondern auch, wenn es um Easter Eggs, die sich auf CD Projects Spiele wie Witcher 3 beziehen, geht.

Alles in Allem für mich ein 10/10 Game, da das Setting und die Story fesselnd und einzigartig sind, die Welt von 2077 quasi unendlich lange erkundbar ist und die Charaktere. 
Absolute Kaufempfehlung, vor allem, wenn es im Sale ist. 

Das ist das Geld, jeden Euro, wert, sofern man Open-World Story Games mag. Ein vergleichbares Spiel, mit einer immersiveren Welt und tiefgreifenderen Charakteren gibt es einfach noch nicht.",True,2,0

"Wow, what a game! Just about everything in this game is spot on the way I like my games to be. First of all, it ran flawlessly and I never had a single crash. There was on part of the story early on that had a bug, and its documented. I had to change a few graphics settings to get through it, but luckily it never happened again. 99% of the game is flawless.
The audio in the game is great, I played it on dolby 5.1 on my Yamaha receiver. The graphics are very impressive. It took me a bit to get the HDR set right, but other than that I got a good average fps of about 85 to 90 played on my 3440x1440 UWS using my rtx 3080ti. It looked wonderful. Ultra wide screen was done great. I didnt pick up on any artifacts like stretched screen with that.
The story is great, and the voice acting is decent. Of course Keanu Reeves is in it and he has a major role in it. His voice is all through the game as well as his likeness. The DLC is well worth the price, if you get this game be sure to purchase that as well. I think there are alternate endings to this, and I liked mine ok. The ending was realistic and satisfying because of that. 
If you like role playing games that focus on the story then this is a game for you. The gameplay itself is really fun too. Its got a good amount of cutscenes, but there is plenty of free roaming in the city and lots of side quests. I played every quest there was I think, and got 148 hours out of the game. Its well worth what you spend.",True,1,0

"[h1] Review: Cyberpunk 2077 - A place where all kinds of people meet [/h1]
2020 | played time: 112 hours | 8/10 

Cyberpunk 2077 is a very story-centric role-play game based on a tabletop role-playing game from the late 1980s. It is developed and published by CD Project Red which pulls you into a potential dystopian future of our world.

The game begins in one of three variants in the year 2076 depending on the background choice made for V, the protagonist, in the character creation. The first act begins with V working as a mercenary in Night City. However, after working a few gigs life takes an unexpected turn. In the second act, V is hit by the reality of the aftermath of the preceding act and tries his best to survive. 
The story of V progresses through the main story missions and a vast number of optional side quests in the open world. The relating cutscenes and dialogues are mostly set within the open world creating immersion, however waiting for a quest to start at the given location can feel disruptive. The side quests also include options to have romantic affiliations with some characters depending on the gender and sexual orientation of the protagonist. Night City is traversed by V in first person, by different means of transport such as by foot or in vehicles. The latter has an unusually unnatural handling to it. The fighting system seems rather unrealistic in a game with an immersive intent where one shot to the head does not result in immediate death of either V or some enemies. One the other hand, this would make certain play styles such melee builds unviable. Cyberpunk 2077 invites to capture moments by providing a photo mode. The world provides several apartments, and looting is possible at almost every corner. However, a missing survival system makes the apartments and most of the lootable consumables close to obsolete. 
Cyberpunk 2077 can be modified which is made very accessible through third-party mod-menus. These modifications offer extensive possibilities to improve graphics and visuals, immersion and quality of life, or simply adding assets such as cars.
The world is created with a lot of attention to detail though the huge size of Night City and the vastness of the Badlands. The city and the surroundings can be explored by various modes of travel such as by foot, with the metro or with vehicles. The latter have a unique and unordinary futuristic design due to the view of the late 1980s. The city captures the feeling of a de facto corporatocracy and the power of corporation through the many towering skyscrapers and other buildings. The 3-dimensional possibilities of such building by using balconies, bridges and other levels reachable through elevators are well explored though substantial potential in this area is left untapped. Night City offers a huge variety of places including bars and other vendors which can be explored. A short fall is that not every street vendor is interactable by the protagonist. Completely missing but essential in a city of this size are supermarkets and at least one proper mall. Though there are several markets which are a substitute for the latter. The city offers different districts, each with a unique style and architecture reflecting the different socio-economic backgrounds living there. However, the gradient between districts can feel noticeably abrupt. The world experiences different weathers such as rainfall or fog. Analog to the previous aspect, the weather changes in the game are also very abrupt. Although the map is beautifully created, the slope changes in hilly areas are jaggy and some on- and off-ramps are unrealistically steep. While walking around in back alleys, piles of garbage can be found. However, due to the solid design of the assets any disturbance in the arrangement of the piles results in a hail of garbage bags.
The sound is very neatly designed. As such stepping on different materials makes different sounds. The immersion is furthered by having sounds for moving glass bottles and cans. The sound design of the vehicles is very well made. The radio and the music selection offer a good variety and various genres. All the characters’ voice actors did an astounding job capturing the emotions of the characters. Unfortunately, very noticeable is the sudden high-pitched detection sound which is played upon detection by an enemy while stealthing ripping the player out of the immersion.
Overall, the game is nicely balanced from a graphics point of view. Though the resolution of the textures and the fidelity of the assets are below the expectation of a game released in 2020. Additionally, though pleasing for the eye, the color grading is rather warm which is a mismatch for a dystopian futuristic megacity. Furthermore, the contrast in the game is tuned a bit too high resulting in an unrealistic feeling. Fortunately, modifications to adjust the postprocessing filters exist to remedy these shortcomings.
The main story of Cyberpunk 2077 is structured into three acts including a prologue, interlude and epilogue. Most notably, the storyline is anything but railroaded. As such a huge amount of optional side quests are available forming V’s story in Night City. The order for the parallel running side storylines is mostly irrelevant giving the sensation of immersion in the world and actually living the life of V. Also noticeable is the feeling of impact of the decisions that need to be made in the life of V and the related events and people. News coverage of world events also increases immersion and the sensation of living in Night City. Unfortunately, due to this setup, the urgency of progression created by certain events is disregarded and minorly breaks the logic of the plot. However, time is still given the due significance by having waiting times between quests and forcing the player to explore the world. 

Cyberpunk 2077 is a must play for any singleplayer roleplay game enthusiast. It offers a great and very immersive experience. The story offers a lot of freedom in decisions all affecting the outcome in some way. Graphically, the game is not up to par with other titles released in that year. But the story and the world design are worth overlooking the minor flaws the game has.",True,3,0

"Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that, every time I opened it, hit every dopamine and serotonin receptor. I was completely immersed in a world full of dystopian complexities, rebellion against the system, and characters who, whether bound by friendship, love, or pure hatred, all leave their mark on Night City. Some forge deep connections, others clash violently, but in the end, every action—every presence—shapes the world around them.

If you enjoyed Watch Dogs 2 or Mirror’s Edge, you’d understand that I’m a sucker for kinship-core themes. The way the world and its characters interact isn’t about heroes or villains—it’s just survival in a world of moral absurdity. If visualized, it would look like a Jackson Pollock painting—chaotic, layered, and unpredictable.

Running along that edge, you witness the beauty and tragedy of those who push themselves to the brink—some reaching glory, others barely scratching it before falling. In Night City, it’s common practice to live off poisons—sex, drugs, anything to numb the pain or slip away from a world that no longer feels like home. A world already claimed by others, where your misfortune is just another commodity to exploit.

The edge is the only way to truly live—and to die. But those who die loud enough, those who burn bright before they fade, become more than just memories. They become legends. They are the sparks that ignite humanity’s resistance to oppression, the embers that refuse to be snuffed out.

And that, to me, is mesmerizing—or dare I say, breathtaking.",True,1,0
"Cyberpunk 2077 Review

🟡 Introduction

I bought Cyberpunk 2077 a year after its release in 2021, and at that stage, the game was in a rough state due to numerous bugs, performance issues, and missing mechanics that could have enhanced the experience. However, despite these issues, I still found enjoyment in the base game, which offered an incredible story and engaging missions. Over time, as updates improved the game, I grew to appreciate it even more. With the release of the Phantom Liberty DLC and the influence of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the game has transformed into a truly immersive cyberpunk experience that finally delivers on its original promise.

🔵 Story & Worldbuilding

The narrative of Cyberpunk 2077 is one of its strongest elements. Playing as V, a mercenary trying to make a name in Night City, you get entangled in a high-stakes conspiracy after implanting a bio-chip containing the consciousness of Johnny Silverhand, portrayed by Keanu Reeves. The story is deeply engaging, with multiple branching paths that allow players to shape V's fate. The emotional weight of the story varies based on choices, making each playthrough unique.

The side quests are just as compelling as the main story, often surpassing it in terms of emotional depth and character development. Quests like Sinnerman and Dream On showcase the philosophical and ethical dilemmas that define cyberpunk fiction. Meeting various characters, from rogue AI to rebellious cyberpunks, makes every interaction meaningful. The romances in the game add another layer of depth, with Judy, Panam, River, and Kerry each offering distinct and well-written relationship arcs.

🌆 Night City is a well-crafted setting that offers plenty to explore. Each district—from the neon-lit streets of Japantown to the corporate-controlled City Center—feels distinct. Random events, like cyber psycho encounters or gang skirmishes, make the city feel unpredictable. The small touches, like hearing snippets of NPC conversations or seeing braindance advertisements on giant billboards, add to the immersion.

🔴 Gameplay & Mechanics

Cyberpunk 2077 blends first-person shooter mechanics with deep RPG elements. The combat system allows players to approach fights in different ways: hacking enemies as a netrunner, going full-on melee with Mantis Blades, or using brute firepower to tear through enemies. The gunplay has significantly improved with patches, making combat feel more responsive and satisfying.

The hacking mechanics are a highlight, allowing for creative approaches to combat. Players can disable cameras, detonate grenades remotely, or even force enemies to commit suicide. Sandevistan builds offer another playstyle, slowing down time for deadly precision strikes, making you feel like a cybernetic samurai. Each playstyle is viable, offering a range of tactical depth that was initially missing at launch.

🚗 Vehicle Combat & Driving: The driving mechanics were one of the weakest aspects of the original release but have been improved considerably. Vehicle combat, added in later updates, allows for high-speed chases and shootouts, adding more excitement to the world.

🟣 Character Creation & Customization

The character creation in Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most detailed in modern RPGs. Players can choose their gender, voice, and physical appearance, allowing for full customization of V. The inclusion of trans characters and non-binary customization options makes Cyberpunk 2077 stand out in terms of representation. The ability to modify cyberware further expands customization, letting players build a truly unique version of V.

👗 Transmog System: The transmog system, added post-launch, is a fantastic improvement. It allows players to wear any outfit while keeping the best armor stats, solving the issue of mismatched clothing that plagued the launch version. This feature enhances both immersion and style, allowing players to dress V according to their personal vision.

🟢 Phantom Liberty DLC & Edgerunners Influence

The Phantom Liberty DLC is a game-changer, bringing in new mechanics, improved AI, and an engaging spy-thriller storyline. It adds Dogtown, a district filled with political intrigue, espionage, and high-stakes missions. The new characters, especially Solomon Reed, add more layers to V’s journey. The choices made in Phantom Liberty feel weighty, impacting the core narrative in meaningful ways.

Beyond the DLC, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners left a lasting impact on the game’s identity. The anime expanded the lore of Night City and introduced unforgettable characters like David Martinez and Rebecca. The game now includes references to Edgerunners, such as weapons and clothing from the show, deepening the connection between both mediums. Finding Rebecca’s shotgun in the game is a fun nod to fans of the anime, making it feel like an integral part of the Cyberpunk universe.

🟠 Modding Community & Enhancements

One of the most exciting aspects of Cyberpunk 2077 is the modding scene. The game’s support for mods allows players to fine-tune and expand their experience beyond what CD Projekt Red offers. With over 300+ mods installed, I can confidently say that modding makes the game exponentially better.

From quality-of-life improvements to entirely new gameplay mechanics, modding lets players tailor the game to their preferences. Mods enhance clothing variety, improve AI behavior, add new weapons, and even introduce new districts or quests. While it might seem odd that modding is needed to polish certain aspects of the game, it truly elevates Cyberpunk 2077 beyond its vanilla state.

🏆 Final Thoughts

Despite its disastrous launch, Cyberpunk 2077 has evolved into a masterpiece of sci-fi RPG storytelling. With the Phantom Liberty DLC and continuous updates, the game is finally what it was meant to be. The deep character interactions, expansive world, and improved mechanics make it a must-play for fans of the cyberpunk genre. While some issues remain, such as occasional AI quirks and underdeveloped side activities, the overall experience is phenomenal.

If you’re new to Cyberpunk 2077, now is the perfect time to dive in. Whether you're exploring Night City as a cunning netrunner, a ruthless solo, or a corporate infiltrator, the game offers something for everyone.

"Very good game that made a ""No Mans Sky tier"" redemption. Not only is the game mostly bug free, but since 2.2 and PL, there has been so much added content, and much needed refinement of gameplay systems. The end result is that progression feels better, both in terms of character levels/skills and weapons/cyberware upgrades.

I highly recommend this game for the amazing & relatable characters, believable & awesome story, and even the side quests are interesting. Seriously, you won't find any standard fetch quests here. Everything is voice acted and well thought out.

I put 90 hours into my first characters playthrough, finishing about 75% of the content available; including all main quests from base game and PL, most side quests, but not many gigs or fixer jobs. My second playthrough on Steam I plan to complete every gig and side job.

Cyberpunk 2077 also has a great modding scene, including all types of mods from QoL updates, to complete overhauls.

What are you waiting for choom? Don't be a gonk and miss out on this S tier game!",True,1,0
"Following all of the updates, this is now the 7/10 it was always meant to be. Gorgeous game, interesting world design, fun characters, basic gameplay - wish it was either more like an im-sim or more like New Vegas in its quest design. 

Phantom Liberty is 8/10.",True,1,1
"Beautiful and dense open world, interesting story and characters, fast-paced and visceral combat (unless you prefer stealth, which can also be fun). Lots of replay value as well with dozens of side quests and smaller encounters, which can get repetitive but are still varied, with added lore and storytelling, adding character to the world.
The skill trees accommodate a number of different play styles which, in addition to cyberware and weapon types, allow for interesting build crafting, again adding replay value.

I bought the game after Update 2.1 and my experience was mostly bug-free, although I have had some bosses freeze during fights... other than that, I think this is a very good game and by the looks of it, much better now than at launch.",True,1,1
"This game turned into something incredible. Imagine this in 2020, that would be a blast... Can't believe that the word ""optimization"" could be finally associated with this game.

"Cyberpunk 2077 is far and away one of the most intricately detailed open-world action RPGs ever created, if not the most. It's atomic complexity in both systems and storytelling is matched only by the energy of its moment-to-moment gameplay. The writing far outweighs genre standards, and even the studio's iconic previous outings. This is an incredibly special piece of media; something that could have only been created in the here and now, under specific circumstances by an extremely talented team. 

With 4 years of improvements and an enormous DLC under its belt, I'm so glad I finally decided to see what Night City has to offer. It's an experience I won't soon forget.",True,1,0

"[h1] game of the millenia [/h1]

I bought the deluxe version of this game off of amazon for 25$ back in 2021 and although the bugs were terrible and the frame rate and overall optimization of the game was terrible, the story had me so immersed into the world, i'd never been so interested in a story until i played this, I love all the fun weird weapons in the game and all the cyberware, vehicles and clothing fit right into the universe, I absolutely loved each character and all the twists and turns that the game had to offer, i was so glad to hear that the game was finally getting fixed and that there was a new dlc coming out, on that note the dlc was phenomenal, i love idris elba so i was bound to like his character and it was well deserved I think, I always was interested in the way this game dealt with concepts like rogue ai and cyberspace and this continues to open up that world even more in a way thats both scary and cool at the same time and also *spoilers* [spoiler] the part in the dlc with the rogue ai controlled robot hunting you down like it's alien isolation was my favorite moment ever from that dlc [/spoiler] but back to the main game, the story of cyberpunk is amazing, it is both tragic and beautiful, it's tone and themes explored across the game are always so interesting and usually are always leaving you with more questions than answers, which I think grounds our charcater really well, showing us that there's always something bigger going on in the background, this game can be scary, leaving you shocked at the mission you just played or it can be emotional, sometimes its the funniest shit you've ever seen and I believe this game has it all, and don't even get me started on how much I love keanu reeves in this game in his role as johnny silverhand(they actually have music made by samurai you can listen to you should  def check it out) in my opinion this is one of the best games I've ever played and everyone should get the chance to experience this game at least once, I guarantee you'll have a good time with it, trust.",True,1,0

"Cyberpunk 2077 is Underrated

Yes, Cyberpunk 2077 had a disastrous launch—there's no denying that. But if you look beyond that initial mess, this game is so much fun and incredibly underrated. The story is engaging, and the gameplay is a blast. I especially love how the choices you make throughout the game actually impact the world around you. The skill tree adds another layer of depth, making each playthrough feel unique. Whether you want to be a cyber ninja, a run-and-gunner, or a pistol-wielding god, This game has it.

Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silver-hand is another highlight. He really brought the character to life—Johnny’s a lovable jerk, and I can’t get enough of him. I’m already looking forward to diving into Phantom Liberty and seeing where the story goes from here!

If this game interests you, stop reading reviews and go play it. Trust me, it's well worth getting sucked in.",True,0,0
"Highly Recommended:  10+/10, may be the best first person CRPG I've ever played
Version played: 2.21 with Phantom Liberty

Characters - 10+/10, maybe the deepest and best done group of characters I've ever seen in a game including multiple that professionally voiced by A-list actors

Story - 10/10, there are a few holes in the story and a few slow periods but overall it was great with plenty of conspiracies, corrupt government and corporate actors, and quest and story lines that kept the game interesting. There are also multiple endings for both the main game and Phantom Liberty that are well done and worth playing out. 

Combat - 10+/10, very fun FPS combat with lots of weapon and skill combinations to try. Most importantly for me, the combat was fun and challenging at higher difficulties

Driving and Driving Combat - 7/10, fun overall but I found the controls and horrible fish tailing on the rear wheel drive cars especially were not fun. To address that I only used a car or truck when forced to for a mission. Otherwise I used teleporters whenever possible to travel and when I did need wheels I went with a motorcycle. The motorcycles are much more fun to drive and handle a lot better than cars or trucks - and they look cooler too. 

Graphics - 10/10 - the graphics are very good. I'd give them a 9/10 on their own, but the cool Cyberpunk setting and the atmospheric graphics and art that went with it were an easy +1 for me

Sound 10+/10 - great voice acting by professionals including some A-list professionals, great music from multiple genres that fit in a cyberpunk world including everything from industrial / metal rock to techno to hip hop.

"The atmosphere, the characters, the dystopian narrative on a rebel without a cause on a nigh impossible goal of destroying corporations far too powerful to ever fail. The games honestly definitively peak. Everything about it feels genuinely real, and a commentary on a not impossible future with run-away capitalism that with reflection you'll realize already resembles the modern world, especially in the United States. 

Without spoiling anything, the characters themselves are written to feel believable in such a way that you can forget you're playing a game, and you're given an introspective into their lives within this dystopian world where they're still able to find happiness and joy despite the overwhelming reasons to despise life.

"The biggest issue with the game is I just want it to be better. There is still, years late, a ton of room for improvement, but it's very good. 

I played the game completely blind for the first playthrough and felt overwhelmed by the amount of shovel content that just didn't matter at all. Gigs, outside of maybe a dozen felt like a pointless chore. Side missions ranged from amazing to completely pointless. All Phantom Liberty content is a banger and they really learned from the mistakes of the base game but didn't bother to go back and bring up older content to the new standard they set. 

The modding scene for this game is huge and can be used for fix certain aspects of the game that remain either buggy (vehicle controls sucks, quests not popping up properly) or could use improvement (wardrobe system) but there is no catch all ""community patch"" like some other games have to fix widely agreed upon bugs. This makes looking through literally thousands of mods (or cherry-picking from popular mod packs) the solution to fixing issues CDPR should be resolving.

Gameplay feedback: 
- All gameplay styles are viable enough to beat the game on the hardest difficulty
- The difficulty of the game is terribly balanced and Very Hard (the hardest difficulty) is just as trivial as Easy by the late game, while being annoying more than difficult early on (stealth takedowns are the only reliable way to complete missions for the first 15ish levels, or abusing bad enemy AI.)
- Iconic weapons completely drown out all other weapons in the game.
- The crafting system felt completely pointless outside of ammo and upgrading iconic weapons. 
- The equipment system is barely a thing as taking any armor with bonuses is better than not.
- Engineering is far too powerful for every single build between enhancing Cyberware and providing mission skips via opening doors. 
- Air Dashing from the Reflex Tree is basically impossible to play without if you do it once. 
- Double Jump cyberware has the same 'mandatory' feeling.",True,0,0
