Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,great game after a few years of updates! i really like the amount of builds you can do in this game and weapon variety. story and side quest are also great! spoiler i finally avenged rebecca spoiler
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"it was not what they promised. it was complete shit on release. now, it is not even good. it is great. i love it. definitely one of the best games of all time. do not play without phantom liberty"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"i've played through this game a few times over and each time i get more connected to this world. with games you'd think once you figured out the mechanics you'd start minmaxxing and skipping dialogue you've already heard but not with cyberpunk. i started paying more attention to quests. then i started doing what my character would do not just what i thought would get me the best outcome. five playthroughs later i find my self reading every data shard, checking every terminal, and blasting all the songs. i'm not gonna explain what this game and the cyperpunk genre means to me because i can't. just know you'll love this game no matter what... but if you take your time, if you really take it all in and open your soul to it there's a deep catharsis to be found in this world that doesn't care"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"story is very good on the base game but in the phantom liberty it becomes great. i played the game when it first released on ps4, i can say it was the worst experience then but now i played it on update 2.22 and its one of the great game i can say at least on pc it is running like its a tech demo. i am playing with rt and its a treat to my eyes on night, in day time you will not notice it much but in nigh its a totally different story. if you are not getting fps try fsr 3.1 frame gen mod its works great if you have locked 60 fps then with this mod you can get around 120 fps with rt. i have around 150 screenshot taken because of how good it looks. get the game with the dlc guys its a must. hoping there would be sequel to this game"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"1010 game  amazing story  great gameplay for a shooter  gorgeous graphics and great optimisation. path tracing is playable with a 4070 at 1080pdlss. 4560 fps in most areas. with mods that reduce bounces, could go even higher with minimal fidelity loss  city and level design is one big eye candy. only drawback is no optional third person, but the immersion in first person is top tier. played this game since 1.3, so seeing the problematic child finally grow up to be a star was almost tear jerking."

Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"i got the base game along with phantom liberty dlc, and the length of the game was extensive. the quests just don't stop coming. this game has 13 alternate endings, mind you. many choices. graphics are great. no more bugs like at the launch of the game. many memorable characters. enough memorable quests. game makes you to invest in it. but the gameplay is chill and relaxing. it is a technical achievement and also a great rpg."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"excuse me, waiter? yes, please tell the chef that, while we may have disagreed initially, now that its cooked for four more years this dish is perfect."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"bought it first time way back when it launched, it ran crappily even at potato graphics so i refunded. fast forward to the game's patch 2.21, bought on sale. i can now play the game without frustration. i wish the draw distance and lighting in vanilla was better though these can somewhat be adjusted to liking via mods. fun large map lots of things to do. find your own fun delving into different styles of combat. are you the cool stealthy ninja? or are you rambo? or perhaps a sniper? or mayber a glance at people and fry their cybernetics as a netrunner? or go cyberpsycho? plenty of mods abound as well if you want to spice things up. storywise  no spoilers here, writing makes sense, character development shown. nothing forced. pacing could be better but it does not feel rushed nor sluggish. wish there were some followups to see the consequences of some choices ala witcher 3. wish there were some other choices available when it logistically makes sense as well. voice acting is amazing and brings the characters to life. keanu is breathtaking as well. as of feb 2025 this game is 910"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"welcome to the night city!!! this game has everything  keanu reeves  amazing and dark side quests  trauma  existential crisis  bugs? yeah, they're still there. some jank, some ai oddities, but nothing gamebreaking anymore. b 1010 would cyberpsycho again! b"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"i'm telling yall, this is already better then gta 6. i mean roackstar probably isn't going to change the gameplay formula, its gonna be another cover, auto aim and shoot then drive around and do the same thing 100 times. cyberpunk actually has a fleshed out game play system with tons of routes to choose from and with proper rpg elements so it has a lot of replay value versus gta."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"it's no secret. cyberpunk 2077 had a rocky launch, being mostly unfinished  bhoweverb cd projekt red has delivered in the years postlaunch. h3cyberpunk 2077 is the best game i've played since skyrim released back in 2011.h3 the dlc phantom liberty is a work of art, and the ending credits gives me goosebumps every time i hear urlhttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vu15teo0wsqidawid podsiado's song phantom liberty.url if you're looking for an open world, singleplayer, scifi shooter with some of the best world building i've ever seen  this is your sign to bite the bullet and purchase both the base game and the dlc. the experience from playing it once is worth the game's full price. if you're lucky to catch it on a sale i wouldn't even hesitate. if i had the chance to go back and relive any game from the beginning, bthisb is the game i would choose. i envy the journey you're about to embark on. ihave fun, choom.i"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"cyberpunk 2077 is a game that somehow went from being one of the most disappointing launches ever to one of the best openworld rpgs you can play right now. after years of patches, updates, and the phantom liberty expansion, the game finally lives up to most of its potential. the world of night city is insane  its dense, vibrant, and feels alive in a way most open worlds dont. the city design, characters, and atmosphere are easily some of the best in gaming. every street, alley, and skyscraper feels handcrafted with insane detail. the story is dark, emotional, and filled with moments that actually stick with you. keanu reeves as johnny silverhand somehow works perfectly, and phantom liberty only adds more depth, new characters, and one of the best expansions ive ever played. combat is fast, brutal, and fully customizable. you can run around hacking peoples brains, go fullon guns blazing, or build yourself like a cyberpsycho tank. the rpg systems finally feel like they matter, and the skill trees let you really experiment with different playstyles. that being said, the game still has its issues. some bugs still exist, ai can be dumb, and the open world sometimes feels like its missing that extra bit of life when you step away from the main quests. but the amount of improvement since launch is insane, and the current version of cyberpunk 2077 is actually worth playing. 910  a flawed masterpiece that finally delivers on the hype. if you skipped it at launch, nows the time to dive into night city."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"cyberpunk 2077  phantom liberty dlc  late to the party, but blown away it took me 5 years to finally jump into cyberpunk 2077, and wowwhat a ride. i honestly didnt expect to get this hooked, but ive been playing it every single day since i started. the world is immersive, the storylines are gripping, and the characters feel incredibly real. the atmosphere of night city is unmatched. adding phantom liberty into the mix just took things to another level. the writing, the choices, and the new content feel like a whole new game layered on top of an already deep experience. its polished, intense, and full of surprises. i might be late, but im all inand if you havent played it yet, dont wait any longer. its finally the game it was always meant to be."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"after 200 hours, 100 the game getting all endings for the main game and dlc i will say cyberpunk is the best story game i have ever played. nothing has ever came close to making me feel like the character im playing like playing as v has. i will say this game and dlc is a must play even at full price especially since the dlc turns everything up to an 11 and is the best story ever told in my opinion."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"i genuinely love and enjoy this game! i refused to pick it up when it first came out, due to all the bugs and visual glitches. however, 5 years later, for the spring sale i finally picked it up. the game has gotten way better since it's initial release, and i'm genuinely super involved in the story so far. it's a fun game that has a great story, great graphics and raytracing even for today's standards. yes there's still some bugs and glitches here and there, but it's very few and far between. when i do see any visual glitchesbugs at this point, i just chalk it up to my character's optics malfunctioning and laugh it off, since they aren't detrimental to the game. all in all, it's fun. so fun!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"released in an unholy state, gave up. played it after they foxed most of it around 1.0 something with a low end pc i5 6600k, gtx 1060 6gb did not care, the story was great and the game was definently playable. now i have a moderately decent pc 7700x, 4070tisuper and i have gotten to appreciate the details of this game. every nook and cranny of the map is filled with its own personality, parts i thought were just nothing had their own gigs, and their own small story lines.. 1010 would reccomend to everyone"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"way better than at launch, super interactive and leaves no corner of the city without something to do"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"i know the game came out messy, but it's really worth giving this game a chance today. it is an amazing game in everything from graphics to the story.so many different, and intresting characters that u get to meet all over night city. promise u will have a great time with the game today"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"good gameplay, good story, good characters."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"phenomenal game. yes, the story can be hard to follow. yes, the morality system why knock people out?, the stealth gameplay why hide bodies?, the character customisation why can't i look like jackie, susie q, or maelstrom lol, the romance, trauma team, street cred people should be afraid of me etc. were all halfbaked and clearly the mox were going to be more important in the original scope and plans. but it shows how good the game is when all of this doesn't really matter or affect my view on it. the gameplay is incredible. truly amazing stuff. there is a triple combo that really allows for unique playstyles. 1 cyberware 2 classtype skill trees 3 weapon type skills on my first run i was a borgedout nomad netrunnertank of a man, wielding nothing but a chargeshotgun with two barrels and a heart of hatred. the gameplay was on the highest difficulty but i still felt like robocop. blasting the shit outta gonks close range and blowing the brainchips up of fools across the map with my quickhacks. on my second run i was a doublejumping, quickdashing mantisblade streetkid woman that specialised in throwing knives, sniper rifles, pistols, and chopping fools up with my mantis blades. i had no ability to hack, and relied on a berserk booster for melee. this was an entirely different style of gameplay and is truly incredible the devs have built a system where it works and flows as naturally as it does. if i do a third run i'll play as a smartgun, riflefocused corpo. the open world is amazing, absolutely beautiful and with tonnes of detail. it truly defends its right to be open world with the ncpd scanner and gigsjobs. it's a shame it doesn't have as much interactable establishments in any meaningful way like eg. the yakuza games but still far better than 90 of open world games out there. i'd say as far as the map goes it is actually the best i have ever played. no far cry, days gone, mad max, yakuza, gta, sleeping dogs or whatever really gets close. this is something special. the story is great, it's a decent foundation that is launched to its peak by the performances of its voiceactors. this also applies to phantom liberty. the characters are well written and it punches where it needs to. it doesn't forget the punk of cyberpunk even if the morals the story sortof forces in your face are a bit dubious at best. overall, this game is definitely worth picking up. especially considering you can get it at 50 off quite frequently. make sure to get the one with phantom liberty as imho that expansion has an ending that is absolute cinema. so yes, tldr goated story goated open world design goated side content goated gameplay goated soundtrack mid character customisation cmon man this is cyberpunk world, why do i gotta be normal skinny manskinny woman? mid in some specific gameplay details eg. stealth is still fun, but could be better soul crushing axed content. bruh, monowire hacking, mantis blade wall running, a moonbase etc. would be so cool definitely made the right choice if you waited a few years to buy it after the nightmare launch. shame it didn't stay in full dev for a few years longer and pop out that extra content and polish."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"incredible story, deep rpg elements, and a worldcity that is truly living, breathing, and that takes on a role in the story all its own. cyberpunk is a phenomenal rpg and a pinnacle of storytelling."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"probably one of the best games i've played in my life, both dlc and main stories are amazing, every character in this game is very well done and everyone has a different personality that makes the game feel way more diversified and makes you feel connected and emphatize for them, all missions are different and fun, even the secondary ones despite the problems the game had when it launched, it was really worth it to wait for the patches, i highly recommend it."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"completed this game on console originally, put my controller down, scrapped money together and built my first ever pc just to play it all over again with mods. cb2077 has great game mechanics, is story rich, amazing visuals that sucks you in. for those that are wondering they have fixed all the bugs and glitches that people reported on launch but if your game is ''flatlining'' there will be a fix on yt it sometimes has to do with outdated mods and you have to view the integrity of your files which again is online. i highly recommend getting the game with phantom liberty. 1010 game."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"h3this game has potential. h3 the launch was not great and considering how long it was in development for, all the delays and excuses, this game was not ready for release. cdpr has, and hopefully at the end of this, will still have a brilliant reputation but i think games are being pushed too far in regards to overhyping, advertising unrealistic gameplayteasers and just generally releasing so broken. i testers need to reevaluate their targets and remember that not everyone runs a highspec pc or has the latest console, so all platforms of all kinds should hold tests. i url httpsyoutu.be2slki3x4mci url now, to the game bu pros ub  great storyline, voice acting isn't the best.  some sidequests are really intriguing and can throw you from happy, to sad or leaving you confused but for good reason.  interactivity is okay, but there is enough to do in night city.  choices are thoughtprovoking though not overly too sure how they have an ultimate knockon effect towards the endgame.  night city is beautiful and fast travelling doesn't seem needed, i can drive around the city and still be in awe even if i had driven down it so many times before.  the game immersion, aside from bugs, is okay, not brilliant but enough with how the story goes.  combat is as good as you'd expect although not rdr2 level. bu cons ub  promises of bustling city, but it's minimal people doing the exact same routine unless it involves them in a quest  cars randomly spawn upside down on the pavement and disappears or explodes, or cars spawn merged with other cars causing a complete eyesore and tear in immersion  character customisation, we were promised it would be the best but i think i can name quite a few games off the bat that did it better.  cybernetics, supposed to be the pinical in night city, but only offers bare minimum usage. all you need is a legendary weapon and things are just like hot knife through butter. was expecting much more with cybernetic... bu dlc phantom liberty ub the new golden standard for dlc. i felt like i was in a james bond movie. the cast of characters are all extraordinary and well acted. during the middle of the dlc i felt like i was in the high stakes poker game from casino royale absolutely brilliant quest. dog town is the best district in night city by far and is packed to the brim with new gigs, dungeons with dangerous bosses, new vehicle's and dozens of weapons and hundreds of new clothing items. this dlc easily offer's 30 plus hours of new content, and is a masterpiece!!!! but its playable, it's a good game... just could have done so much more with the time they had."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"h2a happy ending? for folks like us? wrong city, wrong people...h2 i was lucky enough to wait until the game was stable and polished before purchasing this title, despite waiting for it for years since announcement. i don't regret this, because so many people seem to have a sour taste over the game if they tried it at launch, despite all of the improvements and fixes cdpr have done since 2020. cyberpunk is like nothing i've played before, it's truly immersive. i laughed, gotten attached, got angry, felt betrayed, cried until i was a dried raisin, had my heart ripped out of my chest... and although i am definitely an emotional person, there hasn't been many games that truly got this reaction out of me. even characters you only meet in the prologue and barely have screentime youknowwho  i found myself praying that cdpr would make a dlc of the 6 months we only get to see in clips. side npc characters were meticulously crafted to make you doubt intentions, confused about who to trust, unsure about what to choose  all clearly intentional when looking back at the story cyberpunk tells. i played this game for approximately 300 hours 2 playthroughs before purchasing the phantom liberty dlc  i was hesitant because of the price, at the time i had gotten cyberpunk on sale for less than the dlc price so it seemed absurd to me to pay the same price i did the game  but within just a few quests i could understand why, and i never regretted it. be foreworn  i would not recommend this game if you are not in the best state of mind. each ending can be seen as bittersweet at best, each ending made me cry like a baby while the credits rolled because the writing is absolutely flawless. unfortunately, part of me was hoping for a better ending with the dlc  but surprise, the additional ending you can get from the dlc is just... the worst? it ripped my heart in two to make the decision, to hear the final dialogue with j.s, and all the following moments. the game left me feeling empty, in the best way. the writing, visuals, development, easter eggs, music, and female v voice acting holy cow, it is night and day playing female versus male v, no shade to male v voice actor, but everybody should experience female v at least once in my opinion  this game brought me back from my gaming hibernation, now sitting at nearly 700 hours i finally uninstalled the game and moved on to another, but i am now on a desperate hunt to find a game that can fill the void this one left, find a game that can be comparable to this one. if you're hesitating, just go for it  the game is often on sale, get it when its 30 and i don't think you'll ever regret it. even if it's just to drive around night city, or race the streets, there's a bit of something for all type of players that are generally attracted to rpg games. bgameplayb  boring  rock paper scissors  fun  hmm..........  entertaining  ace  godlike bdifficultyb  my grandma could play it  easy  normal  hard  a challenge to be reckoned bgraphicsb  ms paint  bad  meh  normal  very good  an original artistic direction  beautiful  masterpiece bstoryb  this game has no story  some lore  it's there for people who want it  well written  leading to more indepth researchesthoughts  a model to get inspired by blengthb  0 no story  short  average  long  to infinity and beyond bmusicb  just filling noisesno music  trivial and uneventful  good andor fitting the game's artistic dispositions  memorable  transcending whispers of a forgotten world binterestb  i would rather watch paint dry  hard to enjoy  repetitive andor uninspired  a good moment  sticking out of the pack  you will remember it long after breplayabilityb  a onetime experience  only for achievements  if you wait a few monthsyears or with mods  definitely  infinitely replayable or almost"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"the structure of cyberpunk 2077 feels quite different from many rpgs i've played, including the witcher 3 wild hunt. while most games are designed like a tree, with a central story branching out into various paths, cyberpunk 2077 resembles more of a sprawling bush. you dont have to progress very far in the main quest before you encounter a dozen or more side activities, all vying for your attention. what's more, many of these opportunities are just a phone call away. in this futuristic world, quest givers often reach out to you directly, so you don't even need to go looking for them. this changes the usual sense of growth that rpgs offer, as the variety of options opens up quickly before leveling off for much of the game. still, theres so much to explore and discover, with plenty of hidden content you need to actively seek out, that i didnt mind swapping that traditional sense of progression for the abundance of choices offered."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,absolutely brilliant game the creates incredible immersion coupled with a fantastic storyline. night city and its surrounds all have unique feeling zones. combat and movement is sharp and expressive. customising your character to minute detail really makes you feel like you have ownership and an investment in your own story. a
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"simply one of the best stories i've ever experienced in a game. i enjoyed every moment of it. the characters inspired real compassion, and the vast, immersive world of night city was breathtakingchaotic, lost in perdition, yet unforgettable. what a setting, what a storyline!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"graphics and game play is amazing. super fun the ai update and combat has made it another level and endless possibilities for builds build. the story isnt nothing to crazy, tons of funny people to meet and easter eggs to keep you exploring. the cyberpunk vibe is super chill too. the augments and weapon combinations are crazy. 910 such a good game i recommend if you have a good pc."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"greatest game i have ever played, the story is a absolute masterpiece starting of showing u the world in the end of act 1. amazing characters so many fun side quests insane lore so much exploration with random small stories u can stumble upon in places u would never expect it off. one of the only games which made me immedeitly want to play the game after finishing it, also being the only game where i didnt want to finish the game because i wanted to do more in the world but then the best part imo the combat having 3 main directions all being really interesting with one of them having many possible builds in one sandevistan ive enjoyed all 3 of them greatly and will be purchasing the dlc soon 1110 absolute masterpiece"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,hated a chunk of it but it does have a good gameplay loop and story.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"as a game that had a terrible start. it has gone from polygon nightmare to beautiful game . i have not seen a comeback like this since no mans sky . even on a 1050 the game was decent , on the a 3060 it is both beautiful with great game play . the game offers many styles for all gamers . cyber ninja ? done . full bulk badass with only fists ? done ! stealth gameplay ? 100 !!! create your character and see if you can overcome anything . 910"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"only have 3 hours in and was able to add some mods to make the game a little more immersive like the computer tablet anywhere... very handy. so far i am really enjoying the game and like the exploration side of it, i am still trying to get the feel of it with targeting and driving, but liking the game so far... though i had preordered it before it came out, i am thankful that i waited for several patches before playing, i've not run into any bugs, that that is a plus in my book!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"one of the best gaming experiences i've ever lived. night city consumes you, it makes you care for its people, its past and future, and your place in it. keanu reeves is embodying one of the best roles in his career, engaging with him is super fun. the rest of the cast stand their ground too, esp the protagonists and the dlc characters are believable to say the least. you can approach this game as a role playing experience or a guns blazing shooter or a stealthy pacifist or... you get it. you can play the usual firstperson shooter or develop complex synergies in your own unique build. you can customize your appearance infinitely, discover crazy rides, play a bunch of unique arcade mini games, discover subplots within subplots and never stop exploring. this game has been stabilized since its despicable launch and right now looks and plays terrific. i can't imagine a realistic cyberpunk universe looking better than this. if you own a high end pc, just go for it if only to witness its gorgeous lighting and reflections. the occasional bug is there but nothing game breaking and in the long run won't matter. not to mention the development team is still updating the game, adding and fixing stuff 4 years later and keeping the community active with new lore and photo contests or other gimmicks for hardcore fans. a huge bonus is that the dlc is one of the best released a compelling narrative with lots of different options, a higher character level ceiling with a ton of new upgrades in weapons and cyberware and a whole bunch of new sidequests, gigs, vehicles and areas to explore. both the main game and the dlc can be replayed over and over and approached in different storyrelated choices or playstyles and feel refreshing and rewarding like a new experience. oh, and the soundtrack is nuts. the game has been accused of being just a gta clone with futuristic gear, but in reality its art style and sound design support the game's aesthetic perfectly to set it apart not only from gta but also from the other genre defining titles like deus ex, exploring similar themes with a whole different approach. there is so much to love here, there will definitely be something for you. don't forget to grab the free bonus contect while at it the original soundtrack included."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"story is incredibly compelling, after patches gameplay is smooth as fxex function. love this masterpiece"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,really fun game. interesting story. very cool abilities. 910
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,i can't believe i have waited this long to play this game. amazing characters and story. after finishing the game felt this weird void in me. this was the first time i have actually bonded with the characters and actually felt sadness when i lost some of them. it was magical like the feeling of watching lotr for the first time.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since launch, and i have to saythis game is now one of my alltime favorites. cd projekt red put in the work, and it really shows. if you love cyberpunk aesthetics, deep stories, and a world that feels alive, this is a mustplay. night city is insane. the level of detail, the atmosphere, the way the city feels livedinits everything i wanted from a cyberpunk world. the neon lights, the shady alleyways, the hightech skyscrapers, and the different districts all have their own unique feel. walking through the streets, hearing conversations, and watching the chaos unfold around you makes it feel like a real place. its easy to get lost just exploring and soaking it all in. the main story is fantastic, and the choices you make actually matter. playing as v, trying to navigate the mess of night city while dealing with johnny silverhand keanu reeves absolutely nailed the role makes for an unforgettable experience. the game doesnt hold your hand, and it throws a lot of moral dilemmas at you. but what really makes the game special are the side characters. panam, judy, river, kerrythey all feel like real people with their own problems and dreams. some of the side quests are just as good, if not better, than the main storyline. the writing is just toptier, and i found myself really invested in the characters and their stories. the phantom liberty dlc takes everything great about cyberpunk 2077 and turns it up even more. new missions, new characters idris elbas character solomon reed is my favourite, and new gear make this expansion worth every second. the espionage and action elements add a fresh twist, making it feel like a cyberpunk spy movie. if you already love the game, phantom liberty is a nobrainer. combat is a blast. gunplay feels smooth, and melee combat is actually fun now. hacking is one of my favorite partsbeing able to take down enemies by messing with their cyberware or turning their own turrets against them never gets old. you can play this game however you wantsneaky netrunner, meleefocused street samurai, gunsblazing mercenaryits all viable, and its all fun. cyberware adds even more variety. you can install upgrades that let you jump higher, slow down time, or even rip enemies apart with mantis blades. the skill tree has been revamped too, making character progression way more rewarding. building your version of v is one of the best parts. whether its how your character looks, what weapons you use, or what cyberware you install, theres a ton of freedom to play how you want. the choices you make feel meaningful, and every build feels unique. the music in this game is just perfect. whether youre walking through the streets, driving through the badlands, or getting into a firefight, the soundtrack always fits the mood. the voice acting is fantastic across the board, and the ambient sounds of the city make it feel truly alive. visually, this game is stunning. with ray tracing and all the graphical updates, night city looks breathtaking. performancewise, its night and day compared to launchsmooth, optimized, and finally what it was meant to be. if youre playing on a decent pc or a nextgen console, youre in for a visual treat. cyberpunk 2077 has gone from a troubled launch to one of the best rpgs ive ever played. the story, the world, the characters, the combatit all comes together beautifully now. cd projekt red really turned things around, and if you love scifi, cyberpunk settings, or just great storytelling, you owe it to yourself to play this game."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,story rich and it is definitely one of the best open world games i've ever played with great and stunning secondary quests. side jobs surprisingly do not get repetitive over the time. also do not forget to play phantom liberty dlc.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"wonderful story telling with some optimization problems. lots of endings and routes to take with loads of lovable characters. great involvement of grey areas within the character and the player, forcing realistic ends carved with careful decision making."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-23,"i could add more things, it only took a few hours to platinum this beauty. i recommend it, a 10010 game without a doubt!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"dystopian tragedy done perfectly. absolute masterpiece that is a must play. one of the most immersive fictional worlds i have gotten to experience. amazing story and an 1110 dlc that is arguably better than the base game. lovable characters and sad stories, it's got it all. please do yourself a favour and play this title if you enjoy well made passionate work. i am glad i waited till recently to play the game to enjoy it to the fullest since most bugs and issues got fixed now is a better time than ever to hop in and enjoy. cdpr...bravo"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"very good, still buggy as hell, but nothing game breaking or irritating, just silly."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"valeu a pena esperar para jogar! atualmente, o jogo est em um timo momento, bem otimizado e com diversas melhorias grficas e na jogabilidade. apesar da cd projekt ter decepcionado na prvenda, acredito que hoje eles conseguiram deixar o jogo redondinho. para mim, tornouse um dos melhores jogos que j joguei. me fez refletir, me diverti com inmeras interaes com personagens bem construdos, e a narrativa  simplesmente de tirar o flego, com reviravoltas incrveis e de muito bom gosto. alm disso, como apaixonado por arte, fiquei impressionado com o quanto esse jogo entrega nesse aspecto. o nico ponto fraco, na minha opinio,  o balanceamento dos inimigos. joguei no hard e senti que eles so muito fracos, enquanto os chefes da campanha so absurdamente mais fortes que os cyberpsicopatas. no entanto, sei que existem mods que ajudam a equilibrar esse aspecto. peguei ele na promoo por 79,00r e pra mim valeu, fiz 2 finais diferentes e ainda tem muita coisa para explorar e me divertir."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"this game quickly climbed into my top 5 games of all time. cyberpunk is the most visually immersive and one of the most detailed games i have ever played, the graphics with pt and music are fantastic and the world building is something else. it's not just simple futuristic aesthetics. i can feel the unique culture from within night city, the different groupsgangs, the way people act, the slang they use, it all brings so much life to the world of cyberpunk the game bugs have significantly decreased and story is just great, along with the amazing side missions and quests and gigs and and and... and don't let me get started on the phantom liberty expansion, levels. the characters are really great as well, so many personalities to form connections with and plus, who doesn't want to play a game along side keanu reeves? not to mention idris elba. really love the weapons and different play styles this game offers, from heavy assault with the baddest guns in town, to full on melee with your sharpest katana paired with your netrunninghacking skills, or even take a stealth approach, the choice is yours. character customisation is just a delight and i enjoyed creating my different people. sickness all around, i have so much more to say, but this was it for now. 100 recommend. i am glad to have joined this journey and i look forward to what comes next."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,one of the best games ever! i've loved it before the big update and i love it even more now d
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"played this game when it first came out and it was so hard to get into with all the bugs, but this game is actually incredible and amazing now. cd projekt red really earned every bit of respect they could ever need from me for fixing this and making it everything we all wanted when it first came out."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-21,"i played this game on launch on the ps4 and 100 the game then, and despite how bad that was i still thoroughly enjoyed the story and the atmosphere. nowadays after rework and patch this game is fantastic story, music, atmosphere everything you could ever want out of a single player open world rpg. the mods after you have played vanilla bleeds life right back into it."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"choooom, one of the best solo campaigns out there. expansive maps, immersive stories, impressive range of side jobs, gigs and additional quests. top 3 games of all time for me."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"cyberpunk 2077 is like a dystopian fever dream where you play as a mercenary named v, whos basically a walking ikea catalog of cyberware and poor life choices. the game is set in night city, a place so grim it makes blade runner look like a disney vacation. its a world where corporations rule, everyone has a tragic backstory, and your best friend is a gun that occasionally talks to you. the story is a rollercoaster of emotionsmostly despair, with a side of existential dread. youll laugh, youll cry, and youll question why you thought stealing a priceless relic from a megacorp was a good idea. johnny silverhand played by keanu reeves, whos basically playing himself but angrier is your digital ghost roommate, and hes either the best or worst part of the game, depending on how much you enjoy being called a gonk every five minutes. pros night city is stunning when its not glitching into the void. the soundtrack slaps harder than a cyberpsycho on a rampage. judy alvarez exists. thats it. thats the pro. cons bugs. so many bugs. i once saw a car phase through a building and honestly, it felt loreaccurate. the ai is about as smart as a toaster. cops will literally spawn behind you, yell stop right there, and then forget you exist. youll spend more time customizing your character than actually seeing them thanks, firstperson view. in conclusion, cyberpunk 2077 is a mess, but its our mess. its like dating someone toxic but hotyou know its bad for you, but you cant look away. 710, would get cyberpsychosis again."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"i don't think i've been more absorbed within the storytelling of a video game before. i've laughed, and cried while connecting with the diverse roster of characters, the immersion is surreal. feeling these types of emotions from a video game plants themselves deep into your heart. everything just hits the right places nice and deep, phantom liberty adds onto that making this easily one of the best video games of all time. cyberpunk 2077 is truly an unforgettable experience. i my playtime is on console, don't mind the 8hrs here. i"

Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"1010 the most alive i've felt playing a game since the original release of skyrim. i know they messed this game up on release, but it is now a legend status masterpiece."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-27,"i've always liked this game, even with the extremely buggy launch. the world building is so incredible you rarely see something this well crafted. there are parts of the city that look so lived it i can imagine what it would be like to live there. story sucks major ass though and i ended up taking the secret ending and not playing for several years."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,if you still haven't given this game a try just because it had a buggy start.. then you're missing out!! the game is fixed and the dlc is breathtaking. worth the money.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,only took like 3 years after i bought it and 3 pc upgrades later for me to be able to run it but cdpr finally came around and made one of the best looking and playing games there is. truly a next gen title and worth picking up and playing.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"played this game on og ps4 with all the bugs and wonky mechanics. i still had fun playing then and now its just amazing. to see this game go from a wonky mess to being a benchmark to test the highest of high end pcs is something that nobody expected. the atmosphere, the characters, music, and gameplay all slap. cyberpunk is right up there with witcher and has a ton of potential cant wait to see what is coming next!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"do yourself a favor, play this game. since i've installed a hundred of free mods ranging from gameplay, movements, mostly visual fixs and upgrades, this game is stunnnnnnning. thank you my beloved 4090, heating my place the whole winter!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"cyberpunk 2077 took me multiple tries and probably 15 full hours to get into  but once i was into it, wow. this game has everything you could want from an open world rpg and it is simply stunning to look at on top of everything else."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"i didn't have many expectations when i initially bought it but the multiple patches over the years turned a huge mess of a game into something so special that i ended up sinking 100h of playtime and finishing all the achievements in no time. totally understand people's skepticism about whether or not it's worth giving it a try since i come from the same place as them but as of right now i can safely say the amount of gameplay, variety of things to do and overall quality it's definitely worth checking out. considering main game and dlc took me together roughly 130h to finish, i'd argue it's worth buying even outside of discounts since we now live in a times where aaa titles barely make it past 4050h of total playtime and ask for twice as much in total price."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"the game is great, it's hard to find any bugs from the release, in 4 years the developers made the game from rags to riches. the game shows what life would look like if corporations took over the world."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-05,"hands down one of the best modern rpgs. if you're even thinking of getting it just do it. i would highly recommend getting it with the phantom liberty dlc as imo it greatly enhances the base game with a unique area, awesome items and mini bosses and a gripping and devastating story . it's cliche to say that cdpr have redeemed themselves from the godawful launch but its true, this game is a phenomenal technical and literary triumph. my 160hrs breezed by with still more i could've done. i also had the joy of playing this entirely on my steam deck where it definitely did not look as good as it could've on a pc it was still really beautiful if you're willing to play with settings. the performance still suffers noticeably often. mostly in dogtown and in other highly dense areas. saying this, with my settings i regularly got a stable 60fps. loading could sometimes take a few minutes. however, all these tradeoffs did not put me off the game at all for the sheer fact that i could play cyberpunk 2077 on the trainbusworkcouch. if you have a steam deck it is an ugly joy."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"i really love this game. the world is massive, full of interactions, and the missions are truly memorable. the gameplay is satisfying, and its easily one of my top 5 games i've ever played. one of the things i really appreciate is how decisions actually impact the world, which is something not many games do today. however, the one thing i absolutely hate is the endings  there are around 5, and while you complete them, they dont really impact the game afterward, which feels underwhelming. the phantom liberty dlc, on the other hand, is an absolute masterpiece. its how this game shouldve been from the start. every activity is interesting, the contracts and missions are very wellwritten, and the attention to detail is amazing. i love it so much, honestly, i think it's better than the base game."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"if you played the game now, you would never know how much of a buggy mess it was back when it released. good that it was fixed, bad that it happened in the first place. that aside, the combat is great, the music is decent enough, story is nothing to write home about, it has some emotional moments and cool setpieces, but thats it overall i'd say its a solid 710. not necessarily worth the full price, but on a nice discount? would definitely recommend"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,jackie is the best character and nothing bad could ever happen to him
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"i'm a fan of emotional games. oh, how bad i felt in 2020 when i chose the ending where i help hanako. it's surprising that, even though antidepressants dull my emotional experiences, i still feel that sorrow when v dies, and viktor talks to him with a caring voice. the game has changed drastically over the past four years  i would call it the game of the decade."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-07,"makes me feel that perfect sense of nostalgia for a thing i've never experienced. has a story that takes as many playthroughs as you want for it all to really makes sense, with more meaning being understood and appreciated every single time. my offline hours nearly double my visible ones, this game forces you to witness and understand terrible dread and horror, and honestly you'll say thank you."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"cyberpunk 2077 can be described the same way as night city itself glamorous and rotten to the core. the city is detailed and gorgeous, but it's empty, acting only as a set dressing for missions. the missions themselves have strong moments, but the writing is sometimes atrocious. there are a lot of choices, but most of the time the world just does its thing seriously, the game kept throwing panam's crotch into my face no matter how much i tried to keep our relationship professional. there are interesting upgrades in the skill tree and cool weapons and tools to use, but after a short while, you become so powerful it doesn't matter what you use. updates have fixed the worst technical issues, so now it's only as buggy as you would expect from other open world games. there are more issues but i'm too lazy to write them down. i hope you get the idea. i was about to click the thumb down. then i went through the point of no return and after that took some time to think back on the journey. i'll be honest. i really enjoyed the payoff. and looking back, i very much appreciate the attempt to improve on the burning pile that are open world games. time will tell how i'll remember this game. is it worth being annoyed for 60 hours before a grand finale and an occasion to look at the state of aaa games? your mileage may vary. considering the games i enjoy, i would be a hypocrite if i gave this game a thumb down. cyberpunk 2077 is awful. and it's one of the best open world games i ever played."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"at first cyberpunk was a buggy mess that's why i was hesitant to buy it, but now this game is legendary, a must play for any person who loves rpg's. the world is immersive, dangerous, and outright just plain fun! this is not the same cyberpunk 2077 when it first came out."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-20,"highly recommend, great story line, multiple endings, relationships and more. i really wish there was more tbh. i played this on ps5 and wanted to see how it ran on my pc so i bought it again. the graphics are amazing. there are multiple endings and your choices affect the outcome. not for kids, so parents be warned there if full on nudity in the game. wish i could find more games like this. cannot get enough of this game."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-26,"i really wanted to like this game, but i guess it's just not for me. the character customization is much better than any other game i've played, so i'll give it that. but the story was hard to get invested in, the gameplay is just okay enough to be entertaining but not as in depth as i'd like for the genre, it's way too easy to become op and stops being challenging around the 25 mark even if you set it to a higher difficulty... realistically, i'd give it a 6 out of 10. i hope anyone else that tries it likes it more than i did, and you likely will this game's gotta be marked overwhelmingly positive for a reason."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,one of the best games ever made and still the most visually impressive game you can play 5 years after launch
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-08,"great story, fun mechanics, engaging characters. cd projeckt red makes the best story driven games out there."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,"2 ,  .   ,,.,  ..   ,,            .               .             .               . 2010"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"bought the game years ago when it came out and actually had to return it given the poor performance. i recently picked it up again due to the recent positive reviews. what an excellent game. storywriting were captivating, graphics were incredible and the combatgameplay was fun an interesting. would recommend"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"2025 and still filled with bugs as fck can't rebind some controls without editing an xml file in the settings weapons gamefeel is bad driving gamefeel is bad the car in some cutscenes just slide weirdly do not listen to cd projekt fans, they are not objective about this yeah it was bad the time it came out but now it's better than ever better doesn't mean good the worst is  yeah this doesn't work but you can install a mod for it only good points graphics scenario dub in all languages don't buy this full price buy rdr2 instead, you'll thank me later"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"after being in early access for nearly 3 years, cyberpunk 2077 is at it's peak after phantom liberty. cdpr has always been great when it comes to deep lore and immersion in their games. while the main plot might not hit home for everyone the world cdpr has built will make up for it. some of the dialogue that characters use can make me cringe. the lingo used in nc is very campy. but it has it's moments where it comes off as charming nothing is cooler than being a cyborg ninja who can double jump, dash through the air, slow time, and shoot at the same time. combat can get as chaotic as you want it, or you can keep things low profile if you want."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,review after completing main game and dlc. overall the game is very good but is overrated as one of the best rpg's of all time. the dlc is everything good about the main game but better. night city oozes with flavor and there is great story writing but a lot of it and the situations in the game are not super memorable. in particular most 'boss' fights in the game are just damage sponges with a mechanic or two. there are some great ones though to be had. there is significant variety in how you can choose to play the game and letting you respec at any time feels great to try out new things. stats also help you interact with the environment or through conversations as well leading to better immersion. on the downsides is there is serious side content bloat with not a lot of it feeling very memorable. most of it is also walled behind ticking off other markers on the map too which is both good and bad if you want to try to complete everything. there are also still lots of bugs and performance issues with the game. regardless the game is still very good in its final state and best played with the dlc.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,good story and and so much to do!
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"amazing visualization, world building, and one of the best side mission games."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"wow, i really love the game, the story and the role playing are fantastic."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,still a bit janky and unpolished gameplay very fun and satisfying ost is banging night city is something else. schrodingers city. repulsive and attractive at the same time. great characters my ending came outta nowhere and had me dazed this game is something else
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"one of my favorite games. i bought it on my playstation and now on steam and it holds up still. if you think this game is bad because of it's launch, you really need to try it now."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"very nice game. the graphics and game atmosphere are amazing. my only criticism is the janky ai characters walk through cars, ai cars drive all over the place and the mushy vehicle controls."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,awesome game!!! i preordered this on xbox  way before launch... but ms corpos had to eat shit and have no option to port my game data... but i can game on their shitty cloud? imma take it out on arasaka and militech... i am gonna stick to steam now... gonna have to start a new game after 5 years...
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,quite possibly the best game i've ever played. everything about this game is 5 star. only criticism is that i've run out of missions!
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,fantastic game! they really worked hard on this since its release to make it the amazing immersive experience that it is today!
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"love this game it has minor problems with graphics on the deck but with the massive game it is i can expect some issues. the mi or issues wont stop me from playing the game,"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"very pog game honestly. idk, it might just be the aesthetic of the game  but at least in the beginning, its been very enjoyable. it has both serious moments, and moments that genuinely kinda light you up inside. also, silverhand is a badass."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"this is a newly created steam account, as i discarded my old ones, however i purchased cyberpunk 2077 on its release date, i then refunded it due to all of its bugs, after noticing they admitted to their mistakes, and made absolutely massive changes, and put work into marketing and bringing it up to its roughly expected standard i purchased it again. i actually own it on 2 separate steam accounts now. the game looks amazing, performs well enough, and has an absolutely massive modding community. i recommend purchasing this game, just take your time and avoid rushing the main story."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,as an og cyberpunk rolegame player this game brings alive the world i once loved so much with my friends that we played our campaigns for weeks and months at a time.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"i love being able to play as female v, as i myself am a female , i love the game play and story line, the romance, realism and the fact that what you do or say change the outcomes and endings its over all an amazing game and can forget i love the open world and driving!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"this game's plot makes the most sense when you play a nice guy nomad who wants to return to the nomad lifestyle with a new life and a new love after getting burned so badly in nc. it just so happens that my first play through in 2020 was exactly this character. other character types struggle, especially trying to be evil or bad, the default assumption of most side and main stories is that your character is highly motivated to get rid of the chip, really nice and wants to help people, and generally dislikes johnny until the 3rd act. if you play this game within those guardrails like i did my first time then this game is perfect. overall, 8.510 for a killer first play through."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"genuinely some of the best written stories in the rpg genre. amazing combat, and highly recommend the dlc."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"after 4 years of the game being out, it's definitely nowhere near as buggy as it used to be i just now started playing, just going based off what i've seen. sure there are definitely still bugs, practice makes perfect got stuck for me because i died as soon as the final arena was finished which meant i had to reload a save but that was fine i got through it no problem. i did encounter some other bugs here and there jackie went into an apose for a half second before the biochip mission, some visual inconsistencies but for the most part the game ran just fine. i was able to run the game at mediumhigh graphics settings and still get very high and mostly stable framerates which just made the game feel even better. i'd say i like this more than the witcher 3, but only because the tactical gameplay of the witcher 3 doesn't exactly sit very well with me. both games are arguably equally difficult at their core yes i know there are difficulty settings, but cyberpunk just flows better for me. maybe it's because it's a half shooter half melee game with vehicles in a city but regardless they're both amazing games however this one is more fun to my taste. if you're able to still pick it up while it's on sale, i highly recommend doing so. i did so myself and it's some of the best 24 i've spent on a game until a new halo comes out, if doom the dark ages is any good or when the black myth wukong dlc drops. later chooms"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"don't forget to rotate saves if you don't want your game to bug out or have messed up textures! other than that, it was a great experience. good replay value based on the fact that you can approach the game in many ways storywise and gamplaywise writing this after my first playthrough. definetly get sons of liberty, adds variety to the game. contracts and gigs are a bit repetitive sadly."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,graphicsawesome with some room for improvement story so far great sound design awesome to alright
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,amazing action gameplay with a couple of drama and so many other extras.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,overall great game with facinating playability and story.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"played it a lot, it's an amazing game. i know that it had a rough start so i'm glad i played it now instead of then. i'm almost finished with the game even after so many hours. always been obsessed with the cyberpunk genre but having such a big world to explore is amazing. can't wait to see the new shows and whatever project orion will bring."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,cool game. bit glitchy but mechanically it's lots of fun and the story  style is preem. plus it has keanu.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,awesome game i love the story and the open world. combat is very good.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"ive only played 5 hours but from what ive played this games great. the driving is good but it does take a while to adjust as it is a bit sensititve. the gun play is fun and most other things are good. a few downsides, i dont enjoy that at any point you can get shot at by enemies like i was driving to a mission and i just get shot at like crazy and it took me 20 minutes to just get to the mission. i also don't enjoy the bd missions as they are very slow and boring but apart from that this game is amazing"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"great game. after multiple years of patches, its finally the game that was promised. incredibly well optimised."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,love the game so far except the driving but the rest makes up for it. runs great on the legion go.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"it took a long time for the devs to address all the issues in the game but now it is finally fixed. the story is amazing, and the combat upgrades quickly turns your character into a ruthless killing machine. the city is also quite interesting to explore, and your motorbike is your best friend for navigation, or take the metro."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,amazing story and dlc
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"this game is a 1010 for me, i am currently on my 2nd playthrough of the game. the graphics, environment, storybuilding and overall uniqueness of the game is what makes it perfect to me. i stupidly met hanako at embers relativily quickly in my second playthrough and i'm just finding out about all the stuff that i missed out on. can't wait to play the dlc. a 100 would recommend game to anyone looking for their next favorite game."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,i played this game on launch date... and after buying it for the pc and seeing how much its changed.... damn it feels like a whole different game and its actually so good now.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-21,"this game is good, but god dam it still feels like its in beta."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"highly recommended this game because this game is very wide, open world ang graphic like gta 5"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"it's funny, but the beginning of sales of this game was terrible."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"this might be the best story game i have ever played. i've only gotten one ending as of writing this but it was so well written that i don't want to try a different path and make this one feel less cannon even though i didn't find the ending satisfying. i can barely bring myself to keep playing from my last checkpoint because it would be a change in the events of my game and feel off, i might try tomorrow. the gameplay is amazing, traveling feels great, the city feels massive and the combat and stealth are amazing as well. the voice acting and music are movielevel too, just like the writing. one aspect of the game that shocked me is that the breathtaking graphics ran on my laptop with 0 crashes, great loading times, and the only glitches being a few boxes jumping in a shelve when something touched them every few hours. this is easily the most freefeeling game i've ever played with all the different weapons and cyberware and i feel like almost anyone could enjoy it because of all the ways to play the game. i highly recommend this game to anyone interested and can easily say it is a 1010 game, and despite not paying for it because i got it though family sharing, i can say without a doubt that it is worth every penny. i have incredible respect for the development team and everyone that helped to make this game as perfect as it is even with the rough release. i hope you found my review helpfull and decide to try this game if you have the chance. goodbye. update i bought myself a copy of the game along with the dlc partially to post this review because of how much i want this to convince more people to play this masterpiece."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,peak peak peak. peak play this. every side gig and the whole story my only problem are the ''wait to be called'' quests.. and a little bit of bugs but its enjoyable.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"already played this on ps5 so i wanted to play it again on pc with mods to enhance my experience. i gotta say that this game is great and i love it but the amount of visual bugs almost made me stop playing already tried if it was a mods issue but it wasn't. having to optimise settings to fix them at the cost of lower performance and other shit is very annoying and i'm always crossing my fingers that it will run and look fine everytime i load in the game bruh. other than that crap, it's a great game with a great story, amazing graphics when it works, and memerable characters. 910 for me if only they actually fixed everything ."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,this game has amazing story characters and gameplay. theres a bunch of side quest to do with interesting lore
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"one of the best games of all time. as a guy who has sunk at least 2 years into morrowind, this is the closest i've come to playing something as amazing and free."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"an absolute mess upon launch i still had fun though, played about 80 hrs then stopped for awhile, came back after the 2.0 update and finished my playthrough they got rid of some features i liked but they fixed most of the problems i had previously encountered. i am quite annoyed with the price of the dlc considering the state the game was in at launch and its 80 cad pricetag. overall this was an excellent game visually and story wise with great replayability, it has become one of my top 5 favourite games of the last 10 years."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"i love it. it's a bit on rails sometimes when you start a story related quests. i think they could have done a bit more to make these parts more interactive instead of jumping from conversation to conversation. that said the story could easily make a blockbuster film. you can easily take a break from the story and just enjoy the city. i completed the main campaign, then started modding it, modded in and started a new game before attempting the dlc. added a ton of immersion, quality of life mods and just stuff to bring the world alive. so far i've had no conflicts with 64 mods, all just drag and drop to game folder. then i started the a new game and haven't put it down. i'm honestly shocked at how easily moddable the game is and just the sheer scope of some of the mods. they are seamless as well, like they should have been there all along. overall very satisfied. money well spent."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,the saddest i have been in recent memory was finishing this game and uninstalling it. 1010
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"don't play it on very hard and you won't have a frustrating experience i can't in good conscience recommend that decision for your first playthrough.. unless you find the frustrating part of dying over and over again fun, of course! basically, what i mean is, every one becomes your worst enemy, you either get 1shot, 2shot, or 3shot, no exceptions, don't matter how much armor you have, it doesn't exist, it's a joke and you better stock up on healing items and be prepared to run in circles or hide like a little bitch behind cover for a while when you're begging god almighty to recharge your healing items for your next inevitable use. the game is nice, there's a lot to do, and the characters are interesting to interact with, keep in mind that you'll be playing as someone else, you are not roleplaying as yourself, you are roleplaying as v. if you find that uncool for any reason you should look for something different to play.. i'd recommend fallout new vegas or the outer worlds not biased at all, totally, don't check out my profile to confirm.."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"amazing game, i recommend it for who like playing games with alot of ability's of controlling the character, and thos who like to experience new things completely freely, special combats, betting fights, mission fights, combat with various types of weapons, high ability to develop and upgrade skills before entering a fight and even during combat the ability to modify skills and use them to suit the situation you are in combat, a great game."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,great game! i didnt really enjoy it the first time around but after updates this game runs pretty well on my set up also the edge runners anime really helped me get into it tbh
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"having played this game since launch day on the xbox one, xbox series x, and here on pc, i have a lot of things i can say about this game, but don't have the patience to type it all out here. the very horrible, false advertised and extremely buggy launch of cyberpunk still leaves a sour taste in my mouth. however with the improvements in performance, bug fixes, and major overhauls to almost everything in the years post launch, i'm now able to give this game credit where it was well overdue. there's still a lot that i wish can be done to this game, but it's an almost perfect product that i can recommend to anyone who not only enjoys a good story, but to anyone who enjoys open world and single player games similar to me. in short, cyberpunk has had a lot of ups and downs and still some very minor ones that can be ignored, but has made one hell of a comeback from the mess that was it's original release."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,o como  bom transar com a puta profissional o vem fuder no clima quente no calor de 30 grau.  quase escrevi professional com c vou me matar
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,good game and the best part is playing offline mode if you not on wifi
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"came for the hype, stayed for the content. i am reaching a point where i just cannot 100 every games, and i am fed up by easy useless side quests in infinite open worlds. however, this game organises its content in a quite honest way, letting you know how far your are straying from the main quest when choosing a mission. doing the main and main characters' quests, it took me 35ish hours to finish it, with a satisfactory completion of that world, and state of my character. buy it !"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"one of the best games i have ever played. some little things are bothering me but nothing that breaks the awesome storytelling and cool characters, also the awesome looks of the game. 1010"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"honestly, this game has been one of my favorites of all time since patch 1.6 fixed all the major bugs and cleaned up the ui and gigs. 2.0 is just icing on the cake for me, and a great example of a proper expansion vs. dlc. if you don't like the game at this point, then it's just not your kinda game, and that's cool. the actual major problems are long gone."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"you can just walk around the entire map and still find a lot to enjoy. now that the bugs have been mostly fixed i can say it's a fantastic incredible game. the map and world building are absolutely beautiful and the mechanics and fights are very well done. i'm not a big fan of first person shooters but this game was an exception. also, all the quests are fun and don't get repetitive."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,it was amazing at launch. its absolutely breath taking now
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"just approaching the end of my first play through. started out sceptical of first person only, but gradually got used to it. would still prefer at least the option of third person, but we have what we have. i know this is a just a shooterlooter with motor vehicles, not a dating simulator nor base builder, but i would like to have seen a more expansive romance setup. besides the above minor quibble, cdpr have created a fantastic world with immersive stories, side quests and interesting characters, and i'm glad i took the plunge. also like the few hattips to witcher 3"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,i wish there a biochip that make me forget this game so i can experience this story once again

Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"remember... the game is fixed.  idris elba it took some time, and they still deserve all the criticism in the world for releasing it in the state they did... but this game is really good. especially phantom liberty. it's almost not worth playing without it. but the world, the characters, the voice acting, the story is all some of the best i've ever experienced in a aaa game like this. i've been a fan of night city and cyberpunk for years before playing this, and to see the city and the characters i've only seen in my imagination so fully realised in a product like this is just so fulfilling. probably my favourite game of all time."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"unforgettable experience. one of the master pieces that would be remembered and talked about in the decades to come in video game history. i sincerely appreciate the dedication to tell a great story and an immersive universe. for me, there is little i can ask for more."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,810 i didnt like the ending for the main game also dog town one too for president it would be 910 otherwise just wish all the setup i did for the ending mattered i did the panam ending and i think its good just the whole part of 6 months to live this was kinda cheap felt like none of the hard work i did really mattered i know its left to interpritation weather v found another way to live after besides that it was sweet a bit short for me also the dog town dlc has highs and lows like 4 hours of padding is crazy also felt very unsatifying for the end i guess thats the point still dont like it but over all i liked it never want to go in dog town again though its awful to navigate ill give the dlc a 710 because it had great moments
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"love this game, but damn steam u really gotta fix the playtime, stuffs weird played for 67 hrs shows 3hrs"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"wait until i have a child... i'm gonna still put this game to them to play, even in next 10 years. this game is 'g o a t'"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"very immersive, story is good so far, voice actors are quite good too and the characters are believable and feel like actual beings rather than lifeless npcs. v just feels a little off at times"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,gun play is good. the perks system is large and complex. overall easy to understand what skill trees do what and they have many overlapping perks to learn later in the game adding replayability to an already very interesting story and world. scifi isn't always just the imagining of the world in the future but an exaggerated reflection of today's world this game is very that. be prepared for a gritty and grim look at a world consumed by consumerism and obsessed with recognition.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"i played this when it first came out and it was pretty much unplayable. i'm glad i waited for all the bugs to be ironed out. this is probably the most immersive and realistic city i've seen in a game. the hordes of people walking on sidewalks and crossing the street, cars stuck in traffic honking, the occasional psycho driving wrecklessly... it makes it feel like i'm walking around in an actual city. that being said, there are some issues i have with the game, but not enough to warrant a negative review. pros  combat is a lot of fun, and the quick hacks add a lot of depth  the story, characters, and writing are excellent  a ton of weapon and carmotorcycle variety  keanu reeves cons  the whole crime system is pretty bad. you can murder dozens of civilians with a ton of witnesses all around, then hide in an alley for a minute or two, and the cops forget all about you and you can go about your day.  there is no stealing. no breaking into stores after hours and stealing anything left on the shelves.  vendors are there 247. they never close their shop. they never sleep or eat or use the bathroom. this breaks immersion a little bit.  the quest markers are in kilometers, but your car's speed is in miles per hour... wtf?"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,really love how open world this game is and the graphics of this game are outta of this world at the lowest graphics this game looks good and feels good wish they were more games like this that were actually good.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"i really enjoyed this gamw! although it was difficult to understand what was going on, after 3 playthroughs i understood not only the main story, but also the side missions, the dlc, and what certain choices can lead to the worst outcome. i still see myself playing this game even after multiple playthroughs, and dont think i would ever be an ashole to johnny, unless it became an achievement, which i hope never happens. i only wish they added more dlc as the story is really captivating, making me wish that they made more content for the game."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"cyberpunk 2077 is nothing short of incredible. from the sprawling neonlit streets of night city to the deeply immersive narrative, the game delivers an experience that's both visually stunning and emotionally gripping. the attention to detail is remarkable, with every corner of the world feeling alive and full of possibility. the characters are complex, and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat, offering multiple paths and outcomes that make every decision feel significant. it's a thrilling, oneofakind adventure that sets a new standard for openworld rpgs."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"910, loved it, can't find another game that gave me the same feel right now and it's driving me mad. i skipped when it released, waited til now, so glad. a few minor technical hiccups in 80 hours of play. i'll be going back to night city someday."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,it's literally peak. imagine fallout but in a relatively good ending of humanity.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"choom, go klep this game! cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece, in both gameplay and storytelling. full stop. it's a damn shame that it was released in such a sad state in 2020. the updates have turned it from a barely running piece of corpotrashware into something truly phenomenal. cdpr deserves their flowers for keeping working on this game, opposed to most companies who just klep the money and delta. story, choice, quests cdpr made very nuanced characters, difficult and meaningful story choices, and great quests. i've had to pause on numerous occasions to just... sit with the weight of some of my decisions. there is no way to make everyone happy. the world of night city is a world where you will make enemies, you will have to make the hard choices, and you will have to be a heartless bastard to survive. silverhand, takemura, misty, jackie m'fing welles, judy, panam, kerry and so many more organic, well fleshed out characters populate this world. in fact, i enjoyed them so much, i found myself saddened by how short some of their questlines were, especially in the case of river ward, some of the fixers, and eurodyne. combat my combat loop, even at level 34, was already relatively complex, which i enjoy from my games. i'm a dual lover of tacshooters think escape from tarkov, squad, and stalker and expansive, rich open world rpg titles dragon age, elder scrolls, kingdom come deliverance and this almost seamlessly melds the action one expects from those same shooters and the combat effects one expects from those rpg titles. gunplay is good, not great, but i have a higher standard for that particular element than most. one note i have for alot of rpg lovers is something that helped me immensely your cyberdeck is just a spell book, and quick hacks are just spells. ram is mana. wish reviewers drew that comparison more often. very poignant agitprop, mirroring the world we live in now to an uncomfortable degree. i wish some of the mechanics were better utilized, but outside of that and other minor foibles such as short storylines for some characters it's damn near perfect. i can't wait to start a new playthrough and go through the dlc. 1010."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"i have bought this game on xbox and steam, and i am qualified to say that this game is even funner on pc! i definately reccomend it to all gamers, whether you like rpg's to fps, this game has everything you would want with mods and customization. i also suggest watching the edgerunners show on netflix."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"this review is going to be very biased because honestly, cyberpunk 2077 is my favorite game of all time. to me, this game is perfect. the story is amazing and the atmosphere is perfect. this is the type of the game i wish i could replay for the first time. there are so many missions that make you feel real emotion for the characters and difficult decisions that make you question your own morals. the customization is great, plenty of clothing options, cars, weapons and body augmentations, but what i think really makes the game's customization shine, is how versatile you can make your characters abilities. if you wanna be a hacker that is in and out of a job without a trace, you can. if you want to go berserk, run in guns blazing and ignore damage you can. if you want to zip around, slowing down time, slice enemies into pieces and bury throwing knives into their faces, you can. you can also be any combination of those, and more. i was not apart of the original hype to cyberpunk that turned out to be a huge failure at first. i played this game after the 1.2 patch a while back. i was in love with the game then and with each new update i've only fell more in love with the game. the update and release of phantom liberty has only made the game better and better. i'm not going to beat a dead horse, if you want a singleplayer game that will be an experience that will stick with you forever you won't regret buying this. i know not everyone will agree, but this is the first game i have ever considered a 1010 game."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,the story is so fun and there is so many paths that you can go down and i like how the choices you make along the way will affect your game is the future.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"saying this game had a glow up is the worlds biggest understatement. this games story alone warrants buying it, and the gameplay adds another cherry on top. couldn't recommend it more."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"one of the best openworld environments i have seen in a videogame. it is immersive and stunning, but the world is very adult especially right off the bat. all in all, an amazing experience if you enjoy scifi tech, dystopian futuristic cities like new york with neon, and a world that feels truly lived in, then this is a mustplay. the technology requirements can be quite harsh though."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,"the unfinished launch put me off buying this game for years until someone recommended it to me  for 20 it's deffo a good deal. mods are easy to install. runs pretty smoothly even on a mid tier pc. it's like a mix of fallout 4, witcher 3, gta5  watch dogs."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-20,very rich story line and awesome game play!
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,game is so fun i been on it for hours i went to sleep woke up then took a shower and ate then went back to playing even without the dlc the game is so much fun and really makes you feel like your their and people make vr mods for it that just makes the game 4x better
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,compelling world with a lot of complexity that lets you build a unique character in every run. very fun entry into the world!
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,one of the best games i have ever played i did not encounter any technical problems the story was beautiful and the graphics were beyond imagination
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"so far i like it many things to do and learn insane graphics nice music to, driving is weird and personal i don't like talking i skip all dialogs.i recommend it"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"excellent game world, characters and storyside missions. after a rocky first year it was well worth the wait for the game that finally emerged"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,gameplay is awesome graphics are awesome play this game bru
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"one of the best open world story games i have ever played in my life. i have finished all of the endings, almost finished all side quests. amazing game had so much fun playing would heavily recommend 9.510"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,not since i was a child did a video game have such an effect on me when completed. the sense of a void unable to be filled after completion of this game is very unpleasant.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,very good game i can finally fry the brain of every person that mildly annoysd me in public 1010 i love poland
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"the romance options add a cool touch, and the story, along with side missions, kept me hooked. character customization is great, and combat is super fun, whether its hacking or gunfights. i do wish the sword combat had more variety in animations, as they can feel a bit repetitive. that said, the combat overall is dynamic, and switching between different playstyleswhether it's ranged, stealth, or meleekeeps things fresh. i really enjoy the game's atmosphere, especially the mix of neon lights and dark alleywaystheres a gritty, yet vibrant energy that brings the city to life. i just hope npcs and objects have more reactions or better physics to make the world feel even more alive. i really hope more games like this come out in the future. id definitely spend some eddies on more experiences like this."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"after buying a graphics card for this game, my bank account is zero zero zero oh no."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"love the game! i love all the details and playing it on geforce now on my steamdeck is absolutely amazing! i'm just going around reading all the little chips with stories on it, gives you a much better idea of the world in the game and how things have changed from the norm we're used to now. the controls are a bit awkward when you're driving but otherwise amazing."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"i refused to buy this game on launch because i knew it would be overhyped, and it was. since then, the game pulled itself out of it's own hell and became one of the best rpgs i have ever played. 65 stars"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"the gameplay and the sheer number of ways to tackle missions are just insane. the characters feel real, the writing is toptier, and the world is so immersiveit just feels right. every choice matters, and whether you go in guns blazing, sneak around, or hacking, it all feels incredibly satisfying. and with the phantom liberty expansion, its 10 times bettermore story, more depth, and even more reasons to keep playing. one of my favourite games ever."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,rough start on release but the devs pulled through what an amazing  immersive game. one of my all time favorites.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,absolutely amazing game play and story line
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,awesome game even on low graphics lol if your thinking about getting it i would say its pretty worth it
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"probably the easiest game of the year candidate if released in current state. never had high expectations  given ruined reputation of cd projekt red and 'meme' status gained from all the launch controversies. i'm glad i gave it a chance eventually, i've had too much fun for someone that isn't even interested in scifi at all. shame, that it was released a couple of years too early, alas...  try it , 100 worth the full price now."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"absolutely fantastic game. this game exhibits a variety of options for you to take on night city. be it weapons, cars, story choices, and of course your cyberware. all these decisions help decide how you will complete your journey. i have not even mentioned the story and how you will become a legend in this city of dreams. this game most certainly deserves a play through, if not multiple playthroughs."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"awesome game, great graphics, great gameplay, and keanu reeves.. what more do you need  seriously though, it was a really fun play through, with a massive open world that is pretty darn nice to look at. you have plenty of places to explore, lots and lots of side missions and a ridiculous number of weapons to play with. the crafting and upgrading system was overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of it you find that it's really what the whole game is built around and becomes the driving force of the game. it was cool to have keanu play a main role and i liked the combination of racingdriving, fps, storyquesting and decision making. go ahead and buy it, you'll have fun!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"only played the game after phantom liberty so cant talk on how bad the game use to be, that being said, the game is overall fun. the story to begin with felt enjoyable up till the end of the game start. from there it felt like a mixed bag with certain quest lines feeling like the greatest of any fps i have played and others felt like a slog to get through. phantom liberty on the other hand felt different and was by far the best part of the game with a good variety in how missions can unfold. on top of the main story, side missions were fun and were never too long to keep you interested same goes for the optional gigs and the ncpd call out locations. they make for an overall enjoyable experience."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"played it during launch on ps4, i'm happy to say that the things the game was lacking were added in later updates! i'm glad that they kept on working on the game instead of dropping it."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"what a game. the story is beautiful, the world is a work of art, the soundtrack is immaculate. i'm definitely gonna be thinking about it for a while. give it a go, eh?"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,its so sad i cant even open the game without it crashing not sure if its my pc or the game itself but i know i can play destiny with all the dlc's just fine with makes it even worse can't even refund it now either hope they fix it soon
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,this game need to be marinated for 5 years until is good. nice cooked cdpr
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"graphics   this game has it's own world and the graphics make it immersive enough to get lost in it. character design   memorable characters that will make you love them, hate them and even fck them. playability   defensively very accessible to any gamer who decides to pick it up. has a few things that need getting used to with the controls but very accessible after a few hours. story   very rich story telling, i mean that is what cd project red does, they deliver stories in a form of a videogame. memorable to the core and made me come back over and over again. sound   one of the best in this genre of gaming. good gun sound and car sound. amazing music that will make you want to stay in the rain and cry and say it's just the rain. also, grimes heart longevity   it's as big as it gets for a single player game. not much to do besides side quests after the main story is complete. a dlc came after which gave more life to it but that's all you get. i would say about 90 hours of unmitigated fun. after that is just completion and exploration. ingame purchases   none, as there are no micro transactions. only thing you would should spend on is the dlc once the main game is completed. competitiveness   i mean, there's no multiplayer, so there's nothing you can compete for. unless you wan't to speed run the game. similar games  mass effect trilogy story telling deus ex for the similar vibes atomic heart shootingpowersstory and characters cloudpunk cyberpunk city vibes ghostrunner 12 cyber vibes mirror's edge for the dystopian world the ascent cyber vibes, loot and shoot this game...just chefs kiss i give this game 9 chooms outta 10"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"the great story , the great game"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"the quintessential dystopian cyberpunk experience! enjoyable and fully functional combat mechanics, with a full range of melee and ranged weapons. neuromancer fans will appreciate the body upgrades and net hacks. open world exploration on foot or in vehicles cars, bikes trucks realistic conversations and language use, interesting and engaging main storyline with plenty of side quests. the list goes on, and you don't need a list  just play, and immerse yourself in this highly detailed and comprehensive experience, the best i have played in a long time."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,great story. missions can be played like you want. i bought this game at launch and it was unplayable buggy mess but right now it is in good state. there are still some bugs i experienced but most of them were just funny bugs. to new players i highly recommend doing all side missions as they are as great as main story. this game was just great experience overall.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"fucking fantastic, its an improvement on the fallout esque style game, if this idea was taken further that would be awesome, i hope they bring more parkour movement in the next game"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"this may be peak, all of it, put like 30 hours in the past 3 days, i really needed to finish it, wonderful game"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"after all the updates, i really enjoyed this game. not perfect, but a great game to play and enjoy. i had fun but probably wouldn't play it through again. got a decent pc and monitor? get the game on sale, great experience!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"good action, story, environment. not looking at all the hype and initial letdown, etc, this is objectively an impressive game in it's scope, worldbuilding, and fun."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"graphics are insane, the atmosphere was beautiful. the plot could be a little better, especially since it felt rushed."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"talk about the comeback kid, the story was always present in this game the delivery was just rough at the start. coming back to play this game now for the third full playthrough i've done, this game is a masterclass of storytelling and immersion. one of the best performances from keanu reeves ive ever seen, enough to bring a tear to my eye. also the dlc goes crazy and makes you hate yourself. wires and chainssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"as someone who didn't play it until way after launch, all i can say is that this is one of the best games i've ever played."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"holy shit the game's awesome now that they've made all these major patches and reworks into the game. had be engrossed and immersed from beginning to end. what a tragic, messed up world cyberpunk's is. fun, but ultimately tragic."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"cyberpunk 2077 is such a unique game, not only due to it's absurdly complex universe, that's got it's own historic events, wars and whatnot, that's also vast to the point where one could spend hours talking nonstop and still not get to the first half, it's also unique due to it's interactive world that's got so many stories to tell, night city is a living thing, with it's social issues, falling economy, corruption, the list goes on. although there remain all those problems, gangs on pretty much every street, little to no nature, etc, the city still has so much beauty to show with it's immense buildings, that look so futuristic yet so aged, giving the player this extremely dystopia to experience. as far as the story goes, the main missions are quite few, but the game counts on making you want to complete every single side mission and quest, because you will find yourself enjoying it perhaps even more than the main missions themselves, that's on account of how immersive the whole cyberpunk experience feels, getting to the point where you will feel part of it somehow, in a way that the side missions work together with the main storyline to make an absolute banger, with impeccable storytelling, and the dlc is a perfect addition to those feelings, with extra content, a brand new region, new characters, new equipment and all. however, we must not forget the disastrous game launch, with a far more empty open world, poorly designed police, overall dumb npcs, lack of polish and the enormous number of bugs. but, cd project red did not give up on delivering the game they wanted out, managing to get the game almost perfect at version 2.0, and adding things we didn't even know we needed with phantom liberty, and as i speak, the game still doesn't fail on releasing new updates with new creative additions, bug fixes and quality of life changes, getting this game to it's absolute peak. the graphics on this are a whole experience by themselves except for the food, making you want to screenshot every corner, every detail, every view, and every street thats got some colorfull led that was purposely placed to make the raytracing technology really stand out. you may find a different type of difficulty while playing this game because the hardest part doesn't tend to be the combat or anything similar, but due to how much freedom you are given with the way you do things, you will see yourself constantly struggling to decide what is the right choice, every dialog gives you dozens of possibilities, every mission allows you to get to the objective through your own ways, that sometimes will be limited by the way you build your v to be, a netrunner, a slick shooter, an absolute maniac that can kill dozens in seconds, all depends on your choices on where to apply your skill points and on which cybernetics you'll be using. all that gives you enough different paths to make so that you may replay the entire game in many totally different ways that will offer a whole new experience everytime. if you are looking for an immersive experience, with outstanding storytelling that may or may not bring tears to your eyes and a complex universe to dive into, cyberpunk 2077 might be one of your best picks, the game is, as i've mentioned, at it's absolute peak, deserving attention from anyone that's never given it a chance or from anyone who played at launch and disliked it. 1010, absolute masterpiece."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"i'm so glad i finally got to play this. it's been in the back of my mind for years now, but i just hadn't gotten around to it. 20 something hours in and i'm still loving every second. it reminds me of an unholy child of botw and borderlands, and i love it so so so much. cannot recommend it enough."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"ill give the game props for what it does well. combat, story, and characters are all really good. i love how cute panam is as a girlfriend for the player. jackie is a really cool and plenty of the other characters you meet along the way. adam smasher has got to be one of the hardestcoolest looking boss i've seen out side of the soul series. the only thing i wish this game did was take an extra week or so and get the small details... like the food on the table looking like a painted on puddle, and really badly rendered french fries. its such a small detail but when youre playing the side missions and you sit down to eat and glance at the food, it just takes me out of the game and i laugh a little. not all of the food is like this, alot of the foods on a stick im gonna guess look the way they are supposed too, but good luck finding anything that would make you say id try that in the open world. out of my love for the edge runner series, and how good the combat feels, i would recommend this to most, so long as they have a good enough computer. the multiple endings are really cool and making different characters for different builds is a nice way of getting reimmersed when you choose a different start. i would give this game a solid 910. it just needed an extra minute in the oven to get the little things. or even an update would probably fix it, im not a tech guy but my character is."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,the only story game ever besides far cry 5 that made me replay it multiple times 1010 would nut again
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"great game, me go fast, throw knoife at skull, make good crack sound, me recommend."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"played it on console, really enjoyed it. got it on pc. it's a good time. i have yet to play phantom liberty but i'm really looking forward to it"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,great graphics and story line. some glitches here and there but all in all great game.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"the simu feel of nc in edgerunners, and then playing the game, both feels right, the graphics and interaction of the characters is one of the main reasons why i keep playing this game and probably will continue to do so, the sandevistan is probably the main reason"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"don't get me wrong, this game is still a buggy piece of shit but i'm having so much fun that i've already got my money's worth and i'm barely into the story at all."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,a beautiful but buggy game.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"incredibly good game. most livedin city environment i have ever seen. absolutely beautiful visuals and intriguing story. also a metric ton of side missions and events. took me about 160 hours to 100, would still play more."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"took me a while to get into it at the start, but as i'm playing through and levelling up it is getting more enjoyable and easier"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"i bought this game far after release, on sale, and i gotta say, totally worth it. playing cyberpunk a couple years after release feels great. i managed to not get any spoilers and did a blind playthrough that lasted just under 100 hours. i heard the complaints on release, but i was met with few bugs, a couple weird visuals, and no gamebreaking bugs. thoroughly impressed with the story and choices for a variable narrativemultiple endings, and the skill tree and cyberware allows you to play in very unique ways. the world looked great but obviously pushed my build to the limit, a 3080ti was struggling with max graphics, so i settled for maximum raytracing and played at about 50fps the whole time. i played almost exclusively in first person even while driving for a more immersive experience, and i would strongly recommend exclusively driving motorcycles so you can beat traffic and take in the breathtaking world. if you're seeing this in 2025 onwards, definitely give it a go."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,what more is there to say that hasn't already been said? easily one of the best games ever made. must play.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,a little confusing at first but its fun.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"cyberpunk 2077 is a very content rich game that has a lot of playstyles and options to traverse. i wish there were a lot more cosmetic options, particularly with prosthetics, but i really enjoy the quests and gameplay."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"amazing labor of love. had interesting choices, fun gameplay, and a great story."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"one of the best game with great environment design. i still jump back into it sometimes to be a part of night city, a beautiful dystopia."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,highly recommend. very immersive. lots of content. combat is great. driving is great. never fast travel. always drive. first person always. type 66 avenger. katana. smart tracking shotgun. silverhand's pistol. good times.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"immersive game play in an enormous world. fun elements of exploration, racing cars, gunfights, interesting characters, surprising encounters, humorous moments and a very good story. obviously it's dark, but i was surprised how very very rated r the whole world is. you just can't escape the nudity, drugs, violence, etc. it's almost everywhere. picking up the game a few years after release means i don't have any way of comparing it to launch, but the game today is worth buying, and the phantom liberty content is awesome."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,amazing game the first imrpession is the ugliness of npcs in this game. if 2077 beauty standard is low deep in the hole like in this game then i'm glad that i wont make it to 2077
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"where do i begin, well the launch of the game was a huge oil spill. that is true, however in phantom liberty and onward, cyberpunk 2077 has not only broke the ground, but it's really made a name for itself. i would say that in the last decade cyberpunk is in the running for the top 10 games out there. the environment details in this master crafted world by cdpr is absolutely, 'breathtaking' and i could not ask for a better game to immerse several hundred more hours into."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"i got this game day 1 on ps4 when it first released, and then returned it after 2 hours cause of how it was buggy. now, after all the optimizations, and bug fixes all these years later, i can safely say that this game has an amazing story not just in its main campaign but the side gigs and jobs that hit you in the gut, and make you wonder, what is the morally correct choice? that's the sort of rich story standard cyberpunk 2077 is at the moment."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,there is a depth to this game that surprises me. it feels like every part of the whole experience work together very well. the story is interesting and gives characters room to be characters. with game play it feels like you can do whatever style suits you. this is perhaps my new favorite open world sandbox game.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,fun main story line doesn't last long but tons of side quests
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"yes, this game was absolute booty crumbs when it came out. but now after years of multiple fixes and updates and an amazing 1010 dlc, i can safely say this has been a game that i have been looking forward to getting on pc after playing through it on console. mods, here i come!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"great game with an amazing storyline, very immersive and no longer riddled with bugs, highly recommend!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,fun and immersive gameplay complimented by stunning visuals. cyberpunk 2077 is a great rpg for those who enjoy a game with a futuristic steam punk setting
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"overall great game, tons of content, fantastic dlc, hooked me from the beginning till the end."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"cyberpunk 2077 is a remarkably immersive, futuristic experience that successfully transports players into a sprawling neonlit metropolis full of intrigue, style, and depth. from the first moments in night city, its clear the developer invested immense effort in crafting a living, breathing world that teems with activity around every corner. the city itself stands out as one of the most visually stunning backdrops in modern gaming, complete with towering skyscrapers, bustling markets, and atmospheric back alleys bursting with neon glow. the games storyline delivers a compelling mixture of corporate politics, streetlevel power plays, and personal growth. your journey evolves through meaningful dialogue choices and branching paths, providing a level of agency that adds weight to every decision. complex characters, each with their own motivations and struggles, anchor the story and make it deeply engaging. johnny silverhands presence in particular is a highlight, offering a unique dynamic that shapes the players perspective on night city and the forces at work within it. cyberpunk 2077 truly shines in its roleplaying elements. you can shape v into a wellhoned netrunner, an unstoppable solo, or a versatile mix of both. the breadth of weapon options and hacking abilities caters to different playstyles, and theres a deep sense of progression and customization throughout. even the augmentations you choose, from subdermal armor to advanced reflex boosters, affect gameplay and immersion, giving the sense that your character is constantly evolving and adapting to the citys challenges. beyond the core story, night city is packed with side quests that often rival main missions in quality. these tasks introduce fascinating locales, hidden lore, and memorable characters, all of which reinforce the citys gritty depth. whether youre infiltrating corporate strongholds or unearthing conspiracies in the darkest corners of the slums, theres always a sense of discovery waiting around the next glowing signpost. while any largescale game can have its share of technical hurdles, cyberpunk 2077s ongoing updates reflect a commitment to refining the experience and expanding its vibrant world. the enthralling narrative, diverse gameplay choices, and lush cyberpunk setting combine into a unique adventure that stands among the most ambitious rpgs in recent memory. if youre ready to explore a bold new future where style meets substance, cyberpunk 2077 offers a thoroughly engaging ride that delivers both visually and narratively."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"while still fraught with bugs, the game nonetheless accomplishes what it sets out to do"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,i can say that i am really enjoying the experience! night city is such an enthralling place with a stellar atmosphere. i just started playing the game in 2025 ik where have i been living! under a rock?? but i already see why so many people have fallen in love with this game. open world is my vibe and i didn't know what to expect but wow has this game made me feel good. you really get connected with the characters. game feels like it's real.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"i wanted to play it for many years but could not due to a lack of hardware, the experience has been very worthwhile so far. characters are interesting, environment is awesome, combat feels decent, my only gripe is that i wish there was more customization for things like vehicles or v's apartment."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,i hope they make a second cyberpunk. awesome game and a true redemption story them fixing the game. stunning graphics and runs really well these days. i did my first run through on a gtx 1080 and it was smooth as butter
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"ok this is great gaming experience. rough at the edges but one of the greatest rpgs out there 2025 marriage of gta v style living world but much more living and modern rpgs storytelling best ive seen  every important dialog is directed and if you read fast the conversations feel natural like in the movie. some elements are not in game important details but are nice to have like whole car buying arc and there is no proper armor.. come on cd project.. you have hideo kojima came hidden in the prologue but you don't have metal gear style armor in the game.. shame...  combat is shooter like and might be less interesting to a classic rpg fan but is not that difficult and most of it can be avoided stealthy ninja is a valid route for most of the game on the minus side not many romancing options, i get main characters have long romance storylines but there are only 4 one night stands and 4 sexworkers 2 each gender. this is not main part of the game but in the depraved night city is not enough... crafting looks like an afterthought, only ever crafted ammo. main minuses there are 2 main implants that changes and enhance the game sandevistan slowing time in combat super cool, well executed and cyberdeck that let you hac opponents and furniture 2 great atmospheric options but you cant use both at the same time... bad design in a game that is single player story. balance is for online shooters... second thing is that in most conversations choice is illusory, you can or have to go through every option third minus is that game spawns same models for random city dwellers at random and it can result in 2 identical hot dog vendors standing super close to each other sometimes breaking city immersion. highly recommend i am surprised how good this game is."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"i had to drop it at launch due to its wellknowned bad launch, and picked it up again after a few years of good patches. i have to say it was a great decision. i liked the story, good characters, and personally, the best part is its excelent gameplay. felt like a kid when fighting with my build around throwing knives, katana, mantis blades, and the sandevistan, specially against the final boss. i had a blast feeling like a ninja, such a good portrait of high speed, good movility and time manipulation. despite still running into some minor bugs, i still absolutely recommend playing it and getting immersed in all the posible builds and storyline outcomes."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,the game i use to play it on my ps4 when it first released. it was really lag and a mess but i really liked the open world the lore and the combat. fast forward a year or 2 i got a pc and thought to replay this game on steam. comparativly the game has improved alot from the first time i played it and now. it is a must have if u like gta 5 or games like that
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"this is 5th time i played this game, and i very much enjoy it. the story is decent, but the dlc story? amazing. the combat is diverse and great. i really like a netrunner build as i can hack my enemies while i shoot at them which essentially two attacks at once. the acting is great, and you really get invested into the main characters. as for the mc, i think both voice actors are phenomenal, but i lean towards the female v. i think the voice actor does a better job. overall, this is a wonderful game."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"i am very lucky to be able to play this after they fixed their horrific launch. there are still bugs, but these are nowhere near enough to be annoying at all. the graphics and setting are absolutely amazing, with the lighting being my favorite part. my only gripe is how the mission system seems to violently encourage you to go straight into a new mission, despite it not being required. if it had something like the rdr way of missions, where you go to a location to start the mission, it would be a 10, but it stands at an 810 for me."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,this game is simply fantastic....however my only complaint is it crashes a lot and i am not sure why. i have tweaked the settings to even lower quality but still has issues with the game crashing. other than that i have no complaints.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"a visceral firstperson experience like no other. a deepdive into the actionpackeddramatic whatifs of hightech, lowlife balanced with immersive game play. the design of night city and surrounding areas made me want to explore this game for years, despite the sometimes heartwrenching stories and sequences one may come across during game play and general exploration. the various factions, styles, cultures, and color were incredibly detailed and it was obvious that the team put their soul into this game. i can't wait to see what cdpr and mike smith have planned for the future of this digital series."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"might be one of the best, if not the best, games i've ever played. the story is engaging, the actors do a phenomenal job, the world is immersive and so is the combat especially if you take your time with it and experiment, really get to know the game and the way its pacing works. i'm 26 and haven't had this much fun playing a game in years if ever. the only thing missing, which might be a big ask considering tech limitations, would be npc interactions. i'd at least love it if we were able to have 3 options like in red dead  i think it was something like greet, dismiss or intimidate? idk, forgot. anyway, you can press f to get a response, but honestly this will be something that you'll be able to mod yourself, especially with ai integration into video games. anyway, highly recommend. you can sink hours into this. 910. once you understand the games flow, it forces you into a very satisying flowstate, zone, focus, whatever you wanna call it."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"um jogo unico demais com o melhor fator replay que j vi, zerei e instantaneamente iniciei um new game para zerar de novo com outra classe. peak game"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"so good chooms , this is the best story game for me.i never played a story game this much before, make me upgraded my gpu for this game. talking about buggy things, i think its hilarious."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,great game play with twits and turns with every choice you make. makes you feel like every choice matters in your play through. so many options and ways to play. this is my 5th time playing and i am just as hooked as the first time
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"started playing shortly before the release of phantom liberty, so i only experienced a wonderful game from start to finish. can totally recommend it. awesome story, gameplay and visuals. if it only launched in the state as it is in now... the only thing missing for me is the ng option. currently only possible by modding the game and even then it's not a fully immersive experience."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"cyberpunk 2077 is an absolute masterpiece. after all the updates and dlcs, this game has evolved into one of the most immersive rpg experiences ever made. night city feels alive, with its neondrenched streets, deep lore, and jawdropping visuals. the story? phenomenal. the characters? unforgettable. from the moment you step into vs shoes, youre hooked. the voice acting, the emotional depth, and the sheer freedom of choice make every playthrough unique. and with phantom liberty, the game reaches a whole new level of intensity. the combat is slick, the hacking mechanics are toptier, and the worldbuilding is unmatched. whether you're a stealthy netrunner or a gunsblazing cyberwarrior, theres something for every playstyle. cd projekt red took a rocky launch and turned it into one of the best rpgs of all time. if you havent played cyberpunk 2077 yet, youre seriously missing out.  1010  a mustplay."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,this game is the game i personally enjoy it had an rocky start but overtime it got really good the story is great and the way the game looks is just amazing the only thing that i wish the game had is a new game  because i beat the game 3 times without the dlc and im running out of stuff to do so i got the dlc
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,this is one the greatest games ever made. it is a e testament to what is possible in a video game and art as a whole. once you play it you will never be able to see any open world game the same way ever again.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,for me i think that cyberpunk is a really good game but sometime it might be buggy. personally for me i think that the game is really good but it some cool feature like bd i really wish that i could watch it without adding mod or doing mission or side quests. but overall i give it like a 9.210 it could have been a 10 out of 10 but like i said it lack some feature. hope this review help
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,this game is really fun especially for people that like story games
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,love the game but i have no clue if its good vanila since im runnig a modpack but still a great game also let this review be a testement to why pirating is good
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"wow! i'm so impressed with how this game started out as a giant failure and was diligently turned into a fantastic game. the dedication behind it is undeniable. it has its flaws and all, but i'm enjoying this so much. thanks for all the work! would recommend."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,great graphics and a good story mode so far i'm on my first play through
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"this is one of the greatest games i have ever played. straight up, i do not care how bad it was at launch, it is peak."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"cyberpunk 2077 is a breathtaking openworld rpg that has truly evolved into something special. the world of night city is alive with incredible detail, vibrant characters, and a story that keeps you hooked from start to finish. the immersive gameplay, deep character customization, and thrilling combat make it a blast to play. the updates and improvements over time have really elevated the experience, and the narrative is one of the best in modern rpgs. if you love futuristic, storydriven games with rich exploration and action, cyberpunk 2077 is a mustplay!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"have a decent rig to run with good quality, the game play is great sometimes the dialogue can be drawn out like a monologue. great graphics and great features to a first person shooter."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"been here since this was a bug infested tragedy of a game, watched as it developed over the years i know it says i only have 14 hours on here, most of my time is on xbox. it's really awesome to see that cyberpunk edgerunners got integrated with the game with hidden easter eggs and in game weapons and cosmetics. this game was a nightmare to play just a few years ago, but now i believe it's blown far past expectations, especially with mods but i'm not going through that rabbit hole of dependency mods tldr good game, better than before spongebob caveman sound"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"masterfully recovered experience from cd projekt red. gives a simple, yet morally deep plot taking place in the morally bankrupt, corporateruled night city, wherein you play as a self insert, starting from nothing. as you progress, you go from powerless, with combat being lifeordeath scenarios, to a tank, power housing your way through combat engagements in seconds. beautifully done, and fun to play."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,one of the best games i've ever played. even without phantom liberty still a very fun game to play and the story is amazing.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"one of the best open world storytelling games on the market. the story and characters are rock solid, with plenty of high and low emotional moments coupled with those nail biting stressful encounters night city offers. the writing makes most of this possible, especially in the phantom liberty dlc. but the world feels real, lived in, and has nearly an endless amount of lore for you to dive into. while giving you more than enough freedom with your character builds and weapon choices, the cyberware and hacking also being a very welcome and unique edition to the game's combat system. the visuals and environments are also top tier, with neon lit cityscape galore, to derelict slums and industrial parks. nothing to complain about with this one, other than how long it took for them to iron out some of the bugs and glitches. 9.510"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"really great game, one of the best of all time! i've played through the game 2x on console and now have a beefy computer to see all the eye candy at max to play for my 3rd time, and definitely one of the best looking games of all time. cd project red has cleaned up a mess of a launch they had originally with this game, to make it one of the best of all time! so much to explore, and so many ways to play. one of the few games that i've played more than once or even twice now."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,great game! dlc and maintenance significantly improved the game from day one. would highly recommend.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"not usually a fan of most open world games, as i feel they lack mechanical depth, which is usually my favorite aspect in most games. however, this is a game you can't dislike barring launch obviously, i made the wise decision of buying it on sale after all the main patches had released the main story still feels kinda rushed, but phantom liberty is an absolute masterclass of storytelling, worldbuilding, and atmosphere, through and through. if you're even considering getting this game, wait for a sale and get the ultimate edition, you won't regret it. as for actual criticims, the biggest gripe i have with the game is its missed potential. even after the patches, anyone who's played the game once even without keeping up with its development cycle can tell it was meant for a lot more. the map can feel flat in some places despite being the most gorgeous open world i've seen in a video game, the latter half of the story has the vibe of ok let's get this shit over with already, and any semblance of balance is immediately annihilated the second you discover spoiler sandevistan  any fucking sword that has stats directly correlating to sandevistan spoiler, but this is an rpg, op builds are expected and the game still offers a wide range of options that are more than viable. i'd rather address what i didn't like as it is much less than what i did like. and outside of what i discussed? the game's a must play, especially if you have a higher end gpu and want to crank that shit to overdrive"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"one of the best games i've played. i bought it on ps when it first came out and i never understood the bad reviews. i decided to purchase this again while it was on sale with phantom liberty and it's just as good, if not better than i remember it to be. as of this review, i have not got to the dlc yet so i cannot comment on that. i would recommend the base game on it's own."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,true pc fps no mouse acceleration rpg open world nice graphics balanced gameplay nice story
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"it's a great game, but it is still riddled with bugs. they've had more than enough time to sort out crashes and hangs. it shouldn't be in the game at this point."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,good game. tons of things to do and weapons galore. nothing like taking the head off an cyber freak at 2am
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,i knew going in i would at least enjoy the aesthetic of this game being a huge fan of everything this game is based off of. but instead i got a story that made me think hard about the choices i had to make and how it would affect the relations of those around me. i grew to love most of the characters and got to fully enjoy their arcs. not since fallout new vegas has an rpg of this caliber really pulled me in and not let me go. i'm currently writing this after finishing my 1st play through and i already have plans for the next after a hiatus to digest everything this game threw at me what you waiting for? you got a city to burn.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,cyberpunk 2077 is the best game i've ever played the story is amazing gameplay is how you want it to be you want to go guns blazing? go ahead. want to make some gonk shoot himself? you can do that. i can only imagen how breathtaking it looks with a better pc than i have im saving up just to play this on better graphics. ive never played a better and more fun game in my whole life the only thing negitive i can say is i dont have more dates with sweet sweet judy  and multiplayer would be amazing but ik thats not happening lol 1010 buy this game or we are not chooms
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,its really fun. might mind the over use of monolougue not good but if you skip through most of it and do the quests youll get ot the fun stuff. make sure you save every onch ina while to
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,amazing game. has so much content and the open world and story are great.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"you know, i don't think i should say something. you just need to try it out yourself, it's definitely gonna be worth your time and effort. cyberpunk 2077 have both great and breathcatching plot and interesting gameplay, so you'll not get bored. so see ya in night city!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,amazing story and amazing game. i highly recommend this especially if its on sale.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,very fun game with an extremely engaging combat system and story. many side quests lead into long and expansive storylines that add to the dystopia of night city
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,awesome game and despite my concerns about the first person pov this game did it so well that i adore it! fantastic story and really charming characters! i highly recommend it!
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"didn't buy at launch and i'm thrilled missed all the major bugs. one of my favourite games of all time, more than worth the full price. a mustbuy when on sale frequently on sale. beautiful game, amazing story lines, funny sidequests and great combat and customization. not to mention, the dlc is excellent! 1110"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"i've never been so obsessed to such a dystopian worldbuilding game up to a point where i have bought both the game and dlc on xbox and ps5. it has so much replayability that without mods i have placed 200 hours on both my consoles combined. and now with mods, its total chaos. if you watched edge runners and hesitant to buy the game due to the initial response release, don't worry. its far from that and no one will disagree that this game has truly done a 180. this game for sure has sparked my deep interest into dystopian genre and i appreciate it for that. this game is one of those games that everyone must give a try at least through one run. spoilers when you face adam smasher and given the choice to let him live or kill him. for rebecca, just end his life. he will also end up killing someone else close to you depending on what path you choose to continue with."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"very good game... little buggy, but good... story is perfect and gameplay is very uniqe and interesting..."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"game is good after all, but endings leaves a different opinion, mosty due community correct opinion !ending spoilers! spoiler with dlc there are 5 endings, and by the community opinion because game directly says, and it is dlc one where v have a normal probably the only one ending where v will have a long live, althought in few others v survives but only for 6 months. in my opinion, it is kinda bs, because v survives in 35 endings, because v dies if johnny takes hisher body ending, and ending where you take help from corpo because you have option to live 6 months or accept deal of selling your soul to corpo spoiler spoiler so, imo, v survives and have long live in every other ending because v gets rid of the johhny relic, so it stops damaging vs brains. because 6 months are given only if you accept corpo path due removing relic. and the worst ending of having long live is in dlc ending, due problems with artifical brain. but in every ending where alt helps v, and johhny leaves v alone, shehe survives. spoiler"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,still a buggy mess from time to time but still my favorite game of all time. deffo recommend it to anyone looking for a neon light adventure in a huge city with lots of little secrets and great storytelling.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,game mechanics might be overwhelming at first but as you progress and understand the game becomes more and more stunning and beautiful. absolutely loving it.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,so far great visuals great story great bugs great glitches great missclicking the grenade and having to hide from the police for 10 minutes 1010 game
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"1010 gameplay, 1010 graphics, 1010 storyline"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"as an alchemist and coder, i'm captivated by cyberpunk 2077's immersive fusion of technology and humanity. the game's dystopian world is a complex crucible of corporate intrigue, social upheaval, and personal transformation, where the boundaries between flesh and machine are constantly blurred. with its deep character customisation, intricate hacking mechanics, and immersive narrative, cyberpunk 2077 is a digital elixir that will transmute your gaming experience forever."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,pretty fun. still a little buggy than other games but its not too terrible.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,solid good game well optimize even my 7 year old pc can still play it at ultra but you should've warned me that character create session will be nude my nephew is next to me god damn it.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"absolutely loved this game, gameplay is great and the story is incredible. if they launched the game like this at that time. it would've won goty. i've completed this game 8 times on epic now 9th run on steam."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,have played 58 hrs at the time of this review. the overall world is a fantastic place to roam and interaction with certain characters can be funny to emotional. love the story telling and develop of it's main character along with the main side characters.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"amazing and visually awesome game. amazing storytelling, and there are so many small details. highly recommend 1010"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,imagine falloutskyrim except instead of cool dragon breathing or v.a.t.s. abilities you're an awesome cyborg in a dystopian future dog eat dog world. beware who you trust.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"simply put, this is the greatest game ive ever played. no matter how bad it was and i know how bad it was because i was a victim of the preordering of the game, all of it can be dammned because the way this game came back is unbelievable. the game play is fun and interactive in all the right ways, the world is so immersive ive spent hundreds of hours just driving around and fighting and of course the story, the emotion it holds and the absolute cinematic of it all makes this game the greatest game ive ever played."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"i've already completed cyberpunk twice on xbox series x one release, but had to give it another playthrough on pc with all the ray tracing bells and whistles and it was well worth it. having mod support on pc is a game changer to. one of my favorite games of all time and would give it a 9.5 out of 10. only reason i take a half a point off is only due to the state of the game at launch. if you never played cyberpunk and your reading this wondering if you should pick it up you have already wasted to much time..."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,story is amazing and graphics help it push the story even better. some people may call it linear but this is a great game that'll give you hours of entertainment!
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,"amazing game, great music, great atmosphere, great gameplay, great story. only minor complaint is that main story is a bit short."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,i never realized how much i liked this game. even after purchasing it and playing it for a few hundred hours on my xbox i knew i wasn't done with it. had to buy it again on steam and the dlc. cyberpunk 2077 is becoming my favorite game. even with all the bigotry in my head.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,i love the leveling of this game an dhow in depth you can go into with the build and the story is second to none
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,i have played this on ps5 and seam and this is a great game and super fun too bad it was crap when i origionally bought it.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,honestly i cant say anything bad about this game. its storytelling is just incredible and the characters are so great. even throught the rough launch it has redeemed itself. 1010
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"fun game, enjoyable and really cool. i absolutely love the aesthetic of cyberpunk and have been craving for more of the genre. i highly recommend."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"really enjoyed the original launch, even with all the bugs. as they ironed them out, it just got better. about to play the expansion, but i'd rate this game positively even without it."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,fun game interesting story good controls good graphics lots of customization
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"started in 2024. not really encountered any bugs, and its a very good game."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"cyberpunk 2077 is a visually stunning game with incredible detail. very immersive and realistic environments in night city. gameplay is smooth and good story line. i love combat, updating weapons and v. best rpg game in my opinion."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"decent game, good storyline, bugs seems to be worked out mostly. im happy with it"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,great game insane graphics. you have to have a lot patience because their is a lot of dialogue but it helps develop a great story.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"after 200 hours all the way from release day where things have greatly changed for the better i have to say the product is 1010. there's still some funny bugs that will happen during gameplay but the story is great, characters are interesting, and extra details you can do now make it worth the purchase even at full price."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,good game. easy enough so pick 'very hard' difficulty.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"i love the vibe of this game but i did spotted a few glitchesbug while playing. i did not go out of my way to find these bugs by the way, it's just there while i'm playing story mode. the bug isn't anything major like npcs body are stuck together. overall amazing experience so far."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,one of the greatest comeback in videogames history!! i already completed this game twice. absolutely obsessed with character designs and visuals. silverhand steals the show! and the gun mechanisms are really amazing.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"i love and adore this game. i waited for a long while to buy this game since i wasn't sure i'd like the gameplay until one day i decided to go for it and holy. i do not regret it at all. this game is truly so beautiful and wonderful, it's so immersive and the characters you interact with have so much life. would recommend 100."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,i remember playing it on launch day with an xbox one. had lots of bugs back then and still had fun as it was still a fun game despite that. years later i now finished the game running path tracing on my 5080. i love every bit of this game. its polished and looks impeccable
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"it's been a few years, it's now well patched and runs smooth. you'll still need something midrange or higher from the last 3 years but you won't need a beast. don't enable the fake frames, it's not necessary and makes it feel wrong."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"i never thought that i would genuinely enjoy this game as much as i do. i remember all the bad things people had to say about cyberpunk when it first came out, specifically how rough the ps4 release version was. i almost didn't give it chance because of all the bad things i heard, and i'm happy to say that cd projekt red has surpassed my expectations and more. this game has me hook, line, and sinker. the story drove me to tears once i reached the end, it was genuinely emotionally devastating i still haven't recovered. the city feels so alive, the characters are likeable and have so much depth to them, the combat is the most fun i've had in an open world game before, and there's so much content that it's not even possible to do everything in one playthrough. this is one of my biggest game recommendations. if you ever had doubts, give it a chance."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"it's the kind of game you need when you need immersion. an escape. for me, it was exactly what i needed. played the vanilla loved it. now playing the tweaked versionbladerunner guilty mods and all few years on. it's a fantastic game. made with love. i'm glad cdpr toughed through it. it can be very overwhelming at the start. but not too much that you give up. lot of thought put into the mechanics and it shows. great effects. great audio story starts fun turns great at the end. maybe too on the nose?... the vanilla is great it's worth it. 810 pineapples."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"i really enjoyed the game, the fact that the devs still cared and continued fixing the game is really nice. the combat is really awesome and fun, when the edgerunner perk kicks in you feel invincible! the sandevistan its at another level. the katanas and fist are really fun, and the stealth too, there are a lot of ways of doing the same mission and that gives you a really nice feeling. there are a few details that i would love to change about somethings and mechanic tho non lethal does not make any difference in almost all of the main story and sidequests and its quite sad, it makes it pointless. also, when you put k.o. an npc, it doesnt recover or wake up, making it hard to know if they are alive or just unconscious some missions doesnt have alternatives like with evelyn that she well, yk. and even thought you can complete sidequest in different ways, in the theres a point in the story where i personally felt like the devs just said something like mmm lets go straight to the end, after you talk with hanako it feels rushed. the cyberware capacity system is really weird because at some point in the game the shards just doesn't appear, i know it would be broken to make it more easy to get but, take note that a lot of players use a mod for the cyberwareshards! it needs a fix. personally, i really really enjoyed the game, i wish it was longer or well, i hope we get more of the game in the future, like with phantom liberty"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"an incredible game. it's darker than i usually like but i'm glad i gave it a chance. there are still occasional crashes for me and you'll need a good gpu. you'll be drawn in. night city feels alive and looks beautiful, even when it's ugly on purpose."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"enjoyed the game overall. beautiful expansive world but almost seems too big sometimes. i hate missing out on stuff but feel the need to fast travel so much to get things done  just don't have the time to stop and take it all in. the story and cut scenes were great with memorable characters you care about. the ui felt crowded and the crafting and modding didn't hit well for me, seemed a little bit of an after thought. i played on normal difficulty and it was never a challenge, could of stood for a bit more creativity in the fights, especially boss battles."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"this game is so much fun so far , the graphics are insane , the storyline 5 hours in so far is about a 810 if im being honest , and the different implants im planning to get in my body is lowkey crazy like im trying to get a sandevistan which will take me a bit but overall this game is awesome!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"this is an excellent aaa game. if you have avoided it because of the rocky launch do yourself a favor and buy this and the expansion now. you are going to love it. i personally think the most fun is to sneak around and complete missions without being seen or killing anyone. great stealth mechanics and the quests often reward you with extras for playing that way. one last thing, panam 4 life 3!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,i was very hyped to play this game really after playing witcher 3. however i didn't have a pc to play it so now is the time i play it for the first time. i heard there were so much bugs and glitches in the game at the release. but there is nothing like that now. game is very good. enjoyable. really like the vibe and stories of the night city.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"hard to give a review without spoiling anything... it's basically a combination of gta5  metal gear solid the older one from ps2. what is unique to this game is the environmentcity. it's incredibly well designed and full of details. very impressive environment, can't stress this enough. lots of ways to develop your character, almost difficult to understand at times. it's definitely complicated and while it can be neat, it's almost too much. also you can't max out every stat, so you should focus on certain things you want. my character ended up being good at everything and i may want to do it again to see if the game play is different. tons of weapons and fighting styles. story line and characters are really good for a game. i highly recommend buying both the main game and dlc phantom liberty if it's on sale. the dlc alone is substantial contentwise. kinda wished there wasn't so much emphasis on the clothing and customization since your character is 1st person anyways, rarely do you see yourself. i'm running this with a rtx 4070ti super and it looks great. getting great frames with 5700x cpu. there are some times where the game crashes, usually during super fast paced engagements like driving cars fast through the streets. if you like gta, red dead redemption, and old metal gear games you should really like this."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,1010
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"this game is truly amazing and i dont care who disagrees.when i play this game, it feels like im living a life. the city, the characters, its amazing, truly. play this game, what are you doing if you not playing this. trust me, please trust me, and download this game.you wont regret it"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"i have every achievement in this game, and it was an enjoyable process to get to here. i only do this for games that i truly, and genuinely enjoy  which is also rare. what a brilliant game, despite its flaws  cyberpunk is an immersive and fun rpg. play the game with phantom liberty, it is an essential desert after the main course."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"night city is stunning, the characters are deep and the story hits hard. side quests are top tier sometimes even better than the main plot of many other games. the atmosphere pulls you in and the world feels alive. yeah there are some minor bugs but nothing deal breaking. if you love rpgs this one is a must play."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"love the setting, love the characters, like the story, just wish it wasn't still so glitchy four years after its release and the dlc two years after its release."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"this game needs no introduction, the characters, stories and humor all work together into this masterpiece of a gem. loved how this game went from a rough launch to being one of the best games ever."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"i love this game. props to the devs. it runs pretty well on my lowend laptop, and has just gotten better and more stable over the updates. can't wait to play it even more when i upgrade to a better system."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"after the 2.0 updates and the additional dlc, cyberpunk 2077 is one of my favorite games of all time within my top 5. it had a rough start, but with cyberpunk edgerunners reviving the community, and cd projeckt red continuing to support the game, it made a fantastic comeback. it's not very often that a game leads me into other forms of media. i've looked into additional books, comics, articles, etc. just to get a bit more of the world that was created. that is the power of what can happen if you make a great game, and i look forward to the next installment."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"the greatest comeback a story game has ever made !! can't wait for more cd project red games. people there had metal in their heads, waged war from a distance, using things similar to mega scopes, and there were no horses everyone had their own flying ship instead. geralt ciri stop fooling around ciri told you wouldn't believe me, we should have stayed there"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"its very enjoyable if you like gritty sci fi, very much like a dark future where excess and overindulgence plague society. i found the main campaign to be a bit short but very enjoyable, side missions are great for fleshing out more of the world."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"reviewing at 3 hours because for multiple reasons, bought it again on steam after losing access to gog. i have owned and played this game on xbox 360, ps4, gog, and now steam. i adore this game, and am always going to hold onto my 1.03 saves, for the nostalgia of glitchy bugginess. now, it's considered by some to be a masterpiece in some respects, myself included. buy it."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"this game surprised me. i've never been a huge fan of shooters, and this is the first one that ever hooked me and really the only one that has to this level. of course, there are guns, but there's so much more. multiple rich storylines, many characters to follow throughout their journey, especially as they stand by your side throughout yours. a ton of fun, engaging mechanics, with a satisfying sense of progression. given that i'm saying this four and a bit years after release, this is probably obvious by now, but man. banger game."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,its a fun game that has amazing graphics if you have the gpu to handle it.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,"i recommend this because it's the only half decent scifi skyrim game available. and no, starfield doesn't rate even to this level. so, pros are straightforward  it's skyrim but cyberpunk. now for the cons. tons of bugs even years later. mission to stealth kill a boss. i get to the room, choose dialog option, it leads to combat. reload a save from outside the room and now the game refuses to offer the dialog option even though i was clean up to the save. i distract the boss via a terminal, he walks over to it back to me. i enter the room and he instantly rubber bands back to his original location  just flies backwards 20 feet  and then alerts and i fail the stealth part. even when the game works normally stealth playstyle is totally fucked. people just randomly turn on a dime and it forces a save and play approach which kills the fun. very hard mode makes most builds and playstyles completely untenable. actually here, you're best bet is stealth takedowns from behind with heavy use of savescumming. not fun. but if you like the idea of a stealth playstyle, maybe you'll focus on snipers. guess what, the only one you can run stealth is underpowered and won't kill anything above normal in one shot. so you'll actually do better sniping at long range with a silenced pistol than a sniper rifle. ludicrous. if you try to stealth attack with a katana you'll just injure them and alert everyone. but with your bare hands you instakill. again, totally absurd. tons of poor interface issues. like even on keyboard a lot of things bind to the same thing. so you'll finish a police scanner encounter and you have to wait like 15 seconds for the text of a journal drop to be available via a pop up. you need to wait, and trigger it then, or it's a pita to go through the journal interface. but then you got xp at the same time and that triggers your fixer calling you with some shit, which interferes. or you want to pick an item up but no matter where you hover the mouse you can't get it  but you can pick up this other thing 5 feet to the left. or the radio in your apartment and car that randomly reset every time you leave  as if some asshole keeps breaking into your apartment and turning it back on. there's a drop attack you can do, but if you don't land it right it'll screw up and then everyone is alerted so it's pretty unusable. you can use throwing knives but only one. then it magically reappears like you're the god of war. if you have more knives you can't use those  you have to wait for magic knife. like most recent games it has a hamfisted woke storyline shoved in in the form of a trans revenge murder side quest. still didn't spare cdpr from woke backlash anyway, but given their recent csuite exec wide eye stare youtube preaching fealty it's only going to get worse in their future games. at least it's not as bad as fc6 where someone gets murdered for the crime of misgendering. all of the endings are total ass. i get that it's a dystopian future but they really screw over the protagonist and, by extension, the friends that you choose to ultimately die for you, die for nothing. unless you read the spoilers to unlock the secret solo ending and even then you get a shit ending. or use the phantom liberty new ending option and.. yeah that's still super shitty but at least you don't get your friends killed. the newly added sandevistan builds are cool but then you can't disable cameras with the deck which makes the soft requirement to stealth half the quests impossible. so it's an end game build option and there is no end game. save all the cyberpsychos until late game with a cloak equipped. save the beat on the brats for end game and get gorilla arms. both of these get offered to you right at the start and just aren't set up for that."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,i rate this game 2nd place story and gameplaywise for me in that depratment nothing can beat the red dead games. but huge props to the devs for making this masterpiece and bringing us one of best animes of all time.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"honestly, the first game in a long time that makes me want to replay it over and over again. it not being repetitive and unpredictable is what makes this game fun for me. there will always be cons in games and without being bias i think with that being said the cons that the game has now, are not as game breaking as they used to be. overall, i do recommend this to other players who are looking for something more free and immersive. the story is jam packed and compelling. game is very much enjoyable."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"amazing graphics, great gameplay"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"i bought this game when the ultimate edition was released but i only began to play it in earnest as of version 2.21 in 2025. i, like everyone else, had heard the negative things about it at launch. i can safely say none of that applies, now. this is a fun game. even as someone who doesn't play firstperson games and rarely enjoys shooters, i find the story, characters, and overall atmosphere of this game to be engaging. i highly recommend, and bonus if you are a fan of the cyberpunk genre, because the game definitely delivers the vibe."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,one of the games where i actually just picked the closest quest and just started completing everything. not a big fan of story mode style games but this one was pretty good. 100 would recommend. i've done two alternate endings and will probably do a few more.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"best game i've ever played, incredible graphics, great story, fun gunplay and runs well. 1010"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"a bit too much talk for my taste early, but it picks up quick and is very well made. quite an enjoyable game,"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"the game on release was utter dog shit, but as the years past and the constant updates to fix the game it molded this game as amazing. the story path i went on was outstanding, the dialogue was great, and the combat was also clean. i highly recommend for anyone to get this game and experience it themselves even if it was already spoiled to them. this game also proves that consumers shouldn't rush the game devs to release games early and wait until the game is actually finished to play it."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"pros the graphics, characters, effects and battle dynamics are excellent. the variety of weapons is enough. the characters are each like the real thing and taste more like a movie than a game. it's like an experience. this game makes you count down the days to do the next part. it's nice to have a roleplaying game and direct it to different ends, but it takes a while to fully learn the game. you may want to play the game constantly because there are many kills and ways to play. cons vehicle and motorcycle driving physics are bad. it turns too much and can go crooked. npcs are so stupid because he jumps in front of the car, dies, and as if that wasn't enough, the cops show up next to him 5 seconds later. if you're not a good player, keep the difficulty level down because they don't die. bugs still persist in the game, although not as much as before. it is quite possible to see 12 pieces every time you play. it's like rendering late and having the vehicles spawn in an instant. overall just buy and play it. it's really worth it"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"best game i've ever played. the graphics are immersive, the story is compelling and the gameplay it self is very enjoyable."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,played and completed this game when it was at the buggy 1.0 and i loved it then and love it all the more in its polished glory. the developers really know how to make a world feel lived in and in turn immerse the player into the mindset that makes them want to scrape and crawl to the finish.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,graphics are amazing
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"love this game so much. i like open world games and being able to basically become max level before the first mission. so thats what i did, i dont like playing games and only getting the cool stuff and abilities towards the end or having them unlocked through newgame, no i want to be top dog right out the pound. multiple endings is also a good choice to have, probably only going to play it once but its dope to play it and see how i compared to my friends and what not 9.9910"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,saur good i had to acquire through legitimate means to support the devs. played during the rocky launch  was still phenom. vas and writers really went absolutely insane  more than made up for the bugs at the time
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"game keren. dulu waktu pertama keluar saya ingat banyak sekali bugnya. salut untuk developer game ini cd projekt red, bisa merubah game ini dari unplayable menjadi luar biasa seperti ini. meski butuh waktu 4 tahun. buat teman2 di indonesia, harus coba game ini sekali seumur hidup."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"i love this game so much. might be my favorite game ever, except that i played it first on ps4 pro the day it came out and remember what that was like. even then though it still had one of the greatest worlds and stories i had ever experienced. the pain of realizing i couldn't do basic things like customize cars or scale legendary weapons into the late game i remember dumping thousands of materials into silverhand's pistol only for it to still be weaker than an epic revolver was eased with free patches. the game now is a masterpiece. loses points for having a final mission that is eternally in your quest log. ala fallout new vegas 910"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"this is more than just a good looking game and a next gen technology show off. this is life. i don't want to finish this game, let hanako wait in amber forever. please add new story dlc."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"910. the story was amazing and hooked me in every time i loaded it up, not experienced that feeling since half lifeportal series and gta v when it first came out. so glad they polished it and worked the severe bugs out! been on my wish list since it came on steam. just finished the main story right before i wrote this and i want more! will get the phantom liberty dlc!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,super fun and addicting. lots of builds and replayablity
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"truly one of the best games i've ever played. the world building and setting are absolutely top tier accompanying a narrative with tough thought provoking choices and meaningful consequences. before cyberpunk i'd never had the pleasure of exploring a world so immaculately detailed and well thought out as night city. in addition to an unrivaled setting, the game play is a deep well of build variety and moment to moment choice to tackle each challenge however you the as the player see fit. this is a must play by any and all standards."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"still has some minor bugs, but overall this game is a great experience."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"no matter how the game started out, right now it is a masterpiece! the story especially is top tier!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,still a bit buggy but incredible game holds up
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"while the launch was rocky, the wait and redemption was worth the wait. this is by far one of the greatest modern rpg's ever made. overall i'd give this a 1010"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"just best game i've ever played. play with mods that improve immersion, don't fast travel anywhere and take time to do side quests. you won't be disappointed. also phantom liberty is great, get it."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"very fun with story that grabbed me personally. but if your wanting to mod. just be careful though. it can either be a painful brain dance, or simple."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,great game. haven't met any bugs so far. think the patch really helped out the game. the expansion seems great too.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,amazing story. great atmosphere. graphics are beautiful!!! cruising night city at 2 am is just soul touching.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"addictive, interactive. the next stage in cybernetics allowing us to bring our very own bodies to bleeding edge optimization. visit your local ripperdoc to learn more at s.h.a.d.e. enterprise s.h.a.d.e. we've got you covered"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"cyberpunk has been the most enjoyable game i have ever played. the story is amazing and immersive, the game does not force you on a certain path and i feel like the game builds upon much of what makes the witcher 3, fallout 4 and even mass effect games fun. resulting in an experience which i don't believe to be matched by anything else. also the dlc is amazing. that being said, there are things which could have been done better.  inventory management and crafting system can take time getting used to.  many of the character builds which could be fun to play on are not obvious and trying them out requires commitment which can't be reversed.  the open nature of the game means you are likely to miss out on logbooks, quests and alternative endings. all of which could help you understand the world better and get more out of the game.  cyberpunk is also at least somewhat more gpu intensive that it has to be due to poorly implemented taa anti aliasing and upscaling. these are issues with many modern games and i can only hope that cdpr and the industry in general moves away from this direction in the future."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"great story, great combat, great gameplay.. hell yeah i recommend this game!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,the graphics and the immersion really blew me away. the dlc could be it's own game. put 52 hours into the game and still have so much more to do.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,just finished my 100 playthrough of the game. absolutely without a doubt a 1010 game. up there with my favorite games of all time. did a playthrough back when the game released and i'm happy to say the game is 110 better now. highly recommend this fantastic game!
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,in this more or less final version the game is really great whether it be that you get lost in sidequests or follow the detailed main story line getting to know night city in and out.
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"i bought this game back in december of 2022. i remember having a meh attitude towards the whole game. the intro as a nomad, fixing your current car at the time, trying to become a known legend in night city, i was not drawn in immediately. meeting jackie for the first time and doing the shootout with him smuggling an iguana, that was as far as i gotten back then. for a little over two years i did not pick up this game. i saw memes and bugs online and it made me more disinterested as time went on. a friend of mine recommended that i give cyberpunk 2077 another shot after i told him i have beaten god of war. when i tell you that i am currently addicted to this game, words can not describe the euphoria i have experienced lately. i have not had this much fun since red dead redemption 2 came out back in 2018. the story telling and atmosphere is up there with some of the best rpgs i have ever played. it is not perfect, but since cd projekt red has teased possibly a few more updates, there is no complaint from me here. my entire play through so far, i have experienced one crash it involved doing several quick hacks against enemies and exploding a vehicle beside me. there have been npc's on the streets of night city that would float above the ground when sitting. i experienced a bug once where my car would just drive in loops around my character, impeding my chances of getting in. of all the hours i have put in, those have been minor inconveniences compared to stuff i experienced in 2022. it took me about two hours to reach night city and that is where things started picking up. the more you play and explore, you find yourself having a better understanding on how to play and interact with the game cyber ware, crafting, upgrading guns, receiving free cool cars through missions, exploring areas, and finding unique items or guns skippy. following through the main story or doing a side missions are well written and captivating. from a gonk of a launch, to a truly special game. if you were skeptical of trying the game regarding it's history, now is the time to give it another chance."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"it didn't fully meet my expectations, but it offered an aboveaverage open world, enjoyable side quests, and a decent storyline, making for an overall fun experience. however, inconsistencies, bugs, and performance issues hindered my enjoyment. 710  a good game. i'm playing again after the new update and some issues seem to have been resolved"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"beautiful game with very high replay ability, there is some minor visual bug and some quest is still bugged but nothing too major, highly recommended 810"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"played when the game had originally dropped in 2020, and despite the bugs and glitches i had a blast and was invested in such a memorable story and setting. now, having played it a 2nd time after all the updates and fixes, as well as the dlc, i can say this game has solidified itself as a true classic amongst the titans of the gaming industry. and absolute mustplay, the ending still brings a tear to my eye."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"in this game, you can shoot people, and run them over. also your character can have some very cool aesthetic features. i don't know what the plot is about, but, 1010 game."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"you know, i remember seeing gameplay of this game when it first came out. i endlessly ragged on this game for just about everything from bugs to gameplay to what appeared at the time to be a shallow world. right now, i'm playing through all my games in a desperate no backlog challenge attempt, so that doesn't leave me much time to pursue side objectives in most of these games. however, i couldn't help myself here. i actually became quite immersed in everything this game had to offer. the combat was fun as hell and made me feel like a badass. i genuinely started to care for the characters and the results of my actions on the world around me. if i was near a side objective, i did it. if it was for a character i enjoyed, i did it. all this to say that i was genuinely impressed, and whatever insults i offered this game on launch, i take it back and instead offer my suggestion to absolutely try this game out. the ending was phenomenal and truly respects the character development and choices made along the way. i didn't even have phantom liberty and was quite satisfied. worth the time, and i'll likely come back in the end."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"there are few moments that as a gamer you'd know a game is just more than a game, and this is one of those experiences. you'll be certainly in for something more than what you're expecting. gameplay various routes to build your character for combat and interaction with the world. each life route also provides a good insight to the world. the world is immersive and big to explore, my hours are low because i already spent longer hours on a different platform, but throughout over 600 hours of playing in total, never once the game play was tiresome. story as i said each life path gives a decent insight to the world, but when you start it does a perfect job of roleplaying if you only select the related dialogue options for you path. story is so immersive and character developments and storytelling is so perfect, that even after playing each ending, you'd still feel the certain highs as you did playing the first time. dlc adds a good chunk to both gameplay and story, while you can be fine just playing the base game, it's certainly worth the price."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"buggy but some glitches make ya laugh,all though preem game fun weapons and good story"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"great game, character, narrative and setting. game has some glitches, but nothing near bethesda level. fun all around and a good campaign. wish we had more stellar first person narratives nowadays."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"just finished my first ending after finishing all the gigs and most side jobs. the game has a lot of moments where it's really good thought provoking and hype. but it's so rough around the edges mostly because of inconsistentcey with decision making and the consequences of being inconsistent. the couple endings i've seen so far end on the climax without enough of a real conclusion in my opinion. this isn't helped by the fact time spent with characters is too limited to become invested in any of them properly. all the side job and gig characters endings feel too abrupt and as if the team had to finish them to finish the product in time for a deadline instead of tell a full story. also dialogue is stiff and sound just kinda dumb in some scenes. except johnny because he's with you the whole game and does develop and change over time with v depending on how you act which is what i would have liked more from other characters. johnny's character, development and conclusion is by far my favourite part of the game. unfortunately the whole game feels like it's just better to wait for the sequel which will improve upon all the many minor issues with this game which hold it back from being one of the greats. especially as it's still littered with major bugs even on the 2.2 patch. the games main strengths are it's immersive, atmospheric and is backed by an awesome fitting soundtrack but it most importantly is very fun especially the combat so it's still worth playing for sure if you're interested. 7.510"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"i played the cyberpunk 2077 ps4 day one release version, by many considered to be the worst version of the game. about 23rds of the way through the slog i gave up. the game just wasn't worth playing, and i was hardly the only one who felt this way. many updates later it finally reached a state where many people have now come around to it. though the game is far more enjoyable then it was on release and i would recommend it, i personally feel like it still has some fundamental issues that run deeper than bugs and combat. 2077 only superficially resembles the original ttrpg. while elements like slang give dialog a great level of authenticity, many core pillars of cyberpunk are absent from this digital version of night city. while i'm sad to see fun elements like posergangs gangs who get plastic surgery to look like celebrities go, i believe that there are two core features that are instrumental to the cyberpunk experience that 2077 is lacking h2 1. role playing h2 cyberpunk is first and foremost a role playing game. night city is merely a thematic backdrop for characters created by passionate players to explore choices, themes, and stories. 2077's protagonist, v, is a supremely written character but that is exactly the issue. v is a prewritten character like geralt in the witcher, and is fundamentally closer to fallout 4's natenora than any ttrpg player character. though v is given depth in writing, the player is given no depth of choice. nowhere is this clearer than in the player's interactions with the character of johnny silverhand. if the player blindly aligns themselves with silverhand's ideals or completely opposes them, his character makes sense. however, if the player handles johnny's many remarks with the nuance they deserve his character quickly becomes confusing. nuance makes johnny come off as a tryhard contrarian, someone who bases their entire personality on always being different both from other people and from other's expectations. this feels like incredible character depth... until you realize the game doesn't allow you to acknowledge it in any way. this wasn't masterful writing, it's an accident. it's the game's limited reactivity laid bare. johnny isn't someone who hides his real feeling away behind layers upon layers of irony, sarcasm, and contrarianism, he's just a complete and utter jackass read hero who keeps talking about his cock every chance he gets. the only real question the game poses on johnny, the second most important character in this storydriven rpg, is whether you think his actions were justified. the entire game is like this. simple binary choices. sometimes you get to use your skills in dialog for some extra money or to bypass a combat section, but rarely do you get to define who v is as a character because that has already been determined for you. h2 2. humanitypunk h2 humanity is a core theme in cyberpunk to the point it even has an associated stat. in the ttrpg it is directly related to your character's empathy. installing cyberware bionic implants risks insanity, and only highly empathetic characters can reap the benefits of multiple cybernetic enhancements without losing their humanity. this core concept is completely absent from v as a character. npcs get a handful of military implants and go psycho but v can replace their entire body with machine parts and suffer no consequences. the reason humanity is so important to cyberpunk's identity is because it's dystopian transhumanist setting is all about stories centered on humanity's continued perseverance. it's about human emotion, tragedy, relationships, fighting for your beliefs, burning out rather than fading away. it's punk. nowhere is this more clear than in the game's anime series, cyberpunk edgerunner. it is no accident that edgerunners completely revitalized interest in the game. it embodies all the great thematic qualities inherent to cyberpunk qualities that 2077 only flirts with. humanity as it is understood in the ttrpg is at the forefront of the series, and it makes for one of the most exciting, unique, and heart wrenching anime of the past decade. this quality is a doubleedged sword it exposed how lacking 2077 was in comparison. the game feels directionless, meandering. it only hints at themes instead of going all out. it has wellwritten characters, but they are just there to make up for the human struggles that v lacks. none of it is punk, it's just cyber. despite my criticisms i do feel cyberpunk 2077 is a game worth playing. the combat system is vastly improved over the original release and now allows for 3 core playstyles. the gunplay itself is soso, but everything surrounding it like movement, special abilties, hacks, and slow motion make it engaging. stats and the skill tree now actually feel meaningful, though this is largely limited to combat. the characters that you interact with are authentically written and acted, even if they aren't very punk. i like that they left some room in night city for more human experiences. an example of this would be how a side character runs a new age spiritualism shop and will read you tarot. that seems out of place in a cybernetic future, but that's exactly what makes it feel authentic and human. what i especially like is that v's romance options are genderspecific but that the game still lets you embarrass yourself by flirting with someone who is not interested. characters feel more real when they aren't just prizes to be won as part of the player's wish fulfillment. at the end of the day cyberpunk 2077 is a semicompetent open world action game in a setting loosely inspired by the cyberpunk ttrpg. it lacks choices and thematic depthconsistency, but generally creates an engaging experience through combat gameplay and writing. if you like slightly generic open world games that constantly dripfeed you dopamine by having you travel towards a marker and then shooting a couple guys there, this game is for you. h3 the game isn't punk, and that's the most punk thing about it. h3 b nitpicky rant bit b here's some smaller things that shouldn't really matter but they annoyed me so now i'm gonna annoy you  ingame radio is godawful. i know cdpr commissioned a bunch of songs for the game. i think they should get their money back. still cry everytime i wanna stay at your house comes on though.  cameos. i like kojima and his classic kojimbo rambling and thought jesse cox did a great job voicing his character. that said, grimes' delivery was so impressively bad that i can still feel the secondhand embarrassment. but hey, at least she's consistent in her talent.  cdpr spent so much time developing all these gangs and their identities only to use them as disposable fodder.  there's technically a lot of clothing but most of it is reskins of the same few items. there's way more pieces of clothing in the game than what you can get but cdpr doesn't want us to be drippy so all we got is this mediocre wardrobe.  city feels kinda artificial in a bad way. witcher 3's towns all felt pretty lively but in 2077 i often find myself thinking about how unnatural things look and feel.  couldn't romance aurore cassel from the dlc. i know i previously said wish fulfillment is bad but in this specific case i retract that statement because it suits me.  tiered loot is lazy and mostly based on the level you are.  can't change the skin on a gun, which is silly. also don't know what skin an attachment has until you equip it.  speaking of skins, the game has a feature where you can copy a car's skin, but this only works on very specific vehicles for arbitrary reasons.  there's ripperdocs other than viktor he's my ride or die  this entire section was honestly just an excuse to talk about the grimes thing, i'm still surprised that made it into the game.  cars in a game like this don't need realistic physics simulations, just make them fun to drive."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"cd projekt red kinda redeemed themselves with the update and dlc. but the final product still feel a lot less like what they promised in the trailer. hopefully orion won't have the same issue. for me, the gameplay is great and feel smooth, i can have variation in combat and doesn't feel bored. the main story is an 810 and the side quest is the usual cd projekt red side quest, mostly nice, leaning into our morality in it's decision. but can't help to feel a bit underwhelmed compared to the witcher 3. so, don't expect the same quality from both games."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"wow. just wow. i've put in around 300 hours into this game 5050 split here and on console. i've experience 3 of the 6 different endings, and of the 3 i've seen, they are so worth it. cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece throughnthrough. i'll break it up into sections, and i promise not to spoil anything that's not in the trailers or stuff like that, but this game has been out for so long and has had its' fair share of press over the years. v i have never been so immersed into a character....ever. v truly is whoever you want them to be. their origin, their journey, their finale. i played male v first, then female v. both are done to perfection. they have little differences that change everything about them, yet they are the same character. male v is just sick of everyone's bs all the time, and female v has this sound of hopeful spirit in her voice. it's fair to say you'll spend a lot time with v and you will have a preference. i mean to say that they are not identical in their mannerisms, tones and if you ever see comparison videos of the two in cut scenes, you'll tell! i have to give a massive shout out to gavin drea male v and cherami leigh female v as well as cdpr. you killed it! especially with lockdown and gavin recording in london and cherami in los angeles. you will love v, no matter what. trust me. never fade away the story is superb! again, no spoilers. you all know that keanu reeves makes a appearance in this game and my god...i'll get to him next. story is so rich and full of meaningful characters and i mean besides the occasional 20 min side mission  everyone stands out. the game is split into 3 acts all of which have very identifiable characteristics. i wont get into the nitty gritty but i will say that the pacing is great! unless you are 100ing it then it takes forever but that's my doing. you will cry, you will laugh, you will cringe and you will have one helleva time. wake the f up, samurai keanu f reeves. easily steals the show whenever he is there and trust me, he's there! he plays a rocker boy called johnny silverhand and...yeah, breathtaking. so stellar and by the later half of this run i would skip most dialogue unless it was him. he's like jack sparrow meets gordon ramsey. johnny and v mesh perfectly together and truly form a symbiotic relationship together. not in a weird way but a kickass way. for male v he is like the most loyal brother you could wish for and for female v is like the annoying younger brother who has some valuable pointers but she just wants to go by her day. the city of dreams there is no better world design than night city. none. it is so goddamn gorgeous. if you can run it with raytracing it's 1000 times better. the neon lights and truly bladerunner vibes never gets old. i've caught myself wasting hours just driving around the city at night looking at the massive ads everywhere illuminating the night sky. truly unbelievable. the outskirts of night city feel like outskirts in all the right ways as it's integral to one or two of the many story lines. it's not bland with nothing to do, though night city is so addicting. all the areas have such distinct characteristics and you will always know where you are just by the environment. the world though they promised more is still crazy. the people you meet become so connected to night city and it's many districts that you'll see them as one in the same thing. i can't say enough about this and how incredible a job they did by making a truly believable city with our societal, economic and political ways. phantom liberty this is the dlc for the game again no spoilers except one and it can provide an alternate ending for v. you meet more memorable people and another celebrity idris elba, face more strong narrative choices and it truly bumps the game's experience up a notch. when i played the game on xbox, obviously this wasn't made yet and i loved the game. but when this came out, it brought a massive update known as 2.0. which literally turned this game into cyberpunk 2077 2.0. the progression, the customisation, the upgrades, the games performance....it became what it was set out to be back in 2020. all of this stuff is free to everyone besides the dlc section but yeah damn, phantom liberty is so worth it as it like cdpr's witcher 3 is long. it added about 25 more hours to the game as my latest run was at 70 hrs. waiting for a sale is never a bad idea but if you can buy it at full price, do it. you will not regret it. for 100ing oh boy, this game took me...well you can see. over 100hrs to beat. it wasn't hard but it was a grind. i chose to do all the side missions and phantom liberty as soon as they popped up which made the game run so damn long lol. it was worth it to me as i love this game. it does have 23 achievements that aren't tied to just playing the game. what i mean is like throw a grenade, hack someone and do this blah blah blah all at once which you would never do naturally. look up the achievements once you've finished the game as they are easy to miss. you're breathtaking! overall this is worth every penny and is truly a monumental story. the game had major problems at the start, as you may all know. but i believed in this games success and i am so happy that it worked out. this is the no mans sky of single player games. truly a remarkable recovery and a breathtaking experience. one last thing about this game. it's a warning. that is it's biggest strength. if we don't change our ways, we will have night city night city is los angeles, fyi. the corruption, the complete economic disarray. the whole kit and caboodle. it's actually polarising, and yet shockingly familiar to our world. just something i've found interesting. i know i wrote a thesis on this lol but to me this game deserves it. see you in the major leagues! love you, bye!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"amazing story, very engaging. i didn't understand the hype at first but now its all i think about while at work!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"overall, i really enjoyed this game. story was interesting, characters were engaging, combat was varied and exciting. glad i waited until i upgraded my hardware and for cdpr to work out the kinks. phantom liberty was awesome."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"overwhelmingly yes! this game  rocks and scratches that itch for a true action rpg experience. ironically i'm not a big fps guy anymore but the moment to moment gun play and systems are done so well. i keep finding myself year after year coming back to this game. the community is great, the developers never gave up on their baby and it is truly a masterclass of art, direction and themes. on high end systems, everyone knows that this is a must buy. great way to benchmark your rig and get some pretty great flicks off of photo mode. this is a comfort game to me that i'm sure years from now i'll be happy to either boot back up or look happily upon it. also, tons of mods that just are chef's kiss cosmetic, gameplay, engine tweaking, and some pretty elaborate devmod menus i wait patiently for the witcher 4 and hope that the next release follows the labor of love treatment cyberpunk got. thank you cdpr for a phenomenal experience over the past 4 years."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"genuinely one of the best games out there. this game is a high i've been chasing since its release, and i'm sorely disappointed that there wont be more content released. i can remember just about every side quest, every unique weapon, every cybernetic, etc. the game is incredible and easily one of the most fun open world games ive ever played. i have had hours of fun just fighting enemies, especially maxtac. if you want a unique, fun, first person sandbox game that doesn't waste your time and has mechanics that rival the most intense movement shooters and the best of stealth games, this is it. i only wish we could have had a second dlc."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"game is amazing! great story, great gameplay and world. t he world. is alive and interesting. from small gigs that give cash to robbing arasaka you are free to do pretty much anything. if you are thinking of buying it.. do it"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"after 5 years of patching and a gpu upgrade, i can finally recommend this game. it feels like a mix between gta 5  deus ex games"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"amazing game, gorgeous graphics and great story line. revolutionary game especially for the genre it's probably the goat. 3"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"played this first on ps5 for over 900 hours. this game offers such a rich and immersive world to explore and i can't seem to stop, so i bought it for pc as well d plus the photo mode that recently got even more updated makes me even more obsessed! but i wish there were more normal poses without getting mods to do this.  3"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"it's funny how with each year the subplots from the game get more and more relatable to the real world, the graphics better and the mod support wider."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"playing cyberpunk 2077 over four years after release is a completely different experience than when it launched. the myriads of game breaking bugs and underbaked or entirely nonexistent promised features have all been resolved, and now it has become one of the most visually immersive and detailed video games on the market. nothing quite compares to night city it is truly the games strongest aspect as you will find yourself constantly drawn into the unique aesthetic and vibe of the city. playing with path tracing elevates this to the next level, as it completely transforms the game. when it comes to graphics, cyberpunk is best in class. the main story is pretty good. the characters you meet mostly have a personality and the story kept me interested the whole way through. combat was also good, with great variety in weapon type and satisfying feedback. vehicles and driving were also another highlight, with a wide variety of cars that were easily obtainable and all being fun to drive. the soundtrack is also excellent. the game is far from perfect though. the biggest issue i have is the illusion of choice the game has. the choices you make prior to the point of no return have virtually no impact on the ending you receive, or the outcome of certain quests. the game draws you in with unique lifepaths nomad, corpo, street kid, but these offer nothing but random dialogue options that exist as nothing but flavour text. its particularly disappointing because it is advertised as a defining choice that will shape your playthrough, which it simply does not. i also found the game incredibly easy. i was disappointed that there wasnt much of a challenge that forced me to optimise my build to tackle certain missions or bosses. it felt like a waste of such a unique combat system. some side quests are also incredibly dull, and the sheer amount of them combined with the various gigs and simple combat missions scattered throughout the city felt as if they were simply a means to increase the games length. crafting is also completely meaningless, and the skill trees are vast and complex, yet mild in their actual impact  but these are only minor gripes. what resolves all the above is the phantom liberty dlc. it is hands down the best dlc i have ever played in a game. the narrative and characters are immersive and engaging, and the environment of dogtown is stunning. it is truly the summation of the strongest aspects of cyberpunk. unfortunately, this elevation from the base game in almost every aspect works against itself as the dlc which is played out roughly halfway through the game feels tonally different and almost out of place because of how good it is. overall, cyberpunk 2077 is excellent. playing for the first time in 2025 feels exactly like the cyberpunk that was originally promised all those years ago. it has been refined over the years and is finally in a place that cements it as one of the action rpg greats. cyberpunk 2077 810 phantom liberty 1010"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"i've finally giving cyberpunk a try. 100 hours in, i've immersed in night city, peeling it's onion layers one by one. i love the amount of details cdpr put in their world building. each gigs have deeper lore in them that you can find in other gigs or encounters. it's been a while since i jump into a lore rabbithole like this game has. in my opinion, this game could expand more of it's features so that some of them wouldn't feel halfbaked andor put there just for the sake of it. so that the game can be even more immersive, since that's what cdpr are going for with first person view."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"after all the fixes this game will blow you away. the way every character your introduced to has an impact, an impression on your play through whether they live or die, it builds up such a fleshed out world. it also has you weigh heavily in on decisions nothing feels like the truly right choice only a path you could take, its so insane its to the point youll spends minutes even just on one dialogue option wondering if what your doing is really what you want for yourself or the other characters and how it could affect you down the line. the only complaint i could come up with in terms of gameplay is the combat system, it isnt perfect but makes up with it by the sheer amount of customization without making you feel lost. if the game is on sale youd be an absolute gonk not to at least try it out"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"i saw corps strip farmers of water ... and eventually of land. saw them transform night city into a machine fueled by people's crushed spirits, broken dreams and emptied pockets. corps've long controlled our lives, taken lots... and now they're after our souls! v, i've declared war not because capitalism's a thorn in my side or outta nostalgia for an america gone by. this war's a people's war against a system that's spiralled outta our control. it's a war against the fuckin' forces of entropy, understand? do whatever it takes to stop 'em, defeat 'em, gut 'em. if i gotta kill, i'll kill. if i need your body, i'll fuckin' take it! fuckin' hell ... you still don't see it. but you will one day. johnny silverhand, cyberpunk 2077"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"cyberpunk 2077 has been a fun experience so far, but ive lost count of how many times it has crashed on me. there have been moments where i genuinely thought a bug was part of a missiononly to log in the next day and realize, nope, it was just a glitch. the story itself is great, but the constant crashing and bugs make it overwhelming at times. i had someone tell me they didnt like gta v, but honestly, cyberpunk 2077 feels like the same kind of game, just set in a different time period. actually, id say gta v's graphics might even be better. cd projekt red is nowhere near rockstar in terms of polish, but i do give them credit for trying. the game is definitely enjoyable, despite its flaws. that said, one thing that bugs me besides the literal bugs is how sexuality is integrated into the game. i mean, throwing in a random dildo or some nudity? whatever, thats not a big deal. but when my character ends up in a onenight stand without me wanting to take it that far, it just feels unnecessary. although if it were keanu reeves johnny silverhand? well, that might be a different story!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"for folks like us? wrong city, wrong people. literally no game like this nor will there ever be again probably. once you finish a playthrough, you're just gonna start it up again. no other game can replicate the feeling of a more lived in world with these amazing characters. 2077 910 pl 1510 game is even better with mods!"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"the main story line is good, keeps you playing. i would say that most everyday battles in the streets and the side quests are not too difficult, i have set to a lower difficulty. the boss battles are much more difficult and you will need a good level progression and cyberware to do well and defeat the enemies."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,one of the best games i have played. 1010 on par if not better than rdr2 but can be confusing for first playthrough. see you in the major leagues jackie
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"i played through the full game on stadia, day 1 now i am replaying it again after the version 2 updates. i love this game."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,still best updated version and trying best not to complete to quickly savor every moment of play...
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"this game just hits different. i really enjoy how visually capturing and immersive it is, i hope they release more dlc or release a sequal or second one."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"rough launch but the devs pulled it back for sure. insane story and the gameplay is also hella fun, be warned though, don't expect a happy story lol. good luck choom."
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"pros the characters, voice acting, visuals, diverse world, tons of content missions, lore, random npc dialogue, etc cons combat can get pretty repetitive and the npcs are very predictable but maybe it's because i'm playing on normal, just sneakily crouching and head shooting everyone, the world feels like the devs had a lot of unfinished plans for it"
Open-World,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-10,"runs surprisingly well on my 6 year old laptop. any issues i encountered often didn't retract from the fun, and i thoroughly enjoyed the story."
