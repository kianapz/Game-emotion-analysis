4u4yJ36YADk,@hainhim123,2025-02-26T01:36:06Z,"I bought the game in 2020, and it was unplayable on my pc, dumped it to the side and never looked back. Four years later, I built a good spec PC and also ran out of games to play, looked back at my Steam library, and gave it a try  (just to test the spec with RT), and OMG, the game has blown me out of the water; it is one of the best story games that I have played within the decade, with excellent graphics, great character development, awesome gameplay, and a beautiful narrative, one of the few games that I follow all the lines of the characters without skipping, and I love Johnny.",2

4u4yJ36YADk,@moppy9226,2025-02-25T08:21:50Z,"Just finished the main story and overall I think it’s good looking game but an average experience 
1. The story starts and ends strong but not very interesting for 90% of it, mission variety with the main story is pretty lacking. The highlight was Johnny and V’s male voice actor is very good. 
2. Gameplay variety is there but the actual feeling of the gameplay is worse than Farcry 3 which came out like over 10 years ago, driving and shooting and moving is very clunky. 
3. Menus are cumbersome to navigate, and side jobs aren’t that exciting and the layout of city all looks/ feels the same 
4. The game crashed on me 3 times on my PS5  
5. It’s basically the ground work of a good game but clearly has a lot of missing areas 
I heard the DLC is good, so I’m looking forward to that.",0

4u4yJ36YADk,@MrLimo217,2025-02-21T08:43:30Z,"It’s great. Probably one of the best RPGs, however, still so much potential to what it was hyped up to be. I’ve never felt so depressed from a game with some of the endings ever, the feeling of hopelessness is dreadful and that’s when you know they did a great job.

HOWEVER!

A fault for the game is that it’s still buggy and unoptimised, even with high spec PCs pop in is annoying and random bugs still appear that can be immersion breaking, yes, it’s not as bad as at release and having to rely on mods is bad practise, especially when they keep updating this game every 6-8 months",0

4u4yJ36YADk,@ovi_4,2025-02-19T22:20:57Z,The best games I ever played and unboubtinghly best by a long shot are HALO and Doom III the more modern games are either multiplayer that needs on-line internet signal or are heavily infused with loads of puzzles and or/boring strategy scenes that I hate ! And cannot stand. To me FPS. (offline style games ) are the best. No multiplayer junk and on-line subscription needed,0

4u4yJ36YADk,@shawnreynolds2728,2025-02-18T17:53:41Z,I bought it 2 days ago and thus far have been hooked. I can run around and screw with other criminals or the cops. I enjoy the story so far and the missions allow me to use my playstyle the way I want to. in other words the leveling and the gameplay allow me to be stealth instead of saying you can do it and taking it away once the action starts. It may change but I love the world so far.,2

It's up there with Mass Effect and Bungie Halo, and that's saying a LOT! I haven't been this interested in a universe since I was a young boy playing Halo 2. I'm 29 now... This game deserves all the praise in the world. From the music to the setting, the visuals, to the story, acting and world-building, it is perfect. 

Every character is just so damn interesting and with some of them, you'll slowly start to build an opinion of them like they were a real person. Without spoiling too much, expect a dark story regardless of your choices. Night City has a way of... twisting one's perception. 

It's almost a therapeutic experience, not even kidding. If you love sci-fi stories, then BUY THIS GAME!",0

4u4yJ36YADk,@kirkshanghai,2025-02-04T22:48:52Z,"I think what I love most about Cyberpunk is that it can be any game I want it to be depending on my mood. If I want a cozy experience I just drive or run around the city at night and take in the sights. If I want action, the game gives me SO many options for incredible combat. If I want a story-- this game's world is so unbelievably big and detailed that every time I play I feel like I discover something new-- even hundreds of hours in.",0

4u4yJ36YADk,@PoliticallyInsensitive,2025-01-25T21:08:23Z,"I really liked it when it was released. I could get passed the HUD extending being the screen and the occasional glitch. Then they started trying to ""fix"" it and it was horrible. A few months ago i played it again and aside from falling through the map while driving faster than it could render (which only happened after the console heated up and could probably be fixed with a good cleaning and new thermal gel- it's a13 year old PS4 Slim) it was fine.
The only ending that's worthwhile is the Nomad ending. You either end up with Panam or Judy and judging from the dialogue you find a way to live longer than Alt said you would. 
I've done all of them except the Johnny ending (started it but didn't finish it) to include the suicide run at Arisaka Tower",0

I got the game when it came out and I was disappointed I will say. But CD Projekt Red have put so much work into fixing the game that it is 100% one of my favorite if not absolutely my favorite game of all time. I didn't play much when the game first released, but I did play once they started fixing some of the issues. I did a play through as a nomad and ended with the panam story. Maybe 60 to 80 hours. Then I eventually replayed the game as a corpo and did every side mission possible and 100% the game as far as I could and had every ending possible except takamura. Had around 170 to 190 hours. I haven't played since they've released phantom liberty and the massive update to go with it due the dlc and update wasn't available for ps4. But I can promise the moment I get a ps5, whenever that may be, Cyberpunk will be the first game I play and I will try to 100% again. Anyways I just wanted to take a second to say that I love the game, and I hope that anyone who didn't like the game or didn't want to play the game due to its original release, I highly highly recommend giving it a chance. I truly don't believe you'd be disappointed.",0

I love story and rpg games but oh my god the whole time I’ve been playing it’s just- track this person down listen to them say they don’t know anything for 20 min then track this next person down and listen to them yammer about characters you don’t know because their name was mentioned once 5 hours earlier in the story then they lead you to another person who talks your ear off all over again. I can’t do it honestly this has been the hardest single player story game I’ve ever tried getting into and I was so excited getting into it but every hour I get more and more confused and frustrated.,1

Until I got really bored months later and said let me actually try it and was blown away by the story when I realized I had to get past the few missions that are basically tutorials. 
I was under the impression that the rest of the game would be as random and as basic as the first few moments. Boy was I wrong, the story literally makes your jaw drop with the intensity",0

Sin destroys everything righteous in your life and separates you from holy God! If you die a sinner, God will punish you with eternal hellfire and darkness! Repent of your sins and believe the gospel of Jesus Christ!

Romans 1:16-32
King James Version
16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;

19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.

20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:

27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;

29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,

30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:

32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.",0

This lets you constantly spam Quickhacks, I like spamming Tier 5 Synapse Burn and use it in conjunction with the COX-2 cybernetic for easily upwards of 2k damage per quickhack since it makes all quickhacks auto-crit (truly amazing cyberware for netrunning, upgrading it to tier 5++ decreases the max ram penalty to only -4, so it's super worth it)",0

Yes, I know, Panam gives you the only sniper rifle with a silencer during her questline, but my dumbass never noticed that until I started gearing up to meet Hanako at Embers. Thought to myself ""Man, I got WAY too many pistols on me, I'm sure Silverhand aka Mr. Wick is proud of me but I need something else... Oh, my gf's sniper is silenced... and I never used it... cool."" 

Also, to be quite honest, you can easily work around not having double jump by climbing over stuff. Sure, it breaks immersion a little bit by floating over rails and stuff, but saves you an implant space to have something else that gives boosts fitting your playstyle. 

Also also I personally had a lot of fun with the fixer gigs, mainly because of how varied they could be in regards to how many enemies you were facing, the location you were in and the multiple ways of getting in and/or out. Hell, even I who enjoyed playing stealth also enjoyed arriving at a job with an Ajax or Masamune and start lighting up fools with 0 strategy, just in and out through the front door.",0

Street cred especially is affected if you dont go around and finish off hurt people. Since damage and death is based off the body part shot, sometimes you find that you maybe finished them off by hitting a limb and they are just wriggling on the ground.",0

Instead of a loading screen into the new area you just get scanned through the border which makes it feel more clean/immersive. Only time you really get a loading screen is when you load up your game and fast travel. Fast travel also is like one of my least used features cause driving in the game feels so natural. It definitely improved since it first came out, plus they added a lot more cosmetics in the new update, including being able to change certain cars colours.",1

For years, I held Red Dead Redemption 2 in that regard—a masterpiece, an unforgettable journey. And now, after all the struggles, all the setbacks, Cyberpunk 2077 has earned its place beside it. This game had one of the most disastrous launches in history, rightfully criticized to no end. It was broken, nearly unplayable. And yet, against all odds, CD Projekt Red refused to let it die. They rebuilt it, refined it, and with Phantom Liberty, they didn’t just fix a game—they cemented a legacy. Experiencing this world now, in its fully realized form, is nothing short of breathtaking. This isn’t just one of the best games of our time—it’s one of the greatest ever made. You do not get better than this. Thank you, CD Projekt Red, for proving that redemption is possible, that passion triumphs, and that Cyberpunk 2077 was always meant to be legendary.",3

1.- finish of the city buildings exploration, most of them are just there for scenery and the high parts of the city are empty, they promised night city was going to be a place with a lot of vertical exploration and they failed at it, only the main quest and one or two secondary quests touch going on top of buildings.

2.- we never got to have the spider drone other than a few animations on the main quest, and that was supposed to be a main feature like for example the drones from watchdogs 2.

3.- the return of some of the many mini quests that got removed from the game with each update, there was a quest that involved a divination machine at pacifica and her quest got removed, again among other miniquests.

4.- and we never got a true reputation and faction system for dealing with the gangs/police.",0

The recent addition for DLSS 4 is a massive upgrade over the old upscaling model.
With the recent addition of Mega Geometry in Allan Wake 2, which not only increases the quality of ray tracing, but also dramatically boosts ray tracing performance (even allowing the 2080 run their heaviest RT settings at 30 fps) it wouldn't surprise me if this tech eventually made its way to Cyberpunk, which would open up path tracing to a LOT of people who couldn't run it before.

There are also rumours that Cyberpunk will come to the Switch 2 within the launch window (not on launch day)",0

All assassination missions can be easily completed in a pacifist way, in which the assassination is replaced by the kidnapping of the target. The fixer will simply send a car to transport the person, and when thrown into the trunk, he will remain alive. Moreover, in about 90% of cases, fixers will only be happy with this turn of events and will thank us (verbally) for letting them deal with him personally.

I don't remember which mission specifically, it seems to be about eliminating a former biotech employee who hit a pedestrian, but since everything happens on the top floor of the building, instead of sending a car to the target, the fixer will send an entire flying garbage truck shuttle!",0

kG1ZdL_ggGI,@arthuralford,2025-02-26T04:34:48Z,"Dakota Smith gives you a gig (""Flying Drugs"") where you have to shut down a jammer that's taking out her client's drones. If you drive around to where you can hack into one of the cameras, switch them until you get the one that's on the rooftop, facing the antenna's controls. You can us Short Circuit to fry the controls, completing the gig. Dakota calls you, impressed that you came up with a solution that she'd never thought of.

Listening in to the NPC's dialogue will sometimes reveal insights on them. For instance, when you go to meet Mr. Hands the first time, wait in the hallway and listen as he has a holocall conversation with his family. It's a side of him that you don't see otherwise. And when you leave Reed and Alex at the Moth, they talk about what they've been up to, and how they haven't had any relationships. Both of them acknowledge they're ""difficult"" people to love. 

And when Gary the Prophet tells you about a clandestine meeting where you'll see what the techno-necromancers are doing, go to the location. Johnny will ask your opinion; take the last option and get a fun response out of him",46

One I’ve been watching updated reviews and maybe I’m just not seeing the ones claiming it’s still unplayable but none that I have seen have claimed or showed anything to say that. 
I’m not saying cd projekt red is absolved for initially releasing this in the state they did. They were wrong in that 100% what I will say though is cd projekt red should get props in my opinion for continuing to work and fix it from that state “despite” all the backlash. I mean all I’m saying to those still hating on cyberpunk 2077 and cd projekt red is this. How many game dev companies take a game released in the state that cyberpunk was and turn it around putting more resources to constantly improve it? Most companies would just say “screw it” and let the game die. This doesn’t mean cd projekt red is off the hook in their fans eyes but it does earn back some faith from consumers. I look at it as their one strike so speak. Never release a game in the state they did this again. Whether it’s the sequel, Witcher 4, the Witcher 1 remake, idc. Chances are there will be some bugs in those releases even if released when ready. There’s too many variables in games like Witcher 3 and cyberpunk to not have a few but there’s a difference between Witcher 3 being released playable with some bugs here and there to patch compared to the initial release of cyberpunk 2077 4 yrs ago being essentially an early access game.

When EA or UBI releases a broken ass game then we would hear about it for a month and then the noise would have died down... off to the next game. CDPR releases a broken Cyberpunk and everyone is loosing their sh**! all CDPR did was what other big corpos do- overhype and undeliver BUT with a twist... they eventually patched the game!

Now bare in mind I only played Cyberpunk on PC and I realise that the game was unplayable on older consoles , but even with all the bugs I did manage to finish the game and I enjoyed it very much. Storyline was fantastic, driving was OK (then again we always compare these kinds of game to GTA and they had way more experience than CDPR) and last but not least... AUDIO! what a phenomenal sound track!

Meanwhile Stalker 2 comes out with barely any game mechanics full of bugs and it's being praised left right and centre- ""it's not bugs, it's anomalies!"", ""it wouldn't be a stalker game if it wasn't full of bugs!"" etc. I couldn't believe how basic and bare Stalker 2 feels. It's like playing an old school shooter with nice graphics. Dialouges are on par with Dying Light - mediocre. If I had paid a full price for that I would be a bit dissapointed to say the least. 

I'm glad that Cyberpunk came on top and managed to solve most of the issues in the game. However I think pulling it from Sony's online shop was a bit of overreach. To anyone who hasn't tried Cyberpunk, you deffinately should! I stopped playing stalker 2 and started my 2nd Cyberpunk run and oh boy was I in for a treat!",0

I played some other games years after realease and they had 1000x more bugs, and more annoying bugs like GTA5, almost all AC, and yet no one make it such a big deal.
So I think those negative reviews were either from people who never played games or forgot about that, or extreme poor people (or kids) with trashy ancient consoles with HDD drives and didn't do anything about it like at least changing to SSD or whatever, they were entitled, like they ""deserve"" $1000 PC performance on a shitty $200 or whatever console...

This is likely because he spends all day every day ten feet away from a shooting range, and is hard of hearing as a result. I also suspect that he's named after Robert Anton Wilson, who was an editor for Playboy magazine, founded the Discordian movement, wrote the mother of all conspiracy theory books making fun of conspiracy theorists, which itself then became gospel to the people it was making fun of (it's also very good, called Illuminatus!, and if you've ever heard of the Illuminati and are under the age of 130 then it's because of him), and was generally a very interesting guy with a lot to say.

Last time I looked, it was still a broken story with no actual quest there. It starts at the small street market where two bums are trying to steal a dude's motorcycle, simply because his daughter joined a corp. Go to the ""Weapon shop"" and a text option comes up to ask the dude about kids getting sick. He points you in the direction of the powerplant, which honestly looks like a war zone. Look.

QNKS3vkGAag,@donaldpriola1807,2025-02-18T22:53:17Z,"As someone who returned the PS5 version initially, I finally bought it at a discount with Phantom Liberty after the updates. If you go in not expecting the world of this game, you'll be pleased. Strangely, it plays closer to a GTA style in some ways, in that while the world is immersive, no, you can't walk into every store, or house. But the characters, scenario, and setting are good, though not Witcher 3 levels. There is no Bloody Baron quest for me (at least so far). Thematically, it could be stronger, for sure. V is bland compared to some of the other characters--I wish he'd been a slient protagonist. 

But man, those times you drive around the city at night, or stroll through a fog soaked hallway, or the whole noir-ish aspects of the early heist mission--those things make you, at least at times, feel like you're playing Blade Runner, or a William Gibson novel. For $40 or so, it's totally worth it.",0

Tim Rogers details it very well in his Action Button review of the game. You can lose sight of the car at the beginning, and you just fail the quest outright. You can kill Joshua when he first gets out of the car, get paid, and never see anything else. You can take the bribe from the producer and never see Joshua again. Your conversation with him in the diner can lead to him not going through with it. If he ends up going through with the BD, you can leave without seeing it, you can stay and watch, or you can drive the nails into his hands yourself. There are a myriad of ways that things turn out, but there’s only one “true ending”, and your choices determine if you reach it. There are many instances where you are given an illusion of choice in CYBERPUNK, but that quest line is not one of them.",0

QNKS3vkGAag,@BadgerOff32,2025-01-02T17:27:44Z,"I've just started playing this game about a week ago. It's the first time I've ever played it, and the first time I've ever played a CDPR game, and I've gotta say.......I'm absolutely blown away by how bloody good it is! It's an amazing game!

As I've gotten older, I've found it more and more difficult to get into big games these days, especially these massive open world RPGs that throw a ton of complicated systems and mechanics and economies at you right from the start, but with Cyberpunk it sucked me in almost immediately and I've been hooked since! The way it tells stories, the way you interact with characters, how fun the combat is, the incredible look and feel of the city......it's hugely impressive! I'm absolutely obsessed with it!

I haven't even bought Phantom Liberty yet, I wanted to play through the base game first, but hearing how good it is and how it can even change the base games ending, I'm excited that I also have that to look forward to as well!",0

QNKS3vkGAag,@OddysseyTalks,2024-09-29T15:47:19Z,"Something else that the base game always got right was the presentation of the character interactions. It might just seem like fluff AAA graphics that don't ultimately matter but it's so much more than that. When you talk to NPCs in the Major quests & side quests in the game, hell even some of the smaller side quests, if feels like you're immersed into a 1st person scene with proper staging, character body language, a sense of rhythm and flow like in a television show, and stage props that you and the characters interact with, rather than just taking part in an npc dialogue tree. And a lot of these scenes you might move to different locations during them and talk while you walk with them. Maybe y'all talk while driving in real time to the next location, or while you're looking for the switch to turn the lights on. It makes all these interactions feel so much more real and slice of life. There are conversations with high tension that happen during big action/set piece sequences, but a lot of It feels like ur really just spending some time with these characters like a slice of life story in this city. There's no party system for the characters to constantly follow you around whatever you go when they have no reason to. They always have their own motives, and they have lives, friends, and places they live outside of you, even if you can become a closer part of that as you develop your relationship to them. It's really remarkable and helps to elevate the story. The stakes of the big heist sequences often only work as well as they do because you're so invested in these characters and you know after how Act 1 ends that you could potentially lose them",0

It's not a bathesda RPG, you can't be whoever you want, but the build crafting and dialogue options give you plenty of opportunities to make YOUR V. A net runner plays completely differently than a melee focused strength build, and you can combine your cyberwear and skill trees in so many different ways to create a character that feels truly unique to you. The lifepaths aren't transformative in how they change the game, but they absolutely work as a light rpg element to flesh out your character's backstory and motivations. Personally, with how ambitious this game is in its dialogue scenes and character animations, I see why these light RPG elements were a better fit.",3

Bought the game a few months ago and I gotta say it's one of the best experiences I've had playing open world RPGs on the PC.
The graphics are amazing, the voice actors, sound design and soundtrack nailed it, the story drew me in, I have fun shotgunning gonks while double-jumping over obstacles and slowing time to Sandevastate them and I'm actively hunting down cyber psychos just to see what that questline will end up doing.
I feel for the people that trusted the devs on day one and got burnt, but at some point you have to give credit for a redemption story or otherwise studios won't bother trying for one.
If we never gave games or studios a second chance, they'd just leave you hanging with the turd they already sold you and move on to another project instead. That they worked so hard to get the game into the state it is in now should get them at least some forgiveness.

Night City was and still is great and filled with potential, but the ""imersion"" aspect of it... man, that argument was weak AF. All your examples show how CP2077 didn't do what all of them did. You have tons of quests in there, sure, but none of them fill like they are NightCity quests. They feel like any RPG sort of quest. You don't interact with NC... it's just a setpiece. That's why NC fails at being immersive and memorable, and Spider-Mans NY, even very slitghlty, manages to shine brighter, at least there everything you do feels like Spider-Mans New York. Is it memorable? I don't think so, they could change the entire city and no one would care, thus why it's the worst of your examples, but the fact that the city allows you to immersion youserlf as Spider-Man makes the game immersive. NC doesn't do that. In a Cyberpunk RPG, they managed to make you feel limited and NC feels like a pretty sandbox as much as any Assassin's Creed game did with theirs cities.",0

Game is stunning and I rarely fast travel just so I can watch the city out the window .. however I  really wish they would enable third person mode when out of vehicles  .. i really enjoy seeing my character IN the world rather than first person all the time .. at least the driving breaks up the monotony of first person view. highly recommend for anyone who has not played this or played it when it was broken - it's really awesome.,0

Only beaten by Alan Wake 2 in visuals. However the game is just bad. Driving feels amazing, vehicles look amazing. The characters are cool but the underlying game is just dogshit. Drive here through this big, beautiful lifeless city. Try to sneak somewhere. Instantly fail cause you're not told to sneak or the level is laid out so badly you're instantly caught. Now you're in a firefight bullet spongey AI that just shoot and rush other options shoot 20 guys. steal car or random piece of Tech, Drive back through lifeless city and call it a day.

It has no 3pp ona game that highlights style and cool yet you can only see your toon on a bike? I bought it on PC and that is it's saving grace as modders to the recue again. The voice acting is great but I don't find the city that dynamic apart from the odd gang attempt on you. And the lighting. No torch or means of light. On one q I had to quit and again download a torch. I had lost all orientation in a pitch black room and wasn't even sure which direction I was looking.",0

Or just a render in UE5 like all those ""OMG XYZ game remake in 8k!!!!"" videos and 8K with all the mods running PERFECTLY smooth w/o a stutter or artifact....i call major BS there as well.....watch a tech review channel and you will see even a 4090 (the 50 series is just the 40 series super (super) so shut it about those) cant run the BASE game that perfect in 4k totally maxed in NATIVE render (this vid clearly has 0 DLSS running as even in 8k it has weird little oddities that are suspiciously absent in all of this channels videos, so great after effect post production editing (but good post recording editing though. Typical click bait bs.

Its sad too, a lot of talented people have made games look amazing with mods, ad yet we have people like this just faking it till they make it and taking a shit on talented peoples efforts by falsely claiming shit like this. Its easiest when most of the audience (not ALL) do not truly understand the technical limitations of hardware and the software (IE DLSS, Frame gen...etc) so that bullshit artists get the clicks. Watch a gamers Nexus video to learn a LOT about how any GPU and DLSS functions as well as do some research and you will see this is a pure grift/screenshot ONLY mod. (mod set)
Not to mention over 6 mos ago no way a 4090 or any AMD or other card can pull this off as perfectly as depicted. Nice try. 

Put a camera over your shoulder, with your keyboard/mouse clear as day also, whilst playing with this is REAL time in a PLETHORA of real world game scenarios, IE combat, Time of Day changes, lighting changes....etc.....or just admit you made a pretty screeshot mod. By that i mean, prettied up just enough and in specific circumstances to take AMAZING screencaps. and useless for any other use. I guarantee in a real world game play session w/o the weather/ TOD set just right it will look BLOW the f out on a sunny day or during other lighting scenarios as well as in combat, prob get blinded by the over exposed white balance.

If this is all above board....well that'd actually be impressive but there is no damn way. Hell the game engine isn't as ""perfectly smooth"" in its animations and world movement as the video depicts. SO again most likely at BEST 4k if its real and STILL a ton of post recording editing to fix all the legit issues. And also the videos are not of legit game play....just static ""walking"" or driving in LOW density or desert environs to get the best frame TIME not rate so as to have less work in post......and again 2 lighting types.....night w/rain and OVERCAST no sun or natural light.,.....BASIC af lux regardless. And thats the problem with most ""PHOTOREALISTIC"" LUX mods....only work in very VERY specific situations and the rest of the time BLOWN out color, white balance and saturation or in this case the MASSIVE lack there of.",0

If virtuous is primarily offshore in low wage countries it's cheaper. Paying a dev in Poland per hour probably costs more than an hourly subcontractor.... And once you have a stable product you can get away with doing things like this to cut costs. Dev subcontractors are still subject to the release management processes of the primary company so quality assurance hopefully isn't skimped on. 

I can't say this is exactly why CDPR did it, but as an industry professional I can tell you why companies I've worked for before have.",0

First, has to be saved as a .png file. Which is easy. Just right click the picture, save it, and just put .png at the end of the file's name. That'll save it as a png.

The second condition is it needs to match one of a few aspects ratios, THIS is where most pictures will just not show up, or they'll be distorted. This is also easy to fix.

Right click the saved picture, edit with photos, and at the bottom of the window is a little frame icon. Click it, set the aspect ratio, and click save, and any picture you save will display properly.

You can Google a list of usable aspect ratios, but the easiest ones to remember are 16:9 and 9:16

This way you can display ANY pictures you desire.

It seems like a waste of developer time to create every little texture and tile, every character model, then having them interact with one another in a way that looks like the world is alive.  Instead, we need a world that is actually alive.  That when players go in, their experience in the world can be different everytime.  The game doesn't have to be multiplayer, but the npcs need to do more than just being randomly generated, which is the most that games can do at the moment.  At the core of these kinds of sandbox games, it's just you and preprogrammed activities.  So you will hit a wall eventually and lose interest.",0

Also, I really despised being shackled into an ignorant support of NewSA (yah, that's how I pronounce it, because why would anyone waste a syllable on it?) and President Rosalind. It made the whole mission of rescuing her a chore that she was insufficiently grateful for.
EDIT: I think it's interesting that you bash the driving controls when you're playing on a console that has to be played with a controller that has analog steering. I expect that digital steering will always be terrible, and I bought a controller just to improve the driving experience. Which it did, but switching between controller and WASD+mouse was too awkward. I think the mouse steering that 7DTD uses would've made the controls much smoother and reduced the interface-inflicted difficulty of many missions.",0

I've been following your channel for a while and really appreciate the insights you provide. I was wondering if you could consider making a video showcasing how Cyberpunk 2077 performs on Boosteroid. It would be really helpful to see if the game runs smoothly on that platform and if it could be a viable alternative for those of us experiencing difficulties on our own systems. Keep up the great work! Thanks!,0

To switch weapons push pause and go into your inventory and click backpack and then u can switch weapons

Ladder 🪜 that don't fully touch the ground you have to shot them to fall down all the way or hit them then you can gain access to it

You can buy apartments just in case you didn't know that

You can steal any car that is driving on the road

You just have to pull your gun out and blast them dead then you can take the vehicle lile real life

This games actually pretty relasitic

About any glitches 

Who cares

Your in a different world 🌎 

A cyber world

did i miss something? might have but u get my point. not much but its something. didnt play it before the change so im not sure but i think thats almost nothing compared to what it was before? think all jackets and thick pants should have that kind of low armor instead of just some jackets but doesnt rly matter that much.

honestly not sure why they would change it to that but for me thats just extra armor and you can change how you look anyways so it works fine.",0

7FA6nSb1DJQ,@JacquesVideos7,2024-10-27T15:31:27Z,"Il go so far to say…. Cyberpunk compared to gta and saints row

Its basically first person saintsrow without overly leaning on goofy humor… 

Every mission and dialogue option feels like it matters. Even if you fail a mission its still how u went thru that mission and story progresses

Mission to mission in gta can feel exhausting because of varying difficulty and repetitive mission types
Where as in cyberpunk you never really know what to expect. Mission could simply be talking to a npc or getting seduced or being the seducer u just never know

All the characters in cyberpunk are interesting not just story characters u feel a almost real bond with some like goro judy or panam

The romance options are almost dragonage levels if your into that type of thing

This game is basically saintsrow meets masseffect in  first person 

Such a really really really good game 
Yes alot of flaws but i feel the launch really damaged the potential of what could have been one of the greatest ever

Didn't notice I already finished both base and dlc. Story is good, but playing it for only 30+ hours doing 2 different endings. I think it's just okay. That's just me.

I haven't touched Cyberpunk 2077 since the first or second week after launch. Thankfully, I got to play Cyberpunk 2077 on our launch Series X, so the experience was damn near flawless, enabling me to be one of the few who saw it all the way through the end. I think I had 2 or 3 minor glitches or bugs that were more funny than bad. Now, we (fiancee and I) also purchased Cyberpunk 2077 for our launch PS5 the same day as our Series X because sharing sucks. Her experience was very different as her game crashed so much it was unplayable, and the bugs were absolutely atrocious. She's going to watch me play for a bit, and if she likes the DLC, we will get it for our PS5 as well. 

So here's my question....will my experience be vastly different? Should I do a full restart of the game or fix my character and jump into the expansion pack?",0

7FA6nSb1DJQ,@xtangero,2024-06-06T06:01:12Z,"Unless you're early into a 1.63 save, you basically need to restart to get 2.0 to play its best. I started fresh when I first got PL and have been having a decent time with it, but I tried booting up my old point of no return character and, besides it lobotimizing my old monowire build, you are hamstrung by not having 80 hours' worth of armor and cyberware boosters, and the new economy changes will probably screw you over too.

After playing to max level on 2.0, I recognize I'm probably an outlier but I've just not had as good of a time as I did in 1.63. The perk tree is stifling, vehicle combat still feels like an afterthought and is crowbarred into random places, and I have had signficantly more performance issues compared to 1.3 and 1.6. There are still good changes, I especially liked the change away from the crafting economy, but that positive and the other fixes don't outweigh the vibe I feel is missing. I'll finish out PL in my dedicated 2.0 save, but for my next run I'll probably revert the game",0

7FA6nSb1DJQ,@Peaches-i2i,2024-05-25T07:17:56Z,"Cyberpunk is just FO4 and GTA5, a game for the masses. It will never go down as a well crafted narrative because it's too poorly paced and they never fixed the UI. It's too much piled onto the plate to appeal to every demographic and it is not coherent at all. Every two seconds characters start talking over each other, interrupting you with a new side mission. Sad, because the core narrative is amazing. If it was done more like Deus Ex, a linear, well paced and balanced experience with side quests that reconnect into the main story then it would be more memorable. It doesn't even make sense to have so much content because if you build a game around choices and different playstyles then you're going to get plenty of play time out of each run. So why clutter that with so much junk?",0

There's a mod that addsMjolnir to the game, additional cyberware so you have even more choices eg. speed legs and jumping legs, performance upgrades to vehicles, texture overhauls, lighting overhauls, there's so many mods and this game has come a long away in that regard since 2.0 it'd be col to see a video on it",1

SqUucWU_smQ,@thekaiser6842,2025-01-18T07:10:12Z,"I’m incredibly grateful that CDPR decided to continue supporting the game despite previously saying otherwise. 2.2 was most certainly a welcome surprise. Not to sound greedy but CDPR should focus a some attention towards creating more content for this game. Now, I’m in no way saying it should be Phantom Liberty tier content, but it would be a very welcomed addition to us all if they dropped a smaller-scaled dlc (such as a casino heist story for instance) along with new gigs and ncpd scanners. Maybe even the addition of radiant quests. 

I’ve been gaming since the 90’s and I can confidently say that Cyberpunk 2077 is my favorite game of all time and one of the best games ever developed. Despite the early hurdles; it overall proved to be a resounding success and I find it baffling that the team has decided to produce only one, single dlc and more or less shelve the game. A game this great deserves a at least one more addition. CDPR exhausted a commendable level of time, energy and finances improving and polishing this game that it stands today as very technically impressive alongside its overall dynamics that entrance the player in such a unique way that it stands leagues above most other titles within a similar genre. I really do think it would serve everyone’s interests in dedicating a small yet effective team of devs towards producing reasonably-sized dlc products for 2077 while the rest continue focusing on Project Orion. I really do feel that Cyberpunk 2077 as it stands now is left largely untapped in its immense potential for continued support.",1

Need a fix for that for sure!

Also, the skin texture of the NPC's feel over exposed when they are seen in the open areas with direct sunlight, this needs to be fixed. Contrary to this, the NPC's in the shadow areas, for example, under the flyovers, tunnels or behind or inside the buildings etc. their texture details are top notch, similar to everything that looks fab and super cool during the night time light settings.

CqmLhSJxgT0,@FaonPage,2025-01-26T23:00:44Z,"Where it's not a surprise that you get a performance hit with the transformer model on is that it's way heavier than the CNN model, they managed to make it run well enough by optimising their use of the AI performance of the card but this one model has a lot more data and will come at a cost especially if you're not using super resolution (with just ray reconstruction on DLAA for example, the cost of this model gets very obvious the more you go back in time towards the 2080Ti, you can see that in the digital foundry video, the 5090 has so much more AI tops that its not an issue). 

We now have the answer of why they decided to still give the option to go back to CNN without getting rid of it completely like they would for older tech like between DLSS 1.0 and 2.0 for example.",0

It's mainly clothing and whatnot, and I wanted to ask since im interested in similar mods as you, if I download all 4 of your nexus collections, do you think it'll hopefully fix some of my problems?

2pUnUU27-mk,@DJchucklenuts,2025-02-09T23:01:00Z,"Regarding Bawdy Dog, In Cyberpunk Red the TTRPG that is in the same universe as 2077 but set during The Time of the Red circa 2045 you are dealing with a post Johnny AHQ explosion and NC hasn't really recovered from that with much of the outer city being a combat zone (think Dogtown but much bigger and less organised). In the game you play as Edgerunners and one o the interesting mechanics of the game is the rent and lifestyle system that is basically what you pay at the start of each month to survive day to day with a roof and food.

The least expensive lifestyle is the ""kibble pack"" lifestyle where you eat ""kibble"", which is basically dogfood but with human flavourings like cheeseburger and similar. It's an extremely bad thing to have to eat and no one likes eating kibble but it will keep you alive which is all you can really ask. Food in NC tends to be expensive so I think Bawdy Dog saying ""your taste"" is in reference to this kibble being flavoured like human foods.

Since there is probably some kind of law saying it has to be marketed as pet food when it's really just for the exceptionally poor to survive another day, I think that's why they use animals despite them being so rare in NC.",0

If I was a good player people would still hate me. That was a waste of my time.",0
xX7tvQg2Ql0,@DerOrso,2025-02-13T07:08:35Z,"You need Item Components to upgrade your Cyberware. You need Eddies to buy Cyberware and things from merchants.
Typical below Tier 2 arms you 'find' sell for about 600 - 800 Eddies and break down to 5 Tier 1 Item Component, but if you need ICs, no amount of money allows you to purchase them... directly. But....

If you want to play absolutely vanilla, you do this. Buy Slaught-O-Matic guns from vending machines. There are 3 next to each other right in front of the Ripperdoc's office near the Goldsmith Street fast travel box. There are two in the Atrium level of Megabuilding 10. Leaving MB10 turn left and walk to the parking garage, turn right, walk up the street, crossing the first street coming from the left, then turn left on the side walk and find two more vending machines. In Kabuki in the market circle where the gun and the netrunner dealers are, on the lower level, where the gun dealer is, if you walk around the entire circle, there are 4 or 5 vending machines. Those are the ones I know by heart. There are many more.

As I stated before, arms you 'find' break down to 5* Tier 1 IC, but sell for 600 - 800 Eddies. Buying Slaught-O-Matic guns cost 100 Eddie each and breaks down to 5* Tier 1 IC. That means, the pistol you can break down to 5* Tier 1 IC, if you sell it--anywhere you sell gives you the exact same price, even Drop Points--you get let's say 650 Eddies, which you can use to buy 6 1/2* Slaught-O-Matic guns, which you can break down to 6 1/2* Tier 1 ICs, which is 1 1/2 more than if you break them down directly, but you have to work for it.

Or you can do it the easy way, but people are going to start screaming and pulling their hair out, and crying that it is cheating... use console commands to trade your Eddies and ICs without going through the rigmarole. Sell all the stuff you don't want wherever you want. For every 100 Eddies you can buy 1* Tier 1 IC. For 5* Tier 1 ICs you can craft 1* Tier 2 IC. For 5* Tier 2 ICs you can craft 1* Tier 3 IC. And so on. Just do the math.

Use console commands to remove the money you 'spend' for ICs and give yourself the equivalent in ICs. The vending machines will sell about 25 guns if they haven't been used in a long time, but far fewer if they have been used within at least the last 24 hours (game time).The only difference is in not running to every Slaught-O-Matic vending machine all over the map, standing there and buying gun after gun, until the vending machine runs out, to buy the guns for breaking down. 

So you can do a lot of running around to get guns to break down to get the ICs you need, all completely fair and within what the game allows, or you can simulate doing the grinding by using console commands. If you think you should have to sit there and click, and wait....... click, and wait....... click, and wait....... to buy guns you then just break down, you are a sick puppy - go find a doctor. That's not the kind of game I want to play. You do you, but leave me out of it.

Starting with Tier 2 weapons, the ICs you get greatly exceed the Eddies you get for selling them. For example 1* Tier 2 gun breaks down to 5* Tier 2 IC = 25* Tier 1 IC = 2500 Eddies, but sells for only about 1100 - 1200 Eddies. So above Tier 2 weapons, it is better to break them down for ICs. Always check and do the math.",1

I might even argue that calling it a ""playthrough"" suggests that you're going to run it more than once, probably making different decisions and/or building V differently. Each time, you'll likely miss and see things you didn't during the last time(s) you went through it.... That's actually a big part of the appeal of games like this. Suggesting that any of what was shown here ""ruins"" a playthrough is some ridiculous mongering  crap to get people to click. Saying a playthrough can actually be ""ruined"" also suggests there is a correct way to play the game.... And there is most certainly no ""right"" way to play Cyberpunk..... If anything, the right way to play is ANYTHING you do in-game  which  makes you think, ""This game is ******* awesome.""",0

_dClJsNUbpY,@MrRiddleAW,2023-10-21T00:44:28Z,"I normally play this mission depending on the lifepath I've chosen.

If I play as Corpo V - I make the deal with her and go along with the plan. The way I see it, Corpo V is more likely to make a deal and stick to her word.

If I play as Nomad V - I make the deal but I get rid of the virus and tell them Militech is onto them. But I try not to get involved in the fighting even letting Royce and Dum Dum die, and freeing Brick from his cell. The idea is that my Nomad V is neutral so they are willing to play both sides and take advantage of the chaos. 

If I play as Street Kid V - I go to the meeting without making a deal with Meredith and take my chances with Royce. Depending on my mood I'll either blow his head off or I just make the deal with him. For me, my Streetkid V is anti corpo so he/she would not make a deal with Meredith or Militech, so going to the deal and doing it normally is more preferable.",0

YgMKpEFCZpA,@dubvermin,2025-02-23T19:50:27Z,"Nice video, thumbs up :)

This game is something else... Being a seasoned gamer, I was dissapointed at first in 2020 when the game launched... apart from bugs, polce AI, i was mainly dissapointed because the open world felt kind of empty to me, when just exploring - apart from sidemissions/gigs there was no thrill ""around the corner"" apart from some combat, and maaaaaybe some chest to open, i clearly didn't understand the game as a whole back then so i uninstalled after around 10 in-game hours... 
I gave it a shot a second time in 2022 after patches... and oh boy was I in for a ride... I was born in '82 so the game scratches a lot of nostalgic itches for me - blade runner, johnny mnemonic, ghost in the shell, this game is a sweet combination of all those things we loved about distopian future presented in the movies of the '80s '90s and some games from those epic times.
The game is easy to pick up and i didn't feel overwhelmed by any aspect of it.
The presentation in Cyberpunk 2077 is truly next level, even without ray tracing the game looks amazing, the sound is great, and in general the amount of love that was put into subtle details in this game is truly admirable. 
I was in awe when exploring Night City, i truly felt in love with it's vibe and the promise of greatness.
The fact that you can play this game for hours without experiencing almost any loading screen (and that my seasoned GTX 1070 could support steady 60fps with FSR on Quality on medium/high) is truly next level optimisation. I let Night City take me on a ride, and i got hooked, like i love to be hooked with a game, which happens rarely now, since i've played so many other games already... I played Cyberpunk 2077 slowly, savoring it, every detail about it. I was often putting walk mode on just to take it all in, i just wanted the experience to last as long as possible. The story, the lore, the weapons, the combat, the music, the ambience, the characters, the voice acting, the cars you can own, the apartmens you can own (and it really makes sense to go to shower and sleep in them like a human being due to exp buff) it's all just friggin' amazing. Night City is a place I didn't want to leave, it's so immersive that i just could not stop playing this game, and i was somewhat sad when i 100% everything, wishing for a ""memory-wipe"" so i can experience all of CP 2077 from the beginning :)
Despite some hate in the past, and the state of the game being far from perfect (but it's pretty close), CD Projekt Red has once again created something remarkable. This game has a very unique feel to it and it does what it set out to do very well. And let's not forget it's their first FPS game...
I truly recommend Cyberpunk 2077 to anyone who wants to immerse themselves in a truly deep futuristic experience, with a story that leaves you thinking - is this the kind of future we are bound for?
I give this game a 9/10.",0

I knew about the rough launch it had so I stayed away from it best I could. I bought the game and DLC on clearance for $55 at the beginning of the year. I beat everything the game had to offer in about 144 hrs. I was devastated when the credits rolled. I have never ever in my 20 years of gaming had post game depression and I got it hard when I finally beat Cyberpunk. I was sooo immersed into this world that I would legitimately DREAM about being V lmao I know it sounds wacky but I went through breakup depression when Panam didn't want to know anything about me after the 2 year coma. I will be starting my second playthrough as female V but I want to sit with it first for a couple more days. From the soundtrack, to the characters, voice acting, action, choices and THE STORY! This game will always a ride I will remember for ever. Great first video btw!
EDIT:
I'd like to add that since I went in completely blind on my first playthrough, I beat the game without doing Phamtom Liberty first, I had no idea it took place in between Act 2 and 3. So I got the Nomads ending with Panam first.",0

That just makes it all the more impressive that something like this was made. Also the slang. That is the first time in really a game or movie that I can think of where the made up slang worked. Like worked so well that I want to use it in my vocabulary now. I just finished it the other day for the first time but I feel empty now. Like I couldn't do anything else in the game. I finished everything so I had to finally fight Smasher and because I was so OP at that point it was ridiculously easy. I would often just piss off MaxTac just to have a bit of a challenge. But I didn't want to leave NC and now that I'm done I feel like there isn't really anything else that can take it's place because of the immersion of that game. It was home away from home.

4 years later it's my favourite game. I didn't expect to be able to buy apartments, i didn't expect we would be able to actually sit in bars and drink, i didn't expect they would rework the entire skill three, i ABSOLUTELY didn't expect vehicle combat to be so damn GOOD and SMOOTH.
I didn't expect to have such an amazing DLC. I didn't expect they would bring metro back. 

I just didn't expect this beautiful but lifeless city would turn into something i would just have fun messing around with, but here we are.

P.S.: If you want challenge, i recommend switching on hard difficulty. If you want dark souls, i recommend switching to Very Hard. Because it's actually very hard now.",0

I played the game in this order and absolutely loved every second of it. The convo with johnny in the motel, feeling helpless in trying to save songbird, the absolute hate on Myers, the connections with people you make along the way, and finally the last ditch effort of soloing Arasaka tower with johnny only to find out that you are doomed to die.

nl2RRUkckyw,@beck4715,2025-01-05T23:20:04Z,"Spoilers ahead in case anyone reads this and hasn't played Phantom Liberty. I also recommend stopping halfway through the vid in that case because there be dragons.

Love the video and the conclusion. The whole game is nothing short of a masterpiece and hits hard even on a second playthrough (maybe harder than the first time around). Phantom Liberty may be one of if not the best stories I've played through and your choices genuinely feel like they matter right up to the very end. Went with So Mi too and felt so betrayed that I called Reed, but refused to take the single dose. It may be minor but it felt like I was actually crafting the story vs playing through someone else's, and the game just...let me. By the end it felt that much more impactful because everything that did/didn't happen was on me.

Your comments on difficulty: the game definitely feels better to play on Hard imo since there's a chance you could actually die in combat encounters if you don't focus up. Every bit of gameplay I've seen on normal looks like having training wheels on and you can tank waaaaay too much damage.

I played on Hard and even at max level with an endgame build that robot at the start of Phantom Liberty could ruin my day if I just stood there (but to be fair, I didn't have a ton of survivability). Very Hard may not be for everybody but I do recommend trying it out. Fair warning though, you die a LOT faster. I switched over halfway through PL when Hard got too easy and that final fight against black ops was really tough even with Sandevistan and insane damage. But it's a good option if you feel your build has trivialized combat encounters.",0

nl2RRUkckyw,@SoapChill,2025-01-03T20:42:04Z,"I luckily was not on the hype train when cyberpunk came out. I actually had little interest in the game. 

I for one i'm glad that the game came out in a broken state, especially after foolish children sent death threats to developers FOR delaying the game. I'm so glad it was broken for those people that decided that harasment was the way to get the game to come out SHM. Disgusting behavior from disgusiting people. 

Anyways. I got cyberpunk few months after the dlc came out and i saw it on steam with the dlc for like 20 bucks, or some really good discount not sure, but i got a good deal.

I recently bought Mass effect andromeda for 3 dollars on steam, I was so curious as to why it has so many mods for it on nexus mods that I wanted to see if they ""truy"" fixed the game.

halfway through andromeda, i was kept thinking about that interaction you have with malestrom in the beginning of the game in cyberpunk, and how YOUR character always has the power, and how your character always talks and does what you want. And I just stopped playing andromeda right then and there, got some new mods for cyberpunk and started a new game, and man... The dialogue the world, the combat.

One of the best games i've ever played, with arguable the best open world city/map i've ever gotten a chance to play on, and I love elden ring, but what cyberpunk did, i think superceeds it because it has people, and stores, and they all are believable in this world.",0

While I am enjoying the game right now in it's fixed state, I hope CDPR learnt from this and understand what they need to do for the next cyberpunk.

Next, V does have a support system - Misty and Vic. Not to mention all the new people they meet throughout the game. All of that plus Johnny acting as a psychological buffer is probably the reason that V hasn't gone full cyberpsycho, but it's ALSO probably the reason that - as we see when using the Edgerunner perk - V may suffer from occasional bursts of cyber-mania.

4QuPqc2XcQg,@xXLoneLoboXx,2025-02-22T09:12:06Z,"I’ve discovered new information to this!

I don’t believe the relic kept V from going Cyberpsycho at all. On my recent playthrough instead of going to meet Dex in his limo, I decided to break out of Watson and go farm gangoons in Pacifica to level up. (I want one of the dudes in the heist to drop a tier 5++ Tamayura.)

At street cred 50 you can unlock all types of cyberware, including arm and leg cyberware that everyone swears you can’t get before the heist.

My little crusade in Pacifica before meeting Dex has only netted me 18 levels so far, but I’m fairly certain you can fully chrome yourself out before completely before even meeting Dex if you get a high enough level first and get enough money… Which is way too tedious to do when you’re trapped in Watson at the start of the game.

Unless there’ll be some kinda pop up stopping me from installing every bit of chrome I can before the heist, that means the relic isn’t doing squat to keep V from Cyberpsychosis… V’s just that strong.",0

Therefore V's morals are in constant flux. Most people he encounters are seen as NPCs and he mows through them if they're in his way of getting shit done. Sure, the ""special"" people he runs into are important to him and he strives to help them. He believes he's a good guy and all the collateral damage is necessary, but from an outside perspective, he's a monster.

Or if i want to keep it quiet i do very similar just from a camera inside the complex im raiding. Either way its definitely not anything that invites Max Tac to my doorstep. 

So im for the immunity thing due to the unique nature of the engram chip fucking with his brain. Hes still there in the story enough to be V but the overwrite takes more of a stranglehold by the point of getting into Mikoshi but we still dont see V losing his memories, just gaining Johnny's",0

One implant in a very mentally unstable person boom cyberpsycho that's what the humanity score was in the table top game this is even on the radio in game and said by the creator it's not cyberware it's the mental state. V is just a very mentally sound person.,0
4QuPqc2XcQg,@kevinyamil2103,2025-02-19T23:37:21Z,"Cyberpsychosis has less to do with implants and more with the psyche of the person. If you pay attention to the NCPD Cyberpsycho gigs, every single one of them had a set of events that caused them to snap. This, with implants, makes snapping into rage a bigger threat, considering simple implants like sport-focused ones can turn into weapons. The brain chemistry can also be affected by the implants, to a degree. Also consider the fact NC is a zoo full of violence, this also having a 'brainwash' effect on people overall. 

 (e.g. The mechanic, paid for the garage; but the tools, jacks, and all the machines you need to run it had to be paid separately)

There is a phenomenon similar to what amputees describe with the implants where it feels alien and stuff. But that is just one more factor for many. Also the chip doesn’t save you. You are the chip. Multiple characters refer to you as already dead. IMO V and Jonny are on the chip the chip is using Vs brain like an interface to make them “V” but it’s just a marionette. That’s why you can be switched in the end. It’s also the entire point of what is happening to you. You’re  test case for SaBuro taking over his son’s body. That test case is then weaponized using the psyche of Jonny Silverhand to attack Arasaka on behalf of the independent AI. That is why delamaine sais that your itinerary has been arranged in advance. It’s referring to the excelsior program but also to the e story in general. I would boil the whole narrative down as two opposing forces. The Blackwall AIs slowly taking psychological real-estate by backing the gangs and saburo arasaka trying to become an AI in order to stay the dominant force in the world to come.  V represents both the victim of this and also the only agent with any choice in who succeeds. But it’s a war that doesn’t matter to you, that will finish long after the story but it’s also every single story in the game. (Phantom liberty is a fall in quality there)",0

Back in earlier versions of the game, you could put certain mods on your cyberware. One of which would put an outline over enemies that are aware of you. Adam in those scenes would be glowing red, showing that he's actively aware that you're present, but since you pose no threat, he doesnt care. He's not asset protection, he's just a bodyguard.",0

omyoJ7onNrg,@foggy_EQ,2025-02-22T23:30:08Z,"i'm super late commenting but i'll still go out and remind people of this. There is zero excuse for a bad port to PS4 and Xbox One. They are very old and outdated machines, true, but, nobody *forced* CDPR to release the game on those consoles. they sold it at equivalent price to the pc version. at the end of the day the statement that: ""this game is too much for ps4"" can be true. but what isn't true is saying consumers who bought the game on console were foolish to think that it would be a good experience cuz the hardware is very weak. These are dedicated gaming platforms. they are not marketed as PC machines even if they are all just computer silicon in a different plastic box. Not that it matters given the fact that they were selling it as it was at the same price as the PC version, but, we should remember that console hardware is only there to service their platform. the platform and eco-system are what the user interacts with and the internals are their to simply operate at a fixed level across all the same consoles. While much more complex, we should see consoles in the same light as streaming boxes. streaming boxes have a processor and all the stuff necessary to be a computer but it's all their to support the platform. if the machine can't play 4k streams well and you were to sell a movie that doesn't offer a lower res version to stream no one blames the user who was under the impression that they would purchase a product that functions.",9

This video aged like milk!”. The point of the video wasn’t to show how the game is now, it’s how it was at release, which is unacceptable. It’s amazing how modern gamers as so far regressed that they can essentially get served a steaming $h!t on a plate, but then the chef apologizes and brings you actual food a over a year later and now you’re happy. As a person with integrity and standards, I would never have come back or waited for my actual food. Gaming sucks now and gen Z goobers with literally nothing better to do will put up with any and all garbage practices in the industry now just because. This regression didnt happen overnight, and being over 30 and seeing the early industry of gaming vs what it is now has been a really depressing experience. Can’t blame them for getting defensive and acting like this is the best game ever when they didn’t get to have the experiences we did growing up.

No grandiose death fulfilling a legend nor some drive off into the horizon trying to get my life back as a rockstar in someone else's body... It just ends, normally becoming another face in the crowd. And I think that's why my V's ending is the most successful of them all.

X6iqzPECYCw,@Upsidedowndog27,2025-02-27T01:57:49Z,"I straight up just forgot about cyberpunk for 4 years. I just started playing seriously 2 days ago and with everything working and running smooth, I can confidently say cyberpunk is an amazing game. I’ve barely touched the story (only done the initial arasaka job and met with takemura at the diner) but I am having so much fun. I just got electrifying mantis hands and I freaking love them. But. And this is a big but, but I will never, ever, ever forget cyberpunks launch. It is single-handedly the reason why I don’t trust a single game company anymore. CD project red was one of the most loved and trusted studios ever. They gained that trust with amazing titles like the Witcher 3. And then for them to take our trust, our money, and our time, and just throw it in the trash hurt man. 

The game was unplayable on my Xbox one s when it launched. I even kept trying to come back like every six months to see if it was playable yet for the first 2 years. Then I just stoppped checking and caring at all. I wrote it off as one of those cool games that I would only really be able to experience with a nice pc. For years it’s hurt my soul. It still does hurt. When it initially launched I wanted everyone to just not buy it even after it became playable. I wanted everyone to ruin cd project red for what they did. And to a certain extent I still feel like they don’t deserve the success cyberpunk has now created. It’s a great comeback for sure, definitely no mans sky level, but I think cyberpunk was even worse. At least no mans sky was playable. 

To finish this long ass comment I just wanted to say that now I think the game is amazing and fun, but I will also never trust cd project red again and will never pre order a video game ever again in my life. (Unless it’s gta of course lmao)",0

Maybe it’s because I for the most didn’t have my beliefs challenged because I already had a really deep hatred for intelligence services but I was just found myself throughout the whole thing being like “yep these organizations are full of really horrible people who you shouldn’t never trust and never trust that they’d do the right thing” I found reed to be a pretty repulsive character in general. I didn’t really feel any pity for him or for Alex. (Who I didn’t find particularly likable either) songbird however was much more interesting as a character to me. I wasn’t mad at her lying or being manipulative to people because given her circumstances she has probably had to do that all her life to get by and survive and probably doesn’t trust that people would willingly help her. So I sent her to the moon at the end reed and everyone else be damned. And the game agreed with my view seemingly when reed was fighting tooth and nail willing to break international law and get people killed to take songbird back into NUSA custody. The whole time I just found myself with the same thoughts for the most part these spies are shitty people and songbird is more of a victim than they’ll ever be.

Like it is a very high quality experience and it’s nice to see something that isn’t just “oh they do bad things but someone needs to do bad things for the right reasons” but for me it just didn’t really hit that hard.",0

X6iqzPECYCw,@Ralius-sv7nz,2025-02-13T05:12:05Z,"Dude you must try the witcher 3.

As i said, for me its better then cp77 and i have 2600 hours in cp77. 

Bloody baron is part main quest part side and dont you worry witcher 3 has many, many side characters that will blow your mind. Bloody baron quests have been deemed best moment of the year for games when it came out and for good reason, it trully is line of quests that touch many subjects from ptsd, abortion, alchocolism, etc. but are dealt with in a such a delicat way that no matter where you stand on those issues you dont feel like its lecturing you, it provides you with a human context for these issues and allows you to make up your mind. Geralt is also a great fuxking main character, grumpy, sarcastic, stoic loyal, and not to be messed with, think of wolverine, joel from the last of us,and with a bit of kratos of sparta and al bundy from married with children even. but keep in mind that he is a preexisting character, so his options regarding dialogue and choices will be more limited then Vs because there are somethings that geralt would not do no matter what so you cant do them either.

Expansions are top tier aswell, on part with phantom liberty, and, honestly, hearts of stone expansion i would even put above phantom liberty when it comes to story and its main bad guy, of which i cant tell you much because the less you know the better, but i think its the best bad guy in video games period. From dandelion, zoltan, the jarls of skellige, death and rot and illnes of velen, coruption and stentch of novigrad, monsters, dark rituals, sacrifices, politics, lore, emperors and kings, other witchers that you meet and more...

Like i said its incredible. But before you start few things.

Witcher 1 and witcher 2 are also great games, witcher 2 when it comes to graphics still holds up, witcher 1 has not aged the best and is a bit grindy i wont lie. But if you could play them first that would be great. Sadly given how they are structured it would require at least 2 playthoughs. So if you cant aford the time at least give yourself a few hours before the witcher 3 to watch some sort of retrospect on those two games and their story from youtubers that you know are good at that, to get the story. But a proper retrospect not a review, that wont cut it. 

There is also thronebreaker but that game is very different, you play as queen meve and it takes place before all three games, during the events from the books, but its a... strategy/card/RPG that might not be your cup of cake since it relays on a version of a card game invented for the witcher 3 called gwent... which is a great card game, you will see it in the witcher 3.

Regarding the witcher 3. You must, must i repeat must take your time with it. its a slow burner that requires detail playthoughs, you cant run though it and expect it to work. Take your time, while you are in the starting area do a bit of main, a bit of side stuff, before you leave make sure you do all of it, you can come back later on if you missed something so dont wory too much about it. there are events not on the map so exploring is a must, you cant realy soley on markers. Explore and read notes, shit even graves have stories to tell. For example in starting area there is a story thats not relaed to geralt but you will hear about it from other people, maybe you wont even notice it its said its like rumors and hush huah tones, but if you pay attention you can cobble up the story on your own. there is no reward for it but thats fine, not everything has to have a reqard for it, its a small world building detail. So you must take your time, its slower and, to be honest, quite bigger then cp77 when it comes to story lenght, i would say its almost double the lenght.

Good luck on the path.",1
X6iqzPECYCw,@Ralius-sv7nz,2025-02-13T04:15:42Z,"Its weird... i consider witcher 3 and rdr2 to be better games in almost every area... but cp77 does have something that keeps me from moving on just yet, even after 2600 hours.

X6iqzPECYCw,@UrPilotNatt,2025-02-05T10:49:11Z,"No clue if this will be read (especially since it will probably be extremely long) but i love this game and need to talk about it.

I had bought Cyberpunk when i should’ve been using that money for something way more responsible, but i just had an impulse after seeing its fixed and had really good reviews. I had 0 clue what I was in for, this game just worked, it played for me in such a way that just left me like wtf.

The start of the game was exciting and new and left a ton for me to explore. It was kinda like with rdr2 where everything was so new i just felt great. i’ll never forget at the start of the game with Padre with this whole new city, with my lights off. So much wonder at what felt so large. I became so immersed I’d rest my arm on the desk and nod LOL. Then meeting jackie and doing a ton of side stuff, it just felt great and new. So much wonder in this universe. 

Then Jackie died… This was a powerful moment for most I assume. but this marked a part where i genuinely felt incredibly alone, and the world just felt, off. it was beautiful it was so well crafted, but it did not craft a feeling of wonder but rather, jesus christ. I didn’t get any more time with Jackie than anyone else but i had spent 10 hours ish doing side stuff that i didn’t even know was side content, it felt Id known him forever. I’ll never forget fighting my way to the biochip, and seeing the game shed a whole new light i had missed because i was so dang obsessed with a fantasy. the game tricked me into feeling exactly what it’s about!! i’d meet judy and absolutely obsess over her story, but as time went on, i felt like i was just finding these broken characters who couldn’t help me, i felt like anyone but judy was stepping on me and using me. i still loved them but i began to feel alone, and hopeless. except for daum johnny silver hand who’d pop in my vehicle and i’d drive around with for 10 minutes. and takamura being an idiot around a phone. 

The game sold me on a dream and forced me to fight alone, which as much as i’d tell panam or judy night city ain’t so alone when you got V around, i was a daum fibber. night city is lonely as hell, unless you got a terrorist in your head, and even he makes you wish you were fully alone. jkjk he becomes chill as hell and lovable, but in the beginning my god LMAO.

then finally the ending. i had decided to spend one last night with judy at my house and do a little dance swaying my arms while she goes absolutely nuts. i remember waking up and seeing her asleep, knowing daum well i’d probably never see her again. i took a step out the door and i seriously down and cried irl. It felt like i was losing something. despite being a game that generally was so depressing, it provided so much entertainment and amazing moments and it just drew me in. driving in the starter vehicle saying goodbye to night city, only to finally be on the roof. saying goodbye made it feel final. oddly enough in that moment in the roof, i’d finally come to acceptance with the whole thing. i felt like it was my last shot, and that i’d just have to make a decision. and one last look into night city after long contemplation i let johnny take the wheel. the whole sequence was crazy but generally unimportant. but that feeling of saying goodbye to your character you’ve grown so close to, knowing you had picked the wrong choice to keep going. it hit me like a ton of bricks. i felt so sorry for her, as she had failed. then the grave saying goodbye to yourself, the music, it just felt so strange. like i wasn’t just sending off a fictional character but 50 hours of my life that i can never repeat for the first time. saying goodbye to someone id been for so long to escape. on that bus i just felt empty, and judy making the call begging V to call back, i wasn’t a cry baby man. 

this is a long ramble, and i could talk a ton more about the individual characters and stories, but the feelings were just astounding. the characters lead perfectly into a narrative that essentially put me into the story. and judy is a goat, her storyline is the best!! absolutely genius game, it’s my third favorite ever, it means a lot.",0

X6iqzPECYCw,@MN-vz8qm,2025-01-22T00:52:18Z,"Hey OP, buy a super beefy computer, some good VR googles (ok that will be an investment), then download Luke Ross VR mod, plus as many mods as you want :

- probably starting with ""dark future"" in which you have to eat, drink, sleep, manage your stress, the one you have to manage your car, plus the edgerunner one which simulate cyberpsychosis, and the economy of 2077 which makes buying stuff much more difficult

- then the mods which allow you to socialize more, drinking and dancing with your friends in bars and nightclubs, the one where you can pay for braindances etc... what's cool is that these mods have been adapted with the previous ones, so meeting your friends in bar, watching a braindance, drunking booze decrease your stress level for example

-  and of course a bunch of graphic mods; I like particularly those which make ads on the street videos rather than posters, and the one which put all tv shows and ads in 60fps HD. Oh and the one which remove music outside cutscenes is a must have too, so that the noises and radios arent parasited by the same combat musuc all the time.

Here, we are totally at the mercy of corporations and a government that now seems to work for them instead of caring and protecting the people they were hired by. I feel helpless to change anything in this country, but in the world of Cyberpunk, I feel powerful, and dangerous to those who compromise our happiness and freedom in a mad, desperate and greedy race for more money and more power. It’s ironic that it took playing V, someone who is completely at the mercy of a chip in her head, to feel in control. Add to that the amazingly real-feeling characters and friendships forged along the way, and the tough choices presented to us, and this very quickly became my favorite game of all time. Even more so than RDR2 and Witcher 3, both of which I adored. I’m pretty sure I’m on my 7th play through and have no idea when it’ll finally be enough. I fear it never will.",0

X6iqzPECYCw,@quantumjet253,2025-01-07T03:23:05Z,"(Writing this prior to watching the video!) There are a handful of game mechanics within Cyberpunk that I believe are the pinnacle, absolute perfection, of game design. 

First and foremost for me, although I know this isn't true for all, is the view perspective. First person is the most atmospheric, 'realistic', immersive way to experience a virtual world. We're not controlling a puppet, we're not 'watching' an avatar go through an experience, we're experiencing it first hand. In my opinion, no action-orientated game, should ever be 'third-person' or 'first-person'. All should be the same as you'd expect a driving or flying game to be; to allow the gamer to choose what suits them, what they consider the perfect way to experience a game. 

Another aspect to a lot of modern games that is equally game-mechanic perfection is customisation. This was literally stolen from pre-video game role-playing games offering the ability to customise a character, their load-out, their equipment, their weapons, their means of transport and their clothing. Why this is such a perfect feature is that it allows every gamer the opportunity to make a game feel like it's theirs, like it was made for them. Clearly a gamer has to love the setting, the style, the look and feel of a game, but by having the ability to make choices to customise a character to suit their taste and style instantly makes a game feel more personal. I think we all feel 'closer' to our character, we're playing 'our' character, how we want, regardless of how the story or how missions are designed.

The single most profitable aspect about games, that has undeniably massively increased the number of gamers, brought unbelievable wealth to the industry, and why so many corporations within it exist and why money-obsessed people and businesses entered this industry is down to one thing; games can look absolutely stunning. Gaming never needed graphics to evolve as much as they have, and I'd argue that the industry would be better for hardcore, genuine gamers if this hadn't happened! But it was always going to, and its an advantage to proper gamers that the games they were always going to enjoy are more enjoyable because some genres and styles of games are better for improved, beautiful graphics. A downsides to this is that it's encouraged people that aren't really gamers, that are graphics-obsessed wouldn't have entered. A big detriment to the budget and time required to make such games is that smaller, potentially more creative, more gamer-oriented/understanding developers are overrun by corporations, and often at the mercy of money-obsessed, and now incredibly powerful publishers who wield the power to finance games beyond the capability of a developer, encouraging them to rapidly expand, and if the game doesn't hit, often an unrealistic profit level the developer is shut down. Don't care about that, but I think all gamers do care about long wait times, games being released unfinished brought about because non-profitable development time has a limit. 

Cyberpunk has certainly benefitted from the increased and detailed graphics games can achieve. And equally the downside too; taking a ridiculous amount of time to develop, and being pushed out to the public unfinished and clearly requiring more time fix it and make consumer-ready. Which incidentally is on gamers for continually rewarding/ignoring the industry's most disrespectful attitude towards those that allow it to exist.

This game tells its story well, is pretty well written, has some decent voice-acting (ignoring K. Reeves of course!), is set in a detailed world that often allows several approaches to achieve set goals (perfect mission design game mechanic), and is pretty polished and of an incredibly high standard throughout. Yeah, I think its an excellent game, and I'll always be annoyed that immature, impatient gamers forced the developer to give up on an online version that could have seen the game have a continual stream of new content.",0

I finished the storyline in jsit a couple of intense days, and I was absolutely blown away—not just by the content and story, but especially by the characters.

Honestly, I’ve been struggling a bit since completing the game. It sounds strange, but it almost feels like mourning. I experienced the highs and lows of forming relationships with such a diverse group of characters. I witnessed their struggles and, for some, the hope waiting for them on the other side.

I’ve never been this invested in a game before, and I think that’s because it doesn’t just feel like a game. It feels like I’ve met a group of people I care about but will always be just out of reach.

WR_CVOIV3rA,@iseeu-fp9po,2025-02-12T15:50:25Z,"I'm just going to let ChatGPT summarize the various issues with Cyberpunk 2077 on the PS4:

""Cyberpunk 2077 ran poorly on the PS4 due to several technical limitations and design choices that pushed the aging hardware beyond its capabilities. Here are the key reasons:

1. Memory (RAM) Bottleneck
The PS4 has 8GB of unified GDDR5 RAM, which is shared between the CPU and GPU.
Cyberpunk 2077 is a highly detailed open-world game that requires significant memory bandwidth for assets, AI, and physics.
The game often exceeded the available memory, leading to slow texture loading, asset pop-in, and crashes.
2. Weak CPU (Jaguar Cores)
The PS4's AMD Jaguar CPU is 8-core but clocked at only 1.6 GHz.
The CPU struggled with the game's complex AI, NPC density, and physics simulations, leading to stuttering and frame drops.
Many features, such as NPC behavior, were simplified or broken due to CPU limitations.
3. Slow Hard Drive (HDD)
The PS4 uses a mechanical HDD instead of an SSD, which significantly slowed asset streaming.
Open-world games rely on fast data streaming, and Cyberpunk 2077’s high-detail environments suffered from slow texture loading and pop-in.
This also caused long loading times and crashes when moving through the city too quickly.
4. GPU Limitations
The PS4’s GPU (1.84 TFLOPS GCN-based AMD) was underpowered for the game's real-time lighting, high-resolution textures, and crowd density.
CD Projekt Red targeted a high visual fidelity that was more suited for high-end PCs and next-gen consoles.
As a result, resolution dynamically scaled down (often below 720p), and frame rates dropped to 15-20 FPS in demanding scenes.
5. Lack of Optimization & Poor Scaling
The game was primarily developed with PC hardware in mind, featuring high-end lighting, physics, and AI.
The PS4 version suffered from poor level-of-detail (LOD) scaling, meaning objects loaded too late or were missing detail entirely.
Patches improved performance somewhat, but at launch, the game was practically unplayable on base PS4.
6. High CPU & GPU Load from Open-World Features
Dense NPC populations, vehicles, dynamic lighting, and physics simulations were too much for the PS4 to handle.
Unlike older open-world games, Cyberpunk 2077 aimed for high interactivity and detail, making it difficult to run on weaker hardware.
7. AI & NPC System Performance Issues
The AI in Cyberpunk 2077 was ambitious, with dynamic reactions, pathfinding, and combat systems.
On PS4, AI systems often broke down, resulting in glitchy NPC behavior, disappearing crowds, and broken police systems.
Conclusion
Cyberpunk 2077's performance issues on the PS4 stemmed from aging hardware limitations, lack of proper optimization, and an overly ambitious game design that was built for stronger systems. The game required extensive patches to make it more stable, but it was clear that the PS4 was not capable of delivering the intended experience.""",0

WR_CVOIV3rA,@shadowswithin702,2025-01-02T20:49:20Z,"Just before I fully watch this and I will, I know I'm going to get the familiar angry feelings over this game. And yes over a video game I know many of you will not understand, and yes they made it better in the end perhaps. But having played Witcher 1 and 3, I was very excited for this game. And yes in hindsight being excited for a video game, I should have known better.  But I was excited and thought considering Witcher 3, it could be something that would be phenomenal. And it was messy and not very good, and the problem with the DLC is. I don't know how much of the cut content from the game, which was sizable is in that DLC.  Might be none or may be considerable, making me pay for cut content not a fun scenario. Considering how angry it made me playing the base game, in the end my mate went halves with me when the DLC was on sale. Mostly because he wanted it, and he knew I didn't want to give any more money to CD project Red. I've not played it and I don't know if I will, I now no longer trust the developer. But they did teach me a valuable lesson, don't be excited for a new video game. And if you reading this enjoyed it fantastic, not knocking your experience. And just to be clear, the game still has bugs and cut content. Which could have made the game even better. They had our trust as gamers, they were a beacon for doing right by their players. They didn't need to do what they did by, releasing it before it was ready and lying to their dedicated players. But they did and while aspects of the game are good, I wonder at what could have been. And in the big schemes of things, does it matter to you no probably not. With all the other rubbish releases lately, I'm not as perturbed as I was. But I will never lose that yucky feeling, when playing this game. After watching the video, dam I knew the console version run worse than the PC copy. But to see how badly especially on ps4, the PC wasn't great but far better than this. Sorry to the console players honestly, for me it will always be stained no matter what they do.",0

As a matter of fact even though the game is technically much better now, this may be a bit controversial but I actually think the game still has a lot of issues. I think the game is now just average. It’s not a terrible game now with all the bug patches but Cyberpunk 2077 is still nowhere near a masterpiece and never will be. The game has issues by design even beyond just having bugs and glitches up the ass.

In fact, I’m even going to do my own video on this game soon. I definitely have some things to honestly say about this game.",1

Also addressing the lack of random events, I dont know about anyone else but naturally running around the city organically brought me to several story and side missions that all felt like they were on a guided path despite me just driving or running around the whole city.

And here's the weird part. RDR2 played incredible on the older gen i.e. Xbox One and PS4. The textures were still incredible, but that game was well over 100GB so it made sense.

I always thought when I pre-installed mine, the rest of the game would load?? It was only 50GB. I was thinking, why is it half of what RDR2 has? Thankfully your video shows that first version is almost gone.",0

5Cs-Q5Sodgw,@rezarfar,2024-09-24T05:11:09Z,"This video is slightly off the mark, it's missing a huge piece of information, just how disastrous the launch of this game was.

This video doesn't really explain the depth of deception CDPR actually undertook to manipulate the sales of this game, what CDPR actually did in my opinion, will never ever be recoverable, no matter how much they try to make up for it. It was a big deal. A REALLY big deal.

CDPR actually manipulated the narrative surrounding the state of the game prior to the launch because they KNEW it wasn't just broken, it was fundamentally NOT what they were advertising, they used the early access reviews to basically pull a pre-order heist.

The early access for reviewer's was a small 45 minute demo of the game and to even get access to the demo the reviewer had to own a high end 2000+ dollar PC. Various different reviewers throw up red flags about this that were ignored by the majority and gaming journalists.

Then there was evidence that journalists were paid off to be stifle any negativity about the game, further manipulating the narrative surrounding the quality of the game. Heist successfully done 

This doesn't even go into the fact that the very game itself was a lie, it was not only broken in terms of bugs, there were fundamental gameplay alterations that were not evident from trailers that were NOT in the game, that isn't just a bug in the game.

Then you couple that up with the fact that the game had the potential to literally BRICK YOUR DEVICE, it wasn't just broken, it was one of the biggest disaster launches in gaming history. I think only Concord and ET surpass it 😂. Only reason game even exists today is because, as i said, they pulled off a pre-order heist, managed to rack up nearly 10m sales from pre-ordes.",0

Cvx228_Joa4,@douglasw0,2025-02-03T07:12:03Z,"So I'm guessing the reason that Pawel posted what he did is that they're developing additions for the character creator to port directly over to the next cyberpunk.  With Project Orion announced, the likelyhood is that whatever ""additions"" come to character creation in 2077 over the next period of time, those same additions will likely find their way into Orion.  It's telling that the focus of the request is character creation and not game play.  Character Creation is absolutely something that could be ""ported"" to Orion while any game extensions / game play additions would not be.  I suspect we'll see additional push in any other factors that could be ported...for instance 2.11's car paint jobs would also be content that could be technically ""ported"" to another version of the game.

Given that CDPR's got all their eggs in the Witcher 4 basket right now (400+ developers on that team assumedly), having an outside studio work on Cyberpunk extensions that could very well be the beginnings of development for Orion makes a LOT of sense...gives Orion some code right out the gate.",0

I'm sure to use that Hidden Gems mod as well as the DLC Liberation since I obviously missed all the twitch drops and such, Extra Iconics also sounds pretty good! Now the only mod I may also look up is if there is a mod to remove that scar you get when getting Kiroshis, it was annoying to see it through the whole game.
PS: I may also check out Dark Future mod since even during that first playthrough I liked to put my V to sleep and such, now I'm going to actually benefit from that and it will make different apartaments actually more fun to use. And with the amount of customization options already in the mod, without the need of reinstalling/downloading different versions of it I can always tweak things up to make the experience more comfortable to me.

I believe it sets the difficulty to very hard so even if your original save was on normal the new game plus one will be on very hard though you can just change it back to your original difficulty if you want.

Also note this mod is a double edge sword, as these NG+ saves cannot be cross platform transferred and the NG+ save is hardcoded to require the mod so if you remove the mod you will not be able to use the save.",1

I only wish all the drugs and combat boosters fro SythDose affected your nerve and/or humanity from the other two mods, but it adds a toxicity system that works similar to the Witcher, and makes perfect sense in the world. WannabeEdgeruuners adds a humanity system which can make you go cyberpsycho, much like the show, and SynthDose adds combat booster for some awesome  boosts in combat, but you have to watch your toxicity, and it evens add a cyberwar to help you manage your toxicity. All in all two of the best most game change mods out there. Both of these are on my top 10 for sure, and maybe my top 5.

Cvx228_Joa4,@N00bie666,2025-01-04T23:26:31Z,"Something to note about the NG+ mod is that when you start a NG+ your level will be reduced to 50 if you have PL and 40 if you dont because the mod author ""Wanted progression"". ALSO if you use the NG+ mod to make a new save you can NOT load that save affter uninstalling the mod. this is a completely arbitrary and pointless restriction that the mod author coded in, not due to actual limitations but solely (By their own admission) to keep people using the mod. this also means that if the game updates again you have to rely on the mod author to even PLAY your save. I do NOT recommend using the NG+ native mod. instead pick up a savce editor, there are a bunch out. start a new game and manually make your lvl 60 character with gear and all that jazz. its not that hard and you wont be arbitrary limited by nonsensical limitations. if you want a scaling mod, there is some on the nexus too.",14

5mhb5cQWtlo,@saprone8885,2025-02-05T18:44:38Z,"This is not the most broken. Netrunning build using almost exclusively Synapse Burnout (I know is very boring) is the strongest. Katana build is the second, but the gap between them is pretty steep. Melee and netrunning builds are the only builds which can conformably kill MaxTac at the hardest difficulty. Katana's are the strongest of the melee weapons, Byakko being the strongest of them all like you mentioned.  

The main issue with melee builds is that you do not have as much reach compared to netrunning. I have tested min-maxed katana builds extensively and I often die at some point by a sniper shot. You can also get bursted down easily by turrets/mechs. I test builds in the big camp near the Golden Pacific travel point and usually spawn in MaxTac as well. 

Another downside is that you will run out of time with Berserk/Sandi uptime, which make you quiet vulnerable. Netrunners in comparison can stay in Overclock indefinitely with Synapse Burnout massive 3 seconds extension on kill.

Also Berserk is stronger compared to Sandi. Both Sandi and Berserk basically make you invulnerable, but Berserk has a longer uptime. Especially if you use the Zetatech Berskerk, which has a 11 second duration with only a 25 seconds cooldown.

Another notable improvement would be to use Countershell cyberware. It is one of the most OP pieces of cybereware in the game. It helps a lot with preventing burst damage for a low cyber capacity cost. 

Next Second Heart is a big trap of a cyberware piece. It has a very long cooldown activation and costs a lot of cyber capacity. You should use Bioconductor and Heal-On-Kill instead. With that extra capacity you can get the Cockatrice optics, which will significantly increase your dps. 

At last the perk Edgerunner is also a trap. The health loss is never worth the extra cyber capacity. Health is one of the most important stats for survivability. You have enough cyber capacity to get all the important pieces of cyberware for any build without using Edgerunner.",1

Best post 2.0 Katana by far right against hordes of enemies that pairs well with Sandevistan is *Byakko.* Higher attack speed than Cyclone-modded S++ non-iconic Katana, although the attack speed buff is not permanent and instead only lasts for a few seconds after killing someone. So start combat against the weakest of the enemy group. In bossfights without adds this weapon actually is a bit on the weaker side so you might want to carry a second katana for those encounters.

The *Errata* is actually a very strong option - if you play with incendiary nades instead of the launcher arms.
It would pair even better with a Contagion + Overheat (Raven Microcyber) build than with throwing knifes and Sandy though. In that setup Errata jumps to the top. But then the build is of course not a Sandy-Katana build anymore but primarily a Contagion explosion build with the Errata being one of many tools in the pocket to make enemies go boom or give them the rest if they survive the boom.


When going for Berserker instead of Sandevistan (some people want that) the *Gwynbleidd* sword becomes a very strong option, assuming you actually take enough damage to stay at below 25% health to benefit from the effect. Works best with Militech Berserk if you activate it at below 20% and don't use items/perks that heal you. The 25% effects are still active with the other Berserks but as soon as you regenerate a single point of HP you lose them. Make sure that you combine this with other implants and perks that activate at or below 25% health and explicitly not something like Heal-on-Kill, that would be counterproductive. Though Byakko might actually still be a bit better against hordes in this setup but not by much as in the Sandy build. Gwynbleidd will decimate bosses though - the extra 25% damage also applies agains ""minibosses"" like MaxTac elites. Requires that you own Witcher 3 on the same platform and account to get it.

*Jinchu-Maru* is a very decent, high damage option if you go for Optical Camo. Doesn't have the attack speed of Byakko or effects of Errata or Gwynbleidd but the higher crit damage makes up for it. You can even get crit chance very high outside of Optical Camo - the higher your crit chance from all sources is the more competitive this sword becomes. But it probably still never outclasses the Byakko against hordes but it will outclass it in bossfights, especially if you can use Optical Camo mid fight.



Best throwing weapon by far is the *Agaou,* especially with the skill tree for throwables filled out. Iconic electric axe with highest damage per throw.
It would have one of the highest damage per throw values even without the shock effect but that is icing on the cake, especially against mechs/robots. When going for headshots or breaking the weakpoints that's even more ""alpha strike"" damage.
Found in an organized crime activity in Dogtown (requires Phantom Liberty).",2

5mhb5cQWtlo,@linktojinx,2025-01-30T07:40:32Z,"So I literally just beat my first playthrough. I'm level 60 and I use my point switch early on. I've got 16 points in intelligence thinking I was going to jump back and forth between St devaston and cyberdeck, but I was wrong. 

Sandy is the way to go, so I only have five in my body but I have 20 and cool, reflex, and tech and I have all the best cyberware you could want for anything to dash around in and do melee, I highly regret not putting those intelligence points in body. 

Things like fallout corrupted my brain because in fallout strength is usually the second the last thing besides charisma I worry about. I'm a minimalist with inventory. 

So I had told myself halfway through my playthrough that this game was so intense I was going to do everything on the first run and then take a break from gaming all together, and because of this one mistake I feel like I missed out on a huge part of my playthrough and now I've got to play through it again with the right point allocation.",9

5mhb5cQWtlo,@s3eriousbl9ck26,2025-01-22T04:32:18Z,"3:26 oh how wrong you are. At base you get auto Crits for well timed blocks and the only defense you have other than movement and cover. I can tell by your gameplay you dont have that down. 

When its used with some Cyberware magic and a little skill you get auto Crits, Stamina and Health refills and Speed increase at the cost of no Stamina for blocking. I got clips of blocking maybe hundreds of bullets in one Kerinzikov activation. Many of them had HMGs and Snipers and as you said, you play on Very Hard.

 Sorry but not using this on VH while having a blade build with a Sandy that has room for it is pretty foolish. And I dont even like playing on VH. Its enough AI breaking the game to make you miss on Hard as it is. But ive had my fair share of Maxtac waves and from what i can tell its just an excuse not to rely on OS activations and spamming playstyles. Not to good for those that like to use the full combat system.",1

jiobXmQF3d8,@charmine953,2024-08-30T22:41:24Z,I personally think Street Kid is the most canon path for V. Though I can see the corpo one being there too since Takemura us a shining example of a street rat who turned corpo and rised the ranks which you can fall under the same format only V took a demotional hit. I tried the Nomad since I enjoy the story arc with Panam but its not as enticing as Street Kid and Corpo with the city lifestyle V persues.,0
jiobXmQF3d8,@Derah_OG,2024-08-30T01:53:04Z,"Nomad as a really good minor interaction. In Watson there's a side gig that normally has a pretty depressing ending, unless you're a Nomad. Spoilers incoming:




In that side gig you're hired to kill a woman. She's a cop, one of the EXTREMELY RARE honest cops in Night City (Other such rare examples of honesty in the NCPD include River and Barry). This cop is investigating corruption in the Kabuki market, and her own fellow officers order a hit on her. It's pretty heartbreaking to see such an honest paragon of morality in such a corrupt city meet her end like that. If you're not a Nomad, that quest can only end in two ways: Either you kill that cop yourself, or you spill the beans and tell her that her own fellow officers ordered the hit, this will cause her to drop the investigation, leaving her temporarily alive, but days later you'll hear a broadcast on the radio that she went cyberpsycho and shot up her precinct before being gunned down by Max Tac. So she dies no matter what............

Unless you are a Nomad, and DON'T mention to her that her fellow officers ordered a hit on her. If you follow that path, you can instead recommend her to leave the NCPD and Night City behind and join the Aldecaldo clan. If you do that, you can later find her at the Aldecaldo camp, playing with their kids, and she honestly looks happier than she's ever been.",1

Corpo is my favourite though, all around more interesting background for a video game (personally)+more interesting dialogue, also V doesn't feel like a complete newbie for NC so it gives an interesting twist. The whole coming into terms (and becoming best buddies) with Johnny also feels more poetic as a Corpo.

jiobXmQF3d8,@vincentgc1,2024-08-08T15:39:56Z,"Nomad is the best if you wanna metaplay, you get a free car, can upgrade Jackie's bike (6 tech required), making it the second fastest bike in the game with smooth handling (my personal favourite bike), if you're male V you also get tons of unique conversations to have with Panam if you're going for the romance (making it impossible to fail the romance), pre-cyberware update you also got free unique ripper upgrades. 

Corpo is the best if you want cash, since a lot of in-world events and such you can just use your corpo convo instead of cool skill to pass checks. However the money for such events and quests sucks, it was good pre-PL update since you didn't earn a lot of money from selling weapons and cyberware. But now you can sell a common weapon for 1.5k ED (used to only be 50-150ED), which is basically the same as additional rewards from cash-quests and gigs. So you might as well just horde weapons and sell instead of choosing the corpo lifepath. Plus you start with a lower relationship with Johnny cause he hates corpos.

Street-kid doesn't come with any benefits but it seems like the most lore-accurate and it does have a lot of flavor dialogue in almost all main quests (blue options), but nothing that can earn you more or alter outcome",1
jiobXmQF3d8,@rickkcir2151,2024-08-06T18:59:12Z,"Street kid always made the most sense to me. Fits in with V’s desire to be a legend. Since only a street kid would really have a dream like that. Their relationship with Jackie also seems more natural. Going from strangers to friends after getting their asses beat. Since they’re both street kids I can see them bonding quickly. 

Nomad is second best to me. Especially with the Panam interactions. Though I feel like the relationship with Jackie is a little forced. Nomad V and Jackie should have practically nothing in common. I also find it odd that V would decide to stay in NC. Why not try and find a new clan, or stay in the wastes? V has pretty much never been in the city before and decides “yup, my new home”

Corpo is a mixed bag. I like the dialogue options it comes with. But V never felt like a corpo. Our position implies we’re fairly important. Yet we somehow already know Jackie, how? Why is our upper corpo character friends with some gang banger from the hood? It’s never explained. Plus, going from an office job to a merc is kind of a leap in career paths. Sure, V was fired from Arasaka and is likely blacklisted from any gainful employment. But it’s still quite the jump.",0

Then, if you go with the Aldecaldo ending it completes his transition from being bound by corporate greed to being completely free of the rat race and city life altogether. It also makes the most sense as to why he would have the skillset required to be suited to the Tower ending in Phantom Liberty and YES I said HE every time on purpose.

It makes that Opening Cinematic of V and Jackie make more sense, the Aldecados with Panam feel more lived in, and just the Nomad path has a better feel to it. Streetkid, though, makes you a NC Native with Dialogue that makes sense from a RPG standpoint if you’re going for a V that is familiar with life here in NC. Corpo though, it’s been 4-5 years since I played all three paths and I can’t remember the real benefits Corpo brought besides really getting into Corpo property and roleplaying a V that “you know Corpos inside and out and wanna get back at them as a Merc”. Replaying the game now, with Phantom Liberty, Nomad and Streetkid seem like the right paths when playing but it’s always the player’s preference.",0

To add-on to the game 2 allow your character to diversify the cause-and-effect outcomes of your choices who you are beginning and who you are now. I mean seriously, if you're gonna make the game with multiple life paths, multiple choices you've got to make it affect the game. Certain weapons you can never get in one life path are available in another, but other weapons that are specifically for the life path that you had in the original game you played. Aren't available in the other life path. so forth and so on.  I mean, the rust pockets wherever it called a car, guys should be able to have access to heavily modified cars and top of the line cars and reactionary adrenaline. Type of implants that are even better than when you get access to corpos.  Street Kid should be given A cou.
 Ple of negative modifiers at the start. But when you finally get rid of them, you should get like at times 50 for your EXP and extra slots on top of 4 your intelligence and physical stats and stuff like that.

And it only comes out after you get rid of your deficiencies or if you put in the right type of tec. At which point you'll be able to go beyond?

Sin destroys everything righteous in your life and separates you from holy God! If you die a sinner, God will punish you with eternal hellfire and darkness! Repent of your sins and believe the gospel of Jesus Christ!

Romans 1:16-32
King James Version
16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;

19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.

20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:

27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;

29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,

30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:

32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.",0

Disagree with Fingers but it's my personal disgust with guy and how he treated Evelyn.
Disagree with Panam, she is spoiled brat bitch that doesn't care about you unless she can use you for her benefit. She hates authority, wants to be in center of the world. I felt bad for Saul.",0

But ratting out Panam wasnt because im a car collector; I just straight up thought with my brain instead of my crotch, and realized that shes a bratty princess with anger issues, and me and my V were having none of it. Storms off on rogue, whatever you say to her gets her snappy, And she only shows you affection when you are good little pup and do as she says, no matter how stupid 

That being said, after a Corporate Hacker run like that, I did go through the game again, and a Meathead ""Block with Face, kill with fists"" is a PERFECT match for this roadhog nutcase",0

KvMY1uzSC1E,@epicguy111,2025-02-22T02:38:33Z,"Early Life
David was born to Gloria Martinez in the back of an ambulance while it was speeding through the streets of Night City. While re-attaching the arm of an edgerunner who had gotten it shot off, Gloria felt her water break, so she quickly finished the sutures before telling the mercenary to swap seats with her, then proceeded to deliver her own baby on the gurney, with the ambulance still speeding towards a hospital. The merc alongside her cut the umbilical cord using the mantis blades in the arm Gloria had just reattached. A brutal yet somewhat poetic tale that bonded mother and son in the awareness that she would do absolutely anything for him, and he would never let her down.[5]

David grew up on the streets of Santo Domingo, living with only his mother in an apartment of Megabuilding H4 in Arroyo. Life in Santo was not easy, as danger was behind every corner of the trashed-filled district, though Gloria did her damnedest to raise her kid all by herself and to shelter him from all possible threats. The problem was that David grew up feeling he was destined for something big, and because of this, he was usually bored of the mundane life. Anytime something dangerous happened in the neighborhood, David was overjoyed if he could be present. For these reasons, he scoped and kept tabs on anyone and everyone in and around his megabuilding, talking the ear off of any edgerunner he had never seen before. Soon enough, David was visiting the local ripperdoc clinics to ogle any new cyberware they had received, eventually brining him to the doorstep of Doc, whom he befriended. With all this curiosity, there were times when David got beaten up, but his fervor never diminished. One time, however, he pissed off the son of a 6th Streeter, who pinned David down and started punching him. The fellow kid kept on going until he finally broke his own hand and promptly started wailing while everyone else was watching. David thought of that kid as a little bitch, and despite being covered in his own blood, he began laughing, which he kept on for almost an hour later. This incident impacted the locals, which meant no one in the neighborhood would touch David ever again, and with some of them reassuring David he was special, and that he would do great things in life.[5]

Due to Gloria's great effort into her job as an EMT for REO Meatwagon, David was eligible for enrollment into the Arasaka Academy after successfully proving his grades. At some point after, David began selling XBDs to classmates that he obtained from Doc. Despite this life, David never felt he belonged to, especially since his fellow classmates were all from rich backgrounds.[1][R 2]

A Day in the Life
One night, David watched a new illegal braindance that Doc obtained from editor Jimmy Kurosaki. The braindance contained the death of the former NUS Armed Forces Lt. Col. James Norris, who went cyberpsycho a couple hours prior.[1]

The following day, after finding his mother sleeping on the couch, the two talked about money problems regarding his school expenses and watched the news of Norris' death, which included D",1
