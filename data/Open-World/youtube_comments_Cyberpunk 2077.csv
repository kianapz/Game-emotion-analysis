Always liked the game, but after my last playthrough, where I got all the remaining achievements, including all the endings, I can honestly say this is one of my favorite games ever. 

It's up there with Mass Effect and Bungie Halo, and that's saying a LOT! I haven't been this interested in a universe since I was a young boy playing Halo 2. I'm 29 now... This game deserves all the praise in the world. From the music to the setting, the visuals, to the story, acting and world-building, it is perfect. 

Every character is just so damn interesting and with some of them, you'll slowly start to build an opinion of them like they were a real person. Without spoiling too much, expect a dark story regardless of your choices. Night City has a way of... twisting one's perception. 

It's almost a therapeutic experience, not even kidding. If you love sci-fi stories, then BUY THIS GAME!",0

If I want a cozy experience I just drive or run around the city at night and take in the sights. If I want action, the game gives me SO many options for incredible combat.

Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition ‚Äî City of Dreams,1gvGn8NtIpE,@TimKuat,"It is a rare thing for a game to transcend mere entertainment and become an experience‚Äîone that leaves an imprint on your soul. There are bad games, okay games, good games, great games, and even legendary games. But then there are the few that redefine what gaming can be. The ones that, when the credits roll, leave you feeling like a part of yourself has been left behind in that world. For years, I held Red Dead Redemption 2 in that regard‚Äîa masterpiece, an unforgettable journey. And now, after all the struggles, all the setbacks, Cyberpunk 2077 has earned its place beside it. This game had one of the most disastrous launches in history, rightfully criticized to no end. It was broken, nearly unplayable. And yet, against all odds, CD Projekt Red refused to let it die. They rebuilt it, refined it, and with Phantom Liberty, they didn‚Äôt just fix a game‚Äîthey cemented a legacy. Experiencing this world now, in its fully realized form, is nothing short of breathtaking. This isn‚Äôt just one of the best games of our time‚Äîit‚Äôs one of the greatest ever made. You do not get better than this. Thank you, CD Projekt Red, for proving that redemption is possible, that passion triumphs, and that Cyberpunk 2077 was always meant to be legendary.",3
