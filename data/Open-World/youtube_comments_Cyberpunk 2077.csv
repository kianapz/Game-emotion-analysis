It's a completely unique experience which no other game can provide. And of course, as it's a CDPR game, so it's all about the storytelling.

It's up there with Mass Effect and Bungie Halo, and that's saying a LOT! I haven't been this interested in a universe since I was a young boy playing Halo 2. I'm 29 now... This game deserves all the praise in the world. From the music to the setting, the visuals, to the story, acting and world-building, it is perfect. 

Every character is just so damn interesting and with some of them, you'll slowly start to build an opinion of them like they were a real person. Without spoiling too much, expect a dark story regardless of your choices. Night City has a way of... twisting one's perception.

The only ending that's worthwhile is the Nomad ending. You either end up with Panam or Judy and judging from the dialogue you find a way to live longer than Alt said you would.

I got the game when it came out and I was disappointed I will say. But CD Projekt Red have put so much work into fixing the game that it is 100% one of my favorite if not absolutely my favorite game of all time. I didn't play much when the game first released, but I did play once they started fixing some of the issues. I did a play through as a nomad and ended with the panam story. Maybe 60 to 80 hours. Then I eventually replayed the game as a corpo and did every side mission possible and 100% the game as far as I could and had every ending possible except takamura. Had around 170 to 190 hours. I haven't played since they've released phantom liberty and the massive update to go with it due the dlc and update wasn't available for ps4. But I can promise the moment I get a ps5, whenever that may be, Cyberpunk will be the first game I play and I will try to 100% again. Anyways I just wanted to take a second to say that I love the game, and I hope that anyone who didn't like the game or didn't want to play the game due to its original release, I highly highly recommend giving it a chance.

1gvGn8NtIpE,@TimKuat,"It is a rare thing for a game to transcend mere entertainment and become an experience‚Äîone that leaves an imprint on your soul. There are bad games, okay games, good games, great games, and even legendary games. But then there are the few that redefine what gaming can be. The ones that, when the credits roll, leave you feeling like a part of yourself has been left behind in that world. For years, I held Red Dead Redemption 2 in that regard‚Äîa masterpiece, an unforgettable journey. And now, after all the struggles, all the setbacks, Cyberpunk 2077 has earned its place beside it. This game had one of the most disastrous launches in history, rightfully criticized to no end. It was broken, nearly unplayable. And yet, against all odds, CD Projekt Red refused to let it die. They rebuilt it, refined it, and with Phantom Liberty, they didn‚Äôt just fix a game‚Äîthey cemented a legacy. Experiencing this world now, in its fully realized form, is nothing short of breathtaking. This isn‚Äôt just one of the best games of our time‚Äîit‚Äôs one of the greatest ever made. You do not get better than this. Thank you, CD Projekt Red, for proving that redemption is possible, that passion triumphs, and that Cyberpunk 2077 was always meant to be legendary.",2025-02-02T05:36:45Z,3

Sin destroys everything righteous in your life and separates you from holy God! If you die a sinner, God will punish you with eternal hellfire and darkness! Repent of your sins and believe the gospel of Jesus Christ!

Romans 1:16-32
King James Version
16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;

19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.

20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:

27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;

29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,

30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:

32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.",2025-02-08T08:53:30Z,0

This lets you constantly spam Quickhacks, I like spamming Tier 5 Synapse Burn and use it in conjunction with the COX-2 cybernetic for easily upwards of 2k damage per quickhack since it makes all quickhacks auto-crit (truly amazing cyberware for netrunning, upgrading it to tier 5++ decreases the max ram penalty to only -4, so it's super worth it)",2024-12-13T04:55:00Z,0

Yes, I know, Panam gives you the only sniper rifle with a silencer during her questline, but my dumbass never noticed that until I started gearing up to meet Hanako at Embers. Thought to myself ""Man, I got WAY too many pistols on me, I'm sure Silverhand aka Mr. Wick is proud of me but I need something else... Oh, my gf's sniper is silenced... and I never used it... cool."" 

Also, to be quite honest, you can easily work around not having double jump by climbing over stuff. Sure, it breaks immersion a little bit by floating over rails and stuff, but saves you an implant space to have something else that gives boosts fitting your playstyle. 

Also also I personally had a lot of fun with the fixer gigs, mainly because of how varied they could be in regards to how many enemies you were facing, the location you were in and the multiple ways of getting in and/or out. Hell, even I who enjoyed playing stealth also enjoyed arriving at a job with an Ajax or Masamune and start lighting up fools with 0 strategy, just in and out through the front door.",2024-11-09T21:23:16Z,0

LFi_2CCy6mk,@NRXStarStruck,"A tip, when you go to do the NYPD or side missions, you potentially lose XP by choosing non-lethal options. Street cred especially is affected if you dont go around and finish off hurt people. Since damage and death is based off the body part shot, sometimes you find that you maybe finished them off by hitting a limb and they are just wriggling on the ground.",2025-01-25T21:13:29Z,0

Instead of a loading screen into the new area you just get scanned through the border which makes it feel more clean/immersive. Only time you really get a loading screen is when you load up your game and fast travel. Fast travel also is like one of my least used features cause driving in the game feels so natural. It definitely improved since it first came out, plus they added a lot more cosmetics in the new update, including being able to change certain cars colours.",2025-01-22T22:33:04Z,1

n0VI0LHUaIY,@fatihsultan1923,"I am a Turk and I love CD Proced Red as a company very much. This game was full of ties when it first came out but now there are very few ties and the story and atmosphere of the game are very good. Our character Johny Silverland is very good. Judy Panam Takamura are also very good characters. Almost everything can be done in the game of course it gets boring after a while but as someone who played RDR2 for 700 hours, you can easily play it for 500 hours. Of course, you can do new things in games by starting from the beginning etc. The graphics are also very good. My computer is a medium level computer and I can say that it is my best game after RDR 2 so far. It could be a masterpiece. It would be great if they brought other things to this game that would not spoil its originality and reality and removed the small ties. Of course, while you can do everything in this game, at the same time you don't get exactly what you want. You have sex, you don't see her vagina, you don't see sperm, you hit the man's head with a shotgun. You hit it, it doesn't explode, and there is an age restriction in this game, they should add them and charge 2 or 3 dollars more
V, we are very good too, but we can increase our level by going from place to place, but we can't go to cyber town for the development of implants, there is no time left, and the game takes a very long time, the character reaches its maximum power, but after a while it gets very fast, the characters' speech and voices are very nice, so if you say you will play the game but I don't know whether to buy it, or if you are between RDR 2 and cyberpunk, if you want vajsi bati, if you want RDR2, something in the future, I recommend CYBURPUNK 2077

NOTE: Don't start while learning a language program while improving yourself, I made this mistake, I started while learning English, I started while doing 3D modeling and design outside of school, I started while doing illustrations, if you are going to start, finish these works in an hour, I will play first, then do it Don't say that, you will have a lot of trouble in the future.",2024-12-25T22:19:49Z,2

2.- we never got to have the spider drone other than a few animations on the main quest, and that was supposed to be a main feature like for example the drones from watchdogs 2.

3.- the return of some of the many mini quests that got removed from the game with each update, there was a quest that involved a divination machine at pacifica and her quest got removed, again among other miniquests.

4.- and we never got a true reputation and faction system for dealing with the gangs/police.",2025-02-17T21:42:02Z,0

The recent addition for DLSS 4 is a massive upgrade over the old upscaling model.
With the recent addition of Mega Geometry in Allan Wake 2, which not only increases the quality of ray tracing, but also dramatically boosts ray tracing performance (even allowing the 2080 run their heaviest RT settings at 30 fps) it wouldn't surprise me if this tech eventually made its way to Cyberpunk, which would open up path tracing to a LOT of people who couldn't run it before.

So I bought it on Steam and that first week only had one odd problem that was fixed by restarting the game. Yes there were a few goofy glitches like floating trashbags but other than that it was fine. Never had a crash or game-breaking bug.

After a reload I became uninvincible and that mission meant I couldn't get the final reward for one of the fixers but realistically outside of that the game was in a playable state for everyone outside of consoles. The mistake was simultaneous release of console.

Witcher 1 was unplayable for a year at launch on AMD graphics cards. GTA6 wouldnt run smoothly on PC unless it was locked to 30 fps for almost 2 years and almost every single larger scope game had similar levels of issues for pc players. 

It was a great game and is even better now and has replaced skyrim as my full time installed game.

_dClJsNUbpY,@MrRiddleAW,"I normally play this mission depending on the lifepath I've chosen.

If I play as Nomad V - I make the deal but I get rid of the virus and tell them Militech is onto them. But I try not to get involved in the fighting even letting Royce and Dum Dum die, and freeing Brick from his cell. The idea is that my Nomad V is neutral so they are willing to play both sides and take advantage of the chaos. 

If I play as Street Kid V - I go to the meeting without making a deal with Meredith and take my chances with Royce. Depending on my mood I'll either blow his head off or I just make the deal with him. For me, my Streetkid V is anti corpo so he/she would not make a deal with Meredith or Militech, so going to the deal and doing it normally is more preferable.",2023-10-21T00:44:28Z,0

IMO V and Jonny are on the chip the chip is using Vs brain like an interface to make them ‚ÄúV‚Äù but it‚Äôs just a marionette. That‚Äôs why you can be switched in the end. It‚Äôs also the entire point of what is happening to you. You‚Äôre  test case for SaBuro taking over his son‚Äôs body. That test case is then weaponized using the psyche of Jonny Silverhand to attack Arasaka on behalf of the independent AI. That is why delamaine sais that your itinerary has been arranged in advance. It‚Äôs referring to the excelsior program but also to the e story in general. I would boil the whole narrative down as two opposing forces. The Blackwall AIs slowly taking psychological real-estate by backing the gangs and saburo arasaka trying to become an AI in order to stay the dominant force in the world to come.

If you're using an Nvidia GPU I recommend using Nvidia's own Shadowplay to record your screen - you can set the resolution and bitrate, and the quality seems to be higher and more consistent. Also if you're editing and rendering in Davinci Resolve, make sure to use a custom export setting and set the export quality to highest - it really makes a difference to the end product.",2025-02-16T11:26:09Z,2

One I‚Äôve been watching updated reviews and maybe I‚Äôm just not seeing the ones claiming it‚Äôs still unplayable but none that I have seen have claimed or showed anything to say that. 
I‚Äôm not saying cd projekt red is absolved for initially releasing this in the state they did. They were wrong in that 100% what I will say though is cd projekt red should get props in my opinion for continuing to work and fix it from that state ‚Äúdespite‚Äù all the backlash. I mean all I‚Äôm saying to those still hating on cyberpunk 2077 and cd projekt red is this. How many game dev companies take a game released in the state that cyberpunk was and turn it around putting more resources to constantly improve it? Most companies would just say ‚Äúscrew it‚Äù and let the game die. This doesn‚Äôt mean cd projekt red is off the hook in their fans eyes but it does earn back some faith from consumers. I look at it as their one strike so speak. Never release a game in the state they did this again. Whether it‚Äôs the sequel, Witcher 4, the Witcher 1 remake, idc. Chances are there will be some bugs in those releases even if released when ready. There‚Äôs too many variables in games like Witcher 3 and cyberpunk to not have a few but there‚Äôs a difference between Witcher 3 being released playable with some bugs here and there to patch compared to the initial release of cyberpunk 2077 4 yrs ago being essentially an early access game.

qLd2nw0mlpI,@inis99999,"Let's look at the double standards here... When EA or UBI releases a broken ass game then we would hear about it for a month and then the noise would have died down... off to the next game. CDPR releases a broken Cyberpunk and everyone is loosing their sh**! all CDPR did was what other big corpos do- overhype and undeliver BUT with a twist... they eventually patched the game!

Now bare in mind I only played Cyberpunk on PC and I realise that the game was unplayable on older consoles , but even with all the bugs I did manage to finish the game and I enjoyed it very much. Storyline was fantastic, driving was OK (then again we always compare these kinds of game to GTA and they had way more experience than CDPR) and last but not least... AUDIO! what a phenomenal sound track!

Meanwhile Stalker 2 comes out with barely any game mechanics full of bugs and it's being praised left right and centre- ""it's not bugs, it's anomalies!"", ""it wouldn't be a stalker game if it wasn't full of bugs!"" etc. I couldn't believe how basic and bare Stalker 2 feels. It's like playing an old school shooter with nice graphics. Dialouges are on par with Dying Light - mediocre. If I had paid a full price for that I would be a bit dissapointed to say the least. 

I'm glad that Cyberpunk came on top and managed to solve most of the issues in the game. However I think pulling it from Sony's online shop was a bit of overreach. To anyone who hasn't tried Cyberpunk, you deffinately should! I stopped playing stalker 2 and started my 2nd Cyberpunk run and oh boy was I in for a treat!",2024-12-19T13:16:18Z,0

SqUucWU_smQ,@thekaiser6842,"I‚Äôm incredibly grateful that CDPR decided to continue supporting the game despite previously saying otherwise. 2.2 was most certainly a welcome surprise. Not to sound greedy but CDPR should focus a some attention towards creating more content for this game. Now, I‚Äôm in no way saying it should be Phantom Liberty tier content, but it would be a very welcomed addition to us all if they dropped a smaller-scaled dlc (such as a casino heist story for instance) along with new gigs and ncpd scanners. Maybe even the addition of radiant quests. 

I‚Äôve been gaming since the 90‚Äôs and I can confidently say that Cyberpunk 2077 is my favorite game of all time and one of the best games ever developed. Despite the early hurdles; it overall proved to be a resounding success and I find it baffling that the team has decided to produce only one, single dlc and more or less shelve the game. A game this great deserves a at least one more addition. CDPR exhausted a commendable level of time, energy and finances improving and polishing this game that it stands today as very technically impressive alongside its overall dynamics that entrance the player in such a unique way that it stands leagues above most other titles within a similar genre. I really do think it would serve everyone‚Äôs interests in dedicating a small yet effective team of devs towards producing reasonably-sized dlc products for 2077 while the rest continue focusing on Project Orion.

And once you have a stable product you can get away with doing things like this to cut costs. Dev subcontractors are still subject to the release management processes of the primary company so quality assurance hopefully isn't skimped on.

First, has to be saved as a .png file. Which is easy. Just right click the picture, save it, and just put .png at the end of the file's name. That'll save it as a png.

The second condition is it needs to match one of a few aspects ratios, THIS is where most pictures will just not show up, or they'll be distorted. This is also easy to fix.

Right click the saved picture, edit with photos, and at the bottom of the window is a little frame icon. Click it, set the aspect ratio, and click save, and any picture you save will display properly.

You can Google a list of usable aspect ratios, but the easiest ones to remember are 16:9 and 9:16

This way you can display ANY pictures you desire.

2pUnUU27-mk,@DJchucklenuts,"Regarding Bawdy Dog, In Cyberpunk Red the TTRPG that is in the same universe as 2077 but set during The Time of the Red circa 2045 you are dealing with a post Johnny AHQ explosion and NC hasn't really recovered from that with much of the outer city being a combat zone (think Dogtown but much bigger and less organised). In the game you play as Edgerunners and one o the interesting mechanics of the game is the rent and lifestyle system that is basically what you pay at the start of each month to survive day to day with a roof and food.

The least expensive lifestyle is the ""kibble pack"" lifestyle where you eat ""kibble"", which is basically dogfood but with human flavourings like cheeseburger and similar. It's an extremely bad thing to have to eat and no one likes eating kibble but it will keep you alive which is all you can really ask. Food in NC tends to be expensive so I think Bawdy Dog saying ""your taste"" is in reference to this kibble being flavoured like human foods.

Since there is probably some kind of law saying it has to be marketed as pet food when it's really just for the exceptionally poor to survive another day, I think that's why they use animals despite them being so rare in NC.",2025-02-09T23:01:00Z,0

You can kill Joshua when he first gets out of the car, get paid, and never see anything else. You can take the bribe from the producer and never see Joshua again. Your conversation with him in the diner can lead to him not going through with it. If he ends up going through with the BD, you can leave without seeing it, you can stay and watch, or you can drive the nails into his hands yourself. There are a myriad of ways that things turn out, but there‚Äôs only one ‚Äútrue ending‚Äù, and your choices determine if you reach it.

As I've gotten older, I've found it more and more difficult to get into big games these days, especially these massive open world RPGs that throw a ton of complicated systems and mechanics and economies at you right from the start, but with Cyberpunk it sucked me in almost immediately and I've been hooked since! The way it tells stories, the way you interact with characters, how fun the combat is, the incredible look and feel of the city......it's hugely impressive! I'm absolutely obsessed with it!

I haven't even bought Phantom Liberty yet, I wanted to play through the base game first, but hearing how good it is and how it can even change the base games ending, I'm excited that I also have that to look forward to as well!",2025-01-02T17:27:44Z,0

QNKS3vkGAag,@OddysseyTalks,"Something else that the base game always got right was the presentation of the character interactions. It might just seem like fluff AAA graphics that don't ultimately matter but it's so much more than that. When you talk to NPCs in the Major quests & side quests in the game, hell even some of the smaller side quests, if feels like you're immersed into a 1st person scene with proper staging, character body language, a sense of rhythm and flow like in a television show, and stage props that you and the characters interact with, rather than just taking part in an npc dialogue tree. And a lot of these scenes you might move to different locations during them and talk while you walk with them. Maybe y'all talk while driving in real time to the next location, or while you're looking for the switch to turn the lights on. It makes all these interactions feel so much more real and slice of life. There are conversations with high tension that happen during big action/set piece sequences, but a lot of It feels like ur really just spending some time with these characters like a slice of life story in this city. There's no party system for the characters to constantly follow you around whatever you go when they have no reason to. They always have their own motives, and they have lives, friends, and places they live outside of you, even if you can become a closer part of that as you develop your relationship to them. It's really remarkable and helps to elevate the story.

QNKS3vkGAag,@StimmyTurner,"I actually think this game has better rpg mechanics than most people give it credit for. It's not a bathesda RPG, you can't be whoever you want, but the build crafting and dialogue options give you plenty of opportunities to make YOUR V. A net runner plays completely differently than a melee focused strength build, and you can combine your cyberwear and skill trees in so many different ways to create a character that feels truly unique to you. The lifepaths aren't transformative in how they change the game, but they absolutely work as a light rpg element to flesh out your character's backstory and motivations. Personally, with how ambitious this game is in its dialogue scenes and character animations, I see why these light RPG elements were a better fit.",2024-06-01T13:39:45Z,3

QNKS3vkGAag,@AndragonLea,"I didn't buy it at release. The limited play area for the reviews and lack of review copies kind of spooked me. Felt really vindicated as well as disappointed when the game turned out to have so many problems.
Bought the game a few months ago and I gotta say it's one of the best experiences I've had playing open world RPGs on the PC.
The graphics are amazing, the voice actors, sound design and soundtrack nailed it, the story drew me in, I have fun shotgunning gonks while double-jumping over obstacles and slowing time to Sandevastate them and I'm actively hunting down cyber psychos just to see what that questline will end up doing.
I feel for the people that trusted the devs on day one and got burnt, but at some point you have to give credit for a redemption story or otherwise studios won't bother trying for one.
If we never gave games or studios a second chance, they'd just leave you hanging with the turd they already sold you and move on to another project instead. That they worked so hard to get the game into the state it is in now should get them at least some forgiveness.

I never lost investment and care within who they were because they were just that interesting. Sometimes the best characters don‚Äôt require that emotional connection because if you make me feel trapped with these people and then have me make a choice then there is something more thought provoking and tension fueled then anything else",2024-05-15T18:21:39Z,0

QNKS3vkGAag,@nicodetonado,"Skill Up managed to be even more delusional about this game than he is about destiny. Night City was and still is great and filled with potential, but the ""imersion"" aspect of it... man, that argument was weak AF. All your examples show how CP2077 didn't do what all of them did. You have tons of quests in there, sure, but none of them fill like they are NightCity quests. They feel like any RPG sort of quest. You don't interact with NC... it's just a setpiece. That's why NC fails at being immersive and memorable, and Spider-Mans NY, even very slitghlty, manages to shine brighter, at least there everything you do feels like Spider-Mans New York. Is it memorable? I don't think so, they could change the entire city and no one would care, thus why it's the worst of your examples, but the fact that the city allows you to immersion youserlf as Spider-Man makes the game immersive. NC doesn't do that. In a Cyberpunk RPG, they managed to make you feel limited and NC feels like a pretty sandbox as much as any Assassin's Creed game did with theirs cities.",2024-05-10T01:23:38Z,0

Game is stunning and I rarely fast travel just so I can watch the city out the window .. however I  really wish they would enable third person mode when out of vehicles  .. i really enjoy seeing my character IN the world rather than first person all the time .. at least the driving breaks up the monotony of first person view. highly recommend for anyone who has not played this or played it when it was broken - it's really awesome.,2024-04-20T17:18:48Z,0
QNKS3vkGAag,@ReprobateMind,"I just dont exactly get the hype for the game. I just a 4080super and G8 Odyssey. This is one of the most beautiful games of all time. Only beaten by Alan Wake 2 in visuals. However the game is just bad. Driving feels amazing, vehicles look amazing. The characters are cool but the underlying game is just dogshit. Drive here through this big, beautiful lifeless city. Try to sneak somewhere. Instantly fail cause you're not told to sneak or the level is laid out so badly you're instantly caught. Now you're in a firefight bullet spongey AI that just shoot and rush other options shoot 20 guys. steal car or random piece of Tech, Drive back through lifeless city and call it a day.

QNKS3vkGAag,@DanFrederiksen,"Very good taste of the game and showed that the graphics can be better than the flat cartoonish if you have GPU power. I get what you are saying and nvidia's demo of genuine AI conversation seems quite well suited for this game, both in characters and storyline branching. Done well enough you could imagine an organic society where the events are entirely unexpected even by developers because it's not scripted but organic. The mindless shooter is a tired genre for many, it would be quite interesting to see a game do very believable AI aided immersion into a cinematic world, maybe even richer than most movies. And could even run on local hardware because an AI doesn't need the extreme trivia knowledge that chatGPT has, just every day intelligence and knowledge.
And with AI it's entirely possible that the entire game is generated by AI so devs don't have to spend years building all the details. All studios should be laser focused on what AI can do and it should see some quite dramatic revolutions in gaming.",2024-03-24T00:29:25Z,0

Instead, we need a world that is actually alive.  That when players go in, their experience in the world can be different everytime.  The game doesn't have to be multiplayer, but the npcs need to do more than just being randomly generated, which is the most that games can do at the moment.

It made the whole mission of rescuing her a chore that she was insufficiently grateful for.
EDIT: I think it's interesting that you bash the driving controls when you're playing on a console that has to be played with a controller that has analog steering. I expect that digital steering will always be terrible, and I bought a controller just to improve the driving experience.

For example Her Majesty is so much better for stealth than river's pistol it's not even close you can stack the best sandy, optic camo, the militech firmware upgrade for optic camo and full build pistol and that's probably the best stealth build in the entire game, every shot crits and it does crazy damage you can literally clear an entire gig with one charge of optic camo without getting detected if you're fast enough I've done it before.",2025-01-18T19:26:20Z,0

did i miss something? might have but u get my point. not much but its something. didnt play it before the change so im not sure but i think thats almost nothing compared to what it was before? think all jackets and thick pants should have that kind of low armor instead of just some jackets but doesnt rly matter that much.

honestly not sure why they would change it to that but for me thats just extra armor and you can change how you look anyways so it works fine.",2024-12-21T00:54:08Z,0

7FA6nSb1DJQ,@JacquesVideos7,"Il go so far to say‚Ä¶. Cyberpunk compared to gta and saints row

Its basically first person saintsrow without overly leaning on goofy humor‚Ä¶ 

Every mission and dialogue option feels like it matters. Even if you fail a mission its still how u went thru that mission and story progresses

Mission to mission in gta can feel exhausting because of varying difficulty and repetitive mission types
Where as in cyberpunk you never really know what to expect. Mission could simply be talking to a npc or getting seduced or being the seducer u just never know

All the characters in cyberpunk are interesting not just story characters u feel a almost real bond with some like goro judy or panam

The romance options are almost dragonage levels if your into that type of thing

This game is basically saintsrow meets masseffect in  first person 

Such a really really really good game 
Yes alot of flaws but i feel the launch really damaged the potential of what could have been one of the greatest ever

Will i have to download it separately or purchase it again on top of PS4 disc( upgradeable to PS5).

I haven't touched Cyberpunk 2077 since the first or second week after launch. Thankfully, I got to play Cyberpunk 2077 on our launch Series X, so the experience was damn near flawless, enabling me to be one of the few who saw it all the way through the end. I think I had 2 or 3 minor glitches or bugs that were more funny than bad. Now, we (fiancee and I) also purchased Cyberpunk 2077 for our launch PS5 the same day as our Series X because sharing sucks. Her experience was very different as her game crashed so much it was unplayable, and the bugs were absolutely atrocious. She's going to watch me play for a bit, and if she likes the DLC, we will get it for our PS5 as well. 

So here's my question....will my experience be vastly different? Should I do a full restart of the game or fix my character and jump into the expansion pack?",2024-06-16T20:40:14Z,0

7FA6nSb1DJQ,@xtangero,"Unless you're early into a 1.63 save, you basically need to restart to get 2.0 to play its best. I started fresh when I first got PL and have been having a decent time with it, but I tried booting up my old point of no return character and, besides it lobotimizing my old monowire build, you are hamstrung by not having 80 hours' worth of armor and cyberware boosters, and the new economy changes will probably screw you over too.

After playing to max level on 2.0, I recognize I'm probably an outlier but I've just not had as good of a time as I did in 1.63. The perk tree is stifling, vehicle combat still feels like an afterthought and is crowbarred into random places, and I have had signficantly more performance issues compared to 1.3 and 1.6. There are still good changes, I especially liked the change away from the crafting economy, but that positive and the other fixes don't outweigh the vibe I feel is missing. I'll finish out PL in my dedicated 2.0 save, but for my next run I'll probably revert the game",2024-06-06T06:01:12Z,0

7FA6nSb1DJQ,@Peaches-i2i,"Cyberpunk is just FO4 and GTA5, a game for the masses. It will never go down as a well crafted narrative because it's too poorly paced and they never fixed the UI. It's too much piled onto the plate to appeal to every demographic and it is not coherent at all. Every two seconds characters start talking over each other, interrupting you with a new side mission. Sad, because the core narrative is amazing. If it was done more like Deus Ex, a linear, well paced and balanced experience with side quests that reconnect into the main story then it would be more memorable. It doesn't even make sense to have so much content because if you build a game around choices and different playstyles then you're going to get plenty of play time out of each run.

There's a mod that addsMjolnir to the game, additional cyberware so you have even more choices eg. speed legs and jumping legs, performance upgrades to vehicles, texture overhauls, lighting overhauls, there's so many mods and this game has come a long away in that regard since 2.0 it'd be col to see a video on it",2024-05-14T01:34:58Z,1

xX7tvQg2Ql0,@DerOrso,"You need Item Components to upgrade your Cyberware. You need Eddies to buy Cyberware and things from merchants.
Typical below Tier 2 arms you 'find' sell for about 600 - 800 Eddies and break down to 5 Tier 1 Item Component, but if you need ICs, no amount of money allows you to purchase them... directly. But....

If you want to play absolutely vanilla, you do this. Buy Slaught-O-Matic guns from vending machines. There are 3 next to each other right in front of the Ripperdoc's office near the Goldsmith Street fast travel box. There are two in the Atrium level of Megabuilding 10. Leaving MB10 turn left and walk to the parking garage, turn right, walk up the street, crossing the first street coming from the left, then turn left on the side walk and find two more vending machines. In Kabuki in the market circle where the gun and the netrunner dealers are, on the lower level, where the gun dealer is, if you walk around the entire circle, there are 4 or 5 vending machines. Those are the ones I know by heart. There are many more.

As I stated before, arms you 'find' break down to 5* Tier 1 IC, but sell for 600 - 800 Eddies. Buying Slaught-O-Matic guns cost 100 Eddie each and breaks down to 5* Tier 1 IC. That means, the pistol you can break down to 5* Tier 1 IC, if you sell it--anywhere you sell gives you the exact same price, even Drop Points--you get let's say 650 Eddies, which you can use to buy 6 1/2* Slaught-O-Matic guns, which you can break down to 6 1/2* Tier 1 ICs, which is 1 1/2 more than if you break them down directly, but you have to work for it.

Or you can do it the easy way, but people are going to start screaming and pulling their hair out, and crying that it is cheating... use console commands to trade your Eddies and ICs without going through the rigmarole. Sell all the stuff you don't want wherever you want. For every 100 Eddies you can buy 1* Tier 1 IC. For 5* Tier 1 ICs you can craft 1* Tier 2 IC. For 5* Tier 2 ICs you can craft 1* Tier 3 IC. And so on. Just do the math.

Use console commands to remove the money you 'spend' for ICs and give yourself the equivalent in ICs. The vending machines will sell about 25 guns if they haven't been used in a long time, but far fewer if they have been used within at least the last 24 hours (game time).The only difference is in not running to every Slaught-O-Matic vending machine all over the map, standing there and buying gun after gun, until the vending machine runs out, to buy the guns for breaking down. 

So you can do a lot of running around to get guns to break down to get the ICs you need, all completely fair and within what the game allows, or you can simulate doing the grinding by using console commands. If you think you should have to sit there and click, and wait....... click, and wait....... click, and wait....... to buy guns you then just break down, you are a sick puppy - go find a doctor. That's not the kind of game I want to play. You do you, but leave me out of it.

Starting with Tier 2 weapons, the ICs you get greatly exceed the Eddies you get for selling them. For example 1* Tier 2 gun breaks down to 5* Tier 2 IC = 25* Tier 1 IC = 2500 Eddies, but sells for only about 1100 - 1200 Eddies. So above Tier 2 weapons, it is better to break them down for ICs. Always check and do the math.",2025-02-13T07:08:35Z,1

mqEh5JsGhSk,@yourfriendlyneighborhoodtr2331,"I played the older version of cyberpunk when it first came out, and back then, iconic weapons had serious damage potential. Unlike now, you had to raise your tech skill in order to craft high quality items (a feature I kinda wish they brought back) and as a result crafted epic and legendary weapons did some serious damage to cover the opportunity cost. Iconic weapons in particular, however, had some absolutely wild power-scaling back then, and in most cases getting any given iconic weapon from common to legendary quality would often give it a DPS of well over a thousand. I started replaying the game recently and now I feel like I rarely touch the iconic weapons, which makes me feel bad because they often have some pretty interesting gimmicks behind them (Fenrir is OP lmao).",2025-01-07T04:36:03Z,0
