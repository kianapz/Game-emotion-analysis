@Hypernova6642,"Probably the most unsatisfying ending to a CoD campaign ever. I was hoping that they‚Äôd do something right and have Price kill Makarov or something like that, but once again the developers gave us a big ol‚Äô fuck you. I don‚Äôt know if they are trying to set up a modern warfare 4, which god I hope they don‚Äôt do seeing the shit-show this game was. Just like Activision to give you an unsatisfying ending to an already awful campaign. Fuck you too Activison, fuck you",0

@jerryconner7482,"Johnny a living legend Rest easy brother. Watching the games really is real life how they fight and lose each other somehow the bad guy aways win. I hate that they didn't kill him when they had the chance but the ending was an epic one. I already knew somebody was going to die, it always happens to the best of us. Thanks for the game walk through very interesting.",0

@Ogreatgames_dot_com,"the gameplay mechanics seem so smooth and intuitive. I‚Äôm glad developers are focusing on making such polished experiences. It‚Äôs what keeps us players coming back for more.
