"Game is good and feels like every other Total War. This review isn't negative because the game itself, its a fun game but Creative Assembly is nothing but a bunch of crooks at this point. Locking units from a base game faction behind a paywall is ridiculous.

DLC's are meant to be addons for flavor and revitalize playthroughs. CA continues to use them as a way to hold the base game hostage and force its players to spend mass amounts of money just to get the bare minimum.   Honestly fuck CA at this point.",False,120,4
"Total War: Warhammer has been a long running series that has seen nothing but growth over it's many years in the gaming scene. This installment has definitely provided great content, with all the factions of the previous 2 games as well as new ones I am excited to see it develop even more in the future. Gameplay is obviously similar to the last game but with a few new mechanics. Overall a great addition to the lineup and I can't wait to see what they come up with for new content with such a vast amount of source material that Games Workshop has available to use",True,4,0
"I used to really like this game, but lately the Chaos armies are just so ridiculously overpowered is just not fun anymore. (This is especially true of Khorne factions, but even Nurgle armies are stupidly strong.) Playing one of the ""good guys"" inevitably means that all your allies and potential allies get overrun by chaos, and then you're next. Playing chaos isn't any fun because it's just not a challenge. In my most recent game playing Cathay, my force of 3 armies (2 mid-tier forces and one elite force), plus a level 4 city garrison were wiped out by a SINGLE Nurgle army, while he lost NO troops. Seriously? This is supposed to be fun?
I've played this game a LOT, but it looks like I'll have to find another strategy game to keep me entertained. This one is no longer playable.",False,4,0

"Just like any other total war game. But I completely hate the pricing structure. The base games aren't enough. You are missing units, while most campaigns are tuned to be played with the dlc. So you will struggle if you don't have the ""missing units.
It's just complete bs you have to pay so much for a pc game and all of its older content. Way out of touch. I hate these pricing structures. Reminds of Destiny.

"This is my Total war: medieval 3
I never really felt any of the other total war games matched up to medieval total war 2, but after 3 years, a couple of player riots, and 3 game iterations, this is finally it. The devs have started to listen. They finally make good changes. (If it changes ill change the review to negative)
The game has an insane amount of replayability, unit variation that is unmatched, and lots of fun mechanics. 
For the total price to experience this id say it better deliver. And now it does. However, due to how they locked factions in this game; i will never buy another game from em again. But this is my ultimate 4x game.
Price wise id say only get it and the other 2 games on sale. Cause factions are locked behind the 2 older games, and their DLCs(absolutely insane)

Theyll never make another game as good as this, i know theyll make medieval total war 3. But theres no way theyll get even close to this",True,0,0
"Excellent game!  As a fan of  the series, this is by far the best in the Warhammer trilogy.  The tactical and strategical combat is unique and rewarding.  Though, there are some areas that have been left in a shallower depth (diplomacy and some economic elements), few games provide the breadth of different faction mechanics and tactical play.  For new players, the learning curve can be quite steep, but it is incredibly fun exhilarating once the basics are learned.  Fans of the genre should not exclude this gem from their library.",True,0,0

"I have sunk thousands of hours into Total War games over the last 20ish years, but this one has been my favorite by far. The range and diversity of factions and play styles is great. The fact that you can use the DLC factions and leaders from the previous 2 games is amazing! Especially since you can often get them on discount if you don't already have them. I don't often comment but I feel I need to because this great game/studio is getting a bad rap because of people with unrealistic expectations.

Ignore all those on here that are complaining about DLC pricing. they are upset because 8 years ago you could get a DLC with 3 legendary lords for $15 and now its $20-$30. News flash! Prices have gone up on EVERYTHING! The price of a 12pac of Mountain Dew has nearly tripled but your games and DLC should still cost the same???

"Let's start with the positives. I personally quite enjoy the real time strategy combat between armies and the sandbox campaign. Most campaigns feel quite different from each other as most factions bring something unique to the battle field. There is also a unique strategic and tactical depth to the game that I'd find other games hard pressed to replicate as well as good level of challenge.

On the negative, it feels like the game suffers from repetitiveness in the later stages of any campaign. I am also not a fan of the Warhammer Fantasy Lore. Furthermore Creative Assemblies monetisation model is not kind to the casual player, requiring you to invest a serious amount of money to get the full use out of each race. 

As such for those looking to buy the game, I can certainly see a world in which it's worth your money but please do regard a buying decision with caution as to enjoy the full experience requires a lot of DLCs and the previous game titles. Sales are your friend in this case. To get a feeling for what the game has to offer I would recommend watching Zerkovich, Legend of Total War and/or Turin.

"Coming from nearly 40 years of gaming, the scope and depth of this game is incredible.

Lords (Generals) with a simple but often satisfying skill point based progression system.

Cant get enough of this. Every time is new there's no same play through. makes you want to start over and over and over just to see what will go right or go wrong this time. combat is tense and adrenaline charged a second too late and you risk a break in your line every start of battle must be perfect and scratches that OCD-perfectionist itch when things go right. You can also play it in a relatively chill manner by turning it into an auto resolve numbers game. Really the variation of scenarios and strategy is infinite. Well done.,True,0,0

"This game, and the total war series, have an unbelievable amount of discussion on the internet. Trying to get into all the different topics would be like trying to drink the ocean so I am going to keep this simple by focusing on game content and dividing my review into two parts; Warhammer & Total War. 

Warhammer- 10/10 If you are interested in this version of the Warhammer IP, whether you're familiar with the setting or not, this is probably the best video game to represent it in a sandbox form where you can play around and do what you want. Want to be a skaven rat man and pew pew the enemy with lasers? Be the emperor of man? be the high elves riding dragons? Be the dark elves with a vast slave economy? etc its all possible, and I think its unlikely another video game will ever give you such diverse opportunities on such a large scale. 

Total War- 7/10 It can be a fun game, cool graphics and some cool moments but you're probably going to play around 100 turns per campaign and its mostly going to be auto resolve. I've played the total war series since I was a little kid and somehow stumbled on the first medieval total war. From my point of view the series has been in crisis since Rome II and many of the games that have followed since then have struck out in different directions trying new things to define the identity of the series moving forward. This game suffers from that crisis. Much of what gave the older total wars replay-ability and character, such as sandbox roleplay elements, have been stripped away. This has been the case with games in this series for over a decade however, and so has come to be expected. Yet since this is a review I think its worth mentioning that this is in now way a return to form for the series despite the obvious financial success. I think when you look at a game like medieval 2 total war for comparison its pretty sad to see where the series ultimately has ended up. This picture gets even darker if you compare the modding scene between the two, what was allowed on medieval 2 keeps the game relevant even today with an endless world of possibilities like Lord of the Rings, Warhammer, Elder Scrolls, Warcraft, etc all being worlds you can go play in the game. People might say you cant do that in warhammer III total war for technology reasons or copy right, but I'd encourage you to go play Crusader Kings 3 which is a newer game by a large company which allows all of those modding capabilities which tells me the reason we dont have it in this game is either Creative Assembly's incompetence or greed, which sadly is evidence this is now a failed series with mostly cash grabs pretending to be new games moving forward.",True,0,0

"Warhammer III has had quite a rollercoaster since it's launch almost 3 years ago. I'm happy to say though that I recommend this product to people interested in a fantasy style Total War installment. The only problem I have with the game, is the buy in. Buying all of the characters across 3 games is nuts, you're looking at paying about 300 dollars if you want to fully experience the game in it's entirety. Not only that, but my friends and I were playing a multiplayer campaign and realized something, not sure if it happens to everyone else. If you don't own certain characters within a roster of a faction, you also don't have access to the Regiments of Renown and other cool unit cards that come in that faction too. Overall such a fun game, but the price is heavy. I'd definitely wait until there is a good sale to buy everything at once.",True,0,0

I have a lot of love for this game, and most of the TW games in general. If you're unfamiliar with the Total War games, or don't know how the community is.. I will say this: This is one of those franchises that has a cult fanbase. The people that like these games care a lot about them. For that reason, reviews and opinions about this game, and others in the franchise are very exaggerated. Criticism for TW games seems endless. There's always a problem, there's always a design choice people are unhappy about, there's always hate for the devs. But many of those criticisms come from people that try to find problems and complain about them. If it wasn't ___. It would just be another thing, they will never be happy with it. 

The game is good. Awesome strategy game, and the Warhammer universe is a great setting for a TW game. Mods help to keep it fresh, and generally the updates and DLC have been decent.

Again, the content model for this game is sort of a barrier. You must buy content for the old games to have access to it in these games. And to own DLC for TWW 1 and 2. You must own those games to begin with. 
That can be a big investment if you want the content but you're starting fresh. However if you've BEEN playing the games and purchasing content, it's actually a nice system.

I'd keep an eye on large sales when considering buying the game/games and the DLC. Or purchase third party keys at a discounted price.

"Two major things: one, three hundred+ dollars for the 'real experience' of a game is madness. The DLC practices take nothing of people's budgets into account. You're looking at months if not years before anyone struggling month to month can play the game as it's meant to be.

Two: Every time there's an update, it says ""unsupported file system"" and forces me to reinstall everything from scratch even though it works perfectly until there's an update. Either stop messing with your game or fix the glitch.

On an other note, some factions have no love while others are constantly in great overall standing.
If you're going to limit the one mechanic that you didn't strip out and instead added to the game, magic, then at least set the upper limit to a point where you can cast more than four overcasted spells a battle.
The Tombkings are in such a terrible place, and according to the lore their one advantage should be that they can raise their forces back to strength infinitely over time, to the point where when Neferata and her sister were fighting, Neferata was losing because her vampires were starting to crumble out while the tomb kings were still coming back from the dead constantly. Increase the healing cap for tombkings, the unit cap for tomb kings and give them ways to heal that's on a timer like Dwarf's runemagic or the empire's battleprayers. Letting Necrotects heal constructs and priests heal undead, either like a corpsecart/necromancer or using timed abilities as mentioned above, will see the tombkings rise in popularity and those units see more play in general.

Overall, this is Warhammer. If you're nerfing something, you're missing the point.
Bring everything up to the same level, not down into the mud. I realize Dragon Ball Z powercreep is a phobia for a lot of people, but Warhammer is meant to be over the top, insane and therefore fun. Why do you think people love skaven so much? Give the other factions the same treatment. Let them all shine in their own ways and niches. You'll have a better, healthier game for it and the community will love you all the more.",False,2,0
"So I own about half of the total wars and have hundreds of hours in them all. Buying this game is akin to getting into an abusive relationship for fun.

I am new to this franchise, i have not bought the first or second Total War Warhammer game and i have also not bought any DLC and i can really feel it.

The amount of options that are locked behind paying extra is unbeliveable, it borders on obscenity. The base game that you pay full price for will unlock 7 factions with most giving access to 1 legendary lord (which basically means picking your leader, each with different affects on how the faction overall plays) and basically nothing else.
Some of these factions have 7 legendary lords and they must be bought over a variety of dlc's, alot of the factions that are available from the base game, has a bunch of units/lords/heroes locked behind buying other dlc as well.

And the dlc is not cheap, like 15-30 euro each. There are 24 factions and 96 legendary lords in the game, and you have access to 16 legendary lords over 7 factions from the base game.

Apart from the monetization, its generally a good game with most of the things you want and expect from a 4X with heavy focus on unit control in actual real-time battles.",False,3,0

That is this game, it always seems like the fun is just around the corner, but it never gets there. It is not fun, not even a little.

"I have about 3000 hours into Warhammer 2 total war and have a fraction of that into this game, and that is for good reason. I thoroughly enjoyed WH2TW to its absolute fullest extent - completing campaigns in almost all of the base legendary lords and most of the DLC lords as well. 

This game does not give me the same sensation at all, it is however a solid game that is decently fun - but not ""lose contact with your friends and family"" kind of fun. I think it misses it's mark on what made the second game great, and made some LL/Races that are plain not fun to play the main attraction - which IMO isolates the kind of people that really enjoy this game for the less diehards. The problem with people not being diehard on this game is that they are most likely not going to purchase WH1 and WH2, because they insist on them still being full price most of the time. Asking someone new to the franchise to purchase $180 of games just to actually enjoy the games is pretty insane, but most of us did do that and I think they let us down in a weird way. Hoping we can limp our way out of the super expensive DLC hole and hopefully the dev's realize most of us have already bought 3 games just to play this one game properly.

"This game is a mess. 

The UI is overly busy with unnecessary details and animations. The information that matters is hidden away frustratingly into menus that care more about being flashy depictions of random  conceptual detritus.

Parsing information from the map is worse. It's neigh impossible to know what's going on because of how much art pollution is going on. Every thing is moving, every turn. Dozens of factions all moving about haphazardly to conquer one another. It's difficult to even figure out where objectives are or how best to get there. 

Enemy combat AI is passable. Even decent, but the campaign so clearly cheats. Enemy factions will go from a crushing defeat, to full strength in a couple turns. Diplomacy is irrelevant when there's so many factions all trying to kill you . No matter how well you play, the battle of attrition is theirs to win. 

There are some good ideas. Many unique features, like stealth , development and a living world are present , but they are all so haphazardly implemented that none of them make sense when taken together. The seams between the features are always present and working against you.

CA should have taken the millions of $ they spent on UI design and art and used it to hire game designers and coders instead. 

The developers bit off more than they can chew. The scope and scale of the game exceeded their abilities and budget to pull off. TW:Warhammer 3 is a bloated, shallow, and ultimately disappointing Total War games. It lacks both polish and functionality. 

If you want Total War, play their older games before corporate cancer (DEI) ruined AAA games. 

If you want the itch of large scale fantasy wargaming scratched, get Dominions 6. It's everything Total War wishes it could be, albeit with simpler graphics, but a far more usable UI.

"Total War: Warhammer 3 – The Ultimate Fantasy Strategy Playground


I’ve played a lot of Total War games, but Warhammer 3 feels like the craziest, most epic one yet. Huge battles, insane factions, and a ridiculous amount of strategy make it one of the most addictive games I’ve ever played. Whether I’m leading a disciplined Cathayan army or going full destruction mode with Khorne, every campaign feels unique and fun.

What Makes It Awesome
✅ Factions Feel Completely Different – Seriously, playing as Khorne and then switching to Tzeentch feels like two different games.
✅ Immortal Empires is Insane – Once you unlock it, you’re basically playing the biggest Total War game ever made.
✅ The Battles Are Just Fun – Giant monsters, magic, and total chaos. Watching a Hell Pit Abomination wreck enemy lines never gets old.
✅ So Many Strategic Options – Diplomacy, ambushes, economy—there’s always something to manage.
✅ The Warhammer World Feels Alive – The art, music, and voice acting bring everything together so well.

A Few Things That Annoy Me
❌ Late Game Can Get Slow – Turns start taking longer, and some battles feel repetitive.
❌ Too Many DLCs (But I Still Buy Them...) – Warhammer and Total War fans know the deal. The game is amazing, but expect to spend more money on extra content.

Final Thoughts

All the races are interesting and have a fantasy worth diving into if you give them a chance, some more than others.
