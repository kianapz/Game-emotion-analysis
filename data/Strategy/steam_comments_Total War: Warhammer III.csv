"Game is good and feels like every other Total War. This review isn't negative because the game itself, its a fun game but Creative Assembly is nothing but a bunch of crooks at this point. Locking units from a base game faction behind a paywall is ridiculous.

DLC's are meant to be addons for flavor and revitalize playthroughs. CA continues to use them as a way to hold the base game hostage and force its players to spend mass amounts of money just to get the bare minimum.   Honestly fuck CA at this point.",False,372,9,2025-01-31 20:42:19
"Total War: Warhammer has been a long running series that has seen nothing but growth over it's many years in the gaming scene. This installment has definitely provided great content, with all the factions of the previous 2 games as well as new ones I am excited to see it develop even more in the future. Gameplay is obviously similar to the last game but with a few new mechanics. Overall a great addition to the lineup and I can't wait to see what they come up with for new content with such a vast amount of source material that Games Workshop has available to use",True,10,0,2025-02-14 17:07:21

"I used to really like this game, but lately the Chaos armies are just so ridiculously overpowered is just not fun anymore. (This is especially true of Khorne factions, but even Nurgle armies are stupidly strong.) Playing one of the ""good guys"" inevitably means that all your allies and potential allies get overrun by chaos, and then you're next. Playing chaos isn't any fun because it's just not a challenge. In my most recent game playing Cathay, my force of 3 armies (2 mid-tier forces and one elite force), plus a level 4 city garrison were wiped out by a SINGLE Nurgle army, while he lost NO troops.

"Do I like the game? 

Once I've spent ~30 hours modding it, absolutely.

Which is why I can't recommend it. Power creep and capitalism make it very difficult to recommend. The AI out of the box is... Annoying. The AI is not designed to beat you, but to be obstacles for you to overcome. They will all gang up on the player to the point where you're getting attacked from several different angles while ignoring their weaker neghibors. In this way they fail to expand and grow to be a larger threat. As such they never put themselves in a position for victory. The exception of this is those hostiles which are in the FOW. There are other things which appear to be blatant cheating which I only have observation of but not direct proof. Armies spawning where they shouldn't be able to afford anything. AI not managing it's territories/economy. The big thing is the anti player bias and the lack of leathality behind the base AI. 


That being said I have over 600 hours in the game. It's worth the money based on that. However the company which produces it makes you feel like a cow they are milking for currency without a care as to the quality of what they dish out. This is a major problem with the industry as a whole. 

Subsiquent TW games have been horrible cash grabs. This is their current flagship, their last bastion of steady income. It's only a matter of time before it's ruined like HOI4 or Stellaris.

All that said, if you like me, are willing to go through the xml files and completely reballance the game, download thirty or so mods and tinker for as many hours as you play. You may find considerable enjoyment here.

"Total War: WARHAMMER III delivers an outstanding finale to the series, blending deep strategy, breathtaking battles, and rich lore from the Warhammer universe. As a fan of both Total War and Warhammer, this game feels like the ultimate culmination of everything great about the franchise.

Pros:
✅ Immortal Empires Campaign: An enormous sandbox campaign that combines all three games into one colossal map. It’s the ultimate Warhammer experience!
✅ Diverse Factions: From the chaos-worshipping Daemons to the disciplined legions of Cathay and Kislev, the factions are incredibly varied, each offering unique playstyles and deep lore.
✅ Cinematic Battles: Epic, large-scale battles with jaw-dropping visuals and animations that capture the brutality and magic of the Warhammer world.
✅ Soundtrack and Voice Acting: Top-notch audio design that immerses you into the chaos and grandeur of battle.
✅ Constant Updates and DLCs: The developers are dedicated to expanding the game with new content, factions, and improvements.

Cons:
❌ Performance Issues: The game is demanding on hardware, and optimization could be better, especially during massive battles.
❌ Learning Curve: As with all Total War games, the complexity can be overwhelming for newcomers.
❌ Some AI Quirks: While improved, the AI occasionally makes odd strategic decisions.

Overall Verdict:
Total War: WARHAMMER III is a masterpiece for strategy and Warhammer fans alike. The Immortal Empires campaign alone makes it worth the purchase, offering endless replayability. If you’re a fan of grand strategy, epic battles, and rich fantasy lore, this game is a must-have.

"Another good Total Warhammer.  

The initial release was quite bad.  The official campaign for this iteration of the game was horrifically bad -  one of the worst designed I've ever seen in a strategy game.  

After many months of waiting, they finally added the Immortal Empires map, including all of the races and settings from the previous 2 games, which brought the game back to where it should be.  This is now the essential Total Warhammer experience, and I've had a blast playing it. 

Creative Assembly has really mucked around with their DLC, however, with it being underwhelming and grossly overpriced in general.  Of their last 3 major DLC releases, one basically had fans boycotting them and led to the studio issuing public apologies, the next was pretty good, and then the one after that went back to a pretty half-assed cash grab.

Ignore all those on here that are complaining about DLC pricing. they are upset because 8 years ago you could get a DLC with 3 legendary lords for $15 and now its $20-$30. News flash!

"Let's start with the positives. I personally quite enjoy the real time strategy combat between armies and the sandbox campaign. Most campaigns feel quite different from each other as most factions bring something unique to the battle field. There is also a unique strategic and tactical depth to the game that I'd find other games hard pressed to replicate as well as good level of challenge.

On the negative, it feels like the game suffers from repetitiveness in the later stages of any campaign. I am also not a fan of the Warhammer Fantasy Lore. Furthermore Creative Assemblies monetisation model is not kind to the casual player, requiring you to invest a serious amount of money to get the full use out of each race. 

As such for those looking to buy the game, I can certainly see a world in which it's worth your money but please do regard a buying decision with caution as to enjoy the full experience requires a lot of DLCs and the previous game titles. Sales are your friend in this case. To get a feeling for what the game has to offer I would recommend watching Zerkovich, Legend of Total War and/or Turin.

"Two major things: one, three hundred+ dollars for the 'real experience' of a game is madness. The DLC practices take nothing of people's budgets into account. You're looking at months if not years before anyone struggling month to month can play the game as it's meant to be.

Two: Every time there's an update, it says ""unsupported file system"" and forces me to reinstall everything from scratch even though it works perfectly until there's an update. Either stop messing with your game or fix the glitch.

On an other note, some factions have no love while others are constantly in great overall standing.
If you're going to limit the one mechanic that you didn't strip out and instead added to the game, magic, then at least set the upper limit to a point where you can cast more than four overcasted spells a battle.
The Tombkings are in such a terrible place, and according to the lore their one advantage should be that they can raise their forces back to strength infinitely over time, to the point where when Neferata and her sister were fighting, Neferata was losing because her vampires were starting to crumble out while the tomb kings were still coming back from the dead constantly. Increase the healing cap for tombkings, the unit cap for tomb kings and give them ways to heal that's on a timer like Dwarf's runemagic or the empire's battleprayers. Letting Necrotects heal constructs and priests heal undead, either like a corpsecart/necromancer or using timed abilities as mentioned above, will see the tombkings rise in popularity and those units see more play in general.

Overall, this is Warhammer. If you're nerfing something, you're missing the point.
Bring everything up to the same level, not down into the mud. I realize Dragon Ball Z powercreep is a phobia for a lot of people, but Warhammer is meant to be over the top, insane and therefore fun.

This game does not give me the same sensation at all, it is however a solid game that is decently fun - but not ""lose contact with your friends and family"" kind of fun. I think it misses it's mark on what made the second game great, and made some LL/Races that are plain not fun to play the main attraction - which IMO isolates the kind of people that really enjoy this game for the less diehards. The problem with people not being diehard on this game is that they are most likely not going to purchase WH1 and WH2, because they insist on them still being full price most of the time. Asking someone new to the franchise to purchase $180 of games just to actually enjoy the games is pretty insane, but most of us did do that and I think they let us down in a weird way.

Fix the lobsided autoresolve that has a bias against player forces, then add back minor settlement maps to settlements themselves, right now it makes 0 sense for them to be so harsh on autoresolve only to force you to play a very easy land battle just like WH2

Stop focusing on adding quantity in general, there was no reason to make ""night"" goblin big boss a whole entire hero when it could have been merged as a variant into regular goblin big boss, or adding sword goblins for that matter when goblins always were meant to be meatshields. 

This is all related to not adding armory / army painter with the base game, forcing 150 units into warriors of chaos roster when it could have easily been 50, if players had armory to pick armaments, heraldry and colors as they like it wouldn't be just WoC that have their power rangers, what makes chaos warriors of khorne any more special than free company of nordland or lion rangers?

Speaking of too late now's, how about an actual siege rework that rids the game of defenders cloud jumping on to the walls or these unsalvagable wall mechanic entirely? It only worked out in shogun 2 because you had more than one layer of walls overseeing one another, but here where you were so insistent on making every single generic settlement map into a box in the middle it only helps ruin player retension from how boring and same every siege battle is. 

How about undoing the ""spell resistance"" or ""all healing has to be %"" too? what possessed you to make such a change, at the exact same time you added spell intensity to make almost every spell 200% stronger, what use there in having a resistance that's only useful to units against area damage wind spells, it does nothing to hold off debuffs, summons or vortex damage spells, and keeping all those items that give 10% spell resist? Is that gonna stop you from getting oneshot when targeted by 3 magic missiles at same time, why not just add magic weakness? And why is there no longer any way to add flat numbers to healing, why does it need to be 0,15% when that does nothing for the empire captain yet helps someone like Kugath hold off an entire chokepoint?

"This game is a mess. 

The UI is overly busy with unnecessary details and animations. The information that matters is hidden away frustratingly into menus that care more about being flashy depictions of random  conceptual detritus.

Parsing information from the map is worse. It's neigh impossible to know what's going on because of how much art pollution is going on. Every thing is moving, every turn. Dozens of factions all moving about haphazardly to conquer one another. It's difficult to even figure out where objectives are or how best to get there. 

Enemy combat AI is passable. Even decent, but the campaign so clearly cheats. Enemy factions will go from a crushing defeat, to full strength in a couple turns. Diplomacy is irrelevant when there's so many factions all trying to kill you . No matter how well you play, the battle of attrition is theirs to win. 

There are some good ideas. Many unique features, like stealth , development and a living world are present , but they are all so haphazardly implemented that none of them make sense when taken together. The seams between the features are always present and working against you.

CA should have taken the millions of $ they spent on UI design and art and used it to hire game designers and coders instead. 

The developers bit off more than they can chew. The scope and scale of the game exceeded their abilities and budget to pull off. TW:Warhammer 3 is a bloated, shallow, and ultimately disappointing Total War games. It lacks both polish and functionality. 

If you want Total War, play their older games before corporate cancer (DEI) ruined AAA games. 

If you want the itch of large scale fantasy wargaming scratched, get Dominions 6. It's everything Total War wishes it could be, albeit with simpler graphics, but a far more usable UI.

"Total War: Warhammer 3 – The Ultimate Fantasy Strategy Playground


I’ve played a lot of Total War games, but Warhammer 3 feels like the craziest, most epic one yet. Huge battles, insane factions, and a ridiculous amount of strategy make it one of the most addictive games I’ve ever played. Whether I’m leading a disciplined Cathayan army or going full destruction mode with Khorne, every campaign feels unique and fun.

What Makes It Awesome
✅ Factions Feel Completely Different – Seriously, playing as Khorne and then switching to Tzeentch feels like two different games.
✅ Immortal Empires is Insane – Once you unlock it, you’re basically playing the biggest Total War game ever made.
✅ The Battles Are Just Fun – Giant monsters, magic, and total chaos. Watching a Hell Pit Abomination wreck enemy lines never gets old.
✅ So Many Strategic Options – Diplomacy, ambushes, economy—there’s always something to manage.
✅ The Warhammer World Feels Alive – The art, music, and voice acting bring everything together so well.

A Few Things That Annoy Me
❌ Late Game Can Get Slow – Turns start taking longer, and some battles feel repetitive.
❌ Too Many DLCs (But I Still Buy Them...) – Warhammer and Total War fans know the deal. The game is amazing, but expect to spend more money on extra content.

Final Thoughts
I keep coming back to Total War: Warhammer 3 because no two campaigns ever feel the same. Whether I want to build a massive empire or just destroy everything in sight, it always delivers. If you love strategy games, especially Total War, this is easily one of the best.",True,0,0,2025-02-11 10:26:32

"For a game of this magnitude, there are frankly inexcusable issues that CA simply refuses to fix. This is the third game in the series and has been out for some time, yet basic campaign mechanics literally do not work. 

For example, vassals, especially ones made from minor factions, do not work. They will simply AFK on their main settlement. Additionally, they seem to be largely incapable of winning battles. I once had to reload due to two full stacks of vassals being wiped by an injured tier 1 unit and generic lord. This is made worse by the fact that THERE ARE FACTIONS DESIGNED AROUND VASSALS!!! Chaos is almost unplayable, as they are incentivized to give their stuff to vassals, who will never do anything. Sure, you can try to order them, but 1) it barely works any better than their standard AI. 2) You have to give them orders to attack a specific army or settlement, rather than generic orders or stances such as ""be aggressive or defensive"". This is only made worse by 3) YOU NEED TO USE A RESOURCE TO ORDER YOUR OWN VASSALS, meaning you are unable to micro them into being useful (not that it would be possible even with unlimited points given how poorly they work). 

Another example is the diplomacy. Want to get a trade agreement with a faction that's not of your race? I hope you're okay with wasting potentially hundreds of thousands of gold to get them to agree. But, if you give them a settlement, no matter how insignificant, they will likely do anything, including become your vassal (for as much good as that will do you). This does not seem to be effected by how much land or armies they have. On top of that the diplomacy is bare bones and hasn't changed functionally from Rome 2.

Lastly, there are antiquated mechanics CA is simply too lazy to update. The biggest thing that comes to mind are rogue armies; full stacks of random, often high tier units (that make 0 sense lore wise; Lizardmen wood elf pirate raiders? Really?) that will wander around your border with impunity until they decide randomly to begin attacking your settlements, often when your armies are on the other side of the map fighting real factions. If you're especially unlucky, they'll attack you early enough in the campaign to essentially make it unplayable, as they start with full, high tier armies for free. 

Bonus: The DLC practice is known to be predatory and excessive. Want the full roster for your favorite faction? I hope your fine with buying 1-2 DLC for it. The worst thing for me is that they only included 1 legendary lord for the demon factions that were new to this game so they could sell you well established and obvious lords like Skulltaker later for a price. 

Battles can be fun but the campaigns range from broken to unplayable. I would encourage anyone to wait for a heavy sale to get into the game.

Less storage space and still cheaper than actually buying and building/painting in the physical tabletop hobby, though.",True,1,0,2025-02-04 21:37:36
"yes BUT it has a lot of other DLC, including both Total War Warhammer 1 and 2, that is required in order to play many as many of the other legendary lords.  Wait for a good sale you can get more of the game for less money",True,1,0,2025-02-03 08:12:38
"The game itself is amazing, but the sheer cost of the full experience is insane.  You can spend hundreds of dollars and still not get the full complete game, many empires are locked behind WH1 and WH2 which are both full priced games with the exception of unpredictable sales or if you hunt for questionable steam keys online to purchase.  I simply cannot give it a recommend unless this approach is changed, it makes Paradox's DLC doctrine look graceful.  Perhaps add a subscription service, or even pioneer a service where a monthly payment is given until all DLCs are owned but still usable in the meantime.  $300+ in DLC that locks 80% of the game is just unacceptable.",False,1,0,2025-01-31 21:31:54

I had no issues with the game running, the graphics are nice, the battles have some cool aspects to them, the story feels thought out, but the overall campaign map leaves much to be desired and does not pull me in to stay for many hours I had hoped to play like previous Total War titles. Public order doesn't even matter.

I am sure it is fun for those who like it, but the change in total war games to only having an army under a general is quite boring, as is not having to put much thought into buildings in the towns. This game missed out on having massive armies and the complaints about AI turn time would be moot if there were options in the game to completely skip watching AI turns.

This game doesn't even allow you to manually customize your army and expand upon any garrison at a city. Sure you can make your defensive army bigger by buying better buildings, but not much past that.

The only saving grace for me was the Warhammer story behind it. If it were one of the other Total War games with the same exact game play, I wouldn't of tried playing past the first two hours.",False,1,0,2025-01-28 03:20:15

Prety cool. Should have more content from previous games.,True,0,0,2025-02-02 06:43:10
"Despite the ups and downs that Warhammer III and Creative Assembly on the whole have gone thru over the last couple of years, I think this game is the pinnacle of the Total War series. 

I say this as someone who first got into the series with Medieval Total War (2002) and who put multiple thousands of hours across the 20+ year lifespan of the series. Rome and Medieval 2 were the games I played the most - but this was before I had a business and a family. 

I now have close to 800 hours in WH3, and every time I start a new campaign and get into new faction or lord mechanics, I still often find myself contemplating the journey that starts with the first Medieval (no campaign movement - just hop army token from one province to the next) and ends with WH3, with all the campaign shenannigans, flying unit, lores of magic, etc. 

If you have never played TW Warhammer and find yourself at a loss about where to start, my suggestion is to do a bit of research and find a factions that sounds like it would fit your playstyle, then get yourself all the DLCs that have content for that faction. This will be a portion of the total price tag for all three games and DLCs - and will still give you hundreds of hours of absolutely fantastic gameplay.",True,0,0,2025-01-28 15:29:32
