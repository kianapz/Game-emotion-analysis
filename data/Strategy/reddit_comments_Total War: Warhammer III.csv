1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"When you vote with your wallet you're bound to be heard.

Glad this happened and I hope other gaming communities do the same."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"A happy tale.

If anyone has been sleeping btw, Total War is an all time great series."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,The problem with vote with your wallet is that people with more dollars in their wallet get more votes.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"People are voting with their wallets for years. People love loot boxes, skins, mtx, battlepass, p2w..

There is a reason why we see them everywhere"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Now I just really hope they actually learn from that for future Total War games and DLCs. 

Pharao was the first Total War I didn't buy early on in a LONG time (I waited until the price drop). And it's a very meh Total War game even for the lowered price."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"This is great BUT also an edge case since the vast majority of the playerbase are adults.  

In most games the playerbase is a lot younger. Yes, even for 18+ games. Hell, my, at the time 8 year old, niece loved to play gta 5. She didnt play any of the story. She would just drive around occasionally hitting people only to inevitably have her car hit the water and then id have to get her back on dry land.  

Kids dont care how expensive something is. They dont care how its made or who had to suffer for it. All they care about is that they want it and their walking, talking atm called ""mommy"" and ""daddy"" WILL buy it for them."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I wish this would happen with Destiny 2, what a fuck up that is. A shell of its former self."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,This is great but I read the first blog post and it seemed pretty polite and not threatening towards the player base at all?
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I used to really love total war, played a lot of medieval, viking conquest, Rome, and medieval 2 when in school.  I was thinking about trying the more recent entries a while back and saw the price for the ""complete"" version with dlc was astronomical even with the steam summer sale.  Seemed like they copied Paradox's pricing model where you get the base game for $30 or whatever and then all the dlc costs costs well over $100."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Shows the power of voting with your wallet.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"... how the hell is the first linked statement ""threatening the fanbase""? Like, what? Lol"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,If they remade Medieval 2 they'd be swimming in cash..
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I do not see how that first article is ""basically threatening the fanbase"" at all. Which bit is threatening?"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"It's a phyrric victory at best. They backtracked a little bit with the last step that went to far. You still pay the price of half a game fora Dlc that has around 5-10% of the content of a game if you account for engine improvements, Graphics, art design, etc..."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Man i wish pokemon fans would see this, but at this point no amount of shit will stop them from buying lmao."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,I voted with my euros
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Too bad it takes several monumental mistakes for it to actually happen - how many huge gaming companies deserve utter failure after the amount of mistakes they've made in recent times?  It's ridiculous.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"If you pay for slop, you shall receive slop in the future. This says a lot about the current state of MP games, people clearly love gambling and slop."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,So I'd like to explain the situation for the people who got confused. For the Total War Warhammer major bug fixes come with new DLC and not until a DLC release game Devs don't put much effort into fixing bugs and other game breaking things. When people said we won't buy those shitty overpriced DLC's Devs said if you don't buy the DLC we're afraid we won't be making any and this means there's no update (bug fixes and improvements) for the game. They basically threatened to kill the game.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,I feel gaming is where it is right now largely due to 'gamers' as a whole having very poor impulse control and no patience. Why does every game have early access now? Battlepasses? Launch DLC? Microtransactions? Because we can't say no.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Shoutout to everyone who always mock that kind of consumer action.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,I guess showing those billionaire b*stards who’s boss is kind of fun after all
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Its easier for niche communities since they are more focused on one game and knows the in and outs of it.

Its more of a shitshow for other stuff since the silent minority that doesn't even care about most of this stuff its the one buying the game.

Still big W for them."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I've been doing this since Rome:TW2. The amount of factions available at launch was shit, but they were very quick to introduce dlc to add more.


CA are scumbags and I made a point not to give them any money since. Plenty of other good games out there."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I mean, this really is great to see, and a 250% increase in DLC pricing is nuts.

But there also wasn’t anything in that first linked “DLC Statement” that even vaguely approached “threatening the fanbase”. Hyperbole and exaggeration just makes it easier to ignore as “the gamers are big mad again”."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"> basically threatening the fanbase:

""Finally, we need to ask you again to stop directing abuse at individual team members. Frustrated as you may get, these are human beings who spend many hours representing you and your voices within the studio. All of our work gets easier when they are treated with respect.""

As the owner of a development company, let me tell you.  I welcome input from my customers.  If you aren't satisfied with our product I will bust my ass to do everything I can for you and make you happy.

However, there is a line.  If you are abusive to my employees, I don't want/need you as a customer.  The only thing worse than that is when people defend such jackassery.  In this example, overzealous fans went too far, and the COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE response from CA is being mislabeled as ""threatening"".

I'm glad Creative Assembly made their fans happy.  There are good customers who genuinely deserved it.  CA made no threats, and if you think for a second that the insults and threats made by the community were the impetuous for the change.... you're part of the problem.

Here's to hoping /u/Capt_C004 removes/revises that inaccuracy."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,If only fifa players had the same sixed balls. Fuck ea. Never again. 
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Idk this is only so much of a win, looking at what their roadmap sounds like, just more dlc, more small retextured games on the same Rome 2 engine, I really am not holding out hope for SEGA and CA"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Total War games have been a shit show upon release for many titles now.  But you all keep getting so exciting and buying them on day 1.  I love the games, but they really were (I haven't bought the last few now) just so bad and very slowly patched, and some things were left unpatched and left to modders.

Everyone encouraged them slowly, they didn't get there all in one go.  If games are repeatably released in a bad way, stop bloody buying them so early.  Wait for patches, wait for a sale or you're part of the reason they keep escalating in their shitty behaviours."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Now seal the deal creative and give us another bloody medieval or shogun game and we'll love shower you dollar bills
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,And that is why I play City of Heroes on Homecoming.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Oh it would be nice to get back in to Total War games. I still remember battles from the first Shogun, me defending a hill with inferior forces and shredding the enemy with archers. 

I’ve barely touched any of there games in the last ten years."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Good for the TW community, too many fans do nothing but complain while continuing to throw down their cash. We don't have to be at the mercy of greedy shareholders, we can help shape the industry if we really consider where and what we spend on."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I still think it was ridiculous when I saw that you literally couldnt play the immortal empires mode if you didnt own the other games in the series.

even more ridiculous that there were a lot of people defending it.


Its not that you couldnt play certain empires, you _literally couldnt play the fucking mode at all_ unless you had the other games in your steam library. Its like if age of empires said you couldnt play matches other than the campaign if you didnt own all the other age of empires game in your steam library.

for reference, immortal empires is where you pick an empire and try to win the game, separate from the story campaign. In my opinion its pretty much the ""standard"" way of playing that you will spend most of your time in.

I was going to buy it but I was like fuck no that is some straight up bullshit. They deserve to have their shit pirated."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,This is the way.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I’ve played since Rome total war 1. Amazing game, then since I’ve logged over 2000 hours on medieval 2 . And I’ve played Rome 2 and warhammer 2. They were okay. Medieval 2 just keeps pulling me back. There’s some problems, but the character management is so much better. I don’t know what it is about the graphics they changed and the building trees but I don’t like the new ones as much.  There’s a feeling in the games that they lost trying to improve the graphics and monetize it. I’ll Lee playing medieval 2 over and over unless something comes out otherwise."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I have bought every single total war game, until the last few. Their greed just made the games so much worse than they were. Where it started to go downhill was the warhammer games. 

I bought the first and some DLC and really enjoyed it. I then bought the second, but I didn’t get any DLC. The price of the game and the price of the DLC was just too much. And it now started to feel like they were putting a lot of content behind a pay wall. I haven’t touched the 3rd warhammer, as the price was crazy, for essentially something that could have been considered a large expansion pack 20-25 years ago. They were wanted £45 I think it was upon release, and they already had factions behind a DLC paywall. 

Pharaoh, yeh I wasn’t touching that. Everyone knew it was a cut down game they wanted full price for. How they thought they would get away with it, I don’t know. 

Bring back the days of Medievel and Rome total war. How many playable factions did those games have on release? 20? Then a game like Empire with so many factions and a huge map. 

They are going to have to work hard to get me to buy the next one."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"It was their first release from their Warhammer line that I didn't preorder. I have all three games and every DLC, but Shadows of Change because it just simply wasn't worth it. I'll definitely be getting it after the update now"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Halo Infinite community please take note of this. The latest *Spirit of Fire* operation is a clear example of 343i using similar methods. Vote with your wallets ; don't buy the bundles!
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Still mad at them about this: Total War Warhammer 1-2-3, which is you know about friggen' WARHAMMER, comes default with no blood in the game for units when they are fighting. That in itself is preposterous and indefensible IMO.  

But they got around scorn by releasing, for free, a DLC that added back the blood. Okay fine.

I got back into it for Warhammer 3 and started playing but just around the time I felt I was going to be hooked I decided man without the blood this is lame. I would wait for the free DLC.

Then it arrived and it wasn't fucken free. Bastards."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Now all we need is people on console to start standing up for themselves and stupidity like paying to play online would go away.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"CA seems to be one of those game companies where the CEOs has zero interest in the gaming industry. CA is in the top three game companies on my shit list for destroying beautiful things. 

I want Total War: Arena back."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,So when are Total War: Empire 2 and Total War: Medieval 3 coming out if CA are now listening to the players?
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I’ve loved Total War games since the first Shogun. Ever since Rome 2 I refuse to preorder or buy at full price. I wait a year until the reviews are in and the big steam sale and buy at half price. I won’t buy dlc unless it’s about 70% off. The games are great, but the nickel and diming greed is off the charts."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-10,Justice for Three Kingdoms!
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-10,I am proud of you guys. Vote with your wallet! Also.... Do not preorder!
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-10,this works when your community is incredibly dedicated/invested. sadly most games can't pull this off due to casual fans/playerrs and mainstream visibility
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-10,I don’t see how that response is threatening the fanbase
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"They still haven't won me back yet, that whole fiasco was a kick in the teeth."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I'm in two minds about this. Sure, power to the consumer to not buy things they deem unsatisfactory. But game development costs money. The blog posts don't read as threats to me, they're just honest communication. Now, if there is data suggested CA is lying, sure, call them out. But if CA fold because they can't pay their bills, everyone loses."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,This is what happens when people *actually* vote with their wallets
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,If only Darktide players understood this
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,I've always loved the Total War games but having 10 different $15 DLCs for all of the Warhammer games has been ridiculous.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I mean, not to sound like a downer, but CA did not go beyond what was expected off them, they simply went and did stuff that they should have done months ago.  
Besides, we haven't received anything of what was promised yet. Better temper those expectations."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Never ever believe a company who is basically saying *""Trust us we need to financially fuck you in order to survive. You want us to survive, right?""*

They're fucking lying and are just being greedy cunts.

*""We've had to make the very difficult decision to raise our prices in these harsh financial times in order to keep delivering the quality products you know and love us for.""*

No, fuck off. You pay your employees like shit and have done multiple stock buybacks and keep raising CEO salary."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,We didn't win we just got a half arsed apology in hopes we'll buy their next half arsed gsme
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,You love to see it
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,I haven't played a total war game since Rome 2. What a disappointment that game was. It was also the last game a preordered and paid full price for. 
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Total war is dead to me. Use to be a favourite. Just constant money grab steadily worsening reskins
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I don't know if we read the same Aug 2023 DLC statement, it reads nothing like a threat. I think OP's being Hyperbolic here.

""Costs are up"" ""sorry"" ""stop making abuse threats"" that's pretty much it."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-10,"They won what?

We've not had a decent Total War game since 2015. All we've had is attempts at catering to new audiences except for Thrones of Britannia and Pharaoh, which were both much smaller 'Saga' titles.

* Warhammer fans - Shitty fantasy aimed at dudes who've never seen real tits.
* Superhero (general) fans - Someone at CA had a Marvel hard-on and made all their games feature one-man army units.
* Chinese market - Dynasty Warriors sim. Records mode is a mess of a joke and built for romance.

Total War is very much still dead and it'll remain so until we get back to pre-Warhammer mechanics. A shame really because mechanically Pharaoh isn't that bad, it's just a piss poor scope."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,if the wh3 dlc goes down in price to 5usd.. I might consider it (the already released dlc)
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I'm so sick of these games having all these DLC packs, instead of like the old days where a game would get a full expansion with lots of content."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Hey, this makes me want to reinstall total war warhammer and play around for a bit. Maybe this time i can really figure out who the warhammer 40k is.

Anyway, whoever was in charge of these pricing changes essentially endangered the entire franchise with their greed, and should not be involved in any monetization decisions again under any circumstances. Clearly the wrong stakeholders had too big of a say."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Still wish they'd drop Denuvo. Anecdotally it causes me grief every time I try to play games with Denuvo away from home. Granted I've only ever bought 2 or 3.

  
Bought every single TW game and expansion/DLC until they introduced Denuvo."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Now they just been to make Medevel 3 or Empire 2 and not have any mythical stuff, just a regualr historical game with alot of the fuctions they have worked on from other releases. 

I don't want a single unit George Washington with guns akimbo blasting British while saying one liners wiping out 300 men. 
By all means have generals on there own but make them vunrable."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Decisive victory!
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Yeah but let's not forget this is already a niche fanbase. Voting with their wallet works because it's mostly them buying it. Voting with your wallet in something like cod, or any other popular franchise doesn't because of the sheer number of people who either don't care or don't even know about stuff like this"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,This needs to happen with Skull and Bones and ppl need to stop preordering the games. The developers are talking about increasing prices but they games will come out in a shit state. Not all developers are bad but there are a lot of shit games where they are more focused on GaaS than the customers enjoyment.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,This is the way. Refuse their greedy practices.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,To be fair the total war fan base are into total war games and if you deliver a turd instead of a total war game you may as well shove it up your ass. 
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Stopped buying total war games when they fucked Jeff van dyck and his missus out of doing the soundtracks.

Fucken bullshit"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Very impressive.

If only other fan bases could actually do this.

CoD community I am talking about you"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,anyone fancy playing with me tonight?
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Damm, I wish Paradox fan were like that"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,They totally overvalued how good Warhammer was and thought they could overcharge just because
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,It really helped that Hyenas was such a dumpster fire that they didn’t even release it.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I own every Total War Warhammer DLC except for Shadows of Change. I wasn’t even keeping up with the drama, I just couldn’t stomach spending $25 for such a small DLC. I’m glad to see they’ve recognized the error of their ways!"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Sadly this kind of collective action only happens with games that have a pretty strong community outside the game.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"This is why I love niche communities and hate the mainstream sometimes, in niche communities you can bet your ass if there's outrage, the majority share it."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,I love how the CPO and his BS are nowhere to be seen in the new update. Dude had to eat massive amounts of crow and his ego probably prevents him from seeing how asinine and insulting his original message was. Pure greed only gets you so far.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Can we please stop blaming the devs?  It’s the leadership, and/or the publisher, that are always to blame.  Devs generally just want to make a good game."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,creative dissonance
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"It only works because two things were true:

* it's a small niche product, and
* enough people followed through

This doesn't work on the worst offenders. Your Activisions and Ubisofts and EAs. They know my money is a drop in the bucket compared to what some whale or child with little supervision and their parent's CC can do. When 1000 people out of many millions boycott COD? Yeah that 0.0001% drop in sales sucks, I guess. That same 1000 when your player base is measured in thousands? That gets noticed."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Based
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,damn this is some good shit. unirocally i want jagex to fuck with mtx in osrs just for the playerbase to walk out. the precedant would be huge for the community
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Take notes Pokemon gamers.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Huge W
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Is it worth getting Pharaoh now?
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Amazing comunity. It happens so often that you see big groups of people not caring and continuing to pay instead of making a stance.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Really good advantage of niche games. Extremely loyal, focal fanbases. Unfortunately very hard to vote with our wallet when it comes to more popular mainstream games."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,What a great success story! Would be great if it could happen more often with other game companies too.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Money is everything that matters to companies, take that away and they panic."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Games Workshop has been trying to sell digital goods at their hyperinflated physical prices for years now. They are never going to stop trying.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,One thing to remember is that the GM of the Total War franchise is the same guy that lead the development and live service efforts for Battlefield V and 2042. Before that he was a live service lead on Fortnite. Expect shitty business practices until he’s ousted.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I am still playing 1212 on atila which I payed six dollars for six years ago. 

Thanks CA!"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I loved TW Warhammer 2 but last time I touched 3 it was a steaming pile of shit, and then the price raising happened. 

I'm good, I'll load up TW2 again if I ever get the itch."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I'm extremely loyal, that's why I only play Medieval **1** Total war. Yeah, you read that right. **1**"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Personally the only game they made in that series I've really enjoyed was spartan total warrior. Everything else wasn't work picking up imo
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"The entire fact it is niché is what makes the backlash actually have an effect...

If it was mainstream, the publisher/dev wouldn't care as their bottom line wouldn't be hurt enough.

The players only won in this case because the bottom line was actually hurt due to its small size"

Three kingdom came out in a good polished state, that was a huge surprise. But they couldn't just not to have a broken TW game laying there so they got lost in patching and dlc and then they finished it with magical tigers unit where they lost me loyal customer that bought every TW and dlc prior to that.

They are insanely lucky and fortunate to have those fans that kept games alive with mods. But everyone had their limits of abuse and CA is great in making modders life hard with policies. Plus spaghetti code."

Creative Assembly reduced the content, increased the price, threatened the fanbase, and then SEGA pulled the plug on their next planned (Live Service) game. Suddenly, there was a round of layoffs for the studio and then they come back to the Total War community a couple months later [apologising for everything](https://www.totalwar.com/blog/message-from-total-war-leadership-dec-2023/)?

As much as I would love to say all this was thanks to the actions of fans, it honestly felt more due to their main plans falling through, so they changed face and are trying to ensure the Total War community can be their safety net.

With that system in place it's time to release a medieval 3, and I think its the best time for it since, having a King you can control individually in battle and have quest is amazing, while also having dukes and counts as playable lords.

I haven't seen a post mortem but the mail problem of WH3 is that it was *not very good*. 

Then the youtubers jumped on it and crapped all over it (you know who I'm referring to) You can see Creative's response is to include streamers in the future, probably more early access and other partnerships to stroke each other's backs

There was so much negativity that Pharaoh was dead in the water. It's apparently a fine game from players I know who've played it. 

Creative also has a big problem - they basically resell the same fucking game the last 20 years with a few design changes. In WH3 they tried to be ambitious and change it with a new siege minigame. The problem is SIEGES FUCKING SUCK and that minigame sucked

They also tried this quest-like system with the previous chaos lord expansion - which I found fine, but players rebelled against it too. Half the player base just wants more of the same thing, the other half is bored of the same thing."

When 3 launched, it felt VERY underwhelming and clunky overall.  I actually stopped playing the game entirely a few months after it launched and haven't gone back or even paid attention to the game since then.

I just looked on Steam and the newer DLCs are now $25, wtf.  I have a difficult time imagining any amount of DLC content that can justify that much of an increase in price.  It's nearly half the price of the base game, ridiculous.

I'd actually like to go back and re-visit the game as I'm sure they have made improvements to WH3 since launch.  But seeing the pricetags on these last few DLCs really doesn't make me very enthusiastic about getting back into the game."

At the time of this post, shadows of change is still 25 dollars. A shitty dlc with a bunch of copy and paste. They even released a statement basically telling the community to buy the dlc if they won’t support warhammer 3 anymore. THEN, they release a manipulative statement saying “sorry you feel this way” not “sorry we messed up” basically making us the problem, not them.

Just checked as well. Active players for pharaoh is like anywhere between 400-1000 players. The dev team and CA are trying to draw players pretending to be the good guys. Realistically pharaoh is going to have support dropped on it just like 3 kingdoms.

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I have been a total war fan for a while and was there during the whole debacle. Coming from someone who bought all the Warhammer dlc It wasn’t just the DLC price. 

Warhammer 1 was a huge experiment for them and they changed how the game was played and when they made their first DLCs it was okay but got you new stuff for a fair price.

Warhammer 2 came along and they shook up the game more when they combined both games into one. The game went through a rough early time but after a while it got hit with a lot of good updates and DLCs and to many felt like the game was true AAA quality. People expected CA would ride this high into an even greater high.

Then Warhammer 3 came along, the game was released with a narrative campaign that was so hated the #1 mod removed the whole narrative mechanic. Things were also pretty buggy as you expect a AAA game released to be and they didn’t immediately release the game mode that combined all 3 games like how game 2 did. 

Even with some tweaking when they did release it things were still very buggy and feeling lacking. Some good but more expensive DLCs came out that were generally received well despite higher cost complaints amidst the unfixed bugs. The players felt they deserved a game in a better state for how much they were paying into it and how good it was in the last game.

Then shadows of changed came, the trailer and let’s plays were poorer quality than usual, It looked like it was lacking things, had more powercreep than anything else we saw and it was way more priced than any other dlc we got. The community was furious at this greedy cash grab while our game was broken with many things unaddressed for so long many just said fuck it. What was worse was the apology letter from leader ship saying “making games expensive yo just give us the money” made more people not buy it. 

They finally released a real apology some months ago and people received it well but were waiting for real results. After the news of what they were adding it seems like they took the lesson, for now."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Some fanbases are too toxic and “loyal” to their franchises to ever vote with their wallets. (coughCODcough)

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,They also succeeded to legitimize a 150% price increase for the dlc by dropping reskinned units as candies. What about you say the whole story and not just a ridiculous biased one

Like CA could literally release a remaster Medieval 2 and I would buy it for $30-40. But they consistently chose to keep pumping out games historical fans don't ask for and constantly ignore games we asked for."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Total War is fucking amazing. I hope they do some more historic games next. Mediaval 3 or Empire 2 would be fantastic.

Greed has no bounds. Any studio larger than small is going to be run by the bean counters and monied investors before it will be by the creatives. So when a studio goes to far, stop buying the game. It is really that simple. Try out an indie game in the same genre instead.

Especially for Total War, their earlier games that are much cheaper and discounted, with all the DLC and updates, are way better than anything they've released in a while anyways."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Hmm, game still is about 400% more expensive than the average full price title coming in at a starting price of 263€. That's 2 years after release.

I expect the game to cost over 1000€ by 2026."

Sadly this isn't possible for most communities/products as most people are freakin stupid and have no self respect...

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Now if the fanbase wants to actually do the right thing they will continue boycotting the company until they **fucking die** as a message to the others. This one is already poisoned and willing to shit on their players, kill it off and let something new rise, they won't get better, they will just hide it better."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"This wasn't a case of some conscious boycotting.

The quality of the product dropped so people simply felt less incentivized to spend."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,I don’t know much but wouldn’t this be SEGA and not Creative Assembly that is responsible for pricing? Could be wrong but it looks like they’re just the developers not the publishers.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Now, we just need them to go back to the historical formula that made the series great to begin with. Enough with this fantasy bull crap. 

Make a gritty historical total war. It's not that hard."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"They started to lose me after Shogun 2, the game was incredible and every game after that got progressively worse. Warhammer was the last time I bought one of their products, I hope to see them return to glory and this puts them on the right direction"

We did a good job with the sabotage and everything (aldo helped by the whole Hyena fiasco), but don't count your chickens before they hatch. I will not claim victory until the patch is out and I see a true change of route."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Eventually the market catches up. Issue is that we got here today, games are too grindy, have too many artificial game lengtheners, all to push microtransactions and dlc, etc. 

But people get fed up, total war isn't as big as say gta. Gta is already going down the same road, we can tll with rdr2, eng of gtaO drip feed, to see what coming for gta6, so its huge, it will take time for votes with wallet to matter, but for smaller fan base games its faster turnaround. Problem is that casualasation of games to make their market base as wide as possible, so as to avoid getting review bombed and wallet voted out."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,SUMMON THE ELECTOR COUNTS!
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"How can a company think raising prices with less content will make them more money? Especially in this economy. Especially on a game with an established price threshold. By doubling the price you lock out your normal customer and receive the same amount of money if not less money than before. Who runs these departments? 

If you add more content than ever before in a dlc and really make some changes tack on a few bucks, maybe double it specifically for this dlc. But it’s the same size or less than others that have been priced this way for years….you Gota be dumb."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Yeah I stopped buying Warhammer games as they were just releasing glorified mods of warhammer 2 or rome 2
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Yeah, the biggest lie in the industry is when the publisher convinced people that they decide Where the industry was going and the players just had to accept it."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Even with the additions, the DLC is still way too expensive. The DLC is like 40% the price of the main game. Well, when the main game gives me a huge map, a campaign, lots of factions and all that. I expect 40% of the same amount of content in the damn DLC for that asking price.

I mean, at the time when the DLC launched. I could buy the DLC and the previous one with one with the Chaos Dwarf faction or I could buy Baldurs Gate 3, a 200+ hours RPG.

DLC packs are such bullshit scams."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"No, we didn't and they still aren't giving enough to justify the price for their last dlc."

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,250% increase? Where was that price? Australia? The price increase was 67% higher for the recent DLC.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Same thing happen with Total War Rome 2

After the half-baked content in that, a LOT of Us Complained and refused to buy more content until Creative Assembly FIXED THEIR DAMN Game.

Eventually 2018 the game was the way it should have been at launch in 2013"

Where is the win? They price increased 250% and is still +250%.

The real crime is that the games have been mediocre at best compared to Shogun 2 and everything that came before. Medieval 2, Rome 1. Those are legendary games for a reason.  Nothing of what they have released since has ever come close to that. Rome 2 was and still is a disaster that is unplayable without mods. The less said about the Saga games the better as well I think.

Unless they do a big change of direction and rebuild from scratch (there are reports that the games are build with tools that are considered ancient in IT terms, especially regarding bugfixing), it will stay mediocre at best.

Me and my friend noticed that my laptop's performance was very bad with a 3060 and 16gb of RAM, and we noticed that the laptop wasn't using the 3060 to play, instead it was using the intel i7 graphic (which is not the optimal thing).

I recall a couple polls claiming that the vast majority of total war warhammer players don’t also take part in the warhammer tabletop game.  This holds especially true as the total warhammer games use the fantasy setting, which is far less popular now than the 40k setting. The total warhammer player base is almost entirely built off of CAs pre existing base of total war players from the good old days"

That's how long time fans of certain franchises get fucked over: they tend to have standards and expectations, so why develop a game for them when you can target an easier audience?

Not alot of whales compared to the average consumer. If they do adjust to mostly whales, they'll be taking bigger risks or downsizing until it's not manageable.

I really think the big issue is uninformed consumers and deep apathy. Whales are definitely a problem, but one that can be worked around if the other half of the free market, the only regulators, respect themselves more, enough to not let companies take advantage of them. Eventually even some whales will see the hired addiction expert's damages done and also step back.

Currently though, we gotta start making people see they deserve better. That we all deserve better. That standing up to companies, means not just better, affordable products, but better work environments, better pay, and an overall better industry.

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Take this with a grain of salt since I'm not active in the community but I believe it stems from the fact they had shuttered development of TW: Three Kingdoms after committing to bug fixes and more DLC (I think? idk tbh) because it wasn't selling as well as they wanted. The statement ""However, this is the business reality of supporting WARHAMMER III and **ensuring we’re able to offer the years of extra content that are currently planned.**"" (emphasis mine) was taken as an implication of ""buy the DLC or else we'll do what we did with Three Kingdoms"" by the community. 

Again I'm not active in /r/totalwar but there were several threads that probably do a better job of explaining it than I just did.

Edit: /u/herO_wraith [did a better job of explaining it in another reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1amkca4/the_total_war_fan_base_won_and_made_the_greedy/kpmjomc/)"

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"The perceived threat was this part :

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I disagree with the paradox comparison entirely. Paradox games just feel completely incomplete without a select few DLCs. Especially when we're talking about sequels (like CK3). 

Total War DLCs, imo, just truly feel like additions and they usually feel well worth the money. It doesn't really feel like you're missing out on anything without them except in a couple of cases (Skaven are pretty rough without the weapon teams DLC, for example)."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Dunno about the historical ones since I didn't bother with DLC there, but for me at least a rough 80% of TWW DLC seemed fairly priced because:

* extra campaigns meant at least a few dozen hours of play on the main map and then being able to play the new factions in the combined maps
* Warhammer assets are fairly complex and detailed graphics-wise + audio work isn't free either

I generally felt like I got my money's worth from their DLC"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,[deleted]
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"They've 100% ripped off Paradox's approach.

Sadly most of the DLC for Total Warhammer 3, the current big game, tends to be mostly new factions and leaders. They'll have their own individual mechanics to a degree but there's nothing that will change the overall game or add new layers to it the way something like La Resistance does for HOI4.

CA's way seems to mostly be the GW way of offering new factions."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"it's surprising that people don't say what's commonly said about this issue : Just buy the dlcs for the races you actually play.  If you play all of them, that's hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay.  If you just play a few, that's maybe a hundred hours.  You get what you pay for if you enjoy the sandbox campaign."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"It sort of needs context that OP didn't give. 

First, TW:WH3 isn't a stand-alone game. In a lot of ways, the Warhammer games are all one constantly evolving game. Owning one on the same account unlocks all previous content for it in the next. Perhaps the best way to conceptualise this, is to imagine game 1 is based in notEurope, game 2 features NotAfrica, NotAmericas and a bit more. By owning game 1, game 2 unlocks a free mode where you get a super combined map. So understand WH3 isn't just a game, to a lot of people it is supposed to be the culmination of multiple years of gaming and something they knew had been coming since the very begining.  

CA had a hugely successful game called 3 Kingdoms based of a period of Chinese history and with a popular following, including a tv series. They went hard after the Chinese market with it, and succeeded. Leaked sales numbers suggested it was the best-selling base Total War game of all time. 

DLC has been a thing for Total War games for a while and generally it is pretty accepted, people still get very angry with Day 1 DLC, but for the most part the additions every 6ish months to add content is welcome. 

For 3k CA made shit DLC that the 3k fanbase didn't want, again the 3 kingdoms era was well covered in other media and CA did their own thing that nobody was interested in. The DLC sales were awful. CA then release a video/blog that was originally called 'The future of TW Three Kingdoms' where they announced that due to poor sales, they were killing all support for the game, all bug fixes, any future DLC, all gone. 

While there is somewhat of a divide between fans of the Fantasy games like Warhammer and the historical games like Empire/Rome/Medieval, the entire fanbase saw what happened to 3k. TW:WH3 has been in a truly dire state for much of its life. So bad, even influencers who had early access were reluctant to recommend it.

So when fans read 'However, this is the business reality of supporting WARHAMMER III and ensuring we’re able to offer the years of extra content that are currently planned.' 

The fanbase reads, buy the DLC or your game gets 3ked, and we leave it in this near-unplayable state. CA doesn't have a good history of releasing games in the best state, but their DLC team that does the Quality of Life improvements has historically done a great job of constantly improving the games to the point of greatness."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I dunno, man. The last paragraph where they asked fans to please not direct abusive comments to specific employees seemed pretty threatening. /s"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Yeah, that's confused me as well. Maybe I'm blind but I don't see the threat."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Been following the story for awhile. The threat was something along the lines ""we need these price increases or we don't make more content"" when especially for total war warhammer it meant that long awaited dlc will never come if that statement was true. That was the threat, telling us to buy their overpriced dlc or they won't make us anything. I'll look for the exact quote if you're really interested."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"This one

""There’s no good time to increase prices, and we have not taken this step lightly. However, this is the business reality of supporting WARHAMMER III and ensuring we’re able to offer the years of extra content that are currently planned.""

Many fan interprid this as ""Accept our new price or no more DLC for you"""
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Something no one is mentioning is that WH3 was released very buggy, and when the ""if you don't buy our DLCs then we won't support the game with updates or DLCs"" post was made, several features of WH3 were considered broken. As an example, one of the 40 or so main characters you can play is named Nakai and he is all about these giant reptilian crocodiles called Kroxigors. That's his whole schtick. The other lizardmen characters can recruit them too but his are best. Except... he couldn't recruit them at all. That's a just-shy-of-game-breaking bug for his whole campaign.

So it wasn't just a logical ""if you don't want our DLC, we'll stop making more"" statement, it was also a ""we'll not fix the major bugs in the game *you already bought and paid for*"" threat."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,This really is counting the chickens before they hatch.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,It's crazy how the community still can't recognize that this is just how CA operates in order to divide the TW community against one another. The issues with the DLC was only **one** of the many issues that TW:WH3 suffers from. Small decisions from CA like these always causes a significant chunk of the community to ignore the plethora of issues that continue to go unresolved.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Not sure how 20-25 is half of 60 which nowadays is more like 70 but the content/price-ratio argument is still true.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,greece/greek states being a DLC was a fucking joke.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"They threatened to abandon this game if people didn't buy the overpriced, shitty DLC."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"This is me in a nutshell. I’ve moved on to Indy games where the developers are making these games out of love for the games and community, not how much they can get that community to pay regularly."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"As someone who still consistently plays Empire, I couldn’t agree more."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"When they released the game they said they would do at least 3 years of support and DLC content. Then less than a year in, they said we have to increase the price to continue support. Meaning if the DLC doesn't sell well, they might not keep their original plan of 3 years. Calling it a ""threat"" is kinda silly, but it still pissed a lot of people off."

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Exactly, they can have two successful product directions. Warhammer lends itself quite nicely to the hero-centric, magic-heavy playstyle. 

In Empire, there was NOTHING like that, and I loved it so much. In Shogun 2, the generals could eventually get an ability where they would like sit down in the middle of the battle and chill, and it provided a huge morale bonus to their command radius, and I thought it was kinda broken but hilarious. The focus was always on the troops, maneuvering, and morale. 

Both can be good. But I don't want to see an Empire 2 where the generals kill droves of men by wading into melee combat. I just want to research rank fire and see my front rows kneel when they reload. Much like a warhammer without heroes and magic would seem off."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"> I still dont know where pharaoh came from as a design idea.

Given CA's current state due to their turnover, a new medieval/empire/shogun just wouldn't be very good and it'll just hurt them more than help. 

Beyond that, Pharaoh is supposed to be a ""sagas"" title and isn't really comparable to those games to begin with. Doesn't mean it was a good idea but it was *never* going to be something like one of those ones you want. The next game will be a big title but it's more likely to be 3k2 than any of those."

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"> This holds especially true as the total warhammer games use the fantasy setting, which is far less popular now than the 40k setting.

I will not lie, I bought it on launch because I wanted to have the big campaign that was advertised since TW1 was in the news cycle but I stopped since I got distracted with other games and performance was a bit . . . shit, to put it nicely. I loved TW 3K, I loved TWH1 and 2 and I haven't played any others really due to well, I own them, I just never played them because I heard the series was great, but it took it being about Warhammer for me to try it out (and then same with 3K. It also helped I had a friend I could play with when he streamed it.)"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Honestly the sheer scale and variety of Total Warhammer is absolutely bonkers. I mean in how many other games can insane mad scientist rats nuke Imperial China, all while post industrial revolution Assyria sends demon fuelled tanks to blitz krieg medieval France?"

If CA offered me Empire 2, I'd bite their arm off."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Also, it is impossible to shame the shameless into action. CA course corrected also due to them giving a damn. GW makes them give a damn. Sega reminds them that TW is the only thing they have left. But CA actually also gives a damn about the games.

I truly hope CA Sofia gets more autonomy. Given what they had they did a good job with Pharaoh. Not gonna buy it tho."

Barely even needs people. [This arcticle claims 2% of the userbase, the whales, contribute between 50-70% of the revenue](https://www.blog.udonis.co/mobile-marketing/mobile-games/mobile-games-whales)

I get mildly irritated whenever this argument about user bases being responsible comes up. It is a tiny, miniscule fraction of the user base whose actions justify these exploitative and predatory practices."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"It's not just addiction to gambling. Just look at the trend of charging people more so they can play the game a few days before everyone else like with happened with Diablo 4, Starfield, Liest of P, among others, and yet people still mass purchase the game despite not even getting shiny pixels out of this."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Your comment vastly downplays how these companies exploit human psychology to tap into that part of our brains and influence us. It's no different from gambling, but at least lawmakers realised the gambling industry needed regulation... gaming does too."

This is just describing advertising."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,We should def blame the people alongside with the creators.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Yeah this is the context most are missing. The blog post was taken by the community as them basically saying ""Buy the overpriced DLC or we 3K WH3"", a.k.a. we abandon the game. To which the entire community looked at their coming titles at the time, Hyenas, which was cancelled later but at the time most were expecting it to flop, and Total War: Pharaoh, which after the price was revealed everyone *knew* was going to flop, and said ""bet, like you're going to abandon you're most popular/profitable franchise when you have nothing else in the pipeline for at least another year or two"". And this is on top of everyone already being pissed off at the lack of content for the price of the DLC itself which is what they were responding to in the first place."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"There’s a few other distinguishing factors with Paradox as well:

- Paradox’s development cycles are pushing a decade for each of its series. EU IV and HOI IV are 11 and 8 years old, respectively. CK III and Victoria III are each relatively new but replaced prior games which had been around for 8 and 12 years. You get a long lifespan out of Paradox games, so spending $40 base + $100 (or more) in DLC is well worth it on a per-hours-played basis, IMO. 

- Paradox DLC tends to mechanically overhaul its games in addition to adding some new flavor content. The EU IV I play today with piles of DLC is incredibly different from the game I bought in 2014.

- Paradox’s historical strategy games are all mechanically *very* different from one another, and even sequels within the same series regularly introduce significant mechanical adjustments. Total War, on the other hand (as much as I love it), has kind of always felt like re-skin of the same game with updated graphics and a new setting."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-10,"Rome 2 was the one I was looking at specifically during steam summer sale, $60 for all dlc for a game that's 10 years old still seemed pretty steep lol.  I have Empire, but it's so different to the pre-gunpowder era ones it was a little hard to get my head around.  I'll probably give it another shot at some point."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"In CA's defence due to each faction having specific mechanics and further on top of that legendary lords having further unique mechanics.

Adding a new system that works for every faction seems like an absolute nightmare to balance implement and fix the bugs that it would introduce."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"As a CA fanboy with many thousands of hours across their games, I also have to stress that we don't forget the non-existent QA process for multiple TWW2 and 3K DLC (I say non existent because some campaigns would be straight up bugged from the start, you can't say you didn't notice that if you booted the game) and multiple long-standing bugs in multiple series"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I'm a Total War player so I'm very familiar with their track record and was tremendously disappointed to see support/content for 3K dry up so quickly. 

Even with all that context, referring to any of that as ""threatening the fanbase"" is some thin-skinned sensational nonsense. 

""So they're basically saying if we don't buy their products, they're not going to release more content?! Who do they think they are?! I feel theeatened.""

Yeah, nah, lol. You can call out shitty practices and management without boiling it down to nonsense like this."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"How is that a threat, really? I'm not defending CA; I agree their handling of WH3 has been an embarrassment. I just find it incredibly bizarre to portray this as ""threatening the fanbase."" 

They made a business decision that was admittedly shitty and said ""we need to do this so we can afford to make the rest of the content we've laid out in the roadmap.""

Like, that's not a threat, people. Just because your life and soul is tied up in a strategy game doesn't mean the ""will they/won't they"" of content release down the line is holding you hostage or threatening your wellbeing.  

I applaud the sentiment in the post that players effectively voted with their wallet and the developer has responded, but somehow I feel it was more likely just the market resolving itself rather than some coordinated campaign, and I still find it absurd to describe anything they did as ""threatening."""
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I still don't see how that's a threat. They are a business after all and are responsible to their shareholders. Generating revenue is one of the main goals after all.  

It sucks when prices go up, but would you rather they fluff it up with BS?

they all share minimal lore, mostly the chaos gods, and if you decide to play a warhammer game it will either have ''40k'' on the title or not which in case it most likely belongs to the fantasy universe"

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"> And you need legit models for official tournaments, same as Magic cards. 

How many people that buy Warhammer shit to play the game win back their money in tournaments? I'm guessing 0-10% tops. And those dorks probably accept some more plastic shit in lieu of cash. So who gives a shit about their official tournaments? Is the game not worth playing just for the sake of the game? If the game is worth playing for itself, who cares about overpriced plastic that can be represented by random board game pieces?"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Oh no, no no no. A good resin printer will pay for itself the first time you print something. You could build an entire Adeptus Titanicus army in 40k scale for the price of one GW titan.


Depending on what you're printing and where your nearest GW shop is, it can actually be faster to print than to drive to the store.


But it does take some effort, and it's a bitch to get set up the first time."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Maybe you are thinking filament printers? My buddy has been printing my d&d groups' minis for a few years now with a good resin printer and they come out excellent. You can get resin printers with 12K LCDs for sub $400 these days.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,These days thats no longer the case. 
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,When's the last time you looked at good resin printers? They're often *better* than GW at this point. Sometimes indistinguishable.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I absolutely can print perfect models. I usually do proxies because I like the style better for some armies. I do print 1:1 gw clones, and once painted, the only difference is in weight.

You don't even need much ventilation, just a small hose and fan sucking to outside. I do it in my spare room. I've saved hundreds if not thousands printing multiple armies."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"The thing with TW is that they are practically the only game in town when it comes to strategy games with grand epic real time battlew. Knowing that they have no competition made them arrogant and for some reason real spiteful against their own community. Expecting that no matter what they do, the fans are gonna stfu and buy it... Well that worked for a solid while until most said enough was enough. They actually released a new $60 Total War game, despite very vocal backlash from the community and then once it barely sold 50k copies, suddenly the alarm bells rang and they changed their tune."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Yeah I feel that would apply to any RTS these days. The fanbase for RTS games is small and passionate. So if you piss off the passionate ones thats the majority of them, whereas if you piss off the passionate call of duty players you still have a fuckton of casual ones."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"One of the reasons CA tried to really half ass the Total War franchise is that Sega, their publisher, had greenlit a looter shooter that was intended to access that whale F2P market."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,And even if that happens greedy companies get butthurt and say their profits aren't high enough so they ax the game.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-10,Yeah it seems that outside of warhammer CA is trying to have the cake of DLCs without long term support.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,I still don't understand what happened. They cancelled a game that people liked and were playing and wanted to buy based on what I have hearD.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"True, but I get to keep my money and move onto other developers.  Let the more votes people get what they think is value to them.  I am over here looking at hentai rpg's because I cannot get more slaneeshi love."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I think it's more to do with what the profile of the playerbase is like.

Like grand strategy games aren't the kind of game that you just kind of sit down on the couch to play for 30 minutes. They are way more in-depth and basically if you're not really into it, you won't be playing the game all that much long-term. What this means is that you'll have a significantly larger portion of the playerbase being people who are actually really into the game. This means that you've got a larger proportion of players visiting forums, engaging in discussion about the game, making connections. And *those* people are the ones that will actually vote with their wallets.

When most of your playerbase is made up of people like that, it'll have an actual impact. CoD could not pull that shit off in any way because there's a much too big chunk of the playerbase that would never visit forums or subreddits just to talk about CoD."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Yeah this and other subs have probably gotten thousands on the ""no preorders"" and ""no microtransactions"" bandwagons but it doesn't matter because tens of thousands eat that shit up."

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Twwh3 launched in a rough state but has been slowly getting better. They screwed up with bad patches and a shit dlc last year, but since then they have been patching a lot of the problems, and now they are making the dlc better.

Ever since IE launch (except for the massive dip in everything around the last dlc) it has been slowly improving. Ignoring that single period with the shit dlc and patches, I feel twwh3 is better than twwh2 since the release of the chaos dwarf dlc. If you havent played it after the chaos dwarf dlc release date, I really recommend you give it another chance.

Also the big map (Immortal empire or IE) is now free for everyone who owns twwh3 without needing to own 1 or 2. So no reason to play the shit map the game launched with

Also skaven play and feel the same as in twwh2 imo, definitely worth trying. Especially clan Eshin, who are now placed in Cathay, which is a new part of the map in twwh3"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I was the opposite.  Wasn't a big fan of WH2 and playing it just made me want to play Empire (the game, not the faction).  I finally grabbed WH3 when it went on sale recently and I'm enjoying it way more than WH2.  Even playing some of the older factions, they feel way better for me in WH3 than WH2."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Much like a lot of Total War game, they start off in a poor state and, more often then not, end up in a great place. TW3 is getting there."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Shogun 2 is probably the best “classic” experience for new players but normally I’d say pick the historical setting you are the most interested in.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"It is quite different and those are great games, but I have grown to enjoy the warhammer games too- the I think it actually fits well with the mechanics of the total war series. I do hope they have a full-fledged historical title again next though."

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"What he's saying is, unlike mobile games or games with microtransactions which allow ""whales"" (where the term is most commonly used) to put in 4000x the money a casual user would spend into a game, there's a very defined spending ceiling in Total War. 

Even if they jacked up the prices 4x to 100$ per dlc, only a small subset of whales would buy it, and they'd only need to buy it once. Sure their ""vote"" counts for 4 players, but they can't nor need to buy the dlc ad infinum."

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Because not everyone is a victim but many sure like pretending to be one.

My last few conversations where basically this exact issue. Idiots (with the overall support of the community it seems) complaining about ""predatory business"" and ""victim blaming"" but none of it applies to them.

I'm not against people criticizing games. I personally don't go near anything with exploitative in-game hooks and completely agree that they are addictive BUT if you have all the consumer rights you need and aren't exposed to anything really nefarious...you are not a victim! 

It is getting ridiculous.

There is addiction...and then there is a lack of personal responsibility, a refusal to acknowledge simple truths like ""X market behavior won't change if you keep buying X product"" and naive expectations that businesses should have absurd ethical obligations than people can't even hold themselves to, like they need to be mothered.

The vast majority of us (myself included) are not the addicts, we aren't whales, we aren't victims..."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,Because it's a situation the victims put themselves in an can almost always get out of themselves if they actually wanted to.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Well, yeah.  We have come a long way from ads just being “hey I exist and here is where I am, come let us service you” to pulling out all the bells and whistles and practically lying to the consumer to get their purchase.

Advertisement has been a psychological war on the consumer and corporations are unfortunately winning or already won."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Advertising is also regulated. A lot of this stuff isn't. 
And the companies will keep pushing the limit until someone stops them (e.g. loot boxes being banned in some countries because they are gambling)."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"It obviously wasn't intended as a threat, the company probably never thinks about 3k, but from a fan perspective it's a pretty easy read.  ""We're going to increase DLC price by 250% and if that doesn't sell we kill the game"" is a pretty reasonable interpretation from someone who's mad about 3k and mad about WH3."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Well, agree to disagree. We made them back down on their word and all's good. I won't argue on semantics as it seems we agree on what matters but not on the definiton of the word ""threaten"", which, who cares."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"It's community interpretation, not my opinion. I just answer the comment above.

I agree with you about the game price, I'm kind of neutral about the whole thing."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"It’s contextual for the Total War fanbase

CA has a reputation for just dropping games that don’t make them money, the main one here is 3K that they dropped shortly after release because of backlash from predatory DLC reception."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I'd agree it's not a threat per se, but it was incredibly tone deaf. Scuttling their 3K game due to poor dlc performance (largely CA's own fault) and warning players the same could happen to TW:W struck the player base as ""buy our mediocre, buggy, content-lite, overpriced dlc or no more game for you""."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-10,"Warhammer Total War DLCs have notoriously been a major cash cow for CA. It was their most profitable franchise, so them alluding they might shut it down because people were upset really felt like they were trying to go for emotionnal blackmail rather than put a real commercial argument.

Also, you are underselling it a lot by calling this a simple price hike to adjust to inflation. They went from 10€ for 2 sub-factions to 25€ for 3, and the 3 had less content than usual. Also these DLCs used to come with a Free DLC subfaction, but that wasn't the case this time. 

It wasn't a rational increase of price, it was a completely deliberate attempt to try and milk as much money as possible from their most profitable playerbase in order to make up for the incoming losses of Pharaoh and Hyena."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-10,"Prices going up with inflation is one thing. The chaos dwarf dlc went up $5 dollars ($30>$35) over previous race packs. And whilst there was some murmers, the community also pointed out that an extra $5 was about the inflation rate. But this was a 250% increase for no extra value."

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"I spent about £300 on models, probably £100 on paints etc.

However, the amount of hours I commit to the hobby, probably 2 hours a night painting on average (about 40 hrs a month) plus 5 hours playing every other weekend.

So about 50 hrs a month, 600 hrs a year.

I've been playing this army for a year, and am now dropping another £300 on a new army.

So that puts me on about 60p per hour. Which makes it a very very cheap hobby in my opinion."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,a friend of mine has a 3d printer so he downloads bootleg schematics and just 3d prints all of the models he wants for a fraction of the price :P

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Books, videogames like Total War, Boltgun, Darktide, Vermintide, possibly the upcoming Space Marine 2.

Alternatively, Warhammer Underworlds is a hybrid board game/card game/miniature game that only uses a handful of minis per team. Kill team is closer to WH 40K table top, but fewer models, smaller boards, faster games. Separate rules as well. Both of these require some assembling and painting, but fewer models makes it more managable.

In between those and full scale armies and such, you got combat patrol, which is 40K, but from single boxes per army. Alledgedly balanced, and simpler rules."

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Read some books.  Absolutely the best, cheapest way.  I recommend starting with the Space Wolf trilogy (Space Wolf Omnibus 1), and then go straight to the Horus Heresy series (Horus Rising, False Gods, Galaxy in Flames).  That’ll give you what you need to understand the universe."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Bloodbowl is a striped version of warhammer and adds a ball. You're allowed to attack other players, stomp them into the ground, it's quite fun. The engines were so so but it should be very cheap

This total war game is actually based on an older Warhammer fantasy timeline that the publishers abandoned long ago - they rebooted fantasy into an Age of Sigmar that changed everything

The fans also prefer Warhammer 40k, the fantasy stuff is very 80s. 

If you want to read, Gotrek & Felix: The First Omnibus is what I recommend"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"To add to the other replies, you should also note the difference between Warhammer Fantasy (WHF) and Warhammer 40k (WH40k). They are similar in many ways, but WHF has a much more traditional foundation in fantasy tropes.  WH40k, while not free of sci-fi tropes or borrowed archetypes, manages to set itself off as something unique.

Wiki reading for general background is free and a good place to start.  The Black Library pushes out novels constantly, but they tend to be limited prints which means they're expensive and hard to get in physical editions.  A few of the Omnibuses are widely accepted enough to be readily available.  *Eisenhorn* and *The Founding,* both by Dan Abnett, give a glimpse, respectively, into the world of an Inquisitor and a company of the Imperial Guard. 

Game-wise, Darktide and Vermintide give perfect slices of the Warhammer ambiance, however they are a very specific type of game that won't appeal to everyone.  The recently released Rogue Trader CRPG is also a good choice for building a general foundation of understanding.  Mechanicus is another decent game that puts you in the world of the Omnisiah and the Tech-priests.  

And naturally, youtube has lots of options for people explaining lore or compile edits of cinematics done for games/media over the years.  The Astartes Project is often cited as a major lure to people WH-curious.

To sum up, there's not a ""correct"" place to start, but lots of different paths that show little pieces of a very big universe."

Warhammer is played on a specialist gaming table - stores and tournaments provide use of these for free. But require you to use their models, the price of the models includes access to the specialist gaming venue.

1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Alright, but you're sort of inherently exaggerating by using the single biggest, most expensive models and then on top hedging with ""depending on where your nearest GW is"" - so it's always going to be technically correct for *somebody*.

An entire army of titans made by somebody living in Alaska just isn't a normal use case.

The typical Warhammer player would want to print like 30 marines and a couple tanks."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,And not only that-- the resulting models are very fragile unless you severely limit which models you choose to print. Anything with spindly bits like raised swords or spears or even guns will be quite fragile.

They can only milk warhammer so long, they already seem to be struggling to maintain their current level of revenue so they increased dlc price.

I learned to play Magic with hand-drawn cards on notebook paper that we cut out using a teacher's paper cutter in 8th grade. Still play Magic. Never bought a fucking card in my life.

It would cost about $0.10 to print. One model just paid $49.90 into your printer. Regular Space Marines are $7.50 each, still cost 10c to print. At $7.40 savings per Marine, you've saved over $200 for 30 of them. By the time you've printed an army, the printer has been paid off and then some.

TW games have every major interesting era covered, if you want to make a name for yourself, you gotta do something different.

I think they really tried to reach out to a larger audience and made the mechanics simpler to do so.  I wish they would take all the QOL stuff from the newer TW games (rearranging unit cards on the fly, better troop movement, etc) and make something like Medieval 3 using the better economy, growth, diplomacy, spies, priests, and unit health/armor systems from the older games (and please bring back the speeches your generals made - a pious but crazy general speech was glorious)"
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"My problem with newer TW is the lack of replayability for me... I know many like the game for the battles, and yes the varity of units and ''heroes'' is a bit fun.

But what made me play hours upon hours of Rome and Empire total war, was that each nation had difference in borders and challenges. I could play as an expanding Rome, an declining Selecuids or ''barbarians'' just making their own homes. I could play an economic focused Ottoman empire, not expanding just developing. Or an expansive Austria, taking the ports of the Ottomans to access trading ports.

Now I did absolutely adore Shogun 2, however I didn't feel any need to play a varity of factions. They were so similar, 1 (2 sometimes) province, 1 stack of rebels. Expansion into similar sized neighbours. And then an midgame with just an natural progression which was pretty similar whatever place you started. And then an endgame which was better than the stale lategame in Rome. However it also just ruined the diplomacy in my eyes, after my first time I simply viewed everyone as enemies to be cut down to size and destroyed. In Rome i could pay off some pesky barbarians i didn't care to send an army to destroy or foster good relations while i expanded into richer land. But in Shogun 2, I rather just expand everywhere, as if i don't they will backstabb me anyway.

The newer game was more of this, the Empire in Warhammer starting as only the capital? :/
Why does the Western empire of Rome in Barbarian Invasion, feel more like an crumbling empire. Than the Empire in Warhammer which had to fight literal demons."
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Cities skylines is only published by paradox, not developed. A lot of the titles that paradox publishes are pretty bad. 

I think the critique still applies though, victoria 3 is a complete shit-show more than a year after release and imperator was canned due to low players. On the other side ck3 was an amazing foundation for the CK series and the subsequent content was good but rather sparce, but with the recent announcement it looks like the scale of content is growing.

Considering CK is probally the closest in form to a potential total-war esque then I would be optimistic for paradox to develop such a title. But that also means that it is definitely not going to happen, CK is already a great game and releasing another similar title wouldnt make any sense."

There was another show called Time Commanders from the BBC that also used the original Rome: Total War where people essentially just played the game while Historians commented on it and Richard Hammond hyped the whole thing up.  I think they brought it back in 2016 for one season using Rome 2.
1amkca4,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,The upside is that that means the games keep getting developed at a lower cost than a subscription. I like it that whenever I decide to play one of their games again there's new content. It's no fun if you start playing one of their games late though.

I totally understand the perspective. My money-draining hobbies are things like Pickleball where you literally have to have proper equipment to play because of reality. Yeah, I wear out a racket and have to get new shoes, etc.

That logic doesn't remotely apply to Warhammer. The pieces are just plastic bits that you ALREADY HAVE TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION to make matter whatsoever. Why would you pay hundreds, or thousands of dollars for the ""right"" to pretend your shitty plastic pieces were more special than anything else someone was imagining? 

If Warhammer people cared about the game itself they wouldn't care about the pieces. I don't think it is a serious game so much as a way to showcase idiotic consumerism. Chess doesn't have a proprietary flavor of plastic shit that you are required to play with. Poker doesn't require any special deck of cards that one company can mark up.

Edit: lol, dickhead wrote some stupid shit and blocked me. Real games have components that are required to play a game. A soccer ball for soccer, gloves and a bat and a baseball for baseball. Nobody needs some plastic shit to play Dungeons and Dragons warmode."

At least when speaking of single player, this could apply to a *lot* of games in the series.  Empire, for example, quickly led me to the conclusion that artillery won battles and that cavalry was a vastly better way to protect your artillery.  The AI, meanwhile, would field *some* artillery, but never really committed to the concept and so the game, more of then than not, was basically me using relatively small amounts of infantry backed by *lots* of artillery and cavalry and then deploying to favorable terrain.

Having the overwhelming advantage in guns meant the AI was essentially forced to try and silence them, and if the drag enough combat power to plausibly get through, their own guns would be vulnerable to *my* artillery.  Battles had a very copy paste feel to the point where I'd use only a few different strategies that were often as simple as hammering their artillery (and causing plenty of infantry and cavalry casualties along the way) until they began advancing, keeping their own cavalry busy with my own, and then simply timing a switch to grape to break what was almost always flagging morale.  And nowhere was this more apparent than in sieges where all of this was compounded by the game not allowing the enemy to make full use of their army.  Sure, the city defenders had more guns than I did, but the fraction they got to field *wouldn't*.  Meanwhile my own army had the advantage of prepared positions.

I enjoyed the game to an extent, but I also found a solution that worked with little modification in nearly all cases - hardly what you want in a strategy game."

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,I believe that the Supreme Commander series allows this.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Not exactly an RTS but Stellaris allows you to do this. It's real time but you don't coordinate specific units. Something closer that comes to mind is Total War: Warhammer. It's turn based on the overworld, but when you get into battles they are real time and you can pause it.  

Maybe not exactly what you are looking for but they might pique your interest."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Homeworld could do that iirc. Same with Deserts of Kharak. Not sure I'd call them chill, more like haunting. But otherwise Total War for sure. Its such a brilliant mechanic, I don't like playing games without it now.

Loads of builders like Oxygen Not Included let you do it. And pretty much any paradox game (NOT turn based, its real time but is grand strategy).

Great question, I'm always wanting more of these because I love the feature so much."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Maybe not exactly what you have in mind, but I really enjoy Door Kickers 2. I typically play it paused, create a plan for my squad, and then watch them get shredded and try again"

Ever play Starcraft? You know the indoor hangar maps? The whole games kinda like that, you control a team of 4-5 units as if it were a RTS but doing a map thats more of a traditional isometric ""dungeon""

Theres plenty of upgrades and management in the game, as well as a good use of tactical RTS commands with the ability to slow down or stop the action to give commands.

  
Aside from that theres a lot of good reccomendations in these comments."

You spend a lot of time thinking with no worry about conflict and can also pause the game to engage in your plan once you come up. It helps you make a plan with multiple characters and have them all act at once."

Try Regiment. Its a Microprose War Game RTS based on the cold war.

Next I'd say Terminator: Dark Fate.

I don't think the game we used to play can correlate well. Darkreign alone hasn't seen an equal, but stuff like WARSHIFT are things that couldn't have ever been done then.

What everyone here says is true, in todays gaming, Total War is amazing. Lets see how they do with the Star Wars one.

I saw a Stellaris Callout by u/ShadowRiku667. This game is amazing once you get past its complexities. Its my highest hour game on steam.

Edit: look into GoG.com. Games like Metal Fatigue, Earth 2150, NOX are on there and DRM free."

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"I think its still in early access but there's a roguelike RTS called Rogue Command that has the super slow down mechanic. No limit on how long you can do it but its not entirely paused. Game encourages you to use it liberally to micro but isn't necessary except maybe at the harder difficulties. It is a rogue like though so other than your catalogue of starters the units you unlock and various perks and upgrades are randomized. 1 run is 9 levels and at the end of each level you're offered 3 random units/buildings and a loot tree to decide whether you want unit upgrades, once a mission drops, perks. There's tons of different units/buildings. The starter list is a lot smaller and isn't meant to be your main force but is meant to heavily influence a given run overall.

Super fun smaller scale RTS, but the roguelike nature might not be for everyone."

It's absolutely inscrutable to start with as there's a lot going on but a normal game can take 10 hours.

It's pretty unique too as you're playing as the hopelessly outgunned humans against an overwhelmingly powerful AI that could crush you at any moment but doesn't feel the need to, unless you push it too far. It's all about building power up through precision strikes and guerilla warfare to steal better technology without pissing the AI off too much. At the same time the battles can get enormous as the AI will seek to reconquer lost territory.

All of your plans can be made while the game is paused and your units will adhere to their orders as soon as you resume. Most of the actual fighting is really just a case of positioning your ships and letting them duke it out. Most of the game is waiting while excitedly planning your next heist."

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Combat in Starsector is real time with pause, though outside of combat it's more comparable to Mount and Blade or Kenshi.  


You do have to consider logistics, and acquiring/outfitting new ships, officers, etc.  


You can control your flagship or let the AI handle it.  Not really a traditional RTS, but there's good overlap in the types of players it appeals to.  And you can order all commands while paused, so split second inputs only factor when controlling your flagship in combat, and in niche cases in the overworld.  "

DA:O especially plays well because the combat is real time ish but you're incentivized to pause a lot to think about what you want each party member to do, especially on the hardest difficulty.

Take a look at Mechabellum too. It's not an RTS but it shares a lot of the strategy elements of RTS games. It scratches the same itch for me that SC2 used to but without requiring the high APM micro skills I used to enjoy when I was younger and had more free time to practice."

As for the pausing aspect, all three have a Shadow mode that lets you plan out an attack/distraction with all of your units to act at the same time, it's a super fun RTS Stealth set of games that fits this wish super good imo, even more so because of how thematically varied they are, Shadow Tactics has very long levels set in feudal japan, while Shadow Gambit is the highest replaybility wise with a magical pirate theme, and Desperados has shorter levels but some incredible level design and is based in the wild west."

It's an RTS Rougelike where you command a spaceship through random encounters and combat. You direct crew around the ship to perform various tasks, such as manning the weapons or shields, fixing breaches or damaged systems, or even fighting off intruders.

You tell the ship where to fire, and tell your crew what to do aboard your ship. It's a *tough* and *unforgiving* game that will punish your mistakes. The key *is the pause mechanic*. At any moment, you can press spacebar and freeze the game. Assess all the problems on your ship, organize your crew, assign them to the highest priority problems, line up your weapons on the enemy's critical systems, etc.

I watched a bit of AbeClancy's FTL let's plays to get a feel for the game before buying. I was always wondering how he was missing critical moments, like a crewmate stuck in an oxygenless room, suffocating, about to die. Then I played the game. There is a *LOT* going on everywhere all the time. Pausing is *critical* to playing with any sort of effectiveness."

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"If you're looking for unit tactics instead of base building, I had a blast with Crying Suns. The premise was take something like FTL, but on a grander scale, command a whole armada instead of a single ship. In a very similar vein is Flotilla, controls are a bit more finicky but there's good RTS unit command on a tactical scale to be had there. Both that I mentioned are real-time with pause with some roguelike/roguelite elements baked in.

I also just started playing Escape from the Mad Empire after a Reddit ad pointed me towards it, currently unreleased but there is a demo on Steam before they hit early access. Enjoyable Beta-quality release so far."

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Not technically an RTS, but Phantom Brigade is a cool semi turn based game. It's a game about liberating your country by having big mech fights. It's turn based sort of. You plan out your turn, and then it plays out in real time. During your planning phase, you can see what the enemy intends to do out to around 6 seconds. So you can plan to have a mech with a shield charge an enemy, knowing when and where to hold up the shield to block damage. Or an enemy missile barrage is on its way, and you can plan to have your mech boost dash at the last second to dodge as many missiles as possible. After every battle, you have a budget to scavenge parts from enemy mechs before the rest of the enemy forces catch up and run you out. So if you just fought a tough enemy with a cool gun, you can salvage it and use it yourself.

It has a ton of customization options to specialize your mechs and make them look however you want. Want a heavy armored mech with a giant laser, laying down damage from long range and tanking hits without moving much? Go for it. Want a super lightweight speedy boy with a sword and shield that bum rushes the enemy back line? Absolutely. From giant lasers to snipers to swords to shotguns to missiles and rockets, so many options to play and strategize however you want."

There's no basebuilding. 

The player does have to manage and equip a highly dynamic strike force across a bunch of different missions & objectives. Units, equipment, damage, ammo levels, and fuel are persistent. 

Salvaging disabled and abandoned vehicles, and dropped weapons for infantry crews, are a huge part of the game's economy and army management.

Constant vigilance around your base is a necessity as often losing one building can end an entire run.  It's also built with the idea that if you need to do any building you can pause to make sure your base is built correctly since locations do matter for future upgrades. 

The game has a story/campaign mode that's a bit lackluster, but the replayability mostly comes from randomly generated maps and various levels of increasing difficult conditions (adjust the number of zombies you have to go through from like 60% of normal amount to 500%, adjust days before final wave comes from 80 to like 120 I think, some maps have harder times with resources/more noise generation to attract zombies/etc)

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Sudden Strike 4


It's a World War 2 RTS, you can pause any time during the game, and even give your units orders while paused.


You can play as the Allies and Axis across different battles. A unique feature is you can choose between three doctrines before a battle that changes what units you get and their abilities. 


It's on Xbox Game Pass Core if anyone is interested. "

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Mechabellum! 

You dont control the units. You just buy them and place them. Then round after round the armies clash over and over as you slowly try to adjust your unit selection and placements to hit what you want to be hitting and block what you want to be blocking. 

The game does a great job presenting counters and tricks that let you adjust on the fly. Do you spend on upgrades to improve existing stuff? Do you shell out for large units? Where do you put that long ranged heavy sniper in order to hit those tanks that are a problem? There's a chance this turn to do a napalm strike, if your opponent takes it do you raise shields to block the fire? How is your AA, do you need more in case the enemy deploys a tonne of air units?"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,Rougue command. I really hope you see this because im telling you that game us EXACTLY what you're looking for
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Companies of Heroes 3.

Don't let the old reviews fool you. COH 3 is an amazing game in it's current state. One I really recommend buying."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Have a look at Phantom Brigade. The whole premise is that you get to glimpse a few seconds into the future and while paused you execute a set of orders for your troops, you then get to tweak their moves where they aim and all these things while the game is paused. Then you hit go, and it plays out the next few seconds. 

It's incredibly cool, and it allows you to view the action unfold in real time while you micro while paused."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,They are billions is a great pausable RTS where you build and defend a base from a giant mass of zombies

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"In Halo Wars 2, YAPYAP has a leader power called Please Don't Shoot Me that stops all attacks for a good few seconds for everyone. No units can fire, no turrets can fire, and nobody can activate leader powers in that time, but you can still order units around. It's not exactly a pause button, especially considering it's an ability with a cooldown, but I just wanted to bring it up because it's silly to just ""pause"" a multiplayer game."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"If you Like Star Wars, then Empire at War is a great game, can run on most potatoes, and has a super active modding community! :D and it has a pause button at most stages, including ground combat, space combat, and galactic map levels."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,I spend alot of time paused in crusader kings and stellaris. I basically run them at max speed and spend like 70% of my play time paused queuing things up.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-26,I’d say definitely do not get They Are Billions. Some people like it but if you even blink it will wipe your progress and you have to start over from scratch. Might be a good game but the polar opposite of what you wanted.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-26,"I just saw you updated post and the games you listed there.  Wow, there are some games there I've not seen in a long time.  Myth and Myth 2 were great games.  Crying Suns wasn't a bad game - I played that a couple years ago.  The Civilization games started out as grid-based, but evolved into Hex-based in Civ V.  Note, I've read the latest offering (Civ VII) is a bit mediocre - it's not bad but it's not enough of an upgrade over Civ VI).

I have a few other suggestions that I thought of now too:

Age of Wonders series.  Civ-like games but with more interactive battles, but are overall more turn-based, not real-time.  
A similar game is the Endless Legends.  Played it a tiny bit, and it reminded me a lot of Age of Wonders and Civilization.  Turn-based.

Part of the Endless series is Dungeon of the Endless.  It is a bit of a a cross between an RTS, Tower Defense, and Dungeon Crawler.  Low-end pixel graphics for the first one.  The Sequel (Endless Dungeon) has much better graphics although I've not played it yet so don't know how the gameplay compares to the first one."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,The Command and Conquer games were like that.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Fire Emblem, Valkyria Chronicles, XCOM series. Not RTS but rather turn based, but they're all amazing games and mostly similar in how they work."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Am I stating the obvious by saying it sounds like you prefer a turn based game? 


If you need to pause the game to assess the situation then you don't actually like Real Time"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,FTL works this way.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,Dragon age!
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Not here to police your life but the only way to stop being overwhelmed by a stimulus is to expose yourself to it. I remember when I started to play ranked in league of legends the music would start playing giving it a serious atmosphere, i might be not have gotten the time I wanted so people might get mad at me if i fail, and I could go on and on. I would sweat, palms moist, hand shaking. It just gets easier over time. Even when there used to be third party tournaments with prizes of in game currency those symptoms appeared again but you get used to that feeling and you just work through it. 


Just chose that game that you are wishing you were able to play and stick with it. You'll be proud of yourself when you eventually surpass your expectations "
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,I would pay lots of money for napoleon's gameplay with empire's campaign map and trade.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Empire was peak. I wish they would remake that one, loved the world map."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,Shogun 2 is also great.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"If you are into Warhammer Fantasy, this is probably the best option for a video game. Expensive if you want to play all of the factions, but if you want to live out your short king dawi dreams, it’s a really great buy."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Second Total War, im big into Total War 2 myself. Ive liked each one in their own way, but vanilla TW2 is the warm TW hug i return to."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"This is it OP, though I prefer Rome. 

Rome: Total War on my iPad is basically all I do on planes these days"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"I vouch for og Rome and Shogun and Shogun 2. Man I love running back Rome 1, so nostalgic and my dumb brain loves seeing infantry just get flattened by Roman calvary charge 🤣"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,FOTS imo is the best of the gunpowder ones gameplay wise but the vibe is a bit different. It’s for sure my favorite total war game. Japan being so linear also lends itself really well to total war’s… questionable campaign ai though
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Both very good, I enjoy the three kingdoms one personally as well. Especially on romance mode to make legendary characters cool and very strong"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,OG rome is my go to.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Yeah, I'm tired of FTL. But you are very correct about this."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"I thought everyone playing this game was a genius. 

After about 15 hours, I figured out you could issue commands some paused. 

Turns out I was just an idiot haha"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"I tried a no pause run recently, it went as well as one would expect lol"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"It's an excellent game, but I'm not sure it's chill since you can lose so easily if one or two guys sneak in.   I still think it's a great recommendation, though."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Yes! Excellent example, and a very fun game."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"The game had way too much micromanaging for me to enjoy, and with no mid level saves, the smallest failure would cost you hours of gameplay"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,Or Diplomacy Is Not An Option
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Such a great game. If not for the pause function, 99% of people could never win, including me"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,This so hard
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"100%.  When I think of a game built around the idea of pausing, this is what comes to mind.  It uses the pause feature so well."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-26,since ages on my steam wishlist but never more than 20% off sadly
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,You can also adjust it from 10x speed to 1/4th speed. The time controls are really granular.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"2nd this, I’m in a similar boat for needing to be able to pause and this game has been great"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"If you are also looking for something a bit cheaper, Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion goes on sale for 5-10 dollars a lot. The first game is still a solid recommendation imo, and the mod support is incredible as SOASE 2 gets its footing.

If you're going for performance however, sins 2 wins in that regard due to the 64 bit engine that can accommodate more system memory. It also has fancier graphics, gameplay wise sins 2 is close to rebellion with some improvements to mechanics and additional content."

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"How's 3 now? I played it shortly after launch, but it felt like the QoL was lower than TW: Warhammer 2 and I kinda bounced off of it.

But I'd played the heck out of TW: Warhammer 2.

(Though partly I started having children shortly before 3 rolled out, and TW is a massive time sink.)"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,Yup total war Warhammer 2 here. Only game my old ass can play these days.

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,Terra Invicta is kind of similar in some aspects.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"That is my thinking too.  
Alternative that is faithful to Total: A, is ""Zero-K""  
I asked the same question on their steam discussion boards, and apparently it has a pause function. So going to give it a try :D"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Yup, love setting up complex orders and positioning structures just right with pauses in singleplayer."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Oh wow I'd forgotten this game. I loved it, but hated playing it on my Xbox. Gotta go see if it's on steam now."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Just made a comment about Stellaris. I'd consider it closer to RTS than turn based, but I guess it's technically more of a 4x game"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"How isn't Stellaris not an RTS?

Granted, Stellaris is one of the few RTSes I like playing because it's slow and random enough that the game isn't about executing a build order as fast as possible, but it's still an RTS. I don't know what else it would be. Someone else said it's a X4, which is true, but a X4 can be real time or turn based."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Came here to say Homeworld, it was remastered recently I believe."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Deserts of Kharak is a pretty great game, good mention"

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"I prefer the real discount version of the game ""There's a Couple Dozen of Them."""
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,Great game
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,lol there is no such game
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,That game is ANYTHING but a chill experience. 
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Just finished this myself and I thought it was a lot of fun. I definitely needed the ""stop"" not ""slow"" option haha. It got intense at times."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Agree, that game is fucking awesome. Tense AF, but great atmosphere, gameplay, and voice acting."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"AH. Amazing game! Beating it was fun, so I second this recommendation."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,This and also planescape: torment
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"That's a good way to describe it.  I probably call it more RPG, but you do get to the point where you can build your own base and produce crops and goods. 

Takes a while to get that far but it's present."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"It's my favorite game right now. In fact the pause button is key to planning and building, which I love .  Also the use of 2x and 3x speed"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"I grew up on the old games, not limited to Total: A. I play Zero-K right now, it's a pretty decent remake with a ton more stuff. Controls can't easily be rebound however. Having pause on Space bar would be nice :/"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"I had no idea it was real time, I figured it was more like a Fire Emblem."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"I will heavily consider these.  
I remember playing the demo for Commandos and seeing Desperados eventually too. Might consider them.  
I'm a slow player, pause allows me to enjoy the games. AND i DO love me some good stelf ;)"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,That game rocks.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"I got a lot of the old games. Dark Reign 2 never hit the same as DR1. But as far as i remember, DR games didn't allow commanding units when you paused the game.  
That and now it's outdated.

Zero-K is kinda overwhelming with the amount of units - So i think i'll keep looking for a bit more simpler games. Everyone here has some fantastic suggestions and i'm having a hard time choosing :D  
My potato computer will be happy if i look for older titles rather than new ones :D  
But on the other hand, lots of even modern RTS games don't pull that hard on the GPU and CPU, as far as i have seen, unless poorly made."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,You could place buildings while pausing the game right? When I played the remaster demo I wasn't able to so I'll be kinda sad if they take it away when it launches.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,Seconded for rogue command
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"James, one of the active modders of AtS, made a mod for me that is possibly very out of date now, called it ""Queen's Delight"" something like that. Mostly a cheat mod. But it was quite fun playing this way :D"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"By extent, Owlcat Pathfinder games are also real time with pause."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,Seems like you missed the Dragon's Age series but yes.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"I made several mods for it :D  
So it's fair to say i know it fairly well \^\_\^"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"I know it fairly well. It hadn't even been out in EA for more then 2 hours when i got my hands on it :D  
Fascinating to watch int change and grow to what it is today."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Total:A and Zero-K and Supreme Commander and now BAR  
Well, at least i'm now spoiled for choice :D"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,XCom Apocalypse is a personal favourite
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,Dawn of War 2 doesn't have pause does it?
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,Love the Sudden Strike series! The pause feature is really essential and it's so satisfying seeing your whole army move into positions after unpausing.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Fun how a simple game mechanic can bring people together, eh?"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"BY SIGMAR, YES!"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,Fantastic game
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"You got that backwards, mate \^\_\^  
Supreme command is the spiritual succor **to** Total Annihilation.  
Total Annihilation came first :D"

I've gotten tired of FTL, and i managed to clear 6 missions in the game before i wanted to punch my screen. There is just something about Bomber crew beyond the feeling of a fast based experience that made me very angry. So i decided to just uninstall and move on. Cute damn game, sure, but i found it not very forgiving. Not my type of game."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"In warno you def can full out pause, I also recommend it it’s a blast"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"I don't think it ever needed it. I got MANY hours in this. Never stressed me like other RTS games. but then again, this does not feel like an RTS in the traditional concept."

As of writing, i'm at around 59 game titles people have suggested thus far... I'd say that's pretty substantial amount of RTS games."

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,Dude. Me too. Or even just a remaster of Empire at this point.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,Absolutely not. Get your ass back in Spain.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,What about fall of the samurai with empire’s map?
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,It's not exactly the same but DarthMod for Empire gave it alot of extra hours for me.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,Twas the first game I owned on steam.   Empire was definitely peak total war
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,my personal favorite

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,Oh yes Rome 2 is also excelent
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Which Total War 2? Medieval, Shogun, Rome, Warhammer?"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"I remember running og Rome on my potato in college!

Didn't they remaster it recently?"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Theres another that falls into a similar catagory, doorkickers!


Its very short missions, like 10minutes tops, but theres a mission generator which can make some pretty large maps.


Also has a pause feature, as well as a sightline feature "
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"If you like FTL you'll love Convoy, it's more of the same but has a fresh eye enough take on the formula to be interesting, strongly reccomend https://store.steampowered.com/app/318230/Convoy/"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Do you know about FTL: Multiverse? It's a mod for FTL, that's basically the sequel to FTL we never got. Highly recommended. It's essentially a total conversion mod, and is set after the events of FTL. Changes include hundreds of new weapons, some new species, new sectors, tons of new events, over 100 new ships, as well as many QOL changes, such as being able to control crew drones as well as mind controlled enemy crew, the ability to toggle your toggle weapons/drones mid fight, the ability to tell your crew specifically which tile to stand on instead of which room etc...

Its really one hell of a mod. Highly recommended."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,Shortest Trip to Earth is very similar as well.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,Ah wish I'd seen this comment first. Wrote a bigass comment about FTL. Oops lol.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Give Nexus The Jupiter Incident a try.

It's not quite a traditional RTS but is an excellent strategy game and I'm pretty sure you can pause to issue orders.

As it is about capital ship combat it is inherently on the slower side."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,Planetary annihilation is pretty fun for space rts

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,There are a lot nowadays. That has started to blossom into a full on genre almost. A lot of card builder sub-varieties but some other’s like it.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"If you like ftl and strategy you have to check out rogue command

You can pause at any time"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"If you haven't tried it yet, Into The Breach. I think it's free if you have a Netflix subscription. No real time component, but so much strategy you might sit for 30 minutes just planning your next move."

Modding scene is pretty healthy, too."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Honestly I'm not the guy to ask, just got into it and haven't played the last two. 


It seems pretty impressive tho. Even if the dlc policy is predatory as fuck"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Warhammer 3, Immortal campaign is what the last 2 games have built up to.

If you enjoyed 2, I see no reason why you would not enjoy 3rd one. 

The only good thing about 2, was there was more detail in the Legendary lord campaigns. I still enjoy Immortal Empires campaign more. Starting positions are better, and more variety in Lords, races, better updates, and balance."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"The only game mode I will ever play is WH3 immortal empires. It is digital crack, and I'm pretty sure they made it free for everyone..... So reinstall it! No harm can come from giving it a shot."

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Do it. Supreme Commander is a gem of an RTS, and the Forged Alliance expansion is a worthwhile followup.

Stay away from Supreme Commander 2 though. It's a significant and inexplicable downgrade."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"I first read that as ""Total A"", which would be a short form of Total Annihilation.  TA is overlooked for its ground-breaking RTS combat, including the orders-on-pause feature."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Also you can slow/speed up Zero-K in increments of 10%, press - /+ on your keyboard.
Also uniquely to ZK units have some ability to micro themselves when you use attack move"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,Economy is turn based. Unit movement is not.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Probably falls more outside RTS category just because you don't have much in the way of individual units controls, abilities, etc. I'd say combat is a smaller experience in Stellaris than in most traditional RTS games, because it goes for scale. Sins 2 is probably better for space RTS gameplay."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Economy only ticks at the beginning of each month. Compare it to CK2, where the smallest unit of time is a day, and your treasury/prestige/peity updates continuously, every day."

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"It does give that Fire Emblem energy, except it's in RTS form, complete with your troops growing as they get through the campaign. Unlike Fire Emblem, there's no RNG to worry about with unit growth.

The closest thing the game has to a PvP Skirmish mode is the Coliseum's online mode, where you can pit individual squads against other squad builds, which you can use as inspiration for your own squads for use in the campaign, and they can get rather degenerate once you have all the pieces."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Big +1 to desperados and shadow tactics. All the games by Mimimi are fantastic! It's very satisfying when you hit *go* from the pause / planning screen and fire off a multi-character combo kill.

You might also like Satellite Reign, which has stealth mechanics."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Highly recommend desperados 3, phenomenal game!!"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"If you're considering desperado I'd maybe look at wasteland series aswell, wasteland 3 is very good"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Oh I missed the part about also commanding troops while paused. No you can’t do that. I don’t play RTSs but I played the absolute dogshit out of Crusader so I assumed because of OP that pausing wasn’t a common feature

So yeah OP if you’re reading this you can’t pause and command troops but you can slow the game down a lot to have more time to think"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Added it to my wishlist off the recommendations, and though it's more of an auto battler, if you're an old SC2 junkie like me, check out Mechabellum, refund it if you don't like it 🤷🏼‍♂️"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,I don't think Owlcat's games let you queue up orders. Pillars of Eternity does (although it isn't very well explained).
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,No no I played that
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Ok hell yeah, when you said RTS games you can pause it was the first thing that came to mind."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"It does, you can bizarrely press the pausa/break on your computer keyboard and it will cause the game, orders still assignable, IIRC. But you can definitely pause it with that button, yeah."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"MIndustry has a little more Tower defense and simpler factory management, where is Factorio has far more complex automation


Both are fun games though."

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Steam says my Factorio has 23k hours.  I leave the game paused when I'm not playing, and Steam counts it all.  I know my longest Space Exploration run was about 1000 hours and I'm confident I've done at least 6-10 times that total."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"I’m biased, I’m a huge franchise fan and relic games in general. This game is the easiest to pick up whether an old fan or new entry. Controls are easy, great QOL added from previous titles, and the anniversary update is about to drop with a bunch of new content!"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,You missed it because they weren't like that. At all.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"My heart beats, and I know its words. They are the same words, repeating evermore.

Empire 2 when? Empire 2 when? Empire 2 when?"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Empire still plays pretty well, I don’t think it needs a remaster, it needs a sequel to improve and expand on some features"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,It sounds like what you're saying is I should reinstall empire and make britannia rule the waves once again.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,It's fantastic. I could not recommend enough.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,Yeah having to drag an army back across your entire empire to replenish in southern france sucks

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"TW dlc isn't THAT bad. Not if you've ever played a paradox game. The price going up recently sucks, but they all feel pretty optional.
 
They generally roll out the QoL features for everyone when a new DLC drops. Unlike Paradox where you need to buy every DLC to get the QoL features included. And the enemy armies DO get the new units - which is nice.

It's basically always silly to buy every DLC because unless you're retired, you don't have time to play long campaigns for every faction.

Unless things have changed in the past couple years at least."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Thr DLCs add great value, but are not needed at all to get lots of value out of the game. The latest model of DLCs that release 3 indivual lords, that are packaged at a discount I'd pretty good imo.

Some are definitely better than others. But, the base lords are great. I recommend not to get any DLCs until you have a firm grasp of the playstyle you enjoy most."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,Except for the aforementioned time sink when I have two small children. :p

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,I actually own 3 and don't quite prefer it as much. But it's been a year since I played maybe I should check out the dlcs.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,It does have pause and honestly feels a little more polished than Zero-K. They're both great games but my friends stick to BAR due to it feeling a little more polished. I like zero-k for the terrain editing midgame and the absolutely bonkers super weapons.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"+1 for Beyond all Reason, it's a great game!"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-24,"Supreme Commander 2 ran better, had better graphics and was far more optimized, but the game play was definitely a step backwards.  It was still okay, but definitely not the quality of the first game."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Eh. I would say you really don't have more control in combat in most RTSes than you do in Stellaris. Granted, the last time I really played an RTS was Warcraft 2, so maybe things have changed.

But, in an RTS, you select a unit (or units), tell them to move to an area, or attack a target. When their target dies, they often start attacking the next nearest target. Oftentimes, you are selecting entire groups of units.

Ultimately, Stellaris does the same thing. You could control ships on an individual basis, but the game makes it easy to group them up.

I'm not really seeing a difference, other than scale. Neither allow the kind of individual control a tactical game would demand."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,The graphics blew my mind in 1999. I was 20.

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"I really enjoyed SupCom2, mainly because you're eventually forced to make a move if you base build"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"The difference for me is in the degree of control. When the battle starts, you lose control of singular units. Let's imagine the scenario, I'm attacking with the mixed army of swarm-type units and heavy long-range artillery vs single heavy unit and some flyswatter-type support (some kind of AoE) somewhere nearby.

In typical RTS, I could just recall and reposition my swarm if I would encounter flyswatters, allowing my long-range artillery to make a fork for my opponent between chasing my swarm, but being exposed to the artillery, or to surrender a heavy unit. In Stellaris you can't really do that, if your swarm fleet decides to fly into the zap cloud-well, only thing you can possibly do is to command a retreat. You can control the behaviour with the ship AI upgrades, but those changes are made before the combat, not during it.

Only thing that I could micromanage in Stellaris is to move my short-ranged fleet closer to the direction of arrival of the enemy fleet, so when the fight starts, I could have an advantage in range, but it's still a much smaller degree of control. 

I might also be wrong, because I never watched high-level Stellaris gameplay, and I'm a decent-at-best Stellaris player, so if I'm wrong about Stellaris-please correct me."
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,Once you lose control of your units the second they enter combat I consider it less of an RTS than most. In Warcraft 2 I could move units to gain a tactical advantage or micro to hit targets I want. Stellaris is more about grand strategy when it comes to combat.
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Well tomorrow that remaster celebrates its tenth birthday. <grin>

Yeah, I wasn’t 20, but I wasn’t under 15 either in 1999. I thought the remaster was gonna be five years ago when I went to look it up."

1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"It requires all three, vamps + tomb kings + pirates, but it’s a complete overhaul that lets you basically play all three factions at once. Such is the power"
1ixehw5,2025-02-24,2025-02-25,"Crusades and Jihads were so broken in that game. If you could succeed in the first crusade it was so easy to just abuse the mechanic for tons of money and general traits by requesting new ones every chance you had. Of course you needed to keep your papal approval up, but that wasn’t too hard.

As a Muslim nation it was even easier. I think you just needed an imam with a high enough piety and you could declare a jihad basically anywhere and do the same"

**Game** | **Score** | **% Liked** | **-** |**Notes**|**Verdict**
 |  | | |
**Terraria** | **167** | 84.7% | (+204/-37) | A very enjoyable castlevania/metroid-esque game that is only really similar to Minecraft in it's building/destroying mechanic.  | **Must Buy**
**Star Wars KOTOR** | **102** | 83.6% | (+127/-25) |  Although it is somewhat outdated, KOTOR is an incredibly well-written RPG with very fun and very long gameplay.   | **Must Buy**
**Sequence** | **63** | 97.0% | (+65/-2) | A very fun DDR/Stepmania RPG with great music (by Ronald Jenkees), enjoyable gameplay, and humorous dialogue.  | **Must Buy**
**Solar 2** | **24** | 100% | (+24/-0) | Relatively short (about 2 hours), but very enjoyable physics-based sandbox game in which you can grow your universe with planets and engage in large-scale space battles.  | **Probably worth it**
**Prince of Persia series** | **22** | 100% | (+22/-0) |  A very fun action/puzzle platformer. ""Sands of Time"" and ""Forgotten Sands"" are the best of the series. | **Probably worth it for Sands of Time**
**Cities in Motion** | **22** | 92.3% | (+24/-2) | An enjoyable city simulation game that focuses primarily on the transportation management aspect. Relatively challenging and very well polished.  | **Probably worth it**
**COD Black Ops** | **13** | 76.0% | (+19/-6) | Has a relatively engaging singleplayer storyline, and a very fun multiplayer that focuses a little more on pure gun combat than the Modern Warfare series. However, it's still relatively expensive for a sale price. | **Probably worth it if you enjoyed other COD games**
**Star Wars Republic Commando** | **12** | 83.3% | (+15/-3) |  A very fun FPS in the Star Wars universe, although the game is somewhat repetitive. | **Possibly worth it**
**Star Wars Jedi Knight Series** | **5** | 100% | (+5/-0) |  A great combination of puzzle and action gameplay set in the Star Wars universe. | **Possibly worth it**
**FEAR I and II** | **3** | 100% | (+3/-0) | Relatively enjoyable and very engaging horror genre FPS games.| **Possibly worth it for Horror fans**
**FEAR 3** | **-4** | 25% | (+2/-6) | A standard arcade shooter with a poor story that fails at being a horror genre game. However, the multiplayer is quite enjoyable.  | **Skippable**
**Disciples III**| **-5** | 0% | (+0/-5) | Similar to ""Heroes of Might & Magic"" and ""King's Bounty"", but the game is plagued with bugs, has a poor combat system, and has a shallow plot/campaign. | **Not worth it**
**Stronghold 3** | **-34** | 0% | (+0/-34) | Horribly broken game with uninspired maps and unbalanced and somewhat unenjoyable gameplay.  | **Not worth it**

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Knights of the Old Republic is a steal at that price, so is Terraria."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Here's my insight for day 9, (as usual, feel free to leave any comments on the deals) 

**[The Dawn of War Series](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/DawnOfWar)** are some of the most chaotic and brutal RTS games ever made. Missiles fly over the screen, dreadnoughts impale the infidels, and the Unclean One spews his unholy vomit on all who oppose him. This RTS franchise  is constantly action packed and is the most aggressive RTS I've played. My personal pick of the bunch is Dawn of War II: Retribution, which has the streamlined chaotic nature of Dawn of War II, but with the most content and no GFWL. I would definitely check out Retribution (nobody plays the original Dawn of War II or Cahos Rising, only Retribution) and maybe the original Dawn of War collection (only get Gold and Dark Crusade, Soulstorm is rubbish) if you're looking for an action packed RTS. Remember, there is only war! 

**[The Gothic Franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/Gothic)** is a series of hardcore European RPGs. Being a hardcore European RPG, the UI isn't very friendly, and some of the mechanics are clunky. The first two games were particularly good, but the quality of the series sharply drops from there, and from there onwards, it's not worth bothering with. If yo're desperate for an RPG that you can get into, check out the first two Gothic games, but ignore the later ones. 

**[Cities in Motion](http://store.steampowered.com/app/73010/)** appears to be a Simcity ripoff at first glance. However, while Simcity focused on managing an entire city, Cities in Motion focuses purely on mass transit and traffic. While this may sound tedious, the developers did make the game mechanics fairly enjoyable, if repetitive. Check it out if you've been dying for a Simcity esque experience of some sort. 

**[The Prince of Persia franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/Holiday2011_PrinceofPersia)** is a set of action platformers with a focus on fluid and challenging platforming. The best elements of the series are the the acrobatics sections that test your agility and platforming skills. The best comparison would the the platforming of the Assassin's Creed series, and if you enjoyed that, you'll enjoy the Prince of Persia games. That being said, the Sands of Time trilogy is the best of the series, as the other games don't quite live up to them. 

**[Call of Duty Black Ops](http://store.steampowered.com/app/42700/)** is yet another FPS in the undying Call of Duty series. Unlike the modern warfare games, I actually quite enjoyed this one, as it has a quirky sense of humor. Black Ops is a fairly solid game,but it's way too overhyped, and I don't really support the business model, but the gameplay is solid. If you want a mindless shooter to lose yourself in for a few hours, there's not too much harm that Black Ops could cause. I'd recommend it, but if you haven't particularly cared for the Call of Duty series, this isn't going to make you a crusader for the cause. Overall, Treyarch did a solid job in developing this game, and I've enjoyed it a lot. If you've grown tired of the series, there's going to be little here for you. But for newcomers and fans looking for more Call of Duty, it's a solid choice, and you could do a lot worse.  At the current price, I wouldn't recommend it, and the DLC isn't even discounted, so I'd pass this up, unless you really want it. A full review of Black Ops can be found on [my blog](http://thepcelitist.blogspot.com/2011/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-review-solid-yet.html) as well. 

**[Terraria](http://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/)** is a Metroidvania style action platformer with building elements akin to Minecraft. While some might dismiss it as a 2D knockoff of Minecraft, it's much more than that. Terraria has a significantly larger focus on exploration, platforming, and combat than Minecraft, to the point where I'd consider them different genres. The building isn't as addictive as Minecraft, but the exploration and the loot will suck you into its charm. 

**[Sequence](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200910/)** is a rhythm based RPG by Iridium Studios. It's a very bizarre combination of Dance Dance Revolution's arrow matching mechanics, and a tactical RPG. There are three menus, defense, mana, and spells. You must constantly switch between these three menus to be successful in combat. The game has a great sense of humor, and the soundtrack by Ronald Jenkees is fantastic. Definitely worth the 1.25, the same price as a coffee at McDonald's, but so much better. 


**[Disciples 3](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/Disciples3)** is a great example of when you take a great franchise and ruin it. Initially, it looks to be a fairly competent stratetic RPG. However, it's not. There's bugs a plenty, combat is shallow, audio is lame, there's no online multiplayer (which the previous game had), a poor tutorial system, a lack of challenge, as well as general depth, and the campaign is sterile. Avoid this mess of a game, it's not worth your time. 

**[Stronghold 3](http://store.steampowered.com/app/47400/)** is also another result of when you shit on an established franchise. It's like Stronghold 1, but with the piss taken out of it. Ignoring the plentiful bugs and numerous crashes, Stronghold 3 still isn't very good. It's incredibly slow paced, to the point where a sloth would get impatient, the tutorial is very lackluster, and the combat is shallow. The only positive thing about this game is that the developers are patching it up frequently, so if it's actually decently playable now, I don't know. Definitely not worth your money at 3 dollars, let alone 33. 

**[The Star Wars Franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/StarWars)** is quite varied, actually. To be honest, all of these games are quite good. Republic Commando was a very solid strategic FPS with a heavy emphasis on squad tactics. Star Wars Battlefront 2 is a very fun team based shooter with 64 player servers. Knights of The Old Republic is a very solid RPG by Bioware. Empire at War is a very solid RTS, and Jedi Knight has very fun melee combat. If you're open to different genres and you love Star Wars to death, you really cannot go wrong with any of these games. 

I haven't tried out **[Solar 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/97000/)** yet, but it looks like an engaging sandbox shooter. From what I've read, you start off as an asteroid and you have to build yourself up by smashing into other asteroids. That asteroid then merges with your own. You do this all up until you become a planet, a star, then a neutron star, etc. It looks quite interesting, and for 2.50, there's not much risk in giving it a shot. There is a demo, which I will try out to get a better verdict. 
Creepybusguy said ""Solar 2, while simple, is a ton of fun. Going for the achievements makes it brutal at times. The soundtrack and humour of the game are what really make the game. A great game."" 

Finally, we have the **[F.E.A.R](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/holidaysale2011fear)** series, a set of horror-action FPS games. The horror is a lie. This series is as scary as a piece of wet cardboard (less so, in fact. Touching wet cardboard might make you wet). And as we've learned with Dead Space or Resident Evil 5, enemies aren't scary when you can blow their faces with shotguns. That being said, the shooting is immensely enjoyable, with the AI in F.E.A.R 1 among the best in any FPS game. F.E.A.R 3 (I refuse to call it F.3.A.R) also has very satisfying and visceral gunplay. The multiplayer in F.E.A.R 3 is a blast, with Fucking Run and Soul King being the standouts for me. I'd say that F.E.A.R 2 is the weakest link of the franchise, but it is still a solid game. Overall, if you get past the uninspired scares, you'll find some solid, if generic, shooters. Definitely worth a look for fans of FPS games.  
EDIT: If you just want F.E.A.R 3, it is 15 dollars at Green Man Gaming. Check out ltx's post for more information.

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I'm not sure where the regular guy is, but I'll take a shot as copy and paste. Edit:
[Here's a link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/nsgu8/steam_holiday_sale_day_9_useful/c3bl4zr) to someone who is not me and may know what they are doing. I just summarized yalls comments.

**Cities in Motion** is a lot of fun if you liked the transportation management aspect of Sim City 4. There is no City building outside of transportation networks. It can be quite challenging and the game does a great job at giving you objectives. If that type of game sounds appealing, it's easily worth $5, as it's a very polished game and does what it says it does very well. If you enjoy OpenTTD/Railroad Tycoon style games you should give it a look, its not quite as grand in scale, but it is good fun.

I definitely recommend **Sequence** if you're looking for a well-written game with fun gameplay to play every once in a while. The voice acting is spot on for the most part and the rhythm-game-esque combat is hectic and fun. The gameplay is basically Rockband: Unplugged (PSP) combined with Puzzle Quest. There are three ""lanes,"" one for incoming attacks (hit the arrow to block the damage), one for casting spells (deal damage/heal/other effects), and one for mana (used to cast spells). Each lane drops notes at a different speed: The Defense lane drops notes fairly regularly depending on the enemy, the Spell lane drops notes when you cast spells, and the Mana lane is almost always full (but there is no penalty for missing Mana notes). It's combined with some interesting RPG mechanics outside of battles. I 100%'d the game and got about 10 hours out of it. I liked the story too. 

I haven't played it, but Almost everyone here recommends **Terraria**. It's been described as minecraft in 2D, but Terraria focuses much more on combat than minecraft, and less on construction. The must have of today and easily worth the full price. Even if you lack the drive to do some of the really creative stuff, it's still just fun to craft the basics and kill the bosses. Based upon the good things that everyone here is saying, I'm definitely putting this at the top of my shopping cart.

**Prince of Persia** Sands of Time was great, Warrior Within was ok, enjoyed Two Thrones as well. Although the game is a bit hand-holdy for some of the puzzles, it's an enjoyable game for anyone who likes the action/puzzle combo. Am surprised there's not some sort of bundle. Not sure about Forgotten Sands.

I love the **stronghold series**, probably more than most fans. Stronghold and SH crusader were fantastic, I also thought SH2 was pretty good. Now Stronghold 3 has received some very negative press because it was buggy as fuck when it was released. It has much less content than other releases (War/Economy Campaign, free build, no single player skirmish, buggy multiplayer) as well as being buggy (it has been patched a few times to be fair, still could use more). I'd save your money and wait for it to be cheaper and more polished in a year.

**Call of Duty Black Ops** is similar to the other Cod games. Most people here have probably played it. Personally I think it's kinda repetitive of the others, but it adds some nice combat sequences and secret agent style gameplay to it that sets it apart from the other games. If you like CoD games, you may want to get this, but if you're looking for a game that sets itself apart from the others, I suggest you watch some youtube footage first to be sure you want it.

**Dawn of War / Warhammer** Gameplay is initially focused on capturing and holding strategic locations on the battlefield. These control points are captured by infantry squads and provide resources to construct additional units and buildings or unlock certain units in an army's tech tree. Battles are won either by holding a certain number of control points for a period of time or by destroying all of the opposing armies' HQ structures. Two primary resources exist: requisition and power. These resources are not harvested or otherwise gathered by the player's units. Instead, requisition is generated constantly by the army headquarters.

**Gothic** Is a fantasy RPG. You choose your player class and then set out on quests. The game places a special focus on the interactivity of the environment. For example, while anyone hunting wild animals can gather raw meat from them, this can be turned into grilled meat by making use of a stove or frying pan. Similarly, most of the activities other characters can be seen doing (playing musical instruments, stirring soup pots, urinating etc.) can be done by the main character as well (although with the exception of forging weapons these activities have little bearing on the game). People here seem to like the first and second ones but are shying away from the others. 

**Solar 2** In most games you see stars in the background, you shoot asteroids or you live on planets. But in Solar 2 you ARE these objects! You take on the role of God. Solar 2 is an open-world, sandbox game set in an infinite abstract universe. Play constructively: grow your system, nurture life on your planets and attack enemy life in huge space battles. Play destructively: crash into other objects and cause chaos, use your orbiting objects like wrecking balls, steal planets from other systems. Solar 2 is extremely short game (like 1-2 hours). But if you like physics games I'd say it's worth it.

**Star Wars** Its worth it. The Jedi Knight games are the most fun Star Wars games I've played. The lightsaber combat is almost perfect and it's really fun. This game is a must for any Star Wars fan. Developed by Bioware, SWKOTOR is similar to their other games such as mass effect. The alignment system tracks actions and speech—from simple word choices to major plot decisions—to determine whether the player's character aligns with the light or dark side of the Force. Generosity and altruism lead to the light side, while selfish or violent actions will lead the player's character to the dark side, which will alter the character's appearance, turning their eyes yellow and their skin pale. Combat is round-based; time is divided into discrete rounds, and combatants attack and react simultaneously. However, the number of actions a combatant may perform each round is limited. While each round's duration is a fixed short interval of real time, the player can configure the combat system to pause at specific events or at the end of each round.

**F.E.A.R.** (an initialism for First Encounter Assault Recon) is a psychological horror first-person shooter. You take on the role of a guy with extremely quick reflexes, a feature of the game where you can slow down time. You start out not knowing the story, so you get to learn along the way. The animations show a complete body, so you can see your feet and when you climb ropes you see your hands perform the relevant actions. The game has standard weapons for a FPS, and the standard style multiplayer as well with different game modes like deathmatch or CTF. If you're looking for something to scare you, then this game is for you. The entire point of the game is fear, with monsters jumping out of closets and getting right up in your face.

(Stay tuned as I edit this post, I'm just describing the games, feel free to leave a review)"

I could never get into minecraft, as I preferred the exploration to the building, but it wasn't really fleshed out enough in minecraft. Terraria was basically everything i wanted from minecraft, Taking what minecraft had and totally running with it in a new direction, calling it 2d minecraft is a disservice."

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I'm going to go against the r/gaming hivemind and put in my own two cents about Knights of the Old Republic. I picked the game up a while back for $5 and simply could NOT get into it at all. I've played a few hours into it at this point and couldn't bear it any longer. The game was certainly brave and novel at the time, but it hasn't aged well at all. It's very slow paced, very long winded, the story is dull, the graphics look blocky, many of the skills are broken, and the combat leaves quite a bit to be desired. 

For $2.50, you really aren't losing out too much if you just want to try it, but that could be much better spent on games that are funner that will hold your attention for longer, i.e. Braid, World of Goo, etc. I guess if you're a die hard Star Wars fan you could go for it, but if you're THAT die hard, chances are you've already played it.

TLDR Save $2.50 on KotOR and buy Braid instead."

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I'm a pretty big fan of the Warhammer: 40k PC series. I've bought every game since release minus Dark Crusade. Here are a few interesting points about them (I haven't played the first set of games in a long time, so I'm not 100% sure about them.)

-The games are different from other RTS games in which instead of individual units are managed, infantry squads are used to fight. Each squad/vehicle can be upgraded with various weapon/armour upgrades depending on the tier of your command center. When one unit dies, the whole squad's effectiveness is reduced and you must retreat back to a relay point, command center, or certain vehicles to reinforce. There are no flying units (Except in DoW I: Soulstorm). 

-Destructible cover and positioning in the second series is a huge aspect of the game. For instance, you can hide behind rocks, buildings or even craters left behind from explosives or artillery which greatly reduce incoming ranged damage, but will degrade eventually from enemy fire. Certain weapons such as flame throwers and grenades can be used to clear out buildings instantly and ignore cover. You can also flank enemies from the side or engage in melee to tie up heavier ranged units to make them vulnerable.  

-There is no resource gathering in the game, the two main resources are requisition and power. In both games there are these nodes scattered across the map which you can capture. In dawn of war I, you build upgradable outposts on them which have a machine gun attachment and generators in the base IIRC. In dawn of war II there is no base building whatsoever minus special buildings such as turrets, aura banners, tunnels that are used for quick travel behind enemies, etc. Power is acquired the same way requisition is, except you can auto-build up to 3 generators per power node and create a structure that must be destroyed before the power node can be captured again.

-Aside from multiplayer skirmishes the game modes in the second series are extremely fun, it even has co-op. The one I enjoy the most is one called Last Stand. You pick one of 6+ heroes with two other players then try to survive 20 waves in an arena while hordes of enemy NPCs try to kill you. The hero you pick unlocks more gear as it levels up. I haven't played the campaign in retribution, but the ones in the original DoW II game and Chaos rising were extremely fun. You control 4 out of 6 beefed up heroes from the space marine faction (Can play with a friend and control 2 each) trying to save various planets from massive invasions from the other races. You get skill trees to customize your heroes along with new gear and abilities all the time. 

-"
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,So I'm interested in maybe trying a Prince of Persia game for the first time.  Which one should I get?
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Gothic 2 with Night of the Raven is absolutely incredible. Everyone should play that game, it's one of the best RPG's ever, in my opinion."

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Goddammit, AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome achievement is freakin hard!   Hell the entire game is.  Fun as hell, but hard!  "
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,Wasn't there a kotor 2? Where is it?
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"For those who haven't played the Gothic series but are considering it, here's my 2-cents.

Gothic 1 and 2: If you can get past the different style UI's and control maps, they're some of the best RPG's ever made. They're difficult and hugely involving. To me, they feel more immersive than Skyrim does, and the whole games feel carefully thought and hand-made (except for the occasional bug here and there).

Gothic 3 and Forsaken Gods: Quite buggy on their own, but can be a lot of fun if you patch them with the huge community patches that are released for them. The scenery is close to unmatched, if that's your thing.

Gothic 4: Just your typical RPG. Nothing compared to Gothic 1-2, but if you're a huge fan of the series, it's still not a bad game.

Risen: Made by Piranha Bytes after JoWood dropped them, and turned out to be pretty great. It has a very Gothicy feel to it, and it's what Gothic 3-4 should have been like. "
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Be careful with KotOR; it's a fantastic game, but I recall it having some performance issues on modern PC's.

Everyone should check out Terraria though. That game is the pixelated reincarnation of ""fun""."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I just bought some games on steam while I'm at work right now, can I download them at home? My steam is online, does steam has any feature like that? "

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Really. If you dont own Gothic I and II, get it. Although the engine is of course not that good, its one of the best RPGs ever played. Ten dollars is a really fair price, since it gives you many hours of atmosphere and fun. Its definatly worth it. Gothic III is not really good though, and Gothic 4 is like a completely new game, i never played it."

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I wanted to chime in and say that Dawn of War II/Chaos Rising/Retribution are fantastically fun games set in the well known Warhammer 40k universe. The single player is a story based campaign, and in Chaos Rising and vanilla DOW, it's quite good -- the campaigns are long. Vanilla DOW is about the Space Marines, and Chaos Rising is as well -- but Chaos Rising gives you the option to turn to Chaos (i.e. the renegade space marines).

Gameplay is more of a squad based RTS rather than a traditional base building experience -- similar to Company of Heroes, another Relic game. You have a group of heroes which you upgrade with armour and weaponry and direct on the battlefield, moving them into cover and using special abilities to turn the tide of battles.

Retribution has a campaign for many of the major factions -- Space Marines, Eldar, Imperial Guard, Tyranids, Chaos Space Marines, and the Orks. Retribution is the one that people currently play in multiplayer heavily and it is quite fun. The Last Stand mode is a ""three player versus hordes of enemies"". Note that if you buy Retribution, there is one particular piece of DLC which is a bit more interesting than the rest: the Tau Commander. The Tau Commander is not a skin pack or wargear set, but an entirely new character that you can play in The Last Stand. It doesn't say it outright, but all DLC is on sale today.

There is a ""traditional"" multiplayer mode, if you like that sort of thing, building units and defending your base, and that is the achievement for today.

The Dawn of War I games -- you can get the whole pack, but the best of the lot is Dark Crusade. Soulstorm is generally accepted to be derpy in terms of storyline, and features the famous ""SPEHSS MEHREENS! BATTLE BRUVVERS!"" speech by Commander Indrick Boreale, who you may know from his appalling speech impediment in the Dawn of Awesome video series, and countless Youtube Poops. DOW1 is a very traditional RTS, by the way."

Also, the Jedi Knight games are a blast. Jedi Outcast has great single-player and multiplayer, and Jedi Academy has worse single-player but better multiplayer. Even just setting up a deathmatch with a bunch of bots of famous star wars characters and having a first to 50 lightsaber battle royale is a ton of fun. Easily the best handling of lightsaber combat in a video game."

It has much less content than other releases (War/Economy Campaign, free build, no single player skirmish, buggy multiplayer) as well as being buggy (it has been patched a few times to be fair, still could use more).

MOTHER OF GOD. Over the course of I don't even KNOW how many sales, I've picked up just about every game I have any interest in, but there are a few classics (imo) that I've been waiting to pick up to finish my collection....

PoP Trilogy
Dawn of War (The originals)
Jedi Knight and Jedi Academy

And here they are, all at once. Fuck my wallet :'["
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,Yes! I've been waiting for Terraria to go on sale. I almost gave in when I saw it hit 50% off but I'm glad I waited! 75% off!!!
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Looks like no thread recommending **Dawn of War**, so here's my input.

Absolutely buy **Dawn of War: Dark Crusade** if you like strategy, Warhammer, Company of Heroes, or fun. 7 campaign races to choose from, lots of replayability, and multiplayer is fun. The first Dawn of War series is Relic's pre-Company of Heroes game, and if you like that title, this is natural. The graphics hold up very well, even when the first DoW is 7 years old. They chose to do a Warcraft 3 style look, and it worked well. The game is very fluid, exciting, and challenging at times- and really nails the 'endless war' motif that 40k is known for. Dark Crusade is a great buy if you're on the fence about just buying it all, because it's campaign can be played with any of 7 races, and should let you know if you liked Space Marines enough to buy **Dawn of War Gold** for their campaign. **Dawn of War: Soulstorm** is the one that I have played the least, and not really gotten all that into. Adds two new armies, a bigger campaign, etc- but it's missing something. At 6 bucks though, go for it.

**Dawn of War 2** is fun. It looks pretty, and is a totally different game. Dawn of War is all about huge armies and massive battles, and Dawn of War 2 is more Dungeon Siege than Starcraft. You control heroes and small squads, micro-manage ability, loot hunt and theorycraft, and still have a blast. If Dawn of War was intended to give some of the feel of a huge tabletop Warhammer game though, DoW2 is more like D&D40K. **Dawn of War 2: Chaos Rising** has a better and more fun campaign. More variety in missions, and introduced the ""Last Stand"" mode. More on that in a second. **Dawn of War 2: Retribution** has a more Dark Crusade feel to it, 6 armies to choose from, and I can't really comment on the campaign. Played a bit, but my PC is aging poorly, and it just wasn't doing so well. **The Last Stand** mode *is* very fun though. It's a wave-based co-op mode, where you control one hero and work as a team of 3 to beat waves of enemies. Part DoTA, part RTS, part cooldown management. It's fun, but play with friends if you really want a good time."

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"[Sequence](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200910/) was one of my favorite games this year. If I was going to compare it to any one game - apart from DDR of course - it would be to The World Ends With You.

The humour stands out with its constant barrage of puns in item descriptions and clever dialogue that's often delivered extremely well. The story ended up being far better than I expected, and you might not discover everything unless you look for it...

On the hardest difficulty - aptly described as ""for those socially challenged"" - it was a challenge even though I'm quite good at stepmania. The multi tasking added by field switching and activating spells with cooldowns really changes things. Though, it probably would have helped a lot if I remaped keys and didn't use one hand exclusively for notes.

Finally it might be worth mentioning that the (sole)developer has been very active since the game was released. It's been patched something like 10 times, and he has added requested features like speed modifiers.

* Second, jet packs that can be used like weapons. Jet packs make everything better.
* Third, two player campaign co-op. Brothers, unite!
* Fourth, 4 player co-op mode called last stand. Play as an Orc, Tyranid, Space Marine, The Imperial Guard, Chaos Marines or the Eldaar to fight off waves of traitors. Also contains some RPG elements and lets you level up and gain new gear.
* Fifth: Gear based and Skill point based campaign. Level up your SPACE MARUEENS, become even more badass.
* Fucking Dreadnoughts.

The dawn of war 2 games DoW2, Chaos Rising and Retribution. They're all standalone, but the storyline only really makes sense if you get them all. The first two (DoW2 and Chaos Rising) use GFWL, the last one (Retribution) uses steamworks and is more popular because of that. If you want it for the multiplayer, Retributions where it's at."

My father plays loads of turn base strategies and he played shit out of D3 while heroes VI was left on its own after some 15 hours gameplay. I played both as well for some time.

Some bugs are there but nothing that would prevent your from playing it all. Combat system is actually pretty good and innovative with counter system and special bonus plots.

Artifacts and scrolls in inventory can be tyresome once you got too much stuff, but I really like the spell system(you cast them on adv map before combat), hero upgrading path and especially creature upgrades...

Its not a great game, but for turn-base strategies fans its a very good addition and has quite a long play time."

Might have been fun when it first came out, but avoid it now. "
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,Solar 2 while simple is a ton of fun. Going for the achievements makes it brutal at times. The soundtrack and humour of the game are what really make the game. A great game.
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I disagree with your assessment of Prince of Persia. The 2008 cell shaded Prince of Persia is leaps and bounds better than Warrior Within or The Two Thrones. Less combat oriented, and more platform oriented like Sands of Time. The atmosphere differs in being a more spacious feel than PoP typically is, and the character banter can get irritating, but I'd take it over the later part of the SoT trilogy. "

It has nothing to do with the Sands series, but the game is absolutely beautiful and while the gameplay is a bit easy, I'd say the environment and the relationship between ""the prince"" and the princess became really engaging as the game went on.

Also, if I remember correctly, ""the prince"" is played by Nolan North. Which, if you're a fan, is a nice bonus."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"In regards to Prince of Persia, I really enjoyed PoP2008. Sure it's very easy, but it was also fairly relaxing and very impressive visually. And since it was fairly easy, everything flowed incredibly well."

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"> The first two games were particularly good, but the quality of the series sharply drops from there, and from there onwards, it's not worth bothering with.

Actually Gothic 3 with community patch (don't even try playing that game without it) and enabled alternative AI is IMO to this day the best action RPG with open world. But Forsaken Gods and Arcania are indeed total crap, made by different developers."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Regarding Prince of Persia - I agree that Sands of Time is probably the best of the batch, I disagree on your point about the trilogy.  

Warrior Within is awful in my opinion and puts the focus on repetitive combat rather than platforming.  The story and characters in this game are also uninteresting.

Two Thrones is pretty good when it's behaving like Sands of Time but then there are sections that harken back to Warrior Within and you're left with that same boring combat.

Prince of Persia (the cel-shaded one) is an excellent game in spite of the fact that you cannot die.  The characters and story are interesting, the combat is entertaining and best of all, the platforming is excellent.  This game also looks great.

tl;dr - Sands of Time and Prince of Persia (cel-shaded) are the way to go, the others can be safely ignored."

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I feel like the Dawn of War series needs some kind of a buyer's guide. Can anyone tell me what I'm getting (and what's worth getting) from each of the things that come up after clicking the sale splash? There's the pack of 3, then 3 other individual things, one of which may or may not be in that 3 pack so I'm sort of lost."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-28,"I bought Cities in Motion and am really disappointed; I'm kind of frustrated that you likened it to OpenTTD (this made me buy it), when it seems you only have cursory experience with either one or the other or both. There are good things about the game, but I don't feel it has deserved me trying to find them, so here are the bad things that rather stand out:

The UI is worse than TTD, which is 15 years older. For example there is no way to close all windows. You have to go through and close each one individually by clicking a red x. You cannot move the windows around, so even if one is nice to keep open constantly you can't because it occupies the center of the screen. Most hotkeys are in the WASD area but important camera hotkeys are <- ->, why can't I use the mouse to rotate the camera (eg by holding rightclick). Finally there is that ""secondary viewport"" that you cannot close, which will consntantly remain open and spout useless information at you, or information that you just wanted to have a glance at, not have constantly there... the best way to close it is to click on a streetlight, then you'll just have a black box taking up screen space.

The game attempts to be immersive but fails in terms of mechanics. They throw tons of data at you: 7 different classes of people (first of all, WTF?), 5 different transportation modes, global economics, and traffic. The last two they claim to model realistically. Economics rather than being advanced are akin to bad weather in Rollercoaster tycoon: you simply follow a number and based on the binary decision of whether it's above 0% or below 0% you adjust your prices. While micromanaging prices is annoying, I expected it, as this is typical of tycoon/sim city games. The advanced traffic seems random at best. At central intersections there will be traffic jams that will just vanish a bit later. Similarly cars will drive onto sidewalks and vanish. There is no time of day or anything else that is visible to the player that would help him understand traffic pattern.

They run a 3D engine but zoom is limited to the point where individual people are not distinguishable, and are invisible once they enter vehicles. Clicking on people shows a detailed 2D portrait in the info box; there are very few portraits. People don't feel personal, why bother depicting them with detail when that detail is obviously irrelevant. Sound effects are repetitive, and feel like they've been lifted from TTD: i.e. a 2010 title with 1995 sound effects. Whereas TTD was limited in that everything was written into machine code, with CIM this is just laziness and poor production. The music is vague elevator music, it evokes no feelings. At least sound can be turned off without loosing anything. Finally as the months fly by the game is stuck in July, 3PM, not windy. There is no weather in game, shadows on trees are the same direction at all times, and building facades don't change.

Overall the game feels like a half-hearted effort. It doesn't bring anything new to the table of trans-simulators, and costs $5 on sale. It's much worse than a $5 indie game would be, and incomparable in value to the free OpenTTD."

Also, if you need more of a reason to support it, it was pretty much created entirely by one guy ([Jason Wishnov](http://www.playiridium.com/about)). He wrote and programmed the entire thing, as well as provided the voice for Ky, the main character. Wendi Chen did the (gorgeous) artwork, another two or so contributed music, and there were a couple more voice actors, but it was pretty much Jason's baby.

Jason's really active over at the Steam forums and replies to lots of threads himself, and he sent me a humble and personal reply when I e-mailed him after I finished the game. If you/re the kind of person who buys games just to support their devs, then you should definitely pick this one up.

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"The original Dawn of War games are similar to Company of Heroes. Strategy RTS with an emphasis on holding points for resources.

Dawn of War 2 also has an emphasis on holding points, but reduces the amount of units so you get a much more micromanaging experience. Great campaign in DoW2, all of the expansions. They have gearing, experience levels, and talent trees. I would go for any of the DoW2, personal recommendation is the latest one Retribution since it has the bigger community and addition of Last Stand mode, which is 3 person co-op survival to the last wave. It has multiple character/classes with leveling as well."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"The original Dawn of War gave me the most fun I have ever had in an RTS. It is action packed and the animations were great. It's not as serious or as stressful as the Blizzard RTS games but at the same time there were some balance issues which turned some people away. There are 9 races in total which all have totally different gameplay mechanics which also keeps things fresh and interesting. Unfortunately I think the online community is almost dead now. If you are looking for a single player experience don't bother getting the Dark Crusade or Soulstorm as they were complete garbage.

If you are a fan of the RTS genre I would pass on DOWII. It is an overly simplified version of the first one (base building was totally removed!) with prettier graphics. It is nowhere as visceral as the first one either."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I loved the WH40K:Dawn of War and absolutely hated Dawn of War 2.  WH40K:DoW is much closer to Starcraft/Warcraft, and I had some awesome online battles with it.  

I got WH40K:DoW2 a few years ago, and they changed it to be more like a real time RPG strategy game.  You typically have 1 squad, and they gain experience as you go along.  Sort of closer to single squad based WoW in terms of mechanics.  You get gear upgrades for your squadmates as you go along, and everyone levels up.  I was personally really disappointed with this because I had so much FUN with DoW and loved the game mechanics.  I was really looking forward to a prettier version of DoW with DoW2, and I was really let down."

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Agreed.

Stronghold 3's the only game I've ever asked for a refund on, because it was clear that even once they'd fixed the launch bugs the core game still wouldn't be any fun."

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I absolutely loved it. If you like rhythm games or DDR, it's a must for the price.

The gameplay is basically Rockband: Unplugged (PSP) combined with Puzzle Quest. There are three ""lanes,"" one for incoming attacks (hit the arrow to block the damage), one for casting spells (deal damage/heal/other effects), and one for mana (used to cast spells). Each lane drops notes at a different speed: The Defense lane drops notes fairly regularly depending on the enemy, the Spell lane drops notes when you cast spells, and the Mana lane is almost always full (but there is no penalty for missing Mana notes).

It's combined with some interesting RPG mechanics outside of battles. I 100%'d the game and got about 10 hours out of it. I liked the story too. "

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Yes. Buy them! Seriously though, both are extremely fun and rewarding and can be tough as nails, especially Braid. World of Goo is a physics-based game where you have a certain number of Goo balls that can be attached and detached based on your gameplay. Your objective, more or less, is to create a bridge from Point A to Point B using Goo Balls, but obviously physics/gravity is in effect so you have to be careful how to stack your Goo Balls. There are of course other environmental conditions and hazards, like fire and spikes and whatnot. Highly recommended.

Braid is kinda like a modern reimagining of Mario, except it's very indie and very... artsy? It's a very poetic game with beautiful backgrounds and a mysterious and elegant backstory. Gameplay is divided into, I think, 6 ""worlds"" and you have to collect puzzle pieces and make your way through the side-scrolling worlds with numerous obstacles in your path. You'll have to manipulate time in different ways for each world. You also can't die, since holding down Shift when you are about to die reverses time back to a certain point. This time manipulation can get **extremely** tricky in later levels, so you gotta be on top of your game then. Braid has a fantastic ending as well, so it's totally worth a buy.

Hope that convinces you to buy both games!"
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,Braid has great art and is a solid puzzle platformer. Definitely one of t he top indy games.
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I found world of goo to be a plants & zombies type of game - not in the gameplay but the fact that you can't stop playing it once you start to.  I think I played the entire game through in a day or two but it was a very satisfying experience.  It's basically a build-a-bridge game with fairly fun physics behind it that make some levels very challenging, and of course others not so much but still fun never the less.  I recommend it!"
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"World of Goo is seriously the most intricate and unique game I've ever played, definately worth your time. I suggest looking up videos on Youtube for gameplay if you're interested!!"
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"They both have demos, so that's probably the best way for you to decide."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I'll go against the grain by saying Braid has a mis-step in it's design (in my opinion) that stopped me from playing. That design choice is basically that a player must collect difficult to reach items to proceed past a certain point in the game. If one cannot figure out how to access them, the player stops proceeding in the game.

Alternatively, the new Super Mario bros. games feature special coins that can be collected to unlock levels within each world; it's not required to continue through the game, but it's a wonderful reward for those with the ability to obtain the special coins. 

I will admit that in Braid, there's a story significance to their choice, but I got to a point where I'm not sure where the collectibles are/how to actually get them and I'd rather not use a walkthrough. Overall, I was hoping for a game where I could use the neat mechanics of the game without caring about the collectibles. Instead, I'm forced to obtain them and figure things out which is more than what I was asking for out a platformer when I first played it. Maybe one day I'll feel like going back to it, but I just wasn't in the mood at all for that type of experience in a platformer."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"In my opinion, Braid is definitely a must-buy, specially if you're into platformers. It has beautiful art and soundtrack, an amazing story with some clever twists and awesome gameplay focused on controlling time. It really is a very fun experience, specially at $2,50.

I haven't played a lot World of Goo, but it seems very interesting from the little I've played. It's very easy to get into it, it's pretty straightforward and what you see in the trailers is what you get."

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Cities in Motion is a lot of fun if you liked the transportation management aspect of Sim City 4. There is no City building outside of transportation networks. It can be quite challenging and the game does a great job at giving you objectives. If that type of game sounds appealing, it's easily worth $5, as it's a very polished game and does what it says it does very well."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Cities in Motion is more similar to Transport Tycoon than Sim City. You build a transportation network around a city that grows over time, setting tram & bus stops, upgrading vehicles etc. Part of the game is picking the optimal route between stops like in Transport Tycoon. Overall it's not a particularly deep game, but very relaxing."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"From the meta-critic reviews it looks like it's a transportation sim, not a city sim.  :(

And agree on KOTOR. :D"
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Very enjoyable. You don't build cities like in Sim City, it takes place in actual cities like Amsterdam and Belgium in different time periods starting in the early 1900's. Surprisingly fun for being a ""transportation simulator."" There are always missions to keep you busy and it has great music. I think there is a demo, check it out if you're hesitant. "
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I bought Cities in Motion a couple months ago and it is definitely worth the $5. It is best to think of it as a virtual train set. You set up routes for buses, lay track for trams and trains and then watch as the little vehicles trundle from stop to stop. You can people-watch too as each passenger is an individual with a home, workplace and a list of locations that he travels to and from.

The challenge in the game comes from maintaining the business side of your transportation company and managing congestion. It is easy to invest in a rail line that ends up losing money or to build an inefficient transportation network that leaves passengers angry. When this happens, you will fall into a debt spiral and eventually run out of money, which means 'game over'. Getting it right is very satisfying, but when it goes wrong it can be frustrating as it might not be immediately obvious what you did wrong.

TL;DR: A fun game for people who like building systems and observing emergent behavior, but the game is slow paced and it is easy to fail."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,So many good Republic Commando memories! Definitely underrated.

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Don't bother with DoW2 DLC, just buy the core games.  All 3 of them are excellent but if you only buy 1 get Retribution.  (Edit: Oops I guess i didn't read your full comment.)  It has the best campaign and multiplayer, and it's the only one that allows you different races to play single player.  (Six of them!)  So it has the most bang for your buck.  

The DLC is just reskinned models for vs. mode, or alternate equipment to use in co-op.  Unless you end up playing Last Stand really hardcore for a long time, it's not likely you'll even use all the items in the base game.  (There are *tons* of items available in the core game.  Once again, you have 6 heroes you can level up and earn new equipment with.)  

If you play for 6 months and end up really wanting something different from the game, *then* you should buy the DLC.  It's a waste if you buy it right off the bat cause it's made for the people who are hardcore into the game."

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Its worth it.  The Jedi Knight games are the most fun Star Wars games I've played.  The lightsaber combat is almost perfect and it's really fun.

One of my best gaming moments comes from this series.  It was during a 1 on 1 lightsaber boss battle (spoiler-free).  

It was a long fight, with both of us slashing left and right, force pushing, and dodging.  I was low on health and had to try to finish them.  I threw my lightsaber at them, hoping to catch them off guard and land a hit.  They saw it coming, deflected it with their own saber,  I turned and watch mine going flying across the room.

I looked back and see them retaliate by copying me;  they threw their lightsaber.  I dodged to the right, the direction of my fallen lightsaber, and picked it up and charged at them.

Right as I got close their lightsaber returned to their hand.  I slashed at them but they jumped straight up to avoid it.  I jumped after them swinging again, we clashed midair and landed facing away from each other.  I turned around to see them collapse on the floor.  A narrow victory.

It was completely unscripted and one of the most surreal experiences I've had in a video game."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I've heard Knights of the Old Republic is great, probably will pick that up. *Along with a billion other things*... I should've waited for Prince of Persia to go on sale, now I regret it... and definitely picking up FEAR 2."

Plus Relic put in far FAR more touches than Blizzard. There is so much dialogue in these games to give you flavour and atmosphere.

Plus... MOTHERFUCKING ORKS!"
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,I got Chaos Rising a while ago but haven't played it much probably because of the whole GFWL requirement.

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,FYI: It doesn't run well on Windows 7 64-bit.
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,Also all the wonderful questlines regarding Revan's cult and the fact that he was apparently trying to [grow a new star forge](/spoiler) don't have the same impact if you haven't played KotOR.
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,I am one of those freaks.
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"This. Jedi Outcast is on my list of 'games to recommend to everyone I know', especially if you're a Star Wars fan."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,i seem to be the only person that didnt like swkotor. awkward controls
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Not sure why you got downvoted, but no, you don't have to pay. And if you like Star Wars and rpgs, then you will likely enjoy KOTOR. Its combat is similar to DA:O's, if that helps you at all."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Honestly, there aren't many games as scary as Amnesia and Penumbra, but some really excellent atmospheric and unnerving games are Metro 2033, combat is a constant struggle and claustrophobic, and the S.T.A.L.K.E.R franchise, where it's very atmospheric, and incredibly unnerving. The main objective of S.T.A.L.K.E.R is to survive the harsh and unforgiving world, and blowouts in Call of Pripyat are quite tense and unnerving as you face imminent death. "
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"There's the Nightmare House games, which are HL2 mods I think.  I recall watching a very, very creepy youtube video featuring a part of NH2 with Weeping Angels-esque mannequins.  "
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"If you have a PS2 or an Xbox 360, I highly recommend trying to find Fatal Frame and Fatal Frame II. Fatal Frame especially seems to hit that ""OMG I HEAR IT WTF IS OUT THERE!"", though both games do suffer a bit from the ""ok, I've leveled up my stuff now I'm safe"" factor.

Still enjoyable, and there's enough creepiness that I had to detox with some Super Mario before bedtime to avoid bad dreams."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Call of Cthulhu is pretty scary for maybe half the game. Once you get a gun, the suspense/horror aspect is all but ruined, although I did have fun with it. You might not enjoy it quite as much if you aren't a Lovecraft fan. But the first part of the game is definitely a good horror/scary game."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"If you have half life two, I can't reccomend the mod 'Nightmare house 2' enough. It sounds generic, but it's the scariest game I've played in a while, and it's free, so it can't hurt to give it a shot.http://nh2.wecreatestuff.com/"
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"One game that way too many have missed is Condemned. It's really scary, especially when you play on hard (which you really should). The melee combat is very satisfying, and when 2 meter tall junkies with sledgehammers starts running at you screaming... Uugh. And I don't think theres any other game where a thug with a 2-shot sawn-off shotgun made me run in the other direction in panic.

Definitely a must, at least on PC. Condemned 2 is a completely different game that is good but not *that* good."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I have one - I think (and all of my friends who have played both) that System Shock 2 is far scarier than Amnesia. In System Shock 2, I remember spending 30 minutes just traversing down a single corridor, almost paralyzed in fear. I was also only able to play in about 30 minute chunks because of how exhausting it was to play (this is kind of true with Amnesia as well).

SS2 is a pain to set up on modern operating systems, however. There are forums to give ""step by step"" instructions on how to get it to work, but in my experience they only sometimes pan out."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,Limbo is quite unsettling.
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"You should try Cryostasis and Metro 2033. Great scares, atmosphere, and story. They don't have the puzzle element found in Amnesia or Penumbra though.

Also, I really don't recommend The Fall. It's more of an art project than a game. It's dark, but not scary."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,I thought Dead Space was pretty good.
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"It's nearly eight years old (and not on Steam), but go for PREY when you can. It's a game based off the Doom 3 engine that has plenty of action, but also plenty of creepy scenes, as well as horror stories through radio broadcasts."

It seems like EVERYONE loves Bastion, but I downloaded the demo a while ago and didn't like it at all. Then when it went on sale yesterday and everyone was talking about how amazing it was, I downloaded the demo again. I was even excited thinking I found another cheap game on Steam. I didn't like it. It's going to come down to personal taste. "

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"While it can be great fun playing alone, Terraria is best played with several close friends. It's also required to play with other people once you're roughly 50+ hours into the game (Hardmode). 

It was the best buy I've ever made on Steam. I've bought it as a gift for several people all of whom enjoyed it. 

This is what I find odd though. These are my top 3 games (In the parenthesis is the price I paid for the game):

* Team Fortress 2 (Free): 137 Hours

* Terraria ($2.50): 114 Hours

* Portal 2 ($50): 23 Hours

I'm apparently more likely to play a game longer if I pay less for it.

Edit: Bullets"
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,It takes some getting in to...5 hours or so in it gets really interesting.

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,Black Ops is my favourite since CoD 4. The single-player is the pinnacle of linear FPSs and the multi-player is some of the best in the franchise.

Levels are missing, but there is a community patch that tries to add the content back in (stuff was shipped on disc that never appears in game). KotOR 2 is a darker, edgier, more interesting game than the original, but alas, it was not finished. It is still playable though. If only it was on Steam..."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I'm a weirdo and kind of liked Gothic 3. Granted, I wouldn't recommend outright, but I enjoyed it for some strange reason even while I knew through-and-through that it could've been a much better game. I'd say its ""charming."" IF you do get the entire pack, get the community patch as it fixes a shit-ton of bugs the game has. 

The premise behind it is promising. Plus the game's world is fucking huge.  Humans are subjugated by the orcs and you're basically a low-class citizen deciding whether to kiss orc ass to get ahead or work on liberating the humans. I do wish someone would try their hand at making a similar game with more time and resources. "
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Dawn of war gold edition contains the original DoW and an expansion winter assault, the main difference from soulstorm and dark crusade, is that the first two ones have a blizzard like campaign: scripted missions with dialogue cutscenes. While soulstorm and dark crusade have a risk like campaign, which consists of a large map, where you have to play skirmishes against the computer, taking over zones on the map until you get to the main stronghold of each opposing race. Each expansion in the first series introduces 1 or more new 40k races.

Dawn of war 2 original has totally different system from the first one, no base building, squad based combat with rpg elements (squads have experience points and can equip items) the campaign in the original DoW2 consists of story missions with randomly generated missions inbetween (for looting and leveling) the first expansion is similar, introduces new corruption mechanic (during the campaign your battlebrothers may succumb to the temptation of chaos) this adds a few different endings to the game. The last expansion introduces a innovative and weird campaign, which has a lot of races and is played out on the same set of campaign maps, but the cutscenes and dialogues are different for each race. Also introduces a new coop survival mode for multiplayer if I remember correctly.

Basically, relic does a lot of experimentation in their expansions, always adding new stuff here and there. If you like fancy story campaigns the first two parts of DoW, and all of DoW 2 are a good buy. DoW is more of  a classic rts where you build up a base and produce units, DoW 2 is an rts/rpg hybrid, with no base building, cover mechanics and destructible environments."

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,What about the extra DLC for an additional $10? Should I get that along with the game itself for $10?

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"How so?  Castlevania was originally a linear action game while Metroid was open, item-collecting awesomeness right from the start.  The Metroid series followed this design consistently throughout the years, only really straying from this formula with Metroid Other M.

It wasn't until Castlevania 2 (released two years after Metroid) that the game opened up and featured the big exploration and item collecting gameplay.  After that the series didn't return to this style until years later with Symphony of the Night which was effectively a Gothic-themed Super Metroid with RPG elements.  Later games in the series (namely Lament of Innocence and Lords of Shadow) even returned to the series' roots and did away with the big emergent worlds commonly associated with ""Metroidvania"" titles.

For the reasons I just listed, the name ""Metroidvania"" never sat well with me.  To me, the games commonly referred to as such should just be Metroid-like."

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"Terraria is certainly not the same as minecraft and it's not focused on building so much. It's much more action-RPG like with a nice exploration and random world in it, also the combat is fun.
It's a simple game but the real fun comes with playing with friends (which is very easy, you can even set up your own server and use each other's worlds) 
If you have it, play it some more, find a friend who plays it (I'm sure there's one) and set goals for yourself, like destroying shadow orbs or beating the eye of cthulu, things of that nature."
nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,Terraria starts slow but when it picks up it picks up fucking fast

It wasn't mind boggling scary but it was definitely creepy as hell in some places, and had some really interesting mechanics in my opinion (the need to replace damaged masks, replace filters, etc). Plus the use of ammo as currency (if I am remembering correctly?) kept you second guessing purchases.

I found it really great in a lot of ways, and I plan to get around to reading the book (I can't remember if the game was pretty spot on, but I know my roommate liked both a lot). But that's just my opinion, of course.

Thanks for reminding me about this game! It's been a while since I've seen him play it... I'll have to see about getting it for the PC. Thanks for the reminder!"

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-27,"I agree. I always held that opinion and never really bothered voicing it as the term ""metroidvania"" is too entrenched in gaming culture.

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-28,"It really just should be ""Metroid-y"" or something along those lines. Metroid invented the subgenre, perfected it in 2D with Super Metroid and then in 3D with Metroid Prime.

nsgu2,2011-12-27,2011-12-28,"I just read the TOS, where does it say anything about sales taxes? It only mentions sales taxes for Merchandise, not for downloadable games. There is no such thing as sales taxes for downloaded games. There is no mention at all of cross-region purchases in the TOS. There is no sales tax (or EU VAT) on the Amazon site, and there is no extra sales tax on the android market or on the iTunes market either. I can also freely purchase on the US Amazon site without any problems. Its only Steam and the Xbox live, that is so obsessed with regional prices. But sure, quote me the part of the TOS that forbids buying from the US Steam store site.

The prices are higher in the EU, not because of VAT, but because they are listed under the same price as in USD, but in EUR. It has nothing to do with sales tax, it is only a misleading publisher practice to rip off customers. And not every game is listed with unfair EUR prices, some are listed according to the actual exchange ratio, or close to it."

 I'm replaying KOTOR now, after mistakenly reading that spoiler (my fault), and it still seems that Mass Effect is similar to KOTOR in a separate universe.

ec72h,2010-11-26,2010-11-26,">Company of Heroes $1.90

One my my favourite RTS games. The balancing can be a bit wonky depending on the map, but there's no greater feeling than launching a howitzer strike on an infantry surge and seeing dozens of body parts coating everything within view.

>Empire & Napoleon Total War Collection $19.90

Empire is fairly buggy, but oh god. It's one of the greatest grand strategy games, can fit thousands of units on screen (Get DarthMod), and it has these amazing RTS battles. Napoleon's campaign is meh, but the battles are even more fun.

>Hidden & Dangerous 2 $0.90

This hasn't aged well, but it's one of the best tactical shooters I've played. Very challenging, very detailed, and very fun.

>Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead $14.90

Don't buy this unless you know what you're getting into. It's kind of like Operation Flashpoint in the sense that it's going to rip you a new arse and fill it with sadness many times over.

>Wings of Prey: WWII Air Combat $12.90

Personally, I'd pass on this. It's *decent*, but there are better combat flight sims- especially for that price.

>Final Fantasy XI: The Ultimate Collection $4.90  / Age of Conan: Rise of the Godslayer Gold Edition $9.90 

These are more or less dead or dying. Age of Conan was a bust from the start, Final Fantasy XI is old enough to be your grandmother and everyone on it seems to be Japanese.

>Assassin's Creed: Director's Cut Edition $3.90

Very worth it. It's got one of those engines that makes you feel like you're actually playing a person rather than a sprite.

>SPORE $9.90

Don't buy this for yourself, but buy it for a kid. It went from this amazing concept to something so stupidly dumbed down that I uninstalled it after a week. Kids like it though.

>Overlord 2 $3.90

It's quirky and fun, but it's a bitch to get the hang of. Worth it.

>Tom Clancy's End War $1.90 / Frontlines: Fuel of War $1.90

Pass, even at that price. End War is a substandard RTS, Frontlines is like if you took all the fun out of Battlefield 1942, downgraded everything (including the AI), then had a dog shit on it before trying to play it with an N64 controller. "

ec72h,2010-11-26,2010-11-27,"What options do you suggest instead of Wings of Prey? I don't want IL21946...I want pretty graphics...and more of an arcade thing. I know the Rise of Flight game is popular, but it sounds too hardcore for me. I couldnt handle 46, never been a pure flight sim guy. 

i'm kinda holding out hoping that tomorrow steam puts WoP up so I can avoid shipping...but if you have another suggestion fire away.

I agreed with most of your post btw. H&D2 hasn't aged well, but damn what a good game. first time i ever saw with iron sights. "

s1pkso,2022-01-11,2022-01-11,If i remember well I think reading somewhere that yes. You willbe able to to put em together.
s1pkso,2022-01-11,2022-01-12,"The combined map for Warhammer 2 is called Mortal Empires and requires owning Warhammer 1 & Warhammer 2, and having only Warhammer 2 downloaded.

We know Warhammer 3 will have a combined map, currently unnamed, that will require owning Warhammer 1, 2 & 3. I think it can be presumed you'd only need 3 downloaded but that has yet to be wholly confirmed.

So yeah, as long as you own games 1 & 2 (which to play Mortal Empires you must do already) you'll be able to play the combined map for Warhammer 3.

&#x200B;

Also some WH1/2 characters will be on WH3's base/'free' map and it remains to be seen if they'll be playable if you own them.

Also the combined map will come some time after release - for Warhammer 2 it was roughly a month after release, then the first DLC came about 3 months later - but due to technical issues the Norsca faction didn't come to ME for another 4 months after \*that\*, more than half a year after the release of the game.

I believe they've alluded to the wait for 3's combined map being a bit longer, so I could see it being Game Release -> DLC 1 2.5-3 months later -> Mortal Empires 4-5 Months after release, wherein they flip the order and release DLC1 (probably Chaos Dwarfs) to tide us over until the Combined Map is fully finished."

**Summary:**|Excellent sequel to the Witcher series, which has met with a great amount of positive reviews from the gaming community. Brutal, sexy, and immersive - this is definitely not an RPG to miss for role-playing fans. Since the game is relatively new, it is still a bit pricey.

**Summary:**|Open-World Action Game; Super Fun if you like to cause a lot of mayhem; Intentionally cheesy plot. This game is all about exploration and doing all kinds of crazy stunts. Want to fly a jet fighter plane, eject, shoot a rocket launcher on another aircraft while hurling through the air, and then re-enter your plan as it hurls down only to make a safe landing? Yep, you can do it in Just Cause 2. If you still aren't convinced, search YouTube for crazy gameplay videos and you might change your mind very quickly.

**Summary:**|Assassin's Creed is a series where each sequel has received more praise than its predecessor. Great rogue-like gameplay in an open world, where stealth and tactics do matter and running in head first gets you killed. Brotherhood received a lot of praise for its polished gameplay and improvements over the first few, while the first game received a bit of criticism for repetitive quests. Worth diving into if you are interested in getting into the series.

**Summary:**|Great indie game which has turned out to be a sleeper hit with the Steam Sales. Sanctum is a tower defense game with a twist, you play in FPS mode instead of the usual top-down commander view. The game seems quite polished and has received praise from gamers who played it in multiplayer mode. This [let's play video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Ds1E88pb0) by TotalBiscuit and friends is a good starting point if you know nothing about the game and want to find out more. There is also a DEMO if you are still not sure, and want to try it yourself before buying.

**Summary:**|Dawn of War has long established itself as a popular RTS series from the Warhammer 40k franchise. Fans of Warhammer 40k will already own this, but those who liked DoW2 and want to expand your gameplay with more choices and units, this stand-alone expansion is probably worth getting. For those who have never played a DoW game before, I'd recommend downloading the [Dawn of War II Demo](http://store.steampowered.com/app/15620/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1) off Steam before looking at this expansion.

[Just Cause 2](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/JustCause?snr=1_4_4_) is a gorgeous, expansive world that's been designed to be blown up, raced through and generally played in. Every bit of this game is designed to make you feel like an action hero, with a lot of actions smoothed over (jumping between two vehicles moving at high-speed, for instance) while still providing you enough of a challenge to keep you vaguely awake. One of the story missions starts you off on a bridge above a valley - you get a phone call telling you to hijack a limousine passing through the area. A conveniently-placed motorbike lets you leap off the side of the bridge, ditch the motorbike mid-air, freefall down to the limo and grapple-hook straight onto the roof. A short gunfight later and you're tearing through jungle highways in your newly-acquired limo, firing blind out of the windows and swerving to avoid roadblocks. 

It's *such* a playable game. I never used the fast travel option despite the map's size, because travel is so enjoyable in all forms, and the world is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. For this price, the game might as well have no faults. Thoroughly worthwhile picking up!

[Magicka](http://store.steampowered.com/app/42910/?snr=1_4_4_) has a delightful tongue-in-cheek style to its singleplayer campaign, and a really interesting take on how magic is cast and used. I often feel that magic is done pretty similarly across the RPG board, whether Western or Japanese. Magicka mixes that up - you chain together elements into recipes, select a cast type (single/multitarget, area of effect, etc.) and that not only encourages creativity but also leads to hilarious fuck-ups as well. Multiplayer is a frenetic disaster sequence, with misfiring magic, accidental target choice and fatal 'don't cross the beams!'-style situations.

I didn't get a *lot* of play out of Magicka, partly because I couldn't find time to organise games with friends and didn't click with the game when playing alone. That said, I think the price is right here, and I'm sure Redditors will be up for some games with you.

[Battlefield: Bad Company 2](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/badcompany2_199?snr=1_4_4_) is a masterwork, in my opinion. I had waited for a game to be as playable as Battlefield 2, and I had to wait a good four years for it. While BF:BC2 never quite hit the same dizzying highs as that game, it was the closest DICE have come since then (and BF3 appears to be finishing the job), and multiplayer is still excellent. The destructible scenery is used to spectacular effect on some maps; the class system is fine, without being overly divided, and on top of the great MP game you get a neat (if simple) singleplayer jaunt too. If you're waiting for Battlefield 3, this is the game to tide you over.

* Guild Wars Trilogy (Seems terrible. Friend told me to get it. If it's not as bad later in the game, someone tell me.)

* Audiosurf (Great game, WELL worth the 1.50 I spent)

* Splintercell: Chaos Theory  (Heard it's a great stealth game)

* Fallout 3 - Game of the Year  (Played it a bunch already, didn't own it.)

* Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Conviction  (So far pretty great. Worth it.)

* Worms Reloaded (I have a buddy with it, gonna play some MP)

* Supreme Commander 2 & DLC (Looking for an RTS that isn't Starcraft for a change, own CoH and DoW2.)

* Fallout: New Vegas (Played about an hour of it, liked what I played)

* Magicka: Vietnam ($1.69, why not?)

* Portal 2 (Need to get me some of that Co-op action)

* Battlefield Pack (I own the physical copy, hate physical copies. Also, I didn't have Vietnam.)

All in all, cost me about $110. Much more than I anticipated spending, and only one of those is a regret so far. *I'm looking at you, Guild Wars.* Looking forward to getting some gaming in. See you guys next sale!

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"So, I held off on recommending this, since it might've came up as a daily deal, but since it hasn't:

**BUY [CRYOSTASIS](http://store.steampowered.com/app/7850/) IMMEDIATELY.**

It's only $6.49, and it WILL be one of the most amazing gaming experiences of your life. It is easily the best-written, most creative, most *heart-pounding*, game I've ever had the privilege to play. It starts off a bit slow, but I can *guarantee you* that you will NEVER play a game that has a more satisfying ending, considering all the shit that game puts you through.

The only one caveat worth mentioning is that it is terribly-optimized; like, really, *really* terribly optimized. Even if your computer is amazing, you probably definitely won't be able to run it on high settings (although it's much smoother if you have a PhysX-enabled nVidia card; I don't). Honestly, though, this only kind of *added* to the experience for me. I don't think I ever died as a result of it, but it was still fucking terrifying to have the game start lagging the *second* this HUGE FUCKING THING APPEARED HOLY SHIT WHAT IN GOD'S NAME IS THAT?!

Seriously. Buy it. Please. I desperately want to see a sequel and it's heartbreaking to see how poorly this game sold/was received. It *in no way* warrants its low Metacritic rating. If you're *soulless enough* to not have already bought it by the time you started reading this, at least watch some gameplay and see if it might intrigue you: http://www.giantbomb.com/quick-look-cryostasis/17-1796/

Edit: put ""most creative"" twice. ^_~"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Dawn of War at 75%? Wasn't the daily only 50% before?

I'm jumping on that. The DLC costs more then the game currently."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Don't be like one of the many people that have lead to Duke Nukem being #2 on the top seller list at the moment.  It is truly not worth $25.  Literally all of the other games in today's sale are more worth your money.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Sanctum not recommended? I saw TB's videos and thought it was kind of cool. I was actually waiting for it to go on sale until I saw this post.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,dawn of war 2  or borderlands?
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Today was a bit disappointing, I was actually hoping to get Bejeweled 3 for $5 during this sale. At least I was able to get COD4 for $10, which is still more than I wanted to pay for a 2007 game, but up until recently, it was still $30, now it's down to $20, then it was half off.

No new achievements for today...

And I hope I'm not the only one who, despite having a big list of games, have more tickets than games that I can get prizes for. I need to spend some tickets on games I might get down the line.

Unquestionably and unconditionally.  I mean, these are indie games (or games so old that modern indie games have better production values than they do). . . even among PC Gamers, most of these are worth precisely $0.  To a select few who can appreciate these titles (which is NOT to say that they are bad - just that they have niche appeal - which I want to reiterate is not a euphemism for mediocrity) they are obvious no brainers.  They'd be deals at three times that price.

But let's be realistic here, Machinarium is *NOT* a mainstream release.  It is **not** the same as picking up Just Cause for $4.99.  For most gamers, paying $1.24 for the Time Gentlemen, Please!/Ben There, Dan That! combo pack is the same as taking a one dollar bill and lighting it on fire, because they wont get a single iota of enjoyment out of it."

Individually the price is $6.69 + $24.99 = $31.68 Whereas the Bundle is $36.83

So if you're looking to buy both Portal and Portal 2, it's cheaper to do so purchasing them separately.

If you have ANY love for number puzzles, pick up [Everyday Genius: Square Logic](http://store.steampowered.com/app/32150/) for $4.99. It's a *bunch* of Ken-Ken puzzles with a really good candidate interface and some interesting additions to keep things fresh. Furthermore, even if you don't play Ken-Ken, it eases you into them so that when you finally start solving 8x8s, it's not terrifying. I'll sheepishly admit that it's my most played Steam game with 40+ hours logged.

[Toki Tori](http://store.steampowered.com/app/38700/) ($1.24) is a polished puzzle platformer that, despite it's cute appearance, is surprisingly challenging. I can only play it in small bits because I'll get stuck and then frustrated, but I appreciate how well made and thought-out the game is.

[System Protocol One](http://store.steampowered.com/app/58300/) ($2.50) is an IT-themed tower defense game. The tutorial is DAUNTING (lots of information just thrown at you and no chance for you to actually practice or use what you're learning) and turned me off to the game initially, but now that I've started playing it I'm really enjoying it, so I recommend briefly glancing at the tutorial to get the basics and then just trying the game out on your own. Even playing it on the easiest mode is very challenging for me, but I like the look of the game and appreciate that not all of the maps are flat (some are on cubes, loops, etc.). It adds dimension (literally) to the game and makes you have to think more cleverly about the paths you're making.

The others I've liked are already mentioned at the top, but I'll second [RUSH](http://store.steampowered.com/app/38720/) (for $1.24 it's a steal, especially if you liked the puzzle aspects of ChuChu Rocket) and [Shatter](http://store.steampowered.com/app/20820/) ($2.50), which is an amazingly polished Breakout-style game that removes most of the frustration of Breakout-style games by allowing you to suck/blow air to adjust the ball's path, making those LAST couple of bricks MUCH easier to get.

Also, in case anyone is still reading, I'm looking for a good bargain racing game. It doesn't have to be revolutionary or beautiful -- just fun. Any suggestions?"

You hit keys which represent different elements (fire, earth, etc.) and/or targets (self, other, aoe).  Combinations of these can do seemingly any spell you've ever heard of from any popular magic system.

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Bought it in the winter sale on a whim, has been my most played game this year. Any time I am bored I can just fire up Just Cause 2 and cause some chaos/climb a mountain/sky dive off a skyscraper etc. Unbelievable ""bang for buck"" value."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Any of the JC2 DLC items worth buying? I have an aversion to DLC items, but they're 25 cents each today. If they make the game better, hard to argue."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/iecfn/steam_summer_camp_sale_day_2_total_war_shogun_2/c231soq?context=3) is what happened when I asked if I should get Just Cause 2 on the first go-round.  The consensus was almost unanimously positive.

(For the record, I did.  Haven't installed it yet - waiting for the Steam servers to calm down some - but I'm looking forward to it.)"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Is it worth it to also get the discounted DLC right now?
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I put in about 15 hours, but I uninstalled it.

Couldn't bother finishing the main storyline, too fucking repetitive.

I just don't have all that much fun with GTA-style sandbox anymore.  I feel old."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,The game came with my video card.  It's pretty fun.  Though I do use unlimited health and $ cheats to just terrorize the world.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Are the DLC worth it? Or can i go without it?
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"For those of you who have Just Cause 2, I suggest checking out the Just Cause 2 [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/jc2) (disclosure: I am one of its mods) for question-answering and links to mods and that sort of thing."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Is it worth picking up the first one for $3.74 as well? Would I be missing out on anything by not playing that one and just the sequel?
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I feel stupid, I bought it yesterday. I could've sworn it had already been on sale and I had missed it. :("
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I've been thinking about it, but I'm not sure how it'll run on my laptop."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"my problem is, its a great game yeah, but you need a decent computer to run this. i can run most games that come out lately, not at max or anything, but i cant even remotely run JC2. thats my only grip >.< otherwise, what ive seen of it and attempted to play was a BLAST and i wanted to make sweet love to it so bad. "
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Agreed. I very much dislike open world games but this one is brilliant. Realizes that it cannot take itself seriously because people just want to destroy. Also, you can take out military bases by your lonesome. "
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"My current computer can't run it, but I don't care if I will have a computer that will run it in the future, that will NOT be for at least another year.  I would much rather be able to play a game sooner after I buy it (if not immediately) than much, much later.  I have had enough money at different points during this sale for JC2's current price (I bought $5 for my Steam Wallet a couple of times, but spent it on a few TF2 items and a few other cheap indie games), but I'm not buying anything else.  I'm totally fine with waiting until winter sales."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,You know what? I cave. I just bought the game because of this thread. So much for word of mouth being dead in the age of $100 million advertising budgets...
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,What about the DLC? Which ones are worth it? They're all on sale but I don't think buying all of them would be a good idea xD [/cheap]
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Eh, the screens/vids aren't calling to me/drawing me in. Not feeling it."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Agreed. Bought it when it was relatively new for $40; the most I've ever spent on a new game (I'm cheap) and it was worth every cent.

For $5, not buying it would be a crime."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I'm only 55% completed for JC2 with 60 hours of gameplay, I'm going through and blowing everything up and discovering everything. It's well worth the money, the gameplay graphics are awesome.

Plus if your a LOST fan there is a pretty big easter egg that made this game that much more epic."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Remember though that it doesn't work with Windows XP. I bought it in the winter sale and was disappointed because my computer is pretty old so I haven't upgraded to Vista or 7.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Help me here- I have a core2duo 2.0ghz, 8600M GT, 4 gb Mushkin ddr2 laptop ram. Will I be able to run this? Because I want to believe.

For reference I run BC2 on medium settings ok, Assassin's Creed 2 just fine, and Borderlands well."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,had $5.20 left in the wallet - sold!
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"No, it's boring."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,I cannot decide between JC2 and GTAIV. Someone help me decide.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,I want to so badly. But my computer can't even run the demo for shit.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"YES WE KNOW ALREADY. I bought in December!

And I still haven't installed Windows 7 yet so I can't play it."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I need to upgrade my video card before I can play it :(  Alas, that should be in a month or so."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"after 1min into the demo and listening to the horrible voice acting of ""Bolo Santosi"" I vowed to never ever put money into that game."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I bought it 3 days ago, FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU!

EDIT:**（╯°□°）╯︵**"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,UNTIL THE WINTER SALES! MWAHAHAHAHA.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,[deleted]
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Farming Simulator? Pffft yeah right. Agricultural Simulator is where its at.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I can't tell if you're being serious. I kind of want to buy it, but is it actually any good? I've never heard of it outside of steam and it looks like it could (maybe) be fun, but even at half price it seems a bit expensive."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,WINTER SALES ARE COMING
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,You going back to your cave? I wish I could. So I could have time to play games.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,and ltx!  and finalsin and comment statistics and bonta-kun!
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Tune in to next season's Wallet Rape!
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Great game, but a bit much for something so old."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Absolutely second this. This is the only time I've ever seen this game discounted at all. It's like Deus Ex with vampires in Los Angeles. One of the best games I've ever played. Tons of replay value.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,torrent it. the devs went under so buying gives no money to them.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Amazing game, but I recommend pirating it to be honest. The developer is no longer in business so 100% of the profit goes to Activision."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,It's especially fun playing coop.  It's extremely intense and my friends and I had a blast.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Is it still worth it for single player?
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,It looks okay but the metascore has to be 69/100 for a reason right?
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Yep, I'm loving this game.  Very impressed by it."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Yes, don't even think twice."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Yes, oh please keep feeding the beast that is EA."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,I bought it at launch for full price. Absolutely no regrets; one of the best $50 I've ever spent.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Capitalism, Ho!"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Yeah, that's what I was looking for too. Thankfullly the demo was so fun that I would pay full price for it!"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Probably one of the best surprises I've gotten in an indie bundle. (a while ago, don't go looking for the bundle now)"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"> Guess I'll just have to pay 50% of base price.

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Awesome, awesome game. Well worth $2.50"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,This is the best game I picked up during the sale.  Recommended. 
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,[deleted]
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"No Fallout 3, either.  Stupid Bethesda.

That said, I'm glad - I've already got Oblivion for my 360, but after playing Fallout 3 on the PC I was tempted to rebuy it because I love the PC controls so much more."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,I know. I didn't get my paycheck until about the 6th day and was sure I was gonna be able to get it now.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,That was in one of the 1st days
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"It is, go look. "
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Wish granted :)
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Still upset that the DLCs are as much as the game. Sucks for people who picked it up when it first came out. :/
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"it's 7.50 for goty but only 5 for the normal version. Is there any compelling reason to spend the extra 2.50? I'm thinking about buying for 5  
EDIT: also can you play co-op with one PC or do you need two?"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I completely agree. I don't understand how borderlands is getting so heavily criticized for having a dull world and repetitive game play while Just Cause 2 is getting praised as a great game. Just Cause 2 had a much blander world and every mission is the exact same. I highly recommend this game, especially with Game of the Year being only $7.50. The DLC for Borderlands, with the exception of Mad Maxi, are all great. They do not feel like they were a missing part of the game but instead feel like genuine expansions."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"My alternative opinion: Borderlands is horrible. Played it for 2 hours and was bored all the way through. It's an okay shooter with a boring setting and uninteresting presentation.

Edit: Despite the ""unique"" style of Borderlands, Pandora is amazingly drab and boring."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,My understanding is that GOTY includes all 4 DLC. Is this correct?
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Nice game, good balance between hardcore and mass-gaming"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I'm enjoying it, it's kind of like Civilization with more emphasis on military and has rts battles."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Shogun 2 is one of the best pc games I have every played. Spent 7 hours last night playing a multilayer Campaign with my friend and had a blast. Works great in eyefinity btw! 

If Civ5 is more your style d2d has it on sale for $19.95 redeemable on steam."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Open World Fantasy Game. Definitely not a strong story. Could be fun and it is somewhat of an insider tip among some people. Fairly generic but just about average. There are so many better games out there that you can spend your money on.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Hell yes! It has a rather big community and it's an awesome game! I recommend! Bought it for the original price it had on launch day :P (50$ i think)
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Very large community, good servers too."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Well you could get just the base game for $5. And that is DEFINITELY worth it. The Vietnam expansion is fun, dunno if I played it enough to warrant $5, but I'm glad I have it."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,If I can run COD 4 can I run this?
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,[deleted]

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Every time I watch gameplay footage of Big Rigs, I burst into a fit of giggles. How was that game ever released?"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,[deleted]
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I'm a sad panda.  This was the one game I wanted above all else.  Truth be told all I've bought was Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, and I am still debating on if the Assassin's Creed pack is worth it to me or not. "
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,This is the first sale in ages that Mirror's Edge has not been a $5 steam daily deal. I'm sorry for your loss :/
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,[deleted]
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"If you don't own those games already, this pack is the best value you can get for your pc."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"On an average day, Portal 2 is the same price as the discounted Valve pack. Some of the games like the Half Life series you won't get around to playing immediately, but if you ever play any one other game on that list then you're getting a great discount."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"You pick your class and skills and become mayor of this town. You must defend it from raiders and open up new areas by killing the monsters at these various points of the map. Many of the areas will award you with resources and treasure which you will need to not only expand your town but keep the king who is helping you happy.

As you build new buildings and improve others; people will visit your town and you will have to recruit them to run the various buildings. The blacksmith, the hunter, inn keeper ect. they'll all have their own stats and abilities, and you can equip them as you like. You can even take two of them along with you to fight some of the areas. Many of which you you'll need back up for anyways. But be careful because if they die they're dead for good."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Core i7 920, gta 285 1gb, 6gb ram. No problems maxed out 1080p. Installed some mods and using the simple trainer. Worth it if you don't have the DLC, TBoGT was a great DLC which resolved the GTA IV story, TLAD was mediocre but also adds to the story.

Recommend if you don't have the DLC or if you don't mind playing it. The mods on it are cool, I only run the environment mod, enbseries is also good and tons of vehicle mods too."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Friend has it, plays flawlessly. There are also tons of mods out there.  Works with Steam version."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"It's probably the worst PC port (One of the 2 ""unplayable"" games, the other one being Civ4 for Mac) I have on Steam. I've gone through the issues before but you need a quad-core CPU and a top-of-the-range GPU to run it at medium settings.

That's if you're lucky enough to get all the DRM working. First there's SecuROM which is completely hit-and-miss. Next is Rockstar Social Club which used to be mandatory but now I believe it is only required if you want to render and upload replay videos. The most problematic one is GFWL though. I recommend using the ""xliveless"" DLL and ignoring the multiplayer completely because GFWL is just not worth the hassle.

Other than that, it's a pretty good city sandbox game with a large modding scene."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,It looks like they changed the price to 14.99.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I know right? I bought it on that first daily sale and now its a cheaper daily sale? Not cool Steam, not cool."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,[deleted]
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"The price got ""fixed"". It's 15 bucks again :("
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"it's a free game, not sure how much more worth it it can be over cosmetic shit."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Worth $0? Yes it's worth $0.  Better to get that than some hat.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"worth three tickets?  I haven't played it, but I don't think it's much to lose"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I bought the first one a while back before the second and third one were released and enjoyed it quite a bit. It does get repetitive at times (almost every single object revolves around fixing some quad-recipitator doohicky that's malfunctioning), but the gameplay feels well paced. I ended up playing it for a few hours at a time when I was bored and enjoyed the experience."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,its free why not?
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I did.  Alien Breed is a lot like the style of Alien Swarm, just not as slick and polished.  Kinda like Space Siege, you are just moving through the story trying to survive.

Bought the first one, never felt like putting money into the new ones, but for free it is a solid game and is fun if you like that style."

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Yes. There are plenty of mods at the Fallout Nexus - graphics improvements, making hardcore mode more worthy of the name, and more."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I was in the same position. The mods make it much more fun. I thought it was worth it, and I've been playing for a few days with no buyer's remorse."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Yes
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Yes if yo like co-op Player vs Environment games, and the idea of leveling up your character appeals to you."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,It's pretty cool. Not bad for $10 at all
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Yes, I missed the daily deal too and bought it for $10. I love it."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I've messed with it a few times, and it doesn't seem all that great. It's like an unpolished L4D."

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,deffo
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I did the exact same thing, hadn't really heard much about it and missed it when it was 5 bucks. Broke down pretty much the next day and bought it for 10, and it is tons of fun. Tons of dark, creepy maps with unique looking monsters and some of the best gunplay in any first person shooter. Definitely worth a pickup. "
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"II & Brotherhood both require you to have a Uplay account and be online when you first launch the game. They removed the always-on DRM, however."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Do I still have to be online all the time to play it or did they patch it?
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"2 and brotherhood are both amazing games, definite buy"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,All three are some of my favorite games.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Without a doubt. The first game was an interesting introduction to the concept but pretty flawed (not enough to do) but the second fixed those issues and Brotherhood improved further. The games are just fun and the multiplayer in Brotherhood is totally unique, making it worth trying at the very least."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,The Holiday sale is even more epic than this one...so I suggest you start saving :P.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I liked it, I hope they do it with every sale. It made getting the achievements seem like a worthwhile use of my time since they only pick 100 people to win their wishlist out of a few million steam users."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"It's actually $15 when you go to try and buy it, the 7.49 is a mistake it seems."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I bought Dawn Of War II: Retribution the last standalone for 15 a couple months ago, this sale upgraded it to the full version for free."

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,[removed]
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,It never gets old.  Well technically they have discounted some of the TF2 items haven't they? :)
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,If you've waited this long and are interested in the DLC just wait for the GOTY edition.

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Did you like Fallout 3?  Were you let down by the quests in Fallout 3?  New Vegas is MUCH better quest wise, and I liked the ""Western"" feel to it too.  Fallout 3 was better exploration wise.  I liked Vegas more than Fallout 3, but I do miss Fallout 3's exploration.  

Mods and patches will fix all the issues you hear about btw.

From what I heard, AC:B is Assassin's Creed 2.5, so if you loved 2 you'll probably love that game.  "

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,I don't know why you are getting down voted but steam screwed up on that sale. 
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"That is a shame, because this game is COMPLETELY worth it at $10. I've put somewhere near 70 hours into it, made a server with several of my friends. It's been a blast, and $5 makes it all the more better."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,"halfway up from here there is some people sharing there steam id's to play with but when I added mine there was only about 5. But ya if there isn't one we totally should start one... anywho here's mine feel free to add me!!

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I really enjoyed both AC2 and ACB. Overall i think that brotherhood was more fun, but Im not sure if its 3 times the price better. If i had to buy 1 I would choose AC2"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,I would go with 2 over brotherhood.  I can't really say why but I had more fun doing the collections and town building in 2 than I did in brotherhood.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I'd say number 2 because the story of Brotherhood follows on from it. Yes you can read the story, but you'll be at a bit of a disconnect in comparison.

Plus, it's cheaper."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"AC2 > ACB. 
To me the new mechanics felt sort of cheap and took away from some of the tension. AC2 also has a better overall story IMO.

However the ACB multiplayer is quite interesting. I would honestly just get all 3."

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"PC Controls are absolutely fine. You need to get into the controls at the beginning of the game but you will master them after a maximum of 2 hours.

2 - 3 - 1 is the ranking you want. If you want to know why, I would play them chronologically anyway though that isn't necessary storywise. "
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I beat the first one since buying on day one of this sale, it's a decent old-school RPG, though it has some annoyances (which can be gone around by it's cheaty and quick save system). 

Make sure to drop points into divination, being able to heal yourself and buff your armor is very worth it throughout the game. I found elemental magic to be nearly worthless except for the spell air shield which keeps most projectile attacks from hitting you."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Pretty enjoyable old school RPG. Like how the different skills change the gameplay. If you put a lot of points into cartography for instance, lots of map details will be revealed."

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Steampunk JRPGs. First one is ""meh"", the second one is better in just about every respect. Combat a bit too easy and grindy, is the only downside.

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"No, the series gets progressively worse with each game. More dumbed down, and easier. 

They are all worth playing imo, but I can not recommend it for $25 (my brother nabbed a used 360 copy from gohastings for $13 recently)"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"No. The series is steadily falling in quality.

Your money (albeit a tad more) is better spent on the Witcher 2"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I posted this reply to another person in the thread, so here it is:

""From what I played of it on the Xbox 360, I would recommend against buying it. The game is a massive step backwards from Fable 2, which was a definite step backwards from Fable 1. If they had similar graphics, one could easily mistake Fable 3 as being the first in the series because of how lacking it is in comparison."""
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,A lot of mods don't work right with the newest patch so the Steam version isn't the best option.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I bought it for the same reason as you (on GFWL, not Steam) and it was a very bad port. I have two Radeon HD 6970s in Crossfire with an i7 2600k processor and when I move the camera on the game, my framerate drops from 60 to under 10 until the camera stops moving. The game constantly lags despite my powerful machine due to very poor optimization. I've had nothing but problems since I've started playing it. The PS3 version was very smooth, the mods are not worth trading the smoothness and troubleshooting headaches of the game in my opinion."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,">Managed to pick up Portal 2, Half Life 2 : Eps 1 & 2, L4D2

You bought the Valve Complete pack, right?"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Get VVVVVV, it's challenging and fun as hell, and the music is brilliant. It's also great for when you just want to play something where you don't have a lot of time or want to get to in-depth (like with an RPG)."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Witcher 2 is fantastic! Much better than the first one (graphically, story wise both have their own merits). It's a gorgeous and very mature game. It treats you like an adult in themes and decisions in the game. Buy it if you like RPGs! I bought it full price on gog.com and I don't regret it."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"The story is self contained, so you won't feel like you are missing much in the second.  It does make a few references back to the events in the first and does not spend the first hour explaining what a Witcher is and their back story like the first game.  It also does not hold your hand as much as other games, so read the help section to learn how to do things before you get too far in the game.  Combat is greatly improved over the first.  I beat my first play though in about 17 hours, only doing about half of the side quests.  Their are 3 acts and each one changes based off your prior decisions and a total of 16 different endings so good replay value.  Over all I would say it is the best story of any game I have played this year. "

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,"If you don't want to risk it, don't. BC2 has been at that price before and will likely be in the future. It needs a powerful rig to run it, much more than L4D2 does. Trust me, your computer won't handle it. "

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I saw that one, but was unsure if I should pick it up. Guess I should check it out."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"If you're not a big follower of Penny Arcade, is Precipice of Darkness still good?"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"This is also the first time I've seen VtM:B on sale for the past...ever. If you do end up picking it up, be sure to get Wesp5's unofficial patch.  Troika went out of business pretty much right after it was released, but the fans have released dozens of patches, adding cut content, fixing bugs, and other such wonderful things. My only advice is to NOT play Malkavian your first playthrough-you'll ruin all further runs by starting with the best clan first."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I haven't tried it yet, but I hope I don't feel the same way. I don't have any nostalgia for the games, but I've played and enjoyed that type of game before.

I'll let you know when I try it."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,"After an initial playing of about thirty minutes I can say two things:

1) I enjoy ""The Longest Journey"" so far.
2) There's nothing wrong with you for not enjoying it.

""The Longest Journey"" is quite slow so far, but I don't mind it because I've grown up playing adventure games that work in much the same way. I can't make a verdict on whether I'll continue to enjoy it or not because I've only played until the first time the main character ""wakes up"" so far, but I enjoy the scenery and the mystery of it all.

Like I said earlier though, the game is quite slow and it hasn't aged well in the CGI or graphics departments. The beautiful landscape I've seen so far has its own charm, but the whole thing does feel a bit dated.

I guess we'll see if I'm getting into it after the first three hours or not.

Honestly, my judgement might be clouded a bit by nostalgia. I grew up on adventure games like this and continue to play and enjoy many of them to this day. "

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,I found this out too. Thank goodness for demos.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Well that seals it for me. Thanks for the heads up.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Also note that it plays very slowly on my laptop with 8400mGS. A friend with an 8600mGT also saw problems. Unless you have something better you might want to say clear.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Most of the other DLC isn't all that impressive. Vietnam is really fun, though."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,That is something I am interested in knowing!
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I'm on the fence about getting it.  I looked over the DLC and nothing but [Mashlands](http://store.steampowered.com/app/73033/?snr=1_5_9__405) (zombies!) and [Vietnam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/42918/?snr=1_5_9__405) seem to add playable levels for co-op.  Can someone verify this or correct me if I'm wrong?

Also, there's no discount for buying all the DLC as a pack.  I don't think adding bonus items to characters seems fair really, but the [wizard set](http://store.steampowered.com/app/73030/?snr=1_5_9__405) is only 33 cents right now.  And the [party robes](http://store.steampowered.com/app/901679/?snr=1_5_9__405) seem to allow you to differentiate your character some more and give a little more of a role to play during co-op.

Edit: I would like to play it at some point, but the other option is to wait for a GotY edition that includes all DLC.
Edit: Another reason to hold off for the next sale would be to wait for bug fixes. [[1]](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ilokd/steam_summer_camp_sale_day_11_useful/c24rezw) [[2]](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ilokd/steam_summer_camp_sale_day_11_useful/c24rgp6)"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Just get everything, most of the DLC (apart from Vietnam and Marshlands) does not add much (usually a map and some swag), but it's cheap as hell."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Dont buy magicka complete, the vietnam is fun, none of the other stuff is worth it."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,you can start a multiplayer game and random peeps will join.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I havent played in a while, but there's no matchmaking system like L4D, just a simple server browser. "

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Didn't think I'd love it, but it was so cheap I bought it anyways. Ended up playing through it all in one sitting."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,"Yep, I was really impressed with the music (among many other things). Very retro and well done. "
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,You just sold the game to me.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"The artist also sells the soundtrack on his website, [here](http://www.souleye.se/pppppp)"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,"Truly fantastic stuff, game looks like its from atari, but the music takes me back to my NES days. "
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Oh, come on. You link to the hardest trinket in the game, a completely *optional* challenge, and say that represents the game?

If you ignore that trinket (like I and many others probably should have) the game's difficulty is very manageable and satisfying, thanks to the frequent checkpoints."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"You do know you can get tickets for the previous days, right?"

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Thanks for reminding me! I had forgotten about that.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,"I downloaded the demo when I was still on XP. Fast forward a few months, got a new rig with Windows 7. Played the demo, got to the 30 minute cut off, restarted, wash, rinse, repeat. 4 hours later, I was determined to buy the full game! 

Its a fun game, and I'm sure it'll go on sale again. It's definitely worth the asking price. Add it to your wishlist, so you'll notice it's on sale when you finally buy Windows7+."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,This.  Kind of silly they don't have compatibility for XP :(
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Yeah also unless you live in the deserts of Sudan with electricity.  Might want to avoid this game.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"It runs on my rig running XP. Just sayin'.

edit: I was thinking of FarCry2, which I bought. But I really wanted to buy JustCause2. FML."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,A gaming rig with XP is not a gaming rig.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"That's how I felt when I found JC1 for Xbox in the Circuit City bargain bin for $3.  After the Bethesda open-world RPGs, JC is the Xbox game I've logged the most time in.  Dunno why I haven't bought the sequel yet."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Don't you have to complete it first before you can mess around like that?
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"That's exactly how it's been for me, too. However, there is one exception.  I just completed a mission that involved destroying some satellites on top of these towers then setting a couple of explosives on a radio tower at the top of the center tower. When I blew up the last tower, I had to jump off the building to survive. Well, as I was falling with my parachute, the screen greyed out and I was falling without my parachute suddenly. I ended up dying and when I revived, I couldn't use my parachute at all anymore. So the game has lost a lot of it's fun cause I use that parachute a lot when travelling around and climbing things. I'm having trouble convincing myself it's worth getting back in to because I was about 40-50% through the game when this happened and I don't want to restart from the beginning..."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"If you're gonna get any of them, get the Black Market Boom Pack. Why? Because the Air Propulsion Gun is the most hilariously awesome gun in any video game ever: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUQbqzX6ZAI"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I bought the monster truck. 

It plays exactly like you would expect a monster truck with a mounted grenade launcher in an open-world carnival of destruction would play, plus the tires make it float when you accidentally drive it off of a bridge and into the ocean. "
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I bought the DLC when it was on sale and it was fun to play around with. I prefer the rifle to the normal assault rifle but it's semi auto. Having to buy the boosters every time was what finally made me use the money cheat though.

100% not necessary, but I'd pay a quarter for them again just for having the bit of extra fun I did and the better rifle."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"For this price especially, it's a ton of fun.  Like others have mentioned, even if you don't play the missions, you can just wreak havoc around the island with reckless abandon. My only problem is that I put it on hardcore difficulty and am constantly searching for bullets."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"The Ariel Pack is pretty decent, especially the parachute thrusters; managed to stay in the air for about an hour (yes I was very bored) with them. Can't comment on the others though."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Black Market Boom Pack. Air Propulsion Gun. You know you want this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUQbqzX6ZAI
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Open the game and play it from a different perspective. The sheer beauty of the wide open landscapes brings me back to the game. Forget the missions, just explore all the areas."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Completely unnecessary, but if you buy now you get a monster truck with an infinite grenade launcher for a quarter, so if that sounds like a good deal then I'd say go nuts and explode all the things. "
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,You won't miss anything if you haven't played the first.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,It was on sale. The final day is a recap of most popular sales from previous days.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Download the demo, also on Steam"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I bought all of them except rico's gun, they are well worth it imo. More toys to play with on your gigant playground island "
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"That sounds tough. I have a E5300 2.5 GHz, Radeon 4670, and 4 GB of RAM and I had to cut down the resolution quite a bit before I could get a high enough framerate to make playing well possible.

For reference: my video card has about 3x the PassMark score that yours does. I'm not sure what the main bottleneck for JC2 is, but if you have plans to get a new computer any time soon do buy it. If not... it'll be on sale again one day."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,"I hear the pc port of GTA 4 runs horribly on most PCs unless you tweak the hell out of it.  Haven't played it, so can't comment on the gameplay, but what I do know is that Just Cause 2 is a smashing good time."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Voice acting sucks and story is sub par. But the gameplay more than makes up for it.

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,The Steam Team!
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,I agree. I was really hoping for a drop on this.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I agree with both of you, tbh. Great game, even if a little buggy. But I'm sure it is showing its age by now."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Indeed, really enjoyed a replay through it as a Malkavian."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,"Errm.. no don't.  The devs aren't the only one worth supporting in the gaming ecosystem.  The publishers and store fronts earn their keep by making the game available over the long haul, supporting it, etc.  The devs have to move on in order to keep making a living, but there's precious little they can do to keep a game alive to new players."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Yes, I've played it ~5 hours single player since getting it the other day.  Well worth the couple of bucks."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I've played quite a bit of single and multiplayer, both are amazing. Granted multi is nicer with some companionship but it is far from unplayable on singleplayer. Worth the pennies, pick it up!"
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I bought it earlier in the week.  I've had a lot of fun with it in single player.  I could see how it would be more fun in multi, but it's still great if you're on your own."

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Were you playing solo?  Co-op made it a lot more fun to me.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"The presentation is anything other than uninteresting, even if you don't personally like the style."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I was also seriously bored. The combat is entirely bland and uninspired, the game world feels horribly 2D and empty and the story and missions are very dull. If you want to play co-op FPS just stick to Left 4 Dead (the RPG elements in Borderlands are effectively grind with little interesting reward, so that negates any advantage it would have over L4D in that department)."

If you're missing a significant portion of the games, the pack is absolutely worth it.  Hell, if you're just missing Portal 2 and a handful of others it's *still* worth it."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I bought GTA IV last week when it was on sale for ten bucks.  Saturday night LoL was down and I decided to go ahead and play.  Declined the retarded Rockstar Social Club.  Spent 20 minutes reinstalling DX9 (I guess my version wasn't up to date?  Maybe it downgraded).  Watched some choppy video (surprised... this isn't a hot gaming laptop but it's no slouch), got to the apartment and it tried to auto save.  Fail!  Have to sign into GFWL to save the game.  

After I figured out my old password, it then decided an upgrade to GFWL was required.  This update took another 10-15 minutes to choke through on my Fiber connection, then informed me I needed to shut down the game to finish the install.  Sure!  Let me save.... oh wait.  All in all I wasted about 50 minutes trying to play my new, legally purchased GTA IV.  And then I decided I really wasn't that interested in playing, and went and read a book.

I may try again.  I guess I've already invested the time, but frankly, when I want to play a game, I want to play it now.  It's not some nebulous desire to play a game at some point in the future."

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Also to add to this, 2 does a great job of summarizing 1's story so you don't have to put yourself through the monotony."
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-11,My hope for the holiday sale is that since the big name games will have just released they won't be on sale so there won't be much I want.

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,I'm surprised how fluid the controls are with the mouse.  I'm gonna play that now...
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,Yes. I've never read any of the Penny Arcade comics besides random ones  and I loved the hell out of both episodes. The humor makes the game phenomenal. But the battles are turn based so if you don't like those kinds of games you might not enjoy it. Though for $1.80 I still think you should give it a try.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"I'd say yes. The price certainly helps, but I'm usually not a fan of ""just buy it because it's cheap"". There's some genuinely funny stuff and it's worth it for that alone. The actual gameplay is there more for the sake of it and I wonder how much sense it made to turn it into an RPG in the first place (I wished they just turned it into a classic point-and-click adventure where story can equal gameplay). But it's still worth it."

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,You'll be a little lost I think. I'd recommend playing the whole series if possible. I absolutely loved it.
ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"Definitely start with 1 so you understand the story. There are basicly 2 storylines in each game it seems (I'm on the second one now). You have a ""real-world"" story which develops the main character Desmond Miles. And then you have a story which he gets to relive in the Animus as two of his ancestors (Altaïr and Ezio in the three games). If you don't play the first game you lose out on the story that explains the basis to the series. Aka who the factions are, why they are conducting these Animus experiments.. Etc. The second game literally picks off directly where the first one ends. All that said, the first game is the worst of the lot. It's far more repetitive than the sequels, but well worth it just for the story of a far greater experience :). Hope that helped."

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"It's terrible, the game has serious development issues, the story was very rough cut. It starts out pretty good and gives you a good feeling, but as it draws out you come to understand that this is a shell of a game, and that the brilliant start never really materializes in the rest of the game. 

I did like the flashbacks, the way flashbacks were implemented was different and cool. 

This is a horror game, it has nice graphics and so on but it also has some really awkward quality issues and just plain dumb development that lacks polish. For example a lot of env is just cut and pasted, stuff just appear out of no where with no reason to appear other than... uh we r teh baddies spawning on your le head... it's not very coherent with the rest of the direction the game originally took.

The only thing the game was good for was showing off some graphics of then Nvidia cards (Thus why it was bundled free).


Edit: You get the game free with the following [EVGA cards](http://www.evga.com/articles/00471/cryostasisparts.asp) ( [Cryostasis free](http://www.evga.com/articles/00471/) ) and possibly other NV partners. Not sure if this still works."

ilokd,2011-07-10,2011-07-10,"> I play mostly on steam, but I can play in offline if I choose so, or something happens to my internet connection.

Steam doesn't actually have a definitive FAQ on this subject so correct me if I'm wrong.

As far as I know, you can't enter offline mode unless your client is set to automatically log you in. You also can't be offline for more than 30 days (?) and your game/Steam must be fully patched (which might not be what you want and turning automatic updates off can be finicky).

All in all, offline mode seems to work the best if you preemptively know that you need to be offline and can switch to offline mode manually and cleanly. Stories about people being locked out of their games are but a Google search away.

> I could play any game of my choosing, thanks to offline mode

Don't you mean despite Steam's nearly always online DRM? You almost make it seem like a plus when surely the benchmark should be no DRM at all?"
