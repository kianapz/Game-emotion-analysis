Pharao was the first Total War I didn't buy early on in a LONG time (I waited until the price drop). And it's a very meh Total War game even for the lowered price.",52
The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"This is great BUT also an edge case since the vast majority of the playerbase are adults.  

In most games the playerbase is a lot younger. Yes, even for 18+ games. Hell, my, at the time 8 year old, niece loved to play gta 5. She didnt play any of the story. She would just drive around occasionally hitting people only to inevitably have her car hit the water and then id have to get her back on dry land.  

Kids dont care how expensive something is. They dont care how its made or who had to suffer for it. All they care about is that they want it and their walking, talking atm called ""mommy"" and ""daddy"" WILL buy it for them.",103

Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"I used to really love total war, played a lot of medieval, viking conquest, Rome, and medieval 2 when in school.  I was thinking about trying the more recent entries a while back and saw the price for the ""complete"" version with dlc was astronomical even with the steam summer sale.  Seemed like they copied Paradox's pricing model where you get the base game for $30 or whatever and then all the dlc costs costs well over $100.",24

The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,So I'd like to explain the situation for the people who got confused. For the Total War Warhammer major bug fixes come with new DLC and not until a DLC release game Devs don't put much effort into fixing bugs and other game breaking things. When people said we won't buy those shitty overpriced DLC's Devs said if you don't buy the DLC we're afraid we won't be making any and this means there's no update (bug fixes and improvements) for the game. They basically threatened to kill the game.,3
The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,I feel gaming is where it is right now largely due to 'gamers' as a whole having very poor impulse control and no patience. Why does every game have early access now? Battlepasses? Launch DLC? Microtransactions? Because we can't say no.,3

The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"Its easier for niche communities since they are more focused on one game and knows the in and outs of it.

Its more of a shitshow for other stuff since the silent minority that doesn't even care about most of this stuff its the one buying the game.

Still big W for them.",3
The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"I've been doing this since Rome:TW2. The amount of factions available at launch was shit, but they were very quick to introduce dlc to add more.


CA are scumbags and I made a point not to give them any money since. Plenty of other good games out there.",7
The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"I mean, this really is great to see, and a 250% increase in DLC pricing is nuts.

But there also wasn’t anything in that first linked “DLC Statement” that even vaguely approached “threatening the fanbase”. Hyperbole and exaggeration just makes it easier to ignore as “the gamers are big mad again”.",10
The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"> basically threatening the fanbase:

""Finally, we need to ask you again to stop directing abuse at individual team members. Frustrated as you may get, these are human beings who spend many hours representing you and your voices within the studio. All of our work gets easier when they are treated with respect.""

As the owner of a development company, let me tell you.  I welcome input from my customers.  If you aren't satisfied with our product I will bust my ass to do everything I can for you and make you happy.

However, there is a line.  If you are abusive to my employees, I don't want/need you as a customer.  The only thing worse than that is when people defend such jackassery.  In this example, overzealous fans went too far, and the COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE response from CA is being mislabeled as ""threatening"".

I'm glad Creative Assembly made their fans happy.  There are good customers who genuinely deserved it.  CA made no threats, and if you think for a second that the insults and threats made by the community were the impetuous for the change.... you're part of the problem.

Here's to hoping /u/Capt_C004 removes/revises that inaccuracy.",7

The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"Total War games have been a shit show upon release for many titles now.  But you all keep getting so exciting and buying them on day 1.  I love the games, but they really were (I haven't bought the last few now) just so bad and very slowly patched, and some things were left unpatched and left to modders.

Everyone encouraged them slowly, they didn't get there all in one go.  If games are repeatably released in a bad way, stop bloody buying them so early.  Wait for patches, wait for a sale or you're part of the reason they keep escalating in their shitty behaviours.",2

The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"I still think it was ridiculous when I saw that you literally couldnt play the immortal empires mode if you didnt own the other games in the series.

even more ridiculous that there were a lot of people defending it.


Its not that you couldnt play certain empires, you _literally couldnt play the fucking mode at all_ unless you had the other games in your steam library. Its like if age of empires said you couldnt play matches other than the campaign if you didnt own all the other age of empires game in your steam library.

for reference, immortal empires is where you pick an empire and try to win the game, separate from the story campaign. In my opinion its pretty much the ""standard"" way of playing that you will spend most of your time in.

I was going to buy it but I was like fuck no that is some straight up bullshit. They deserve to have their shit pirated.",2

The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"I’ve played since Rome total war 1. Amazing game, then since I’ve logged over 2000 hours on medieval 2 . And I’ve played Rome 2 and warhammer 2. They were okay. Medieval 2 just keeps pulling me back. There’s some problems, but the character management is so much better. I don’t know what it is about the graphics they changed and the building trees but I don’t like the new ones as much.  There’s a feeling in the games that they lost trying to improve the graphics and monetize it. I’ll Lee playing medieval 2 over and over unless something comes out otherwise.",2
The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"I have bought every single total war game, until the last few. Their greed just made the games so much worse than they were. Where it started to go downhill was the warhammer games. 

I bought the first and some DLC and really enjoyed it. I then bought the second, but I didn’t get any DLC. The price of the game and the price of the DLC was just too much. And it now started to feel like they were putting a lot of content behind a pay wall. I haven’t touched the 3rd warhammer, as the price was crazy, for essentially something that could have been considered a large expansion pack 20-25 years ago. They were wanted £45 I think it was upon release, and they already had factions behind a DLC paywall. 

Pharaoh, yeh I wasn’t touching that. Everyone knew it was a cut down game they wanted full price for. How they thought they would get away with it, I don’t know. 

Bring back the days of Medievel and Rome total war. How many playable factions did those games have on release? 20? Then a game like Empire with so many factions and a huge map. 

They are going to have to work hard to get me to buy the next one.",2

Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"Still mad at them about this: Total War Warhammer 1-2-3, which is you know about friggen' WARHAMMER, comes default with no blood in the game for units when they are fighting. That in itself is preposterous and indefensible IMO.  

But they got around scorn by releasing, for free, a DLC that added back the blood. Okay fine.

I got back into it for Warhammer 3 and started playing but just around the time I felt I was going to be hooked I decided man without the blood this is lame. I would wait for the free DLC.

Then it arrived and it wasn't fucken free. Bastards.",2

The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"They won what?

We've not had a decent Total War game since 2015. All we've had is attempts at catering to new audiences except for Thrones of Britannia and Pharaoh, which were both much smaller 'Saga' titles.

* Warhammer fans - Shitty fantasy aimed at dudes who've never seen real tits.
* Superhero (general) fans - Someone at CA had a Marvel hard-on and made all their games feature one-man army units.
* Chinese market - Dynasty Warriors sim. Records mode is a mess of a joke and built for romance.

Total War is very much still dead and it'll remain so until we get back to pre-Warhammer mechanics. A shame really because mechanically Pharaoh isn't that bad, it's just a piss poor scope.",2

There was so much negativity that Pharaoh was dead in the water. It's apparently a fine game from players I know who've played it. 

Creative also has a big problem - they basically resell the same fucking game the last 20 years with a few design changes. In WH3 they tried to be ambitious and change it with a new siege minigame. The problem is SIEGES FUCKING SUCK and that minigame sucked

They also tried this quest-like system with the previous chaos lord expansion - which I found fine, but players rebelled against it too. Half the player base just wants more of the same thing, the other half is bored of the same thing.",1

People expected CA would ride this high into an even greater high.

Then Warhammer 3 came along, the game was released with a narrative campaign that was so hated the #1 mod removed the whole narrative mechanic. Things were also pretty buggy as you expect a AAA game released to be and they didn’t immediately release the game mode that combined all 3 games like how game 2 did. 

Even with some tweaking when they did release it things were still very buggy and feeling lacking. Some good but more expensive DLCs came out that were generally received well despite higher cost complaints amidst the unfixed bugs. The players felt they deserved a game in a better state for how much they were paying into it and how good it was in the last game.

Then shadows of changed came, the trailer and let’s plays were poorer quality than usual, It looked like it was lacking things, had more powercreep than anything else we saw and it was way more priced than any other dlc we got. The community was furious at this greedy cash grab while our game was broken with many things unaddressed for so long many just said fuck it. What was worse was the apology letter from leader ship saying “making games expensive yo just give us the money” made more people not buy it. 

They finally released a real apology some months ago and people received it well but were waiting for real results. After the news of what they were adding it seems like they took the lesson, for now.",1

Unless they do a big change of direction and rebuild from scratch (there are reports that the games are build with tools that are considered ancient in IT terms, especially regarding bugfixing), it will stay mediocre at best.

Not alot of whales compared to the average consumer. If they do adjust to mostly whales, they'll be taking bigger risks or downsizing until it's not manageable.

I really think the big issue is uninformed consumers and deep apathy. Whales are definitely a problem, but one that can be worked around if the other half of the free market, the only regulators, respect themselves more, enough to not let companies take advantage of them. Eventually even some whales will see the hired addiction expert's damages done and also step back.

Currently though, we gotta start making people see they deserve better. That we all deserve better.

* Warhammer assets are fairly complex and detailed graphics-wise + audio work isn't free either

Sadly most of the DLC for Total Warhammer 3, the current big game, tends to be mostly new factions and leaders. They'll have their own individual mechanics to a degree but there's nothing that will change the overall game or add new layers to it the way something like La Resistance does for HOI4.

The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"It sort of needs context that OP didn't give. 

First, TW:WH3 isn't a stand-alone game. In a lot of ways, the Warhammer games are all one constantly evolving game. Owning one on the same account unlocks all previous content for it in the next. Perhaps the best way to conceptualise this, is to imagine game 1 is based in notEurope, game 2 features NotAfrica, NotAmericas and a bit more. By owning game 1, game 2 unlocks a free mode where you get a super combined map. So understand WH3 isn't just a game, to a lot of people it is supposed to be the culmination of multiple years of gaming and something they knew had been coming since the very begining.  

CA had a hugely successful game called 3 Kingdoms based of a period of Chinese history and with a popular following, including a tv series. They went hard after the Chinese market with it, and succeeded. Leaked sales numbers suggested it was the best-selling base Total War game of all time. 

DLC has been a thing for Total War games for a while and generally it is pretty accepted, people still get very angry with Day 1 DLC, but for the most part the additions every 6ish months to add content is welcome. 

For 3k CA made shit DLC that the 3k fanbase didn't want, again the 3 kingdoms era was well covered in other media and CA did their own thing that nobody was interested in. The DLC sales were awful. CA then release a video/blog that was originally called 'The future of TW Three Kingdoms' where they announced that due to poor sales, they were killing all support for the game, all bug fixes, any future DLC, all gone. 

While there is somewhat of a divide between fans of the Fantasy games like Warhammer and the historical games like Empire/Rome/Medieval, the entire fanbase saw what happened to 3k. TW:WH3 has been in a truly dire state for much of its life. So bad, even influencers who had early access were reluctant to recommend it.

So when fans read 'However, this is the business reality of supporting WARHAMMER III and ensuring we’re able to offer the years of extra content that are currently planned.' 

The fanbase reads, buy the DLC or your game gets 3ked, and we leave it in this near-unplayable state. CA doesn't have a good history of releasing games in the best state, but their DLC team that does the Quality of Life improvements has historically done a great job of constantly improving the games to the point of greatness.",86

The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"Something no one is mentioning is that WH3 was released very buggy, and when the ""if you don't buy our DLCs then we won't support the game with updates or DLCs"" post was made, several features of WH3 were considered broken. As an example, one of the 40 or so main characters you can play is named Nakai and he is all about these giant reptilian crocodiles called Kroxigors. That's his whole schtick. The other lizardmen characters can recruit them too but his are best. Except... he couldn't recruit them at all. That's a just-shy-of-game-breaking bug for his whole campaign.

So it wasn't just a logical ""if you don't want our DLC, we'll stop making more"" statement, it was also a ""we'll not fix the major bugs in the game *you already bought and paid for*"" threat.",2

In Empire, there was NOTHING like that, and I loved it so much. In Shogun 2, the generals could eventually get an ability where they would like sit down in the middle of the battle and chill, and it provided a huge morale bonus to their command radius, and I thought it was kinda broken but hilarious. The focus was always on the troops, maneuvering, and morale. 

Both can be good. But I don't want to see an Empire 2 where the generals kill droves of men by wading into melee combat. I just want to research rank fire and see my front rows kneel when they reload. Much like a warhammer without heroes and magic would seem off.",2

The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"There’s a few other distinguishing factors with Paradox as well:

- Paradox’s development cycles are pushing a decade for each of its series. EU IV and HOI IV are 11 and 8 years old, respectively. CK III and Victoria III are each relatively new but replaced prior games which had been around for 8 and 12 years. You get a long lifespan out of Paradox games, so spending $40 base + $100 (or more) in DLC is well worth it on a per-hours-played basis, IMO. 

- Paradox DLC tends to mechanically overhaul its games in addition to adding some new flavor content. The EU IV I play today with piles of DLC is incredibly different from the game I bought in 2014.

- Paradox’s historical strategy games are all mechanically *very* different from one another, and even sequels within the same series regularly introduce significant mechanical adjustments.

Also, you are underselling it a lot by calling this a simple price hike to adjust to inflation. They went from 10€ for 2 sub-factions to 25€ for 3, and the 3 had less content than usual. Also these DLCs used to come with a Free DLC subfaction, but that wasn't the case this time.

This total war game is actually based on an older Warhammer fantasy timeline that the publishers abandoned long ago - they rebooted fantasy into an Age of Sigmar that changed everything

The fans also prefer Warhammer 40k, the fantasy stuff is very 80s. 

If you want to read, Gotrek & Felix: The First Omnibus is what I recommend",3
The Total War fan base won and made the greedy developer back track. Customers win when they vote with their dollars!,15798,"To add to the other replies, you should also note the difference between Warhammer Fantasy (WHF) and Warhammer 40k (WH40k). They are similar in many ways, but WHF has a much more traditional foundation in fantasy tropes.  WH40k, while not free of sci-fi tropes or borrowed archetypes, manages to set itself off as something unique.

Wiki reading for general background is free and a good place to start.  The Black Library pushes out novels constantly, but they tend to be limited prints which means they're expensive and hard to get in physical editions.  A few of the Omnibuses are widely accepted enough to be readily available.  *Eisenhorn* and *The Founding,* both by Dan Abnett, give a glimpse, respectively, into the world of an Inquisitor and a company of the Imperial Guard. 

Game-wise, Darktide and Vermintide give perfect slices of the Warhammer ambiance, however they are a very specific type of game that won't appeal to everyone.  The recently released Rogue Trader CRPG is also a good choice for building a general foundation of understanding.  Mechanicus is another decent game that puts you in the world of the Omnisiah and the Tech-priests.  

And naturally, youtube has lots of options for people explaining lore or compile edits of cinematics done for games/media over the years.  The Astartes Project is often cited as a major lure to people WH-curious.

But what made me play hours upon hours of Rome and Empire total war, was that each nation had difference in borders and challenges. I could play as an expanding Rome, an declining Selecuids or ''barbarians'' just making their own homes. I could play an economic focused Ottoman empire, not expanding just developing. Or an expansive Austria, taking the ports of the Ottomans to access trading ports.

Now I did absolutely adore Shogun 2, however I didn't feel any need to play a varity of factions. They were so similar, 1 (2 sometimes) province, 1 stack of rebels. Expansion into similar sized neighbours. And then an midgame with just an natural progression which was pretty similar whatever place you started. And then an endgame which was better than the stale lategame in Rome. However it also just ruined the diplomacy in my eyes, after my first time I simply viewed everyone as enemies to be cut down to size and destroyed. In Rome i could pay off some pesky barbarians i didn't care to send an army to destroy or foster good relations while i expanded into richer land. But in Shogun 2, I rather just expand everywhere, as if i don't they will backstabb me anyway.

On the other side ck3 was an amazing foundation for the CK series and the subsequent content was good but rather sparce, but with the recent announcement it looks like the scale of content is growing.

Considering CK is probally the closest in form to a potential total-war esque then I would be optimistic for paradox to develop such a title. But that also means that it is definitely not going to happen, CK is already a great game and releasing another similar title wouldnt make any sense.",9

That logic doesn't remotely apply to Warhammer. The pieces are just plastic bits that you ALREADY HAVE TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION to make matter whatsoever. Why would you pay hundreds, or thousands of dollars for the ""right"" to pretend your shitty plastic pieces were more special than anything else someone was imagining? 

If Warhammer people cared about the game itself they wouldn't care about the pieces. I don't think it is a serious game so much as a way to showcase idiotic consumerism. Chess doesn't have a proprietary flavor of plastic shit that you are required to play with. Poker doesn't require any special deck of cards that one company can mark up.

Infantry was completely underpowered so much that I used cavalry for screening my artillery instead of infantry.

At least when speaking of single player, this could apply to a *lot* of games in the series.  Empire, for example, quickly led me to the conclusion that artillery won battles and that cavalry was a vastly better way to protect your artillery.  The AI, meanwhile, would field *some* artillery, but never really committed to the concept and so the game, more of then than not, was basically me using relatively small amounts of infantry backed by *lots* of artillery and cavalry and then deploying to favorable terrain.

Having the overwhelming advantage in guns meant the AI was essentially forced to try and silence them, and if the drag enough combat power to plausibly get through, their own guns would be vulnerable to *my* artillery.  Battles had a very copy paste feel to the point where I'd use only a few different strategies that were often as simple as hammering their artillery (and causing plenty of infantry and cavalry casualties along the way) until they began advancing, keeping their own cavalry busy with my own, and then simply timing a switch to grape to break what was almost always flagging morale.  And nowhere was this more apparent than in sieges where all of this was compounded by the game not allowing the enemy to make full use of their army.  Sure, the city defenders had more guns than I did, but the fraction they got to field *wouldn't*.  Meanwhile my own army had the advantage of prepared positions.

I enjoyed the game to an extent, but I also found a solution that worked with little modification in nearly all cases - hardly what you want in a strategy game.",9

Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"Knights of the Old Republic is a steal at that price, so is Terraria.",120
Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"Here's my insight for day 9, (as usual, feel free to leave any comments on the deals) 

**[The Dawn of War Series](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/DawnOfWar)** are some of the most chaotic and brutal RTS games ever made. Missiles fly over the screen, dreadnoughts impale the infidels, and the Unclean One spews his unholy vomit on all who oppose him. This RTS franchise  is constantly action packed and is the most aggressive RTS I've played. My personal pick of the bunch is Dawn of War II: Retribution, which has the streamlined chaotic nature of Dawn of War II, but with the most content and no GFWL. I would definitely check out Retribution (nobody plays the original Dawn of War II or Cahos Rising, only Retribution) and maybe the original Dawn of War collection (only get Gold and Dark Crusade, Soulstorm is rubbish) if you're looking for an action packed RTS. Remember, there is only war! 

**[The Gothic Franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/Gothic)** is a series of hardcore European RPGs. Being a hardcore European RPG, the UI isn't very friendly, and some of the mechanics are clunky. The first two games were particularly good, but the quality of the series sharply drops from there, and from there onwards, it's not worth bothering with. If yo're desperate for an RPG that you can get into, check out the first two Gothic games, but ignore the later ones. 

**[Cities in Motion](http://store.steampowered.com/app/73010/)** appears to be a Simcity ripoff at first glance. However, while Simcity focused on managing an entire city, Cities in Motion focuses purely on mass transit and traffic. While this may sound tedious, the developers did make the game mechanics fairly enjoyable, if repetitive. Check it out if you've been dying for a Simcity esque experience of some sort. 

**[The Prince of Persia franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/Holiday2011_PrinceofPersia)** is a set of action platformers with a focus on fluid and challenging platforming. The best elements of the series are the the acrobatics sections that test your agility and platforming skills. The best comparison would the the platforming of the Assassin's Creed series, and if you enjoyed that, you'll enjoy the Prince of Persia games. That being said, the Sands of Time trilogy is the best of the series, as the other games don't quite live up to them. 

**[Call of Duty Black Ops](http://store.steampowered.com/app/42700/)** is yet another FPS in the undying Call of Duty series. Unlike the modern warfare games, I actually quite enjoyed this one, as it has a quirky sense of humor. Black Ops is a fairly solid game,but it's way too overhyped, and I don't really support the business model, but the gameplay is solid. If you want a mindless shooter to lose yourself in for a few hours, there's not too much harm that Black Ops could cause. I'd recommend it, but if you haven't particularly cared for the Call of Duty series, this isn't going to make you a crusader for the cause. Overall, Treyarch did a solid job in developing this game, and I've enjoyed it a lot. If you've grown tired of the series, there's going to be little here for you. But for newcomers and fans looking for more Call of Duty, it's a solid choice, and you could do a lot worse.  At the current price, I wouldn't recommend it, and the DLC isn't even discounted, so I'd pass this up, unless you really want it. A full review of Black Ops can be found on [my blog](http://thepcelitist.blogspot.com/2011/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-review-solid-yet.html) as well. 

**[Terraria](http://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/)** is a Metroidvania style action platformer with building elements akin to Minecraft. While some might dismiss it as a 2D knockoff of Minecraft, it's much more than that. Terraria has a significantly larger focus on exploration, platforming, and combat than Minecraft, to the point where I'd consider them different genres. The building isn't as addictive as Minecraft, but the exploration and the loot will suck you into its charm. 

**[Sequence](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200910/)** is a rhythm based RPG by Iridium Studios. It's a very bizarre combination of Dance Dance Revolution's arrow matching mechanics, and a tactical RPG. There are three menus, defense, mana, and spells. You must constantly switch between these three menus to be successful in combat. The game has a great sense of humor, and the soundtrack by Ronald Jenkees is fantastic. Definitely worth the 1.25, the same price as a coffee at McDonald's, but so much better. 


**[Disciples 3](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/Disciples3)** is a great example of when you take a great franchise and ruin it. Initially, it looks to be a fairly competent stratetic RPG. However, it's not. There's bugs a plenty, combat is shallow, audio is lame, there's no online multiplayer (which the previous game had), a poor tutorial system, a lack of challenge, as well as general depth, and the campaign is sterile. Avoid this mess of a game, it's not worth your time. 

**[Stronghold 3](http://store.steampowered.com/app/47400/)** is also another result of when you shit on an established franchise. It's like Stronghold 1, but with the piss taken out of it. Ignoring the plentiful bugs and numerous crashes, Stronghold 3 still isn't very good. It's incredibly slow paced, to the point where a sloth would get impatient, the tutorial is very lackluster, and the combat is shallow. The only positive thing about this game is that the developers are patching it up frequently, so if it's actually decently playable now, I don't know. Definitely not worth your money at 3 dollars, let alone 33. 

**[The Star Wars Franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/StarWars)** is quite varied, actually. To be honest, all of these games are quite good. Republic Commando was a very solid strategic FPS with a heavy emphasis on squad tactics. Star Wars Battlefront 2 is a very fun team based shooter with 64 player servers. Knights of The Old Republic is a very solid RPG by Bioware. Empire at War is a very solid RTS, and Jedi Knight has very fun melee combat. If you're open to different genres and you love Star Wars to death, you really cannot go wrong with any of these games. 

I haven't tried out **[Solar 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/97000/)** yet, but it looks like an engaging sandbox shooter. From what I've read, you start off as an asteroid and you have to build yourself up by smashing into other asteroids. That asteroid then merges with your own. You do this all up until you become a planet, a star, then a neutron star, etc. It looks quite interesting, and for 2.50, there's not much risk in giving it a shot. There is a demo, which I will try out to get a better verdict. 
Creepybusguy said ""Solar 2, while simple, is a ton of fun. Going for the achievements makes it brutal at times. The soundtrack and humour of the game are what really make the game. A great game."" 

Finally, we have the **[F.E.A.R](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/holidaysale2011fear)** series, a set of horror-action FPS games. The horror is a lie. This series is as scary as a piece of wet cardboard (less so, in fact. Touching wet cardboard might make you wet). And as we've learned with Dead Space or Resident Evil 5, enemies aren't scary when you can blow their faces with shotguns. That being said, the shooting is immensely enjoyable, with the AI in F.E.A.R 1 among the best in any FPS game. F.E.A.R 3 (I refuse to call it F.3.A.R) also has very satisfying and visceral gunplay. The multiplayer in F.E.A.R 3 is a blast, with Fucking Run and Soul King being the standouts for me. I'd say that F.E.A.R 2 is the weakest link of the franchise, but it is still a solid game. Overall, if you get past the uninspired scares, you'll find some solid, if generic, shooters. Definitely worth a look for fans of FPS games.  
EDIT: If you just want F.E.A.R 3, it is 15 dollars at Green Man Gaming. Check out ltx's post for more information.

[Here's a link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/nsgu8/steam_holiday_sale_day_9_useful/c3bl4zr) to someone who is not me and may know what they are doing. I just summarized yalls comments.

**Cities in Motion** is a lot of fun if you liked the transportation management aspect of Sim City 4. There is no City building outside of transportation networks. It can be quite challenging and the game does a great job at giving you objectives. If that type of game sounds appealing, it's easily worth $5, as it's a very polished game and does what it says it does very well. If you enjoy OpenTTD/Railroad Tycoon style games you should give it a look, its not quite as grand in scale, but it is good fun.

I definitely recommend **Sequence** if you're looking for a well-written game with fun gameplay to play every once in a while. The voice acting is spot on for the most part and the rhythm-game-esque combat is hectic and fun. The gameplay is basically Rockband: Unplugged (PSP) combined with Puzzle Quest. There are three ""lanes,"" one for incoming attacks (hit the arrow to block the damage), one for casting spells (deal damage/heal/other effects), and one for mana (used to cast spells). Each lane drops notes at a different speed: The Defense lane drops notes fairly regularly depending on the enemy, the Spell lane drops notes when you cast spells, and the Mana lane is almost always full (but there is no penalty for missing Mana notes). It's combined with some interesting RPG mechanics outside of battles. I 100%'d the game and got about 10 hours out of it. I liked the story too. 

I haven't played it, but Almost everyone here recommends **Terraria**. It's been described as minecraft in 2D, but Terraria focuses much more on combat than minecraft, and less on construction. The must have of today and easily worth the full price. Even if you lack the drive to do some of the really creative stuff, it's still just fun to craft the basics and kill the bosses. Based upon the good things that everyone here is saying, I'm definitely putting this at the top of my shopping cart.

**Prince of Persia** Sands of Time was great, Warrior Within was ok, enjoyed Two Thrones as well. Although the game is a bit hand-holdy for some of the puzzles, it's an enjoyable game for anyone who likes the action/puzzle combo. Am surprised there's not some sort of bundle. Not sure about Forgotten Sands.

I love the **stronghold series**, probably more than most fans. Stronghold and SH crusader were fantastic, I also thought SH2 was pretty good. Now Stronghold 3 has received some very negative press because it was buggy as fuck when it was released. It has much less content than other releases (War/Economy Campaign, free build, no single player skirmish, buggy multiplayer) as well as being buggy (it has been patched a few times to be fair, still could use more). I'd save your money and wait for it to be cheaper and more polished in a year.

**Call of Duty Black Ops** is similar to the other Cod games. Most people here have probably played it. Personally I think it's kinda repetitive of the others, but it adds some nice combat sequences and secret agent style gameplay to it that sets it apart from the other games. If you like CoD games, you may want to get this, but if you're looking for a game that sets itself apart from the others, I suggest you watch some youtube footage first to be sure you want it.

**Dawn of War / Warhammer** Gameplay is initially focused on capturing and holding strategic locations on the battlefield. These control points are captured by infantry squads and provide resources to construct additional units and buildings or unlock certain units in an army's tech tree. Battles are won either by holding a certain number of control points for a period of time or by destroying all of the opposing armies' HQ structures. Two primary resources exist: requisition and power. These resources are not harvested or otherwise gathered by the player's units. Instead, requisition is generated constantly by the army headquarters.

**Gothic** Is a fantasy RPG. You choose your player class and then set out on quests. The game places a special focus on the interactivity of the environment. For example, while anyone hunting wild animals can gather raw meat from them, this can be turned into grilled meat by making use of a stove or frying pan. Similarly, most of the activities other characters can be seen doing (playing musical instruments, stirring soup pots, urinating etc.) can be done by the main character as well (although with the exception of forging weapons these activities have little bearing on the game). People here seem to like the first and second ones but are shying away from the others. 

**Solar 2** In most games you see stars in the background, you shoot asteroids or you live on planets. But in Solar 2 you ARE these objects! You take on the role of God. Solar 2 is an open-world, sandbox game set in an infinite abstract universe. Play constructively: grow your system, nurture life on your planets and attack enemy life in huge space battles. Play destructively: crash into other objects and cause chaos, use your orbiting objects like wrecking balls, steal planets from other systems. Solar 2 is extremely short game (like 1-2 hours). But if you like physics games I'd say it's worth it.

**Star Wars** Its worth it. The Jedi Knight games are the most fun Star Wars games I've played. The lightsaber combat is almost perfect and it's really fun. This game is a must for any Star Wars fan. Developed by Bioware, SWKOTOR is similar to their other games such as mass effect. The alignment system tracks actions and speech—from simple word choices to major plot decisions—to determine whether the player's character aligns with the light or dark side of the Force. Generosity and altruism lead to the light side, while selfish or violent actions will lead the player's character to the dark side, which will alter the character's appearance, turning their eyes yellow and their skin pale. Combat is round-based; time is divided into discrete rounds, and combatants attack and react simultaneously. However, the number of actions a combatant may perform each round is limited. While each round's duration is a fixed short interval of real time, the player can configure the combat system to pause at specific events or at the end of each round.

**F.E.A.R.** (an initialism for First Encounter Assault Recon) is a psychological horror first-person shooter. You take on the role of a guy with extremely quick reflexes, a feature of the game where you can slow down time. You start out not knowing the story, so you get to learn along the way. The animations show a complete body, so you can see your feet and when you climb ropes you see your hands perform the relevant actions. The game has standard weapons for a FPS, and the standard style multiplayer as well with different game modes like deathmatch or CTF. If you're looking for something to scare you, then this game is for you. The entire point of the game is fear, with monsters jumping out of closets and getting right up in your face.

Today I played what has become one of my two favorites (the other being Dungeon Defenders):   SEQUENCE.

Holy shit, buy this game.  It's beautiful and fun and addictive.  It's like Rock Band and Puzzle Quest had a baby.   The art is great, the gameplay is amazing, the dialogue is witty and snarky....I might have to say this is the best $2.50 I've spent on this whole Holiday Sale.",5

Although the game is a bit hand-holdy for some of the puzzles, it's an enjoyable game for anyone who likes the action/puzzle combo. Am surprised there's not some sort of bundle.  Not sure about Forgotten Sands.

- KoToR for $2.50.  If you don't already have it, get it. I'm sure others will provide a more thorough review, as it's been a long time since I've played.

Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"I'm going to go against the r/gaming hivemind and put in my own two cents about Knights of the Old Republic. I picked the game up a while back for $5 and simply could NOT get into it at all. I've played a few hours into it at this point and couldn't bear it any longer. The game was certainly brave and novel at the time, but it hasn't aged well at all. It's very slow paced, very long winded, the story is dull, the graphics look blocky, many of the skills are broken, and the combat leaves quite a bit to be desired. 

For $2.50, you really aren't losing out too much if you just want to try it, but that could be much better spent on games that are funner that will hold your attention for longer, i.e. Braid, World of Goo, etc. I guess if you're a die hard Star Wars fan you could go for it, but if you're THAT die hard, chances are you've already played it.

Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"I'm a pretty big fan of the Warhammer: 40k PC series. I've bought every game since release minus Dark Crusade. Here are a few interesting points about them (I haven't played the first set of games in a long time, so I'm not 100% sure about them.)

-The games are different from other RTS games in which instead of individual units are managed, infantry squads are used to fight. Each squad/vehicle can be upgraded with various weapon/armour upgrades depending on the tier of your command center. When one unit dies, the whole squad's effectiveness is reduced and you must retreat back to a relay point, command center, or certain vehicles to reinforce. There are no flying units (Except in DoW I: Soulstorm). 

-Destructible cover and positioning in the second series is a huge aspect of the game. For instance, you can hide behind rocks, buildings or even craters left behind from explosives or artillery which greatly reduce incoming ranged damage, but will degrade eventually from enemy fire. Certain weapons such as flame throwers and grenades can be used to clear out buildings instantly and ignore cover. You can also flank enemies from the side or engage in melee to tie up heavier ranged units to make them vulnerable.  

-There is no resource gathering in the game, the two main resources are requisition and power. In both games there are these nodes scattered across the map which you can capture. In dawn of war I, you build upgradable outposts on them which have a machine gun attachment and generators in the base IIRC. In dawn of war II there is no base building whatsoever minus special buildings such as turrets, aura banners, tunnels that are used for quick travel behind enemies, etc. Power is acquired the same way requisition is, except you can auto-build up to 3 generators per power node and create a structure that must be destroyed before the power node can be captured again.

-Aside from multiplayer skirmishes the game modes in the second series are extremely fun, it even has co-op. The one I enjoy the most is one called Last Stand. You pick one of 6+ heroes with two other players then try to survive 20 waves in an arena while hordes of enemy NPCs try to kill you. The hero you pick unlocks more gear as it levels up. I haven't played the campaign in retribution, but the ones in the original DoW II game and Chaos rising were extremely fun. You control 4 out of 6 beefed up heroes from the space marine faction (Can play with a friend and control 2 each) trying to save various planets from massive invasions from the other races. You get skill trees to customize your heroes along with new gear and abilities all the time.

Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"For those who haven't played the Gothic series but are considering it, here's my 2-cents.

Gothic 1 and 2: If you can get past the different style UI's and control maps, they're some of the best RPG's ever made. They're difficult and hugely involving. To me, they feel more immersive than Skyrim does, and the whole games feel carefully thought and hand-made (except for the occasional bug here and there).

Gothic 3 and Forsaken Gods: Quite buggy on their own, but can be a lot of fun if you patch them with the huge community patches that are released for them. The scenery is close to unmatched, if that's your thing.

Gothic 4: Just your typical RPG. Nothing compared to Gothic 1-2, but if you're a huge fan of the series, it's still not a bad game.

Risen: Made by Piranha Bytes after JoWood dropped them, and turned out to be pretty great. It has a very Gothicy feel to it, and it's what Gothic 3-4 should have been like. ",2

Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"I wanted to chime in and say that Dawn of War II/Chaos Rising/Retribution are fantastically fun games set in the well known Warhammer 40k universe. The single player is a story based campaign, and in Chaos Rising and vanilla DOW, it's quite good -- the campaigns are long. Vanilla DOW is about the Space Marines, and Chaos Rising is as well -- but Chaos Rising gives you the option to turn to Chaos (i.e. the renegade space marines).

Gameplay is more of a squad based RTS rather than a traditional base building experience -- similar to Company of Heroes, another Relic game. You have a group of heroes which you upgrade with armour and weaponry and direct on the battlefield, moving them into cover and using special abilities to turn the tide of battles.

Retribution has a campaign for many of the major factions -- Space Marines, Eldar, Imperial Guard, Tyranids, Chaos Space Marines, and the Orks. Retribution is the one that people currently play in multiplayer heavily and it is quite fun. The Last Stand mode is a ""three player versus hordes of enemies"". Note that if you buy Retribution, there is one particular piece of DLC which is a bit more interesting than the rest: the Tau Commander. The Tau Commander is not a skin pack or wargear set, but an entirely new character that you can play in The Last Stand. It doesn't say it outright, but all DLC is on sale today.

There is a ""traditional"" multiplayer mode, if you like that sort of thing, building units and defending your base, and that is the achievement for today.

The Dawn of War I games -- you can get the whole pack, but the best of the lot is Dark Crusade. Soulstorm is generally accepted to be derpy in terms of storyline, and features the famous ""SPEHSS MEHREENS! BATTLE BRUVVERS!"" speech by Commander Indrick Boreale, who you may know from his appalling speech impediment in the Dawn of Awesome video series, and countless Youtube Poops. DOW1 is a very traditional RTS, by the way.",4

Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,Yes! I've been waiting for Terraria to go on sale. I almost gave in when I saw it hit 50% off but I'm glad I waited! 75% off!!!,1
Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"Looks like no thread recommending **Dawn of War**, so here's my input.

Absolutely buy **Dawn of War: Dark Crusade** if you like strategy, Warhammer, Company of Heroes, or fun. 7 campaign races to choose from, lots of replayability, and multiplayer is fun. The first Dawn of War series is Relic's pre-Company of Heroes game, and if you like that title, this is natural. The graphics hold up very well, even when the first DoW is 7 years old. They chose to do a Warcraft 3 style look, and it worked well. The game is very fluid, exciting, and challenging at times- and really nails the 'endless war' motif that 40k is known for. Dark Crusade is a great buy if you're on the fence about just buying it all, because it's campaign can be played with any of 7 races, and should let you know if you liked Space Marines enough to buy **Dawn of War Gold** for their campaign. **Dawn of War: Soulstorm** is the one that I have played the least, and not really gotten all that into. Adds two new armies, a bigger campaign, etc- but it's missing something. At 6 bucks though, go for it.

**Dawn of War 2** is fun. It looks pretty, and is a totally different game. Dawn of War is all about huge armies and massive battles, and Dawn of War 2 is more Dungeon Siege than Starcraft. You control heroes and small squads, micro-manage ability, loot hunt and theorycraft, and still have a blast. If Dawn of War was intended to give some of the feel of a huge tabletop Warhammer game though, DoW2 is more like D&D40K. **Dawn of War 2: Chaos Rising** has a better and more fun campaign. More variety in missions, and introduced the ""Last Stand"" mode. More on that in a second. **Dawn of War 2: Retribution** has a more Dark Crusade feel to it, 6 armies to choose from, and I can't really comment on the campaign. Played a bit, but my PC is aging poorly, and it just wasn't doing so well. **The Last Stand** mode *is* very fun though. It's a wave-based co-op mode, where you control one hero and work as a team of 3 to beat waves of enemies. Part DoTA, part RTS, part cooldown management. It's fun, but play with friends if you really want a good time.",1

Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"[Sequence](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200910/) was one of my favorite games this year. If I was going to compare it to any one game - apart from DDR of course - it would be to The World Ends With You.

The humour stands out with its constant barrage of puns in item descriptions and clever dialogue that's often delivered extremely well. The story ended up being far better than I expected, and you might not discover everything unless you look for it...

On the hardest difficulty - aptly described as ""for those socially challenged"" - it was a challenge even though I'm quite good at stepmania. The multi tasking added by field switching and activating spells with cooldowns really changes things. Though, it probably would have helped a lot if I remaped keys and didn't use one hand exclusively for notes.

Finally it might be worth mentioning that the (sole)developer has been very active since the game was released. It's been patched something like 10 times, and he has added requested features like speed modifiers.

Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"Dawn of War is a sick series. If starcraft didn't exist it would be the most popular RTS around.

* First, no base building. We're fucking space marines, we don't need to pussy ass base building. We capture command points like it's fucking battlefield.
* Second, jet packs that can be used like weapons. Jet packs make everything better.
* Third, two player campaign co-op. Brothers, unite!
* Fourth, 4 player co-op mode called last stand. Play as an Orc, Tyranid, Space Marine, The Imperial Guard, Chaos Marines or the Eldaar to fight off waves of traitors. Also contains some RPG elements and lets you level up and gain new gear.
* Fifth: Gear based and Skill point based campaign. Level up your SPACE MARUEENS, become even more badass.
* Fucking Dreadnoughts.
* Hard as fuck boss fights.


The dawn of war 2 games DoW2, Chaos Rising and Retribution. They're all standalone, but the storyline only really makes sense if you get them all. The first two (DoW2 and Chaos Rising) use GFWL, the last one (Retribution) uses steamworks and is more popular because of that. If you want it for the multiplayer, Retributions where it's at.",0

Warrior Within is awful in my opinion and puts the focus on repetitive combat rather than platforming.  The story and characters in this game are also uninteresting.

Two Thrones is pretty good when it's behaving like Sands of Time but then there are sections that harken back to Warrior Within and you're left with that same boring combat.

Prince of Persia (the cel-shaded one) is an excellent game in spite of the fact that you cannot die.  The characters and story are interesting, the combat is entertaining and best of all, the platforming is excellent.  This game also looks great.

There's the pack of 3, then 3 other individual things, one of which may or may not be in that 3 pack so I'm sort of lost.",2
Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"I bought Cities in Motion and am really disappointed; I'm kind of frustrated that you likened it to OpenTTD (this made me buy it), when it seems you only have cursory experience with either one or the other or both. There are good things about the game, but I don't feel it has deserved me trying to find them, so here are the bad things that rather stand out:

The UI is worse than TTD, which is 15 years older. For example there is no way to close all windows. You have to go through and close each one individually by clicking a red x. You cannot move the windows around, so even if one is nice to keep open constantly you can't because it occupies the center of the screen. Most hotkeys are in the WASD area but important camera hotkeys are <- ->, why can't I use the mouse to rotate the camera (eg by holding rightclick). Finally there is that ""secondary viewport"" that you cannot close, which will consntantly remain open and spout useless information at you, or information that you just wanted to have a glance at, not have constantly there... the best way to close it is to click on a streetlight, then you'll just have a black box taking up screen space.

The game attempts to be immersive but fails in terms of mechanics. They throw tons of data at you: 7 different classes of people (first of all, WTF?), 5 different transportation modes, global economics, and traffic. The last two they claim to model realistically. Economics rather than being advanced are akin to bad weather in Rollercoaster tycoon: you simply follow a number and based on the binary decision of whether it's above 0% or below 0% you adjust your prices. While micromanaging prices is annoying, I expected it, as this is typical of tycoon/sim city games. The advanced traffic seems random at best. At central intersections there will be traffic jams that will just vanish a bit later. Similarly cars will drive onto sidewalks and vanish. There is no time of day or anything else that is visible to the player that would help him understand traffic pattern.

They run a 3D engine but zoom is limited to the point where individual people are not distinguishable, and are invisible once they enter vehicles. Clicking on people shows a detailed 2D portrait in the info box; there are very few portraits. People don't feel personal, why bother depicting them with detail when that detail is obviously irrelevant. Sound effects are repetitive, and feel like they've been lifted from TTD: i.e. a 2010 title with 1995 sound effects. Whereas TTD was limited in that everything was written into machine code, with CIM this is just laziness and poor production. The music is vague elevator music, it evokes no feelings. At least sound can be turned off without loosing anything. Finally as the months fly by the game is stuck in July, 3PM, not windy. There is no weather in game, shadows on trees are the same direction at all times, and building facades don't change.

Overall the game feels like a half-hearted effort. It doesn't bring anything new to the table of trans-simulators, and costs $5 on sale. It's much worse than a $5 indie game would be, and incomparable in value to the free OpenTTD.",2

Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"I absolutely loved it. If you like rhythm games or DDR, it's a must for the price.

The gameplay is basically Rockband: Unplugged (PSP) combined with Puzzle Quest. There are three ""lanes,"" one for incoming attacks (hit the arrow to block the damage), one for casting spells (deal damage/heal/other effects), and one for mana (used to cast spells). Each lane drops notes at a different speed: The Defense lane drops notes fairly regularly depending on the enemy, the Spell lane drops notes when you cast spells, and the Mana lane is almost always full (but there is no penalty for missing Mana notes).

It's combined with some interesting RPG mechanics outside of battles. I 100%'d the game and got about 10 hours out of it. I liked the story too. ",15

Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"I bought this game after watching Northernlion LP it. It is pretty good, and an absolute goddamn steal at $1.24. The voice acting is fantastic, and the dialogue is genuinely funny",2
Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"Yes. Buy them! Seriously though, both are extremely fun and rewarding and can be tough as nails, especially Braid. World of Goo is a physics-based game where you have a certain number of Goo balls that can be attached and detached based on your gameplay. Your objective, more or less, is to create a bridge from Point A to Point B using Goo Balls, but obviously physics/gravity is in effect so you have to be careful how to stack your Goo Balls. There are of course other environmental conditions and hazards, like fire and spikes and whatnot. Highly recommended.

Braid is kinda like a modern reimagining of Mario, except it's very indie and very... artsy? It's a very poetic game with beautiful backgrounds and a mysterious and elegant backstory. Gameplay is divided into, I think, 6 ""worlds"" and you have to collect puzzle pieces and make your way through the side-scrolling worlds with numerous obstacles in your path. You'll have to manipulate time in different ways for each world. You also can't die, since holding down Shift when you are about to die reverses time back to a certain point. This time manipulation can get **extremely** tricky in later levels, so you gotta be on top of your game then. Braid has a fantastic ending as well, so it's totally worth a buy.

Hope that convinces you to buy both games!",14
Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,Braid has great art and is a solid puzzle platformer. Definitely one of t he top indy games.,10
Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"I found world of goo to be a plants & zombies type of game - not in the gameplay but the fact that you can't stop playing it once you start to.  I think I played the entire game through in a day or two but it was a very satisfying experience.  It's basically a build-a-bridge game with fairly fun physics behind it that make some levels very challenging, and of course others not so much but still fun never the less.  I recommend it!",5
Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"World of Goo is seriously the most intricate and unique game I've ever played, definately worth your time. I suggest looking up videos on Youtube for gameplay if you're interested!!",5
Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"They both have demos, so that's probably the best way for you to decide.",3
Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"I'll go against the grain by saying Braid has a mis-step in it's design (in my opinion) that stopped me from playing. That design choice is basically that a player must collect difficult to reach items to proceed past a certain point in the game. If one cannot figure out how to access them, the player stops proceeding in the game.

Alternatively, the new Super Mario bros. games feature special coins that can be collected to unlock levels within each world; it's not required to continue through the game, but it's a wonderful reward for those with the ability to obtain the special coins. 

I will admit that in Braid, there's a story significance to their choice, but I got to a point where I'm not sure where the collectibles are/how to actually get them and I'd rather not use a walkthrough. Overall, I was hoping for a game where I could use the neat mechanics of the game without caring about the collectibles. Instead, I'm forced to obtain them and figure things out which is more than what I was asking for out a platformer when I first played it. Maybe one day I'll feel like going back to it, but I just wasn't in the mood at all for that type of experience in a platformer.",3
Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"In my opinion, Braid is definitely a must-buy, specially if you're into platformers. It has beautiful art and soundtrack, an amazing story with some clever twists and awesome gameplay focused on controlling time. It really is a very fun experience, specially at $2,50.

I haven't played a lot World of Goo, but it seems very interesting from the little I've played. It's very easy to get into it, it's pretty straightforward and what you see in the trailers is what you get.",2

Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"Cities in Motion is more similar to Transport Tycoon than Sim City. You build a transportation network around a city that grows over time, setting tram & bus stops, upgrading vehicles etc. Part of the game is picking the optimal route between stops like in Transport Tycoon. Overall it's not a particularly deep game, but very relaxing.",6
Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"From the meta-critic reviews it looks like it's a transportation sim, not a city sim.  :(

Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"Very enjoyable. You don't build cities like in Sim City, it takes place in actual cities like Amsterdam and Belgium in different time periods starting in the early 1900's. Surprisingly fun for being a ""transportation simulator."" There are always missions to keep you busy and it has great music. I think there is a demo, check it out if you're hesitant. ",2
Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"I bought Cities in Motion a couple months ago and it is definitely worth the $5. It is best to think of it as a virtual train set. You set up routes for buses, lay track for trams and trains and then watch as the little vehicles trundle from stop to stop. You can people-watch too as each passenger is an individual with a home, workplace and a list of locations that he travels to and from.

The challenge in the game comes from maintaining the business side of your transportation company and managing congestion. It is easy to invest in a rail line that ends up losing money or to build an inefficient transportation network that leaves passengers angry. When this happens, you will fall into a debt spiral and eventually run out of money, which means 'game over'. Getting it right is very satisfying, but when it goes wrong it can be frustrating as it might not be immediately obvious what you did wrong.

TL;DR: A fun game for people who like building systems and observing emergent behavior, but the game is slow paced and it is easy to fail.",2

One of my best gaming moments comes from this series.  It was during a 1 on 1 lightsaber boss battle (spoiler-free).  

It was a long fight, with both of us slashing left and right, force pushing, and dodging.  I was low on health and had to try to finish them.  I threw my lightsaber at them, hoping to catch them off guard and land a hit.  They saw it coming, deflected it with their own saber,  I turned and watch mine going flying across the room.

I looked back and see them retaliate by copying me;  they threw their lightsaber.  I dodged to the right, the direction of my fallen lightsaber, and picked it up and charged at them.

Right as I got close their lightsaber returned to their hand.  I slashed at them but they jumped straight up to avoid it.  I jumped after them swinging again, we clashed midair and landed facing away from each other.  I turned around to see them collapse on the floor.  A narrow victory.

It was completely unscripted and one of the most surreal experiences I've had in a video game.",14

Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"Dawn of war gold edition contains the original DoW and an expansion winter assault, the main difference from soulstorm and dark crusade, is that the first two ones have a blizzard like campaign: scripted missions with dialogue cutscenes. While soulstorm and dark crusade have a risk like campaign, which consists of a large map, where you have to play skirmishes against the computer, taking over zones on the map until you get to the main stronghold of each opposing race. Each expansion in the first series introduces 1 or more new 40k races.

Dawn of war 2 original has totally different system from the first one, no base building, squad based combat with rpg elements (squads have experience points and can equip items) the campaign in the original DoW2 consists of story missions with randomly generated missions inbetween (for looting and leveling) the first expansion is similar, introduces new corruption mechanic (during the campaign your battlebrothers may succumb to the temptation of chaos) this adds a few different endings to the game. The last expansion introduces a innovative and weird campaign, which has a lot of races and is played out on the same set of campaign maps, but the cutscenes and dialogues are different for each race. Also introduces a new coop survival mode for multiplayer if I remember correctly.

Basically, relic does a lot of experimentation in their expansions, always adding new stuff here and there. If you like fancy story campaigns the first two parts of DoW, and all of DoW 2 are a good buy. DoW is more of  a classic rts where you build up a base and produce units, DoW 2 is an rts/rpg hybrid, with no base building, cover mechanics and destructible environments.",3

Steam Holiday Sale 2011 Day 9,1025,"How so?  Castlevania was originally a linear action game while Metroid was open, item-collecting awesomeness right from the start.  The Metroid series followed this design consistently throughout the years, only really straying from this formula with Metroid Other M.

It wasn't until Castlevania 2 (released two years after Metroid) that the game opened up and featured the big exploration and item collecting gameplay.  After that the series didn't return to this style until years later with Symphony of the Night which was effectively a Gothic-themed Super Metroid with RPG elements.  Later games in the series (namely Lament of Innocence and Lords of Shadow) even returned to the series' roots and did away with the big emergent worlds commonly associated with ""Metroidvania"" titles.

For the reasons I just listed, the name ""Metroidvania"" never sat well with me.  To me, the games commonly referred to as such should just be Metroid-like.",9

One my my favourite RTS games. The balancing can be a bit wonky depending on the map, but there's no greater feeling than launching a howitzer strike on an infantry surge and seeing dozens of body parts coating everything within view.

>Empire & Napoleon Total War Collection $19.90

Empire is fairly buggy, but oh god. It's one of the greatest grand strategy games, can fit thousands of units on screen (Get DarthMod), and it has these amazing RTS battles. Napoleon's campaign is meh, but the battles are even more fun.

>Hidden & Dangerous 2 $0.90

This hasn't aged well, but it's one of the best tactical shooters I've played. Very challenging, very detailed, and very fun.

>Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead $14.90

Don't buy this unless you know what you're getting into. It's kind of like Operation Flashpoint in the sense that it's going to rip you a new arse and fill it with sadness many times over.

>Wings of Prey: WWII Air Combat $12.90

Personally, I'd pass on this. It's *decent*, but there are better combat flight sims- especially for that price.

>Final Fantasy XI: The Ultimate Collection $4.90  / Age of Conan: Rise of the Godslayer Gold Edition $9.90 

These are more or less dead or dying. Age of Conan was a bust from the start, Final Fantasy XI is old enough to be your grandmother and everyone on it seems to be Japanese.

>Assassin's Creed: Director's Cut Edition $3.90

Very worth it. It's got one of those engines that makes you feel like you're actually playing a person rather than a sprite.

>SPORE $9.90

Don't buy this for yourself, but buy it for a kid. It went from this amazing concept to something so stupidly dumbed down that I uninstalled it after a week. Kids like it though.

>Overlord 2 $3.90

It's quirky and fun, but it's a bitch to get the hang of. Worth it.

>Tom Clancy's End War $1.90 / Frontlines: Fuel of War $1.90

Total War: WARHAMMER III - Introducing the Champions of Chaos,6,I wish I liked this series more. I love everything about total war warhammer except playing it,2
A question on Total War: Warhammer III.,3,Yes but not at launch. Usually takes a few months to bring mortal empires to the game,4
A question on Total War: Warhammer III.,3,If i remember well I think reading somewhere that yes. You willbe able to to put em together.,3
A question on Total War: Warhammer III.,3,"The combined map for Warhammer 2 is called Mortal Empires and requires owning Warhammer 1 & Warhammer 2, and having only Warhammer 2 downloaded.

We know Warhammer 3 will have a combined map, currently unnamed, that will require owning Warhammer 1, 2 & 3. I think it can be presumed you'd only need 3 downloaded but that has yet to be wholly confirmed.

So yeah, as long as you own games 1 & 2 (which to play Mortal Empires you must do already) you'll be able to play the combined map for Warhammer 3.

&#x200B;

Also some WH1/2 characters will be on WH3's base/'free' map and it remains to be seen if they'll be playable if you own them.

Also the combined map will come some time after release - for Warhammer 2 it was roughly a month after release, then the first DLC came about 3 months later - but due to technical issues the Norsca faction didn't come to ME for another 4 months after \*that\*, more than half a year after the release of the game.

I believe they've alluded to the wait for 3's combined map being a bit longer, so I could see it being Game Release -> DLC 1 2.5-3 months later -> Mortal Empires 4-5 Months after release, wherein they flip the order and release DLC1 (probably Chaos Dwarfs) to tide us over until the Combined Map is fully finished.",2
A question on Total War: Warhammer III.,3,"Tentatively called ""Immortal Empires"" or ""A very large campaign"" on the wiki.  Check ""total warhammer wiki"" and r/totalwar.  You need all 3 games to qualify.  Also, you have up to 7 days post release for the pre order bonus, supposedly.  I haven't ordered it yet even though TW2 is my favorite game.",1

This co-op game puts you in an expansive world completing quests, killing bosses, and discovering crazy combinations of weapons to use against your foes. If you have friends who have this game, don't miss out on this opportunity to play this game on co-op with them.

**Summary:**|Great multiplayer game with a very active community. If you like team-based (heavy focus on team play) multiplayer FPS with an array of vehicles and weapons in 32-player maps, then this is the game for you. At $5, it is definitely worth it if you are into the genre. If you are planning on buying the vietnam expansion as well, go for [this pack](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/8666/), it's cheaper.

**Summary:**|Great new game at a great price, tons of fun with 4-player co-op madness. The game really shines when played with friends, and isn't the best for solo play. Definitely worth it for the price if you're into this kind of semi-casual and fun game. There's a demo if you are still on the fence and need a shove, but remember - it's the multiplayer that makes this game worth the purchase. [[Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicka/)]

**Summary:**|Excellent sequel to the Witcher series, which has met with a great amount of positive reviews from the gaming community. Brutal, sexy, and immersive - this is definitely not an RPG to miss for role-playing fans. Since the game is relatively new, it is still a bit pricey.

**Score:**|24 (+26 /-2 )
**% Liked:**|92.8%
**Summary:**|Assassin's Creed is a series where each sequel has received more praise than its predecessor. Great rogue-like gameplay in an open world, where stealth and tactics do matter and running in head first gets you killed. Brotherhood received a lot of praise for its polished gameplay and improvements over the first few, while the first game received a bit of criticism for repetitive quests. Worth diving into if you are interested in getting into the series.

**Summary:**|Great indie game which has turned out to be a sleeper hit with the Steam Sales. Sanctum is a tower defense game with a twist, you play in FPS mode instead of the usual top-down commander view. The game seems quite polished and has received praise from gamers who played it in multiplayer mode. This [let's play video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Ds1E88pb0) by TotalBiscuit and friends is a good starting point if you know nothing about the game and want to find out more.

**Summary:**|Which gamer hasn't heard of the GTA series? This third-person action sandbox game is set in a huge open-world environment in New York, and like previous games, allows you to wreak havoc and do whatever you like. From beating down pedestrians, to running over them, to jacking cars, to helicopter missions - this game has it all with an overarching story to get you through tons of fun.

**Summary:**|Dawn of War has long established itself as a popular RTS series from the Warhammer 40k franchise. Fans of Warhammer 40k will already own this, but those who liked DoW2 and want to expand your gameplay with more choices and units, this stand-alone expansion is probably worth getting. For those who have never played a DoW game before, I'd recommend downloading the [Dawn of War II Demo](http://store.steampowered.com/app/15620/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1) off Steam before looking at this expansion. The demo and videos on YouTube should give you a fairly good idea about the game to make an informed decision.

**Summary:**|Lionhead's famous RPG series. Not as good as Fable II as some proposed, met with quite a bit of criticism. This game was hyped up quite a bit, and has some interesting co-op features like marriage between two players. If you're a hardcore fan of the franchise and don't have the game already, buy it. For others, probably worth passing for now till the price drops further.

[Just Cause 2](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/JustCause?snr=1_4_4_) is a gorgeous, expansive world that's been designed to be blown up, raced through and generally played in. Every bit of this game is designed to make you feel like an action hero, with a lot of actions smoothed over (jumping between two vehicles moving at high-speed, for instance) while still providing you enough of a challenge to keep you vaguely awake. One of the story missions starts you off on a bridge above a valley - you get a phone call telling you to hijack a limousine passing through the area. A conveniently-placed motorbike lets you leap off the side of the bridge, ditch the motorbike mid-air, freefall down to the limo and grapple-hook straight onto the roof. A short gunfight later and you're tearing through jungle highways in your newly-acquired limo, firing blind out of the windows and swerving to avoid roadblocks. 

It's *such* a playable game. I never used the fast travel option despite the map's size, because travel is so enjoyable in all forms, and the world is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. For this price, the game might as well have no faults. Thoroughly worthwhile picking up!

---

[Magicka](http://store.steampowered.com/app/42910/?snr=1_4_4_) has a delightful tongue-in-cheek style to its singleplayer campaign, and a really interesting take on how magic is cast and used. I often feel that magic is done pretty similarly across the RPG board, whether Western or Japanese. Magicka mixes that up - you chain together elements into recipes, select a cast type (single/multitarget, area of effect, etc.) and that not only encourages creativity but also leads to hilarious fuck-ups as well. Multiplayer is a frenetic disaster sequence, with misfiring magic, accidental target choice and fatal 'don't cross the beams!'-style situations.

I didn't get a *lot* of play out of Magicka, partly because I couldn't find time to organise games with friends and didn't click with the game when playing alone. That said, I think the price is right here, and I'm sure Redditors will be up for some games with you.

---

[Battlefield: Bad Company 2](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/badcompany2_199?snr=1_4_4_) is a masterwork, in my opinion. I had waited for a game to be as playable as Battlefield 2, and I had to wait a good four years for it. While BF:BC2 never quite hit the same dizzying highs as that game, it was the closest DICE have come since then (and BF3 appears to be finishing the job), and multiplayer is still excellent. The destructible scenery is used to spectacular effect on some maps; the class system is fine, without being overly divided, and on top of the great MP game you get a neat (if simple) singleplayer jaunt too. If you're waiting for Battlefield 3, this is the game to tide you over.

* Audiosurf (Great game, WELL worth the 1.50 I spent)

* Splintercell: Chaos Theory  (Heard it's a great stealth game)

* Fallout 3 - Game of the Year  (Played it a bunch already, didn't own it.)

* Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Conviction  (So far pretty great. Worth it.)

* Worms Reloaded (I have a buddy with it, gonna play some MP)

* Supreme Commander 2 & DLC (Looking for an RTS that isn't Starcraft for a change, own CoH and DoW2.)

* Fallout: New Vegas (Played about an hour of it, liked what I played)

* Magicka: Vietnam ($1.69, why not?)

* Portal 2 (Need to get me some of that Co-op action)

* Battlefield Pack (I own the physical copy, hate physical copies. Also, I didn't have Vietnam.)

All in all, cost me about $110. Much more than I anticipated spending, and only one of those is a regret so far. *I'm looking at you, Guild Wars.* Looking forward to getting some gaming in. See you guys next sale!

Steam Summer Camp Sale Day 11 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary) (Final Set of Deals),603,"So, I held off on recommending this, since it might've came up as a daily deal, but since it hasn't:

**BUY [CRYOSTASIS](http://store.steampowered.com/app/7850/) IMMEDIATELY.**

It's only $6.49, and it WILL be one of the most amazing gaming experiences of your life. It is easily the best-written, most creative, most *heart-pounding*, game I've ever had the privilege to play. It starts off a bit slow, but I can *guarantee you* that you will NEVER play a game that has a more satisfying ending, considering all the shit that game puts you through.

The only one caveat worth mentioning is that it is terribly-optimized; like, really, *really* terribly optimized. Even if your computer is amazing, you probably definitely won't be able to run it on high settings (although it's much smoother if you have a PhysX-enabled nVidia card; I don't). Honestly, though, this only kind of *added* to the experience for me. I don't think I ever died as a result of it, but it was still fucking terrifying to have the game start lagging the *second* this HUGE FUCKING THING APPEARED HOLY SHIT WHAT IN GOD'S NAME IS THAT?!

Seriously. Buy it. Please. I desperately want to see a sequel and it's heartbreaking to see how poorly this game sold/was received. It *in no way* warrants its low Metacritic rating. If you're *soulless enough* to not have already bought it by the time you started reading this, at least watch some gameplay and see if it might intrigue you: http://www.giantbomb.com/quick-look-cryostasis/17-1796/

If you have ANY love for number puzzles, pick up [Everyday Genius: Square Logic](http://store.steampowered.com/app/32150/) for $4.99. It's a *bunch* of Ken-Ken puzzles with a really good candidate interface and some interesting additions to keep things fresh. Furthermore, even if you don't play Ken-Ken, it eases you into them so that when you finally start solving 8x8s, it's not terrifying. I'll sheepishly admit that it's my most played Steam game with 40+ hours logged.

[Toki Tori](http://store.steampowered.com/app/38700/) ($1.24) is a polished puzzle platformer that, despite it's cute appearance, is surprisingly challenging. I can only play it in small bits because I'll get stuck and then frustrated, but I appreciate how well made and thought-out the game is.

[System Protocol One](http://store.steampowered.com/app/58300/) ($2.50) is an IT-themed tower defense game. The tutorial is DAUNTING (lots of information just thrown at you and no chance for you to actually practice or use what you're learning) and turned me off to the game initially, but now that I've started playing it I'm really enjoying it, so I recommend briefly glancing at the tutorial to get the basics and then just trying the game out on your own. Even playing it on the easiest mode is very challenging for me, but I like the look of the game and appreciate that not all of the maps are flat (some are on cubes, loops, etc.). It adds dimension (literally) to the game and makes you have to think more cleverly about the paths you're making.

The others I've liked are already mentioned at the top, but I'll second [RUSH](http://store.steampowered.com/app/38720/) (for $1.24 it's a steal, especially if you liked the puzzle aspects of ChuChu Rocket) and [Shatter](http://store.steampowered.com/app/20820/) ($2.50), which is an amazingly polished Breakout-style game that removes most of the frustration of Breakout-style games by allowing you to suck/blow air to adjust the ball's path, making those LAST couple of bricks MUCH easier to get.

Also, in case anyone is still reading, I'm looking for a good bargain racing game. It doesn't have to be revolutionary or beautiful -- just fun. Any suggestions?",11

I've gone through the issues before but you need a quad-core CPU and a top-of-the-range GPU to run it at medium settings.

That's if you're lucky enough to get all the DRM working. First there's SecuROM which is completely hit-and-miss. Next is Rockstar Social Club which used to be mandatory but now I believe it is only required if you want to render and upload replay videos. The most problematic one is GFWL though. I recommend using the ""xliveless"" DLL and ignoring the multiplayer completely because GFWL is just not worth the hassle.

I looked over the DLC and nothing but [Mashlands](http://store.steampowered.com/app/73033/?snr=1_5_9__405) (zombies!) and [Vietnam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/42918/?snr=1_5_9__405) seem to add playable levels for co-op.  Can someone verify this or correct me if I'm wrong?

Also, there's no discount for buying all the DLC as a pack.  I don't think adding bonus items to characters seems fair really, but the [wizard set](http://store.steampowered.com/app/73030/?snr=1_5_9__405) is only 33 cents right now.  And the [party robes](http://store.steampowered.com/app/901679/?snr=1_5_9__405) seem to allow you to differentiate your character some more and give a little more of a role to play during co-op.

Edit: I would like to play it at some point, but the other option is to wait for a GotY edition that includes all DLC.
Edit: Another reason to hold off for the next sale would be to wait for bug fixes. [[1]](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ilokd/steam_summer_camp_sale_day_11_useful/c24rezw) [[2]](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ilokd/steam_summer_camp_sale_day_11_useful/c24rgp6)",3

Saturday night LoL was down and I decided to go ahead and play.  Declined the retarded Rockstar Social Club.  Spent 20 minutes reinstalling DX9 (I guess my version wasn't up to date?  Maybe it downgraded).  Watched some choppy video (surprised... this isn't a hot gaming laptop but it's no slouch), got to the apartment and it tried to auto save.  Fail!  Have to sign into GFWL to save the game.  

After I figured out my old password, it then decided an upgrade to GFWL was required.  This update took another 10-15 minutes to choke through on my Fiber connection, then informed me I needed to shut down the game to finish the install.  Sure!  Let me save.... oh wait.  All in all I wasted about 50 minutes trying to play my new, legally purchased GTA IV.  And then I decided I really wasn't that interested in playing, and went and read a book.

I may try again.  I guess I've already invested the time, but frankly, when I want to play a game, I want to play it now.  It's not some nebulous desire to play a game at some point in the future.",2

If you don't play the first game you lose out on the story that explains the basis to the series. Aka who the factions are, why they are conducting these Animus experiments.. Etc.

It starts out pretty good and gives you a good feeling, but as it draws out you come to understand that this is a shell of a game, and that the brilliant start never really materializes in the rest of the game. 

I did like the flashbacks, the way flashbacks were implemented was different and cool. 

This is a horror game, it has nice graphics and so on but it also has some really awkward quality issues and just plain dumb development that lacks polish. For example a lot of env is just cut and pasted, stuff just appear out of no where with no reason to appear other than... uh we r teh baddies spawning on your le head... it's not very coherent with the rest of the direction the game originally took.

The only thing the game was good for was showing off some graphics of then Nvidia cards (Thus why it was bundled free).


Edit: You get the game free with the following [EVGA cards](http://www.evga.com/articles/00471/cryostasisparts.asp) ( [Cryostasis free](http://www.evga.com/articles/00471/) ) and possibly other NV partners. Not sure if this still works.",2

Steam Summer Camp Sale Day 11 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary) (Final Set of Deals),603,"> I play mostly on steam, but I can play in offline if I choose so, or something happens to my internet connection.

Steam doesn't actually have a definitive FAQ on this subject so correct me if I'm wrong.

As far as I know, you can't enter offline mode unless your client is set to automatically log you in. You also can't be offline for more than 30 days (?) and your game/Steam must be fully patched (which might not be what you want and turning automatic updates off can be finicky).

All in all, offline mode seems to work the best if you preemptively know that you need to be offline and can switch to offline mode manually and cleanly. Stories about people being locked out of their games are but a Google search away.

> I could play any game of my choosing, thanks to offline mode

Don't you mean despite Steam's nearly always online DRM? You almost make it seem like a plus when surely the benchmark should be no DRM at all?",3

I admit, I have pirated a game before, for no reason, apart from just wanting to play it. I have also pirated a game because of a legit reason to me (in no way would hold up in court). For example: Game on steam is way higher in price than it should be in my country or I tried to purchase something off Origin with no success after trying for hours, got bored and pirated it.  
Buy the game to support the company, there is no doubt about that.

They got used to having successful games with overpriced DLC that everyone would buy anyway, and they decided to see how far they could take it.

There is no seasonality, like FIF.. ahum EA sports FC,  of Football Manager. We had amazing growth on the PC market thanks to increasing market size and Steam. But now that the same games of exceptional quality like terraria or GTA V are still top sellers, it will mean the end of many studios.

Total War Warhammer 3 devs will remove Steam users starting boycotts,13320,"It's a bit of a long tale, but to try and make a long story short, Creative Assembly is the developer of the Total War franchise. Not very long ago they announced that their DLC for Total War Warhammer 3 would see a price increase despite lacking in content. This compounded with numerous longstanding bugs still not being fixed and suggestions that the team left to work on it were only 20 people strong came across as jarring because of how popular the previous games in the series were. 

To then make matters worse, Rob Bartholomew, one of the people in charge, made a post that effectively said ""If you don't pay the new price we're just going to drop support."" This harkened back to a previous game known as Total War Three Kingdoms in which CA abruptly ended support despite a relatively successful release, so fans were rightfully pissed that they would suggest such a thing so arrogantly. 

At this same time, another game in the studio called Hyenas appeared to be draining all the resources. This game was an extraction shooter intended to be heavily monetized and be the ""next big thing"" in a market that honestly didn't want it. Every video that got posted would see huge negative reactions, and the social media presence was met with tons of blowback due to the apparent abandonment of their fans in pursuit of MTX.

Then just a few weeks ago, Sega (CA's publisher) finally did an assessment of the Hyenas project and promptly cancelled it. This in turn was also followed up with a massive restructuring within the company and a rumored 40% of their workforce downsized. A few youtubers found this information and later confirmed it with contacts they had inside CA. Discussions popped up all over the Total War subreddit and others, as well as the Steam Discussion page for Warhammer 3, where things went from bad to even worse.

A Moderator on the Steam Discussion saw a comment talking about the situation (with a bit of snark) and promptly banned the user. What they didn't realize was this user was a mod creator as well, and the ban locked him out of being able to update his Steam Workshop page. This was then followed up with an incredibly tonedeaf post from the Moderator who at one point said “The right to discuss is a privilege—it is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game"" along with threatening to ban anyone who wanted to protest or boycott their games.

And this is where we are now. CA's community lead (who was formerly from EA and did moderating for BFV and 2042) has attempted to put out an apology but it came across as just as tone deaf as the post they were apologizing for.",2970

Total War Warhammer 3 devs will remove Steam users starting boycotts,13320,"Wow these either aren't answers or to literally TLDR

Creative Assembly (Total War's developer) made ... controversial decisions recently. They discontinued Total War Three Kingdoms due to poor DLC sales, even though the main game was profitable. Warhammer 3 reintroduced bugs from Warhammer 2 and had lackluster updates from a skeleton crew., while hiking DLC prices THREE CONSECUTIVE TIMES, with the content nowhere near scaling. The response to criticism was ""inflation is tough, buy or we won't afford to update game."" Despite outward financial struggles, they reported record profits due to a U.K. tax rebate last year. 

Aside from Warhammer, CA produced historical ""sagas""—scaled-down versions of Total War games. Total War Troy underperformed, and its follow-up, Pharaoh, was even smaller in scale and higher in price. Many suspect Pharaoh was originally meant as a Troy DLC, repackaged for more profit. It has utterly flopped with virtually no active players and not a single TW youtuber endorsing it.

Additionally, CA heavily marketed Hyenas, a late-entry battle royale game. Recognizing the oversaturated market, they eventually canceled it, contributing to their reported 100 million loss this year and likely increased price of the aboce games to partially recoup. After all these setbacks, CA began silencing critics on Steam forums, possibly to mitigate shareholder concerns on this multi-layered financial catastrophe. This censorship only fueled outrage in unmoderated spaces like Reddit. Hence here we are .",26

Total War Warhammer 3 devs will remove Steam users starting boycotts,13320,"The marketing department has been in charge there for over a decade now. It has long been falling.

The old school fans of historical Total War were the first to realize things were rotting on the inside, especially when Rome 2 undid much of older Total war. Empire already messed up much the old engine got right, but given it was a new engine with a different focus in combat, people -including me- were at first forgiving as it surely would get fixed later, right? ^((What was wrong? Unit collision from old engine was lost, terrain didn't matter anymore like it used to, melee was no longer individual soldiers interacting.))

But the introduction of Warhammer masked that and the Warhammer fans were already tolerant for heavy monetization. There were fanboys defending CA's honor for them against all criticism for years. 

The company strongly grew in staff, but actual developers (coders) dwindled in influence and had no say in prioritisation. 

It kept rotting as engine development is no longer done. Marketing orders content shovelling into sellable units. Preferably recycled content. Now the consumers have finally mass realized it's fully stagnated.

This is fine. 

It's not a problem, in fact i'd call it *desirable*, to go with a relatively underutilized historical setting, especially something new to the franchise, instead of the same typical Medevial Europe, Early Modern Europe, or Feudal Japan that almost every historical themed game has as their setting.

Medieval and Early Modern Europe as well as Feudal Japan are some of the most common themes for historical games, movies, etc. As somebody interested in history and archeology (I regularly make multi-page posts on Aztec politics, Maya aqueduct systems, etc), I'd *much* rather see something like Egypt that's not as common already for a Total War Title vs those more common ones.

Immortal Empires didnt even release into BETA until a few months after launch, and CA had already announced that they were taking the main team to work on a different project and handing warhammer 3 off to the DLC team. But the fans preached patience to one another, as this was such a big undertaking there were bound to be growing pains. WH2 had a goofy launch as well, and they fixed it over time. So we decided to wait.

Fast forward 18 months and every change has largely been a lateral move. The battle AI is still ass. Units dont know how to direct fire. Units drop orders as soon as they bump into a large unit. It takes a unit 4 hours to gently rotate 10 degrees before you can use a basic projectile spell. You cant kill a routing enemy without SWAT riot control level tactics. Some dlc has come out, but the strategy for those seems to have been ""let's just make everything as powerful as possible"". Chaos dwarves literally have so much firepower that you dont even need their high powered tier 5 units to beat the game on high difficulty.

The game has languished. It's not anything close to what was promised all those years ago, and CA doesnt seem to care - they only communicate when theyre either announcing something new for you to pay for, or when theyre showcasing something new for you to pay for that hasnt been announced yet. They announce pharaoh for the historical fans. People are nonplussed. No one asked for another swords and sandals historical title. Plus warhammer 3 is still in a garbage state, and there's been no word from CA that theyre serious about making that game work. Theyre pumping millions into Hyenas while their flagship title, the only title making them any money, goes begging. And it feels like theyre just treating the fans of that title as pay pigs whose job is to buy whatever shit they decide to sell, in whatever state CA decides is good enough.

THEN shadows of change gets announced, and the price is astronomical, and people start to push back. The 60 dollars we spent on the base game hasn't even been met yet in terms of quality, and now they decide theyre going to charge 1/3rd the price of the whole game for some shitty factions that arent going to work right for months after release? Fuck that. Fans voice their discontent, Rob releases the worst statement ever, and it just snowballs from there.

Every development (Hyenas cancellation, Pharoah release) has just soured these formerly loyal fans further, and CA has gradually pulled back the mask to reveal themselves as lazy, short-sighted trend chasers who would rather release garbage and then ""move on to the next big thing"" rather than do the job right. They have a bit of a monopoly on the genre so they dont seem to fear their fans just deciding not to play their shitty, slapdash games anymore. There hasnt been an organized boycott so to speak, but a lot of formerly loyal fans are coming out now and saying theyre going to vote with their wallets, and punish these terrible business practices until CA decides to do right by them.",2

Seeing 15 different Clone Legions running around at the same time just... Ew.

I'd be much more tolerant of skin microtransactions in games like Call of Duty or Battlefield if it was client side. Let us customize how each team looks in our matches. Race, gender, the whole bit all the way down to gloves and patches. Hell, let us design presets for snow, summer, fall, or go even further and let us set spawn chances for a certain preset.

Take Battlefield. Maybe I want the engineer guy on the US faction to have a 50% chance either way of spawning in a snowy map with a face cover and goggles, or with just a face cover. Or maybe I want the Russian Recon/Sniper class to have 25% chance of spawning with a hood up rather than say a helmet, ballcap, or ballcap with a hood over it. 

It'd be cool! 

But that'd be too good. 

I would've bought Battlefield V and 2042 if we could have just had client side customization. I would've made each faction historically/thematically accurate, maybe with some flash here and there I found pretty neat, and let that be that.

It was a lot harder for there to be bloat, and therefore a lot fewer bugs and half-baked ideas were visible from the player's perspective.",62
Total War Warhammer 3 devs will remove Steam users starting boycotts,13320,"Answers will vary, but to me it's the amount of content and polish.

The game bends over backwards to be immersive, and is arguably the best ludo-narrative game of the era. You can easily roleplay a noble, god-fearing knight, a narcissistic opportunist, or a bloodthirsty madman without compromising the game in any way. Being Chivalrous and being dreaded both have their ups and downs. 

Polish-wise it's not perfect, but there's so many little things that never made a comeback. From silly little videos when your spies or assassins do their deeds to all of the hammy accented dialogue for almost every culture, to it being the first TW where each unit looked slightly different from the others, to combat animations. It was also Total War; you could (and should) use economics, political marriages, the Pope, spies, assassins, plagues, and hyper-specific tax policy to your advantage. 

Combat animations are phenomenal. The scene where an axe-wielding Danish finishes off one of my English swordsman amidst a massive battle will be forever burned into my brain.

It's also got an impressive skill ceiling. Easy to pick up, but even 500 hours later I was still learning new things about the game. Pressing your faction sigil highlights all the friendly and enemy forces, your fire-arrows can set siege weapons ablaze, giving you a small chance of winning a hopeless battle, and so much more.

Also, debated, but it has the best sieges of every total war. Some of the best last stands I've seen in gaming were entirely organic as my men held the gate, pouring bolts and oil on attackers. On a crusade campaign I vividly remember 5 brave crusaders managing to fend off Jihad attackers with 10 times the strength. My Byzantines fought so hard to hold Macedonia with their professional army only to get overrun by Venetians. There's also some cheese, like beating the Mongols purely because they only have horses and can't operate siege weapons. One time I had three full stacks of Polish troops take over a nearly empty Hungarian citadel and it was just so damn satisfying to see them coordinate line-by-line takeover of the walls.

tl;dr it blended elements of character expression, historical accuracy, strategy, politicking, and economy, coupled with an unforgettable battle system. Perfectly paced, perfectly executed battles, almost perfect blend of imperial elements.",48
Total War Warhammer 3 devs will remove Steam users starting boycotts,13320,"Older titles (up until shogun 2) were much better as a military strategy simulator. The models had better collisions, and the sound design was much better and more realistic. 

For example,  if I play Rome I know exactly whether my units are being hit by javelin, arrows or slingers, just by the sound of the impact. There are proper animations, and the projectiles are loud chunky and distinct.

 In Warhammer, projectiles are much slower and have a worse sound design, making them feel less impactful. The peak meme territory are the muskets, which fire in an arc, just like bows. This is because they ARE just bows, but with a different model rendered. The muskets are also never reloaded.  The units just stand around like they're waiting for their spell to come off cooldown

If you look closely, you can find dozens of small differences like this that make the old games feel more realistic and deep.",70

The main issue with TW is it doesn’t feel like there’s meaningful improvement with each new game. They’re releasing new games that still have the same issues as past games. It feels like the developer is more interested in pumping out the same game just with a different setting instead of actually pushing the franchise forward.",3
Total War Warhammer 3 devs will remove Steam users starting boycotts,13320,"An underrated aspect of both Rome I and Medieval II is the way the game could dynamically generate a battlefield map from the terrain on the corresponding campaign map. It was very clever, and meant they could generate thousands of battlefield maps without needing to manually create every single one. This was incredible for modding, as changing the campaign map (which you couldn't do in the newer Warscape engine until very recently) meant it would generate new battlefield maps for you automatically.

The Medieval II mods were also legitimately incredible. The Call of Warhammer mod inspired the Total Warhammer Trilogy, Westeros: Total War is the second-best Game of Thrones video game (only behind the Crusader Kings 2 mod), and Third Age: Total War mod is the best Middle-earth video game ever. There's even a Zelda Total War mod which is really good, and a fun Elder Scrolls one. The later Total War games do not allow total conversion modding on the same scale.

Medieval II also allowed full, proper sieges of elaborate, multi tier castle and city complexes. It also had the most evolution of units and tech, as you started with bows and catapults and ended with guns and mortar artillery. Plus, it had the second-biggest map (well, third counting Immortal Empires), spanning Europe, North Africa, and parts of North America. The Kingdoms expansion is also excellent. 

The good news is that a remaster of Medieval II is likely on its way, assuming its not the unannounced project that got canned behind the scenes.",4

Total War Warhammer 3 devs will remove Steam users starting boycotts,13320,"That I could see. I enjoy civ a lot, such as the management and planning, but personally can't get into Total War (or most RTS games) beyond just making blobs of death and pointing them towards the enemy. I understand the rock/paper/scissors aspect of some units, and some of the mechanics such as cover, but I don't really understand the morale system and most of my battles either end in major victories because I threw a wall of units at them or crushing defeats that I didn't really understand. 

I personally don't think most strategy games that have deeper aspects to them usually do a great job of explaining them other than providing a literal encyclopedia of all the game mechanics that I know I'll never read, which is a shame since most games (Nintendo, Valve, and more recently Sony studios) have been embracing a ""learn as you play"" concept where they bake tutorials into gameplay without it being explicit. 

Maybe it comes with the territory of a strategy game being inherently open concept and when it tells me ""build the horseman and charge at the ranged unit"" and I'm like ""okay I get what you're teaching me but being told what to do is really boring"" lol

Civ has the same issue. I only really understand civ because I've been playing since III and most of the broad concepts are similar game to game. There are still a lot of concepts of VI that I don't fully grasp and mostly ignore like spies and religion. It just takes away from the experience for me because I don't have fun managing it so I didn't bother to learn it.",2

I would rather pay a few bucks for a mod that works without fumbling with directions on Nexus. I want to pay to support the modders. Devs should officially support mods in their games and give 80% of revenue to the mod authors.

This sounds great on paper, and I too want to support modders. But when combined with the state of the industry and profit pressures in general, it would very quickly become a means of using underpaid labor to make the game for the big corporations and reducing mod scope and quality.",4
Total War Warhammer 3 devs will remove Steam users starting boycotts,13320,"Also the attention to detail, upgrading your units would make them look different on the battlefield, the cities changed as they got upgraded, you could see the trade routs on the map being active, the way the characters talked even, and so much more

Total War Warhammer 3 devs will remove Steam users starting boycotts,13320,"When Warhammer 3 released the other two basically become DLC or expansions. The Warhammer trilogy was always meant to be one big game. Every new release has just added a continent and some new factions. The game is still the same. There is a bigger difference between vanilla Shogun 2 and it's expansion Fall of the Samurai(which is my favourite TW game), than between WH1 and WH3. FOTS changes how you play the game. It's on the same damn map yet everything is different. Buying a new WH game is the same as buying a race pack except you get a new map and story.",8
Total War Warhammer 3 devs will remove Steam users starting boycotts,13320,"Yeah, with games like total war, the battles just take time to understand. I honestly think that creative assembly would do a poor job of explaining it too. It’s also as much about how you build an army for cohesiveness as it is about the actual battle itself. Your army will come up against many different builds from the ai and it needs to be capable of dealing with them. There’s a lot of planning and strategy that goes into that and you need to be able to adapt your strategy based on what your facing.

The movement on campaign is massively under estimated as well. Knowing how to effectively move your armies on the campaign map, knowing when to give up settlements, being able to out manoeuvre the ai etc is all skill based. In a game where armies are expensive and you’re severely limited in how many you have, you need to be really smart in how you deploy them. You also need to pay a lot of attention to which factions don’t like you and may declare war at any time. You can easily lose by going all in on a war and then getting hit by another faction suddenly declaring war. You could say some of these same points about civ, I’d just say there’s a lot more depth and importance in this area in TW compared to civ.

Managing the actual cities is a lot simpler than in civ, but you do still need to know how to do it effectively.",3
Total War Warhammer 3 devs will remove Steam users starting boycotts,13320,"Civ is basically ""you are america build your cities and make the world yours"" total war is ""you are the general, build your armies and make the world yours"" the focus in total war has always been heavy HEAVY strategy beyond rock paper scissors.

Steam Holiday Sale Day 9 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary),230,"Here's my insight for day 9, (as usual, feel free to leave any comments on the deals) 

**[The Dawn of War Series](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/DawnOfWar)** are some of the most chaotic and brutal RTS games ever made. Missiles fly over the screen, dreadnoughts impale the infidels, and the Unclean One spews his unholy vomit on all who oppose him. This RTS franchise  is constantly action packed and is the most aggressive RTS I've played. My personal pick of the bunch is Dawn of War II: Retribution, which has the streamlined chaotic nature of Dawn of War II, but with the most content and no GFWL. I would definitely check out Retribution (nobody plays the original Dawn of War II or Cahos Rising, only Retribution) and maybe the original Dawn of War collection (only get Gold and Dark Crusade, Soulstorm is rubbish) if you're looking for an action packed RTS. Remember, there is only war! 

**[The Gothic Franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/Gothic)** is a series of hardcore European RPGs. Being a hardcore European RPG, the UI isn't very friendly, and some of the mechanics are clunky. The first two games were particularly good, but the quality of the series sharply drops from there, and from there onwards, it's not worth bothering with. If yo're desperate for an RPG that you can get into, check out the first two Gothic games, but ignore the later ones. 

**[Cities in Motion](http://store.steampowered.com/app/73010/)** appears to be a Simcity ripoff at first glance. However, while Simcity focused on managing an entire city, Cities in Motion focuses purely on mass transit and traffic. While this may sound tedious, the developers did make the game mechanics fairly enjoyable, if repetitive. Check it out if you've been dying for a Simcity esque experience of some sort. 

**[The Prince of Persia franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/Holiday2011_PrinceofPersia)** is a set of action platformers with a focus on fluid and challenging platforming. The best elements of the series are the the acrobatics sections that test your agility and platforming skills. The best comparison would the the platforming of the Assassin's Creed series, and if you enjoyed that, you'll enjoy the Prince of Persia games. That being said, only the Sands of Time Trilogy is worth checking out, as the other games don't quite live up to them. 

**[Call of Duty Black Ops](http://store.steampowered.com/app/42700/)** is yet another FPS in the undying Call of Duty series. Unlike the modern warfare games, I actually quite enjoyed this one, as it has a quirky sense of humor. Black Ops is a fairly solid game,but it's way too overhyped, and I don't really support the business model, but the gameplay is solid. If you want a mindless shooter to lose yourself in for a few hours, there's not too much harm that Black Ops could cause. I'd recommend it, but if you haven't particularly cared for the Call of Duty series, this isn't going to make you a crusader for the cause. Overall, Treyarch did a solid job in developing this game, and I've enjoyed it a lot. If you've grown tired of the series, there's going to be little here for you. But for newcomers and fans looking for more Call of Duty, it's a solid choice, and you could do a lot worse.  At the current price, I wouldn't recommend it, and the DLC isn't even discounted, so I'd pass this up, unless you really want it. A full review of Black Ops can be found on [my blog](http://thepcelitist.blogspot.com/2011/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-review-solid-yet.html) as well. 

**[Terraria](http://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/)** is a Metroidvania style action platformer with building elements akin to Minecraft. While some might dismiss it as a 2D knockoff of Minecraft, it's much more than that. Terraria has a significantly larger focus on exploration, platforming, and combat than Minecraft, to the point where I'd consider them different genres. The building isn't as addictive as Minecraft, but the exploration and the loot will suck you into its charm. 

**[Sequence](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200910/)** is a rhythm based RPG by Iridium Studios. It's a very bizarre combination of Dance Dance Revolution's arrow matching mechanics, and a tactical RPG. There are three menus, defense, mana, and spells. You must constantly switch between these three menus to be successful in combat. The game has a great sense of humor, and the soundtrack by Ronald Jenkees is fantastic. Definitely worth the 1.25, the same price as a coffee at McDonald's, but so much better. 


**[Disciples 3](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/Disciples3)** is a great example of when you take a great franchise and ruin it. Initially, it looks to be a fairly competent stratetic RPG. However, it's not. There's bugs a plenty, combat is shallow, audio is lame, there's no online multiplayer (which the previous game had), a poor tutorial system, a lack of challenge, as well as general depth, and the campaign is sterile. Avoid this mess of a game, it's not worth your time. 

**[Stronghold 3](http://store.steampowered.com/app/47400/)** is also another result of when you shit on an established franchise. It's like Stronghold 1, but with the piss taken out of it. Ignoring the plentiful bugs and numerous crashes, Stronghold 3 still isn't very good. It's incredibly slow paced, to the point where a sloth would get impatient, the tutorial is very lackluster, and the combat is shallow. The only positive thing about this game is that the developers are patching it up frequently, so if it's actually decently playable now, I don't know. Definitely not worth your money at 3 dollars, let alone 33. 

**[The Star Wars Franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/StarWars)** is quite varied, actually. To be honest, all of these games are quite good. Republic Commando was a very solid strategic FPS with a heavy emphasis on squad tactics. Star Wars Battlefront 2 is a very fun team based shooter with 64 player servers. Knights of The Old Republic is a very solid RPG by Bioware. Empire at War is a very solid RTS, and Jedi Knight has very fun melee combat. If you're open to different genres and you love Star Wars to death, you really cannot go wrong with any of these games. 

I haven't tried out **[Solar 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/97000/)** yet, but it looks like an engaging sandbox shooter. From what I've read, you start off as an asteroid and you have to build yourself up by smashing into other asteroids. That asteroid then merges with your own. You do this all up until you become a planet, a star, then a neutron star, etc. It looks quite interesting, and for 2.50, there's not much risk in giving it a shot. There is a demo, which I will try out to get a better verdict. 

Finally, we have the **[F.E.A.R](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/holidaysale2011fear)** series, a set of horror-action FPS games. The horror is a lie. This series is as scary as a piece of wet cardboard (less so, in fact. Touching wet cardboard might make you wet). And as we've learned with Dead Space or Resident Evil 5, enemies aren't scary when you can blow their faces with shotguns. That being said, the shooting is immensely enjoyable, with the AI in F.E.A.R 1 among the best in any FPS game. F.E.A.R 3 (I refuse to call it F.3.A.R) also has very satisfying and visceral gunplay. The multiplayer in F.E.A.R 3 is a blast, with Fucking Run and Soul King being the standouts for me. I'd say that F.E.A.R 2 is the weakest link of the franchise, but it is still a solid game. Overall, if you get past the uninspired scares, you'll find some solid, if generic, shooters. Definitely worth a look for fans of FPS games.

Steam Holiday Sale Day 9 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary),230,"[Sequence](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200910/) was one of my favorite games this year. If I was going to compare it to any one game - apart from DDR of course - it would be to The World Ends With You.

The humour stands out with its constant barrage of puns in item descriptions and clever dialogue that's often delivered extremely well. The story ended up being far better than I expected, and you might not discover everything unless you look for it...

On the hardest difficulty - aptly described as ""for those socially challenged"" - it was a challenge even though I'm quite good at stepmania. The multi tasking added by field switching and activating spells with cooldowns really changes things. Though, it probably would have helped a lot if I remaped keys and didn't use one hand exclusively for notes.

Finally it might be worth mentioning that the (sole)developer has been very active since the game was released. It's been patched something like 10 times, and he has added requested features like speed modifiers.

Steam Holiday Sale Day 9 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary),230,"Well, no, because I've never played Minecraft. But from what knowledge the Internet has shared with me, I can try. 

Terraria is like a 2D Minecraft *at its core*. You wander around hitting things with a pickaxe, gaining materials, building blocks, protecting yourself from zombies at night, etc. Whereas Minecraft is better when it comes to the building aspects (since Terraria's lack of a third dimension limits you a bit) Terraria is about the adventure. So while you are building and mining and exploring and basically playing minecraft, this isn't the goal. There are bosses and companions and dungeons and difficult foes to face and *that* is the best part about Terraria.

To put it simply, if you like Minecraft or Terraria you'll probably like the other. One focuses more on the creation aspect, while the latter focuses on the adventure aspect. In the the end they are just two different flavors of the same pastry.",3
Steam Holiday Sale Day 9 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary),230,"Terraria is a little bit like Minecraft as you collect resources and can make constructions, but it's also like Metroid/Castlevania as in you can upgrade your character by finding items and crafting weapons and you have to kill a big sort of enemies. And it's like Mario since it's a platformer.

It's actually fun. I mean, it's not that much about crafting and building but transversing terrains and exploring places like a underground jungle, the dungeon or even hell if you dig straight down. Heck, there are even floating islands guarded by Harpias and it's a bit tricky to get on them.

Steam Holiday Sale Day 9 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary),230,"1.1 added a ton of new things, in particular, hard mode. Hard mode is what you do after you get to the point where you'd be done before 1.1. After you activate hard mode by beating a rather hard boss, a new biome appears, the Corruption gets far stronger, and all enemies are now harder. All the bosses have new upgraded versions. Corruption and Hallow (the new biome) start to spread across the world, with both being substantially harder to stop. Sunflowers won't cut it. Thankfully Hallow stops Corruption and vice versa.

1.1.1 added all the Christmas stuff. From the 15th to the 31st, all new worlds will have a snow biome (as well as 1/3 new worlds after the 31st), and all enemies have a chance of dropping presents. There's a new invasion, which is summoned by getting a snow globe, which you get randomly when opening presents in a hard mode world. After beating the new invasion, Santa shows up as an NPC, but only until the 31st.

So my recommendation is to take all your old stuff, start a new world, and try really hard to get Santa before January.",1

Total War: Warhammer 3 DLC is getting more expensive and the community is rebelling: 'Remember they need us more than we need them',2672,"Warhammer 2 was loved, though it had its own problems at launch which didn't fully resolved into 6-12 months later. It basically spent years and years honing the game balance and QoL features to a razor's edge.

(For those unfamiliar with the game, it's divided into multiple races/factions with wholly unique campaign mechanics and unit rosters. Within those races/faction are Legendary Lords, with unique campaign bonuses, starting locations, and mechanics. A single campaign with a single lord could go a dozen or more hours.)

The DLC program for that title was excellent, however, and a big hit with the fanbase. 

The minor DLC, called ""Lord Packs,"" gave 2 new lords, along with additional unit rosters, for existing factions. Everyone would also get an additional 3rd lord for free with the ""patch."" Total cost: $8

The major DLC, called ""Race Packs,"" gave an entirely new race/faction in the game, complete with unique campaigns and unit rosters, along with 3 lords. Total cost: $15

So on average you're paying about $4/10 hrs of content. Pretty good deal, especially since there's a lot of evergreen appeal to the game, since new lords/races can show up as enemies in future campaigns. On top of that, WH2 introduced the ""Mortal Empires"" map which added the entire first game's content into the second on a combined map, 100% free for owners of the first game and its DLC.

Warhammer 3 isn't as bad as folks make it out to be, but had no excuse to not be substantially better. A staggering amount of lessons learned and improvements were tossed out for no reason, and the overall game quality backslid noticeably. Like literally backslid, changes implemented in WH2 were reverted to their pre-changed state. On top of multiple bugs and balancing issues that still haven't been fully resolved. Some of that was fixed post-release, but it's still nowhere near where WH2 was time for time. That said, they did continue the evergreen tradition by adding a new 3rd (frankly ridiculous in a good way) combined ""Immortal Empires"" map, again 100% free for owners of the previous content. The general vibe from the community is... it's in an ok state, with an unacceptable number of outstanding bugs and QoL issues.

But then they changed the DLC roadmap. 

The game came with a Day 1 ""major"" DLC (ugh) in the form of a race pack. Except now it was $20, only had 2 lords, and was clearly meant to be in the core game given it was fully integrated into the WH3-only map. Not a great start.

Then the first ""minor"" DLC added 4 lords for $15. The overall quality and additions were less than what WH2 had gotten in the past, but came with a major overhaul for a faction from WH1, so was overall well received. At least it kept the general pricing of $4/lord (though, conspicuously, no free lord for everyone).

Then a second ""major"" DLC landed. Now it was $25, a 50% increase from WH2, but was pretty much to the original quality. Still not looking great, and now every DLC and patch was breaking more than it fixed.

Now we've seen the second ""minor"" DLC lord pack. 3 lords, none of them free, and a $25 price tag. **Triple** the price of the same amount of content as WH2. Utterly insane. And the chief of products or whatever basically gave the community their ""Do you not have phones!?"" treatment by saying that's just the cost of supporting the game, with a veiled threat they'll pull future DLC development if it doesn't sell well.

Hence the outrage, and why WH3 isn't much liked anymore.",112

CA finally responded by acting like a ""mobster"" and said they should buy this DLC and the future ones or it would be a *shame if something happened to the game.*

Total War: Warhammer 3 DLC is getting more expensive and the community is rebelling: 'Remember they need us more than we need them',2672,I mean I don’t really like this argument per se. While you can definitely make an argument for those skins being too expensive you can just not buy skins or you can spend $15 on a battle pass that gives you three different skin lines meaning you get what like 10-15 different skins all for different guns AND a knife skin. I understand that you think companies shouldn’t be allowed to make money but I feel like your argument here doesn’t really work because the skins aren’t the content so you aren’t being locked out of gameplay by not having them. DLC actively restricts your ability to play the content as it is locked behind a paywall. Game doesn’t change if you don’t have skins. Company needs to make money though and I feel like a free game with cosmetics is objectively better as you can opt in to support the company or opt out.,-20

Total War: Warhammer 3 DLC is getting more expensive and the community is rebelling: 'Remember they need us more than we need them',2672,"The historical background is that CA killed support for 3 Kingdoms after lackluster DLC sales, and that was a very well liked game within the community. 

Some folks are still raw about that, so mentioning the future of TWW3 is dependent on DLC sales was widely read as tone deaf (at the very least) when the community was upset about the pricing scheme. 

Many people interpreted the studio as saying that voting with their wallets will not result in pricing changes for future DLC, but the discontinuation of future content",64
Total War: Warhammer 3 DLC is getting more expensive and the community is rebelling: 'Remember they need us more than we need them',2672,"That's exactly what they're talking about. That statement could basically be translated as: ""If you want us to keep this game going, we're going to need all of you to pay these inflated prices for whatever scraps of DLC we throw your way."" I believe that's what they're referring to as mobster behaviour, as that would essentially be extortion.

For context; I have no horse in this race, I don't even own the game, just explaining what I've understood from what others have said about this.",38
Total War: Warhammer 3 DLC is getting more expensive and the community is rebelling: 'Remember they need us more than we need them',2672,"Depends on the definition of mobster behavior. I'll admit they haven't decapitated a horse and dumped it into a content creator's bed, yet.

It's just people have paid already quite a lot of money and the current state of the game is severely lacking. Warhammer has been a cashcow for CA and we all realize CA has to make a profit and use those profits to develop new games. That's natural, and fair.

But promises were made to improve the game and people had a lot of hope. If I had known 18 months later the game would still be in this state I would have asked for a refund but it's too late for that.

The combination of the unresolved issues and asking people to pay again nearly half of the basegame while offering so few things came across as unfair. Their followup response come across as extortionate. And extortion is mafia behavior.

But i'll edit the post and put mobster between quotation marks to show it's an allegory.

Personally I didn't care much about the price, I haven't bought any of the 3 dlc's yet because I believe the game isn't worth it at the time.

And if the game was in a good state right now, half the people complaining now would have bought it because they do want to support it.

Hell, before the \*pay up or else\* post most people were asking for adding just a bit more content like an extra generic lord, hero or unit to flesh out the new lords a bit more. (okay some where asking for a lot more but you'll always have extremists)

Edit: It's also not just one DLC, but the entire roadmap of 3 DLC's. Which in total would cost more then the basegame.

Even paradox doesn't announce 3 25€ DLC's when their are such major issue's in the current build.",10

Total War: Warhammer 3 DLC is getting more expensive and the community is rebelling: 'Remember they need us more than we need them',2672,"Diablo is one example in many. You’re argument is nonsense because while you say they could be too expensive you think the flip side is everyone saying they should *not* be allowed to make money. There is no nuance or thought in that argument. 

Do you think a game being “free” to play justifies the steeper prices? Up to $40 for nothing but a skin? You already said no but… you did it anyway. Don’t forget that game was *free* to play. If the game wasn’t free to play what would you think a fair cost for a game with one map, a couple modes usually limited to player counts, and a plethora of customisation options? Are we really talking about just making money here when the most profitable billion dollar games are F2P? What kind of manipulation and psychology should they be forgiven on the basis that the game is simply free to play?

The game itself being built around monetisation effects gameplay. Doesn’t effect competition?? Sure, also whatever. It’s very much an anti-consumer way of thinking to say anything goes otherwise. I think if that’s you’re line of thinking you’re already to deep and should really start looking into how this all works. 

The knock on effect is that just about all games - paid or F2P now incorporate this monetisation system. Do you think games that aren’t selling skins don’t make money? So how do you think we’ve had a games industry for so long without it? Do you truly think the only reason microtransactions are so profitable is because they are value adding? Or is there more to it than that. I’d even go so far to say your reasons for them being so valuable are psychological and to your own detriment, the same way Fortnite sees bullying in schools if someone is found to not have an NFL skin in game. 

There is much, MUCH more manipulation going on under the hood of these games than just a cool looking skin and F2P shouldn’t be the excuse it is for not only steep prices, but manipulation, both of which make a business argument so strong the entire industry has bent towards it. If you truly want me to believe it’s all justified, name me one of these games that hasn’t also hired psychologists. It was never a fair fight in the first place.",3

Another issue at least for me is that the troops you get to defend a settlement is never enough to actually defend it making it pointless to fight.

Also siege battles have been bad in total war overall for quite a while. All units can just build ladders and climb walls in a siege and also all units can break down gates.

People just like owning stuff they think looks nice. Art is no different. If I have to look at something I want it to look nice. I paint my walls colours that look nice I put up art pieces that look nice. In the grand scheme of things all of those things are a waste of time but we’re social creatures who crave diversity. Skins in games are no different. In a game it’s basically the same as deciding what clothes you want to wear. Sometimes I just want the things I’m looking at to look different or be different from what other people has. Finding any deeper value in that is a waste.

Total War: Warhammer 3 DLC is getting more expensive and the community is rebelling: 'Remember they need us more than we need them',2672,I think having the game completely free justifies whatever price they want to put on it because its optional. Making AAA games 90$ for content that is almost never worth 90$ is more robbery than any OPTIONAL cosmetic price. I dont go to the store and see a sweater thats 500$ and yell at them for ripping me off. I think damn rich people are crazy and thats it. Sometimes people just like spending money when they have it to support whatever theyre into. Teamfight Tactics had limited things you can buy and whales literally came in droves and asked the developer to give them MORE things to spend money on. Theres a video of Mortdog one of the developers talking about that interaction. Also affected gameplay in what way because it doesnt give players literally ANY difference in how the game plays out. The game is not built around monetisation thats quite literally the stupidest thing Ive ever heard. Hitboxes on headshots are not changed depending on skin it never was in those games and never will be. Youre assuming that the prices are only steep when they arent. There are reasonable prices too for skins that really arent that bad. You can spend 15$ in valorant and get 10-15 skins that are all pretty damn nice. Youre a fucking delusional asshole with literally NO context at all spewing ideologies that make no sense because you have no idea what the actual games are like. Saying these games are bad because marketing tactics are horrible doesnt mean anything because these marketing tactics are used in EVERYTHING on EVERYONE. So victimizing a specific game for a broken system doesnt matter. Theres also a ton of free ways to get free stuff that theyre adding every time. Free skins as well.

But hey, it was free right? Don’t worry about the in-house psychologist that’s helping ‘develop’ the game. 

If it wasn’t for the latter that makes up the majority of what F2P games entail I wouldn’t even bat an eyelid. But they’ve done extensive damage to the medium and completely distorted the industry. 

The reason these games exist is because a bunch of wealthy people bankrolled a game that might become the next quick way to a buck. Hence we’ve discovered loot boxes, lacklustre season passes and even NFTs since we started this path. Thats why we now have to question whether children are gambling. Thats why Halo sells ‘blue’ and the campaign was still full price by itself. Like spinning off multiplayer as free to play is some gift, now please pay us for primary colours. 

That’s why “idiots” is fitting. Because idiots bankrolled us here and idiots don’t know any better, they bought blue. You’re playing shells of games designed to feed your brain hooks and good vibes. That can be enjoyable! But I’d trade every single one of those titles for decent honest business practice, something F2P just cannot offer, because it’s not about being free.

I'm happier this one seems really appealing to players who struggled a lot with Souls, I still struggle so much with the games so it's completely understandable. I just hope that there isn't a bandwagon of ""This game is the most difficult shit ever!"" unless it feels truly difficult, I feel like people saying that about the Souls franchise have really scared off a lot of new players 🐊🐊",2

It has a steep learning curve for 4 yo but I'm pretty sure if ahe gets interested she'll be able to handle it. In case she doesn't get it but still interested i.

I chose AoE2 because it has a bigger amount of civilizations to choose from, the medieval setting, campaigns and the little history lessons you can check from the main menu. Besides, imo, it's the more accessible game from the entire series.

I also recommend *against* Path of Exile.

This has been my entire afternoon.,1,"Some context:

There is a weird problem with xbox game pass for pc where sometimes when you try to play a game it will launch the Microsoft Store and tell you that you need to install/update ""Gaming Service"", but no matter how many time you reinstall/repair/reset/update that stupid app, it will continue to block you from playing.

For whatever reason this problems has been around since the beta days of game pass and for me it pops up at least once a month.

During this time i have come to the conclusion that the Game Services error is actually sentient and EVIL, and will target whatever game you want to play the most at any given time, proven by the fact that of all games i have installed on game pass, the only one that is causing this error is Total Warhammer 3, which is the game i want to play right now.

Anyway, just wanted to rant a bit about my stupid issue and made a meme to deal with the frustration.

I will now go back to powershell to continue the forced uninstall and reinstall of Gaming Service until magically it decides to work again with no explanation whatsoever.",1

Thoughts:

- Portal is a 5

- KOTOR is a 5

- OG Battlefront II is a 5 as well

- Conker's Bad Fur Day > Conker: Live and Reloaded

- Play Ocarina first. It's a 5, and so is Link to the Past. I would call Majora's Mask a 4 by comparison but not everyone feels the same.

- Controversial: If a Halo game is going to be on there, it should be Combat Evolved ~~or ODST~~

- Controversial: I just don't think L4D2 is that special or genre-defining, but I hope you have fun with it

- Controversial: I'm gonna get hate for this one... But I don't consider the mainline Crash Bandicoot games to be must-play.

- Pokemon G/S/D gen (5) is the only gen you need. Pokemon Stadium is fine, but I wouldn't give it more than a 3.
- Disgaea 5 is fun, but not bucket list worthy IMO

- I would drop Fallout 4 in favour of Fallout 1 and 2

- Controversial: God of War (2018) is the best of the God of War games. I wouldn't even list the others if it were me.
- Minecraft is beatable

- Hollow Knight is on there twice

- I'm thinking you got whooshed with that Bugs Bunny game... Could be wrong, though

- I would drop Diablo III and replace it with Diablo II

- Donkey Kong Country Returns is a whole different game from the original

- Of the Kingdom Hearts games, I would say pick 1 and 2 for the list. Opening it up to the whole series means including some BAD games

- Jak and Daxter is a great platformer. When it comes to the others, I'd rather just play GTA

- Only Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite belong on the list - Bioshock 2 wasn't made by Irrational games and it shows.

- Terraria is beatable

- Prince of Persia will be the trilogy from the early 2000's. I had the first on Gamecube. It's dope.

Additions:
- Final Fantasy VI (5)

- KOTOR 2 (5) As good, if not better, than KOTOR 1.

- Super Mario Bros. 2 (5) (I mean the REAL Super Mario Bros. 2)

- Street Fighter 2 Turbo (5)

- Super Meat Boy (5)

- The Binding of Isaac (5)

- Cave Story (5)

- Mount and Blade: Warband (5) This is the most egregious omission of them all!

- Deus Ex: Human Revolution (4)

- Baldur's Gate II (5)

- Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (5)

Ratings:
- I'd give every Mario game listed a 5

- CTR is a 5

- Uncharted 2 is a 5. IMO the others are not.

- I'd call Dark Souls 3 a 4

- I'm sorry. I love Heavy Rain... But I just can't see it being a 5.

- Telltale's The Walking Dead Season 1 is a 5

- Fallout: New Vegas is a 5, and Fallout 3 is a 4

- Super Metroid is a 5, Fusion and Prime are 4s

- Arkham Asylum is a 5, Arkham City is a 5, Arkham Knight is a 3-4

- Pong is a 5. How do you even compete?

- IMO Stanley Parable is a 5; it's the smartest, most self-aware game I know of

- Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines is a great game. It's legendary. The story, the roleplaying elements... They're amazing. But it's clearly unfinished and the level design is occasionally really, really terrible. For these reasons I would give it a 4 at most despite its status as a must-play game.

Pointless Commentary:
- American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator - y tho?

- The Elder Scrolls ratings are perfect

- You're gonna beat Nethack, OP? Good luck :)

- Wow, King's Quest 6... I haven't thought about that game in years. It's on my personal all-time list, but I'd have never expected to see it here!

- Fuck yeah Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow!

- Fuck yeah Planescape: Torment!

Jet Set Radio - First game to use cel shaded graphics, is a great game and simply because there is nothing like this out there

Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2 - Helped blow up skateboarding, but also had great gameplay and a incredible soundtrack. I remember lots of media saying it was the best game of all time at the time.

Sonic 2 - If 3k is listed I think 2 should be as well. It was the first game to be released worldwide on the same day. This game alone gave the SEGA the better market share over the SNES as well. An important part of history.

I agree with a LOT of your points. I also feel that L4D2 is not genre defining. I personally am a massive fan of the original L4D compared to it's sequel. Even so, as great as they are, they are fun for their multiplayer. The community is almost non-existent for those games now, so it most likely won't be in the play through, because of that. There is a campaign, but without friends it's not the most exciting thing in the world.

Thank you so much for the ratings! I want to make sure I play the best of the best and, because this project got bigger than I expected I had to make the decision to only complete games that are listed at rating 3 or higher. Which means any game with a N/A is not getting played until the rest have been completed, so ratings are very very helpful.

As for the Truck simulator games. You know, I've never found an interest in them (not that it matters I will beat every game listed), but I was shocked to see when someone wrote those down they had quite the following. Every comment I've got for them on any post I've made has a quite a few upvotes.

I've already fixed a few of the double listed things and being confused by double named games, but I will look into adjusting anything you listed

"Hey /r/gaming, what games should I play for my PC, specs and list of what I've got inside",9,"Killing Floor is awesome. I think a more valid comparison would be comparing it to Call of Duty Zombies. It's a significantly better version of that with a higher player count, various different zombies, and a lot more variety. Definitely worth it.",2
"Hey /r/gaming, what games should I play for my PC, specs and list of what I've got inside",9,"Well you are part of a squad that has been deployed to take care of zombies (waves of them) in between waves a trader opens up a shop in which you spend money you earn during the zombie wave (you get money for the damage you do to zombies, not just killing them. This is because sometimes you can spend a lot of bullets taking down a huge zombie, then someone shoots one pistol shots and steals the kill! so money is distributed according to damage done rather than kills)

There is a good variety of weapons to choose from and a few models. Also in the game, there is a perk system; you can choose a speciality (sharpshooter, commando..etc) you get extra % damage using certain types of weapons or shooting headshots...etc

The map list is sufficient and it does prove entertaining. You can play solo, and it is fun... but coop online is definitely the best experience for the game. Make sure you try and play on dedicated servers if you ever do (by clicking the dedicated servers filter at the bottom) 

Two things I dislike about the game though:

1.server browser: you cannot stop refreshing, even if you spot a server you like... so trying ot click on the server as it moves up and down the server browser is a bit of a pin.

2.the movements of the models is a bit awkward... not like counter strike/L4D where its fast and smooth. The way models move, just looks a bit odd as you look at other players moving (you don't feel any awkwardness as you move, just how it looks) 

The game it self is good and it does live up to its name..... it is horror and worst when you are the last survivor of your squad and have to fight off like 50 zombies... almost every zombie is specialised! really scary haha 

So I do recommend yes! but bear in mind the two points up there... the game is quite popular on reddit, I have seen a thread on it recently (yesterday) and it has a very positive vibe around here",2

Killing monsters gets hard really quick and you really don't want to die ingame. Its very challenging.

It's an almost perfect mix of casual elements (crafting and energy systems), with hardcore elements (gameplay). You should try it yourself. Music is awesome.",1

4X games: Am I the only one that gets anxious?,3,"You are not the only person who experiences this. You hear about this most frequently with competitive multiplayer games as ''ladder anxiety''. 


Personally i didn't have any problems with Civilization V but it did show up in VI and Endless Legend. And especially in my first Grand Strategy EU4.


Luckily there is a very easy solution to this problem. 


Just play.


Just keep playing. It isn't an elegant solution. It isn't a magical one that instantly fixes your problem. But it is the truth. Play long enough until it becomes normal. Play until it becomes a habit. Force yourself to keep playing the same run.


Almost everything in life is habit. If you want to see change you have to work to forceably change those habits. But once you do that is your new normal. And it will feel strange to quit a campaign early",5

"Need help with a list of games, chose the best/the worst",1,"**FPS:**
*Best:* Serious Sam - This game is awesome to just roll through with a couple of buddies. Everytime someone gets blasted by those headless suicide boys take a drink.

*Worst:* CS - Don't get me wrong it's a good game but you can't pull of crazy shit like in serious sam or unreal tournament. 

**Race:** 
*Best:* Mariokart - beware you might lose some friends with blue shells.

*Worst:* NFS most wanted - never liked it. 

**3rd person:**
*Best:* Starwars

Never played the other ones on the list

**Platform:**
*Best:* Worms Armagedon - Used to do this allot with friends. Uncheck some of the bullshit weapons if you wanne have a bit of skill involved. (airstrike and such) If your friends are shit at worms leave them on.

*Worst:* Soldat - Gets boring to soon.

**Fight:**
*Best:* SSBM - if you are with 2+ people this is the game to go and again if your friends are shitty at it leave the items on.

*Worst:* If with 2 all are fine but don't let a friend waiting for his turn.

**Co-op:**
*Best:* L4D - Easy to get into and quick into the action.

*Worst:* Payday - Never liked it so never played it lan. Maybe it's good?

**Strategy:**
Best: Warcraft III - Quick and fun games with 2v2 or free for all it never gets boring.
Worst: Medieval Total War - Games and turns take for ever

**Others:**
*Best:* Mario Tennis - Easy to learn and really fun.

*Worst:* Fifa 14 - I hate Fifa games but if you and your friends enjoy them go for it.

"Need help with a list of games, chose the best/the worst",1,"**Fps:** I'm thinking in put Halo Combat Evolved 2 since I have really nice memories of playing it online with some friends and about CS is mostly because it was my first lan experience (and a lot of my friends too). Will definitely put Unreal Tournament and probably Serious Sam :)

**Race** SO many to choose, to be fair I really didn't like Most Wanted that much too (at least compared to underground 2), Flatout 2 brings me very nice memories and I bet it will be a blast, thanks for the advice on Mario Kart, what you think about trackmania? (I have mixed feelings since I think there is no ""clash"", but the tracks are crazy fun)

**Plataform** To be honest Worms is very fun but I don't like turn based games, that's why I put Soldat here (and because a lot of people talked to me about it)

**Co-op** I just put some games there because some of my friends said them because I think I would have much more fun killing them on LAN than helping them survive :P

**Strategy** Because of some of my friends, I don't even like Warcraft (yeah, sorry, kill me but I played that 1 time, i didn't understand shit and it was boring as fuck, I don't like strategy games anyway)

**Others** Well, we are in Europe (don't know if you are too) and around here football is the true spot, a lot of us really like it, imo it has to be 1 vs 1 to be fun (some games 3 vs 3 must be FUN just for the laughs but it probably will get boring) so I'll have to organize it so nobody is ""quiet"" while the others are playing Fifa",1

"Need help with a list of games, chose the best/the worst",1,"*> what you think about trackmania?*

Trackmania is a top contender in my book. It's fast, crazy and it plays like arcadegame. So yea, if you feel like playing it go for it. Personally  i'm a bigger fan of the mario franchise. That's why it's my go to race game for lans.


Honestly it's also what people feel like playing at the moment. Sometimes it's Mario Kart the drinking game and another moment it's super serious with Forza

Also the heavy Nintendo bias shows the more European and especially North American bias as those consoles were the most successful over here (to the point for many people, “Nintendo” and “video game console” were synonymous in the early adoption days).

Anyway, rating videogames is really tough tho. Final fantasy 7 or halo combat evolved are not even close to be the best entry in the series, still they got the advantage on being the first, value that in videogames tends to be REALLY blurry sometimes. I mean ff7 is not even bad, it did a magistral job creating what it did on PS1, but at the same time, ff9 is just better in everything, but in ""inventing"" the system. On the other hand, most people should agree on the fact that ff6 is somewhat better than ff7 too, even if it a really old style game even compared to PS1 games. Same goes for DOOM, sure it's a legend, but what would a logical human being play today, DOOM or DOOM eternal? It's really complicated if you ask me, even if there are exceptions, like bioshock, cause at least for now, it's not too old but it's still GOAT.

The breakdown by decade is very relevant. A lot of games ranks higher with nostalgia factor, which removes objectivity out of the rankings concerning the intrinsic quality of the game. 

So to say, pre-2010 3D games feels very clunky in comparison to newer games. Rendering techniques also evolved since and made players used to new standards, making older 3D games visually very obsolete; whereas 2D games had more time to mature and are less reliant on rendering techniques to look appealing. 
Hence I would always advocate to judge games by today’s standards, as today’s standards is ultimately what makes them enjoyable.

Some thoughts/feedback:

Is there enough data to support platform specific lists in the sense that it's based on reviews from sources that are focused on specific platforms?

My thinking here being, for early home computers, a lot of multi-platform games originated on the arcade platform, and could be pretty awful conversions banking on getting sold on the reputations of the original game. Which might be reflected more properly when looking at platform specific critics.

For example when looking at the all time list filtered to only show ZX Spectrum games it shows 38 games. The only game from the developer [**Ultimate Play The Game**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Play_the_Game) (before they became known as Rare and did a little game called Golden Eye) is ranked at 26. UPTG (great games, horrible name) being perhaps one of the most premiere developers for the ZX Spectrum (and me being a Commodore 64 user knowing about this says a lot for those who where around at the time of that specific platform war:) makes me think that list might have looked different when viewed through the lens of lists focused on that specific platform.

I might be wrong and/or I might not have expressed myself clearly, just a thought.

A couple of other suggestions:

It would be nice if all items in the lists where numbered after their place on that specific list (like for a search result), and not only the place on the overall list.

On the **About** page on the site, you should add a link to this post (and any future ones... or past one too for that matter). And other relevant/significant places where discussions about this work of yours (and the ones that helped you) happens:)",2

Man this list is like time warping me. I see games and I'm like that wasn't too long ago. Chrono trigger I bought from a drug dealer when for 10 bucks when I was a teenager. Probably middle school. As for the list. I was counting them off from the top, I've played about 28 of 50 of those games (stop counting at around 50) as I was growing up.  I kind of feel lucky to have been able to experience these games as they came out or were fairly recently new. 

From my experience,  I dont feel too good about games going forward. As it's probably age, but I don't feel games have excited me enough to go out and play it. I thought I was done buying consoles when the ps4 came out but them metal gear solid 5 was announced and I went to go purchase my ps4. Nothing has really called out to me with the ps5. I really wanted to play the demons souls remake, but I've played the original and I understand what it is now. But as to why I don't feel good about games, it's the microtransactions thing. Like of course I'm wrong, because great games have come out like baldurs gate 3 and elden ring. But I feel like it won't be like the frequency that this list has shown. Like this list has shown that 99 has the most top games of all time. I'd figure 98, or I think 07 was the greatest time for games. 

Just growing up during these past 3 decades for games, had truly been amazing if people who experienced it look back on it.

I would like to point out though, for people considering this list for playing good games from older times, that these kind of lists based on reviewers tend to miss niche or games considered iconic. They also tend to favor console games, specially Nintendo.  

For example, Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun is an excellent stealth RTS, but it's too niche to appear.  
Similarly, iconic games like Thief never get mentioned.  
Even games like Fallout New Vegas, that's liked by hardcore Fallout fans doesn't even make it to the list.

There's also on occasions a disconnect between reviews and gamers. Most recent example is latest Elden Ring DLC that got great reviews but got a mild reception from the people (currently 71%, mostly positive in Steam).",2

The other 9 on the top 10 list, and the vast majority of the games in the top 100, were all good games, but they were also games that had millions and millions of dollars in promotion. How many games, books, movies, songs, etc. are out there somewhere that would completely blow away what we think of as ""the best"" but simply did not have the right marketing behind them.

I aggregated more than 700 greatest games lists. Here are the results.,8422,"Ignoring my subjective opinion that Chrono Trigger is the greatest of all, there are some objective issues with this aggregated list and the method used to construct it:

*  The people who make these individual 'greatest' lists have not played *all* the games listed here, which is the only possible way to have a completely fair evaluation.
* Recency bias is a *major* issue in subjective ordering like this, especially ones that span decades. This makes older titles rank lower down the list.
* Newer lists should NOT be favoured more. No reasoning is given for this and it incorrect to apply random favour here. The reason for this is that there is a type of reporting bias present - many modern reviews are paid/sponsored reviews which raises their scores artificially, meaning recent scores are usually higher than older scores. This means newer lists should be penalised, not favoured.
* The second reporting bias here is also accounted for incorrectly - there are simply more reporters today than in 1990 (for example). A game may get 5 reviews then and 50 now. This means frequency is not a metric to gauge success, and the fact it has been used as such means the output is distorted not minimally but significantly towards modern games.

Like Halo 2 for example despite getting CE/3 of which neither had the same impact. This is important because Halo 2 basically had a full on chokehold on xbox live until late 2007 despite not even being on the current latest generation while sitting atop the list at the end and its the reason most matchmaking/lobby/friends/dashboards lists look the way they do today on services like xbox live or just games in general. When a game that was one of the most enjoyed/played of all time on top of being something that visibly changed the gaming industry doesn't make the top 100 but the secret of monkey island does it kind of exposes how seriously anyone should ever take these things. There probably aren't 20 games all time to have that much impact. This one in particular is an indictment being delivered to gaming media/journalism

There's also games like oldschool runescape that silently prove their worth via people actually playing and enjoying them and for whatever reason they aren't on the list despite heavily outperforming almost the entire top 100 for actual decades. You can tell the lists you're pulling the information from are kind of not really plugged into what players are really doing and its just some journalist typing out their feelings.

Civ IV is not the best game in the franchise by a long shot, certainly not better by 200 spots than Civ V and definitely not better by 400 spots than Alpha Centauri, which is an extremely influential game in the 4X space.

> In total there are 98 all time lists, 51 end of decade lists, ~570 end of year lists

The time frames of the ""all time"" ones significantly impact which of those will be available, and the volume of end of year lists has changed over time. 

Also there's some odd inclusion of ranked vs. unranked lists that probably make the data hard to calculate. Some of the ""game of the decade"" lists like the ""CoG’s Top 20 Games of the Decade"" omit RDR2 entirely, which strikes me as super odd.

Would say there's gonna be a lot of noise created by lists that weren't entirely created with this in mind. Ars Technica's GotY list sure reads a lot like an unordered list other than their winner being called out as 1st as Celeste. But they put RDR2 at 11th while still saying, ""Red Dead Redemption is one of the best games of the decade, and its sequel bests it in every way."" Yet rank it behind F1 2018. I'd imagine there's a fair bit of this type of thing going on. (And given OPs note that losing against lower ranked games is a penalty, could skew things quite a bit.)

Probably trying to make an ordered list out of this data is extremely hard and maybe even a lost cause. May have been better to try to group things into tiers based on breakpoints in the aggregate numbers rather than a pure ranked list.

Really appreciate the effort from OP but without being able to see the calculations or numbers, it's hard to figure out some of the oddities.",14

For a similar example from a different medium, watch how Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time has albums from the 2000s make up a bigger bulk of the list as time goes on, and how in 2003 only 12.2% of the list was albums from the 90s while by 2023 it had gone up to 20.2%.

Then BotW comes out and opens things up a lot, and one thing it does really well is provide puzzles that have multiple solutions and the tools to solve them are pretty open ended - and I genuinely think that’s really cool but not necessarily “Zelda” to me. But what’s worse is the inventory system. I don’t want to have to gather a bunch of random stuff and worry about my weapon’s condition when I’m playing Zelda. That’s what makes it so incredibly unappealing for me. It loses that “simple but complex” thing that every Zelda game has.

It could have been more filled, but there is also a need to have ""empty"" spaces, it is part of the spirit of the game, which is called ""breath of the WILD"". This ""emptiness"" is an integral part of the game because movement and the way to manage it is a main component, it is also a field for experimentation with the tools and power that the game offers us, in addition to being necessary for the coherence of the world (a world filled with POIs everywhere is less natural and organic than a game that knows how to find a balance between content and ""emptiness"").

I think that one of the main differences between the latest Zelda and other open worlds is that it takes the effort to offer a fairly interactive world, with original gameplay possibilities, and that movement, travel, is a deliberately important component of the concept.

But it is a game that offers great freedom to the player, and which corresponds more to those who like to experiment, to be free and creative, unlike other games much more restrictive and directive, I think that not all players have this desire to try to do things by themselves without the game necessarily forcing them to, and that is why some find the game boring I think. That is why I talk about emergent mechanics, the game offers plenty of tools, it is then up to the players to do what they want with them.

But the game could have been a little smaller and more filled (I say ""a little"" smaller and ""a little"" more filled, because as I said, emptiness is also necessary).

All games are repetitive after a while, I think that the latest Zelda are clearly not among the most repetitive games, on the contrary I think that it offers a lot of diversity, even if obviously like all games it has repetitive aspects that would have deserved more attention in the details and originality

This DLC is ridiculously expensive because it's SUCH a higher price from all of the other DLC that has been made for the series so far. It offers less content for a higher price. Comparatively it's totally overpriced to everything else that's just like it.

Total War Warhammer 3 DLC’s price has former tabletop producer “cringing”,862,"GW tried to outright kill the hobby shop industry in the 1990s. Fuck those guys forever. (Source: I managed a hobby and games store.)

Back in the day, they took off because hobby shops pushed their games and miniatures, and they were reasonably decent to work with. Then in the 1990s, they started doing direct sales, and decided the hobby shops that made them as a company could go fuck themselves. In addition to establishing nutbar rules about signage and minimum carry and all kinds of anti-FLGS shit like that, they instituted the most infuriating system to fuck over the hobby shops by revamping the SKUs.

See, back in the day, if you wanted to order miniatures to sell, you'd order by stock numbers. In some cases, a single stock number might be connected to a single model. In most cases, it would be a blister containing a couple of figures from a range of possible models, but the range would make sense. Like, 9502 might be two figures from a possible eight different Ultramarines figures of various poses with various weapons. 9513 might be three of ten different Ork miniatures, et cetera.

In the 1990s, though, they began a thorough revamp of their model line, and they switched up the SKUs. Now, you'd get a blister that had two models from a selection, but the selections no longer made any fucking sense whatsoever. So a single SKU might contain models from entirely different armies. And when you ordered that SKU, you didn't get to specify what you wanted, they were randomly chosen. This became a fucking nightmare, because someone might want, say, a unit of noise marines, and we'd have to play the fucking lottery to see if we could get enough of them in by random SKU distribution.

And then to make things even worse, they'd throw in rules changes that reduced the effectiveness of certain units, or even made them entirely unusable. I remember a time when we ordered an entire sleeve of an SKU that had eight possible miniatures in it, three of which were usable and only one of which was desirable at all, in order to try to help a customer build his army. We got blisters that were entirely garbage.

""Hey, GW, I've got a customer who's trying to build a unit of, I don't know, Monkeyfucker Marines. I need eight units, but rolling the dice on SKUs is getting expensive. Can I just direct-order the models he needs?""

""No, but he can contact us and we'll be glad to sell him exactly what he wants! Glad to be of help.""

""Hey, next time your rep comes by to audit our signage, make sure to call first, because I need to make sure the owner's not around because he said he's going to shoot your guy in the dick. That's not hyperbole or some kind of metaphor. The owner carries a gun and I think he actually will shoot your representative the next time he sees him.

Total War Warhammer 3 DLC’s price has former tabletop producer “cringing”,862,"This is after the FLGSes built Warhammer into the top miniatures game on the market. Before that, ordering from GW was about like ordering any other product. It was only after they became the dominant brand that they decided to fuck everyone. At that point they wanted to move to direct sales and opening their own stores so they could sell directly to our customers instead of having to give us even a paltry discount.

But yeah, it was exactly the system behind blind boxes, except it was only a blind box for the retailer. Once we got the blister in and hung it on the wall, the customers could see what miniatures were there and pick out the ones they wanted. So gradually the rack would just fill up with miniatures we couldn't possibly sell.

They'd come into your store to run an inspection, and if you didn't have enough of each SKU on the wall, or didn't have the proper signage up, or if you had other miniatures too close to their product they'd threaten to cut your discount. They'd even get snippy with you if a game was going on and someone had a proxy or unpainted miniatures.

(Just to clarify, not every model came through this blind box shit. They still had army boxes and starter sets and tanks and all that stuff in boxes you could order directly. It's just that no matter what army you played, eventually you'd need a specific model that only came in a blister, so that was a necessary part of sales. And even when they started offering direct buys to cut us out of the loop, we couldn't even get rid of the blister racks-- we'd have settled for getting rid of the shitty SKU system and just selling the other stuff.

Total War Warhammer 3 DLC’s price has former tabletop producer “cringing”,862,"Believe me, if we could've ordered bespoke blisters with only the models we wanted we would've absolutely done it and we wouldn't have had to maintain a wall of unsellable garbage just to satisfy the square footage. It was not an option GW presented us back then. They'd gladly do it for customers, though.

And of course I'm talking about being able to acquire the models at a price we could actually sell them at. If there was some mechanism where we could get the models we wanted at a price point that ensured we couldn't possibly make any profit on them at all, that wouldn't have been super helpful to us as a store.

The RPG elements were bland, and the lack of real choice in the game was misleading. The story was pretty well constructed, but was primarily carried by the setting and secondarily by the characters, and to be 100% honest, Keanu Reeves was not a good fit for the role of Johnny. The voice work he did just sounded like monotone fake angry Keanu, not like the incredibly turbulent and impulsive Johnny.

Game got hyped to the moon and back and ended up under-delivering in every single area, despite being described as a ""generation-defining title"". Even after release after multiple patches, the game still doesn't feel particularly fun.

a delayed game is not necessarily a good game,57178,"Honestly, any more it's actually a really bad sign. Games *can* be patched, and delays are really expensive. More often than not a delay means that the game would be an absolutely unshippable mess if they stuck to the original timeline, and the delay is enough to get it into a shippable state. It's usually not enough time to get it into a great polished state.

Not to mention, delays from previously announced dates indicates a flaw in *planning*. If the same people that set the initial bad timeline are preparing the updated one, it's a crapshoot as to whether they learned to build out an workable schedule in the interim.

A delay isn't *automatically* going to result in a bad game, but it should really be your first big sign to *really* temper your expectations.",1

Not only that, people aren't going to recommend a buggy game so unless the concept, art, or gameplay are good enough for people to overlook the glaring issues, a resurgence of sales isn't likely.

That said, the market does allow some flexibility for post launch patches as long as a bulk of the game is playable of affected customers remains low.  Some understand that a million screwballs with computers ranging from 15 yrs to publicly available next month is better than 200 beta-testers at finding bugs with a similar subset of standard PCs.

The quote stands as it is.  Its a good quote, and I am sure Miyamoto would still stand by that philosophy even with patches.  Delays polish a project and can ensure that sales can ride the peak while popularity is high.  There will always be games that overshoot their scope and can't live up to the hype.  CP2077 was a good example of a game that might never be what it wanted.

In discrete mathematics (basically logic written like math) an ""implication"" means that one thing being true means another thing is true.

For example: in generation 1, if a pokemon is a Squirtle, then that pokemon is a water type

Note how if it isn't a Squirtle, that doesn't mean it's not a water type, or how if it is a water type that doesn't mean it's a Squirtle, but if it is a Squirtle then it is a water type.

a delayed game is not necessarily a good game,57178,"There's a very interesting story about Attila that goes like this, he's said to have collected exotic animals that he found during his conquests. He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.

But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.

Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.

Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.

But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.

Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""

Curious, Attila did as he asked.

Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.

""Now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.

Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.

To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,

""Thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun.""",1

In addition to the fact that scale is only valuable in the context of enjoyable aspects of a game to scale up, trying to make something big creates many problems with both managing development resources and the actual game design which compound on each other.

For me, 2 will always be inferior but only because my experience with 2 was being crazy hyped pre-launch, then only playing half the game as Chief. I don't hate this decision now, all these years later, but when the credits rolled for 2 my friends and I all looked at each other and said ""Wait, that's *it*?""

I've bought Skyrim exactly once, eventually getting a remastered edition for free on Steam. 900 hours, and I've never completed the main quest. It's not like it harms anyone to release it for a new platform. It's just misplaced disappointment that ESVI isn't on the horizon yet.",0

a delayed game is not necessarily a good game,57178,"""We leave greed to others""",2
a delayed game is not necessarily a good game,57178,"I imagine it's more complicated than that; if it had been about as broken as Witcher 3 at release, people probably *would* have supported them through patching it. They *might* even have got away with it if they focused on next-gen and PC and delayed prev-gen to work on performance, etc.

But software, particularly games, is complex and expensive to develop, and corporations distribute decision making and responsibility. The people actually developing and testing the game would have known for sure that it was unplayable in a lot of scenarios, but I'd guess there's a few layers of communication between those folks and the folks who make the decisions about what to release when.

I'm assuming a lot here, based on what I've heard of other devs, and my own experience working in (non-gaming) software, but I'd guess you have the folks doing the dev and QA work going ""dude, we *cannot* release this, it is *fucked*"" to their manager, but by the time that message reaches someone who can act on it, the difference between this warning, and the concerns raised for previous games has been dulled through miscommunication.

So the guys at the top are like ""Yeah, we have bugs, but we had bugs for Witcher 3, and people *love* that, so obviously a few bugs is okay. What do we actually get if we delay?""

And from a financial perspective, if the bugs were Witcher 3 level bugs they'd probably be right. It's a fucked incentive system, but it's almost always more profitable to release software that _mostly_ works than software that works perfectly. It's also very often more profitable to release new software than fix the existing stuff... and a corporation's first priority is pretty much required to be ""please the shareholders.""

When you combine this with the trend to prettier, more complicated, bigger budget games, and for multi-platform releases, and you have a trend in a bad direction that the consumer can only really fight by not preordering games or buying broken ones, and convincing others to do the same.

...I say this as someone who kinda got lucky. I decided to trust CDPR after finishing Witcher 3, and really loving cyberpunk as a genre... but I had a new PC to play it on, so I avoided the worst of it.

Still, both as someone who works in software, and someone who buys a lot of games... it's troubling. I wonder if CDPR could have delivered better here if they'd ditched last-gen and taken a few more months to iron out the more powerful platforms. Who knows? But I think the trend to huge open-world games and simultaneous multi-platform releases means that bugs are going to be more and more common on new AAA releases.",2

a delayed game is not necessarily a good game,57178,"I'm not OP, but Halo 2 was my introduction to online gaming. And I just feel like the multiplayer was 2nd to none. Probably nostalgia talking. With the BxR and double shot, the skill gap was very noticable. 

I was in my early teens when I picked it up after a friend introduced me, and once I mastered the double shot and could get headshots consistently, I could just absolutely destroy people. Some of the most fun I've ever had playing. I could seriously destroy the other team by myself with the BR in my hands, or a sniper.

Also we have a lot of big titles coming down the tube (Perfect Dark, Fable, Elderscrolls 6, Outer Worlds 2, etc) so while Halo kind of flopped, I have high hopes it will be a motivator for Microsoft to turn the corner and push for better (and more) content from its developers.
