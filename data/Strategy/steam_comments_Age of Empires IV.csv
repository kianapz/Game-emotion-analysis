"This game is so exceptional. It has stunning graphics. Cool single-player missions with historical battles and beautiful videos with the 4k HDR update. Learning a little bit of world history through a lovely guiding voice. 

Carefully crafted map with different presets that you can enjoy playing against AIs. Even with slightly randomized geography, LOL. For instance, the mountains have some narrow paths creating additional threats to the defense.

However, the AI still needs polishing. After several encounters, you will find their attack pattern and weaknesses.
Also still have some bugs.

Overall, 10/10 great game.",True,4,0,2025-02-06 13:34:54
"I really wanted to love Age of Empires IV, but it just didn’t feel right. The game is much more fast-paced than older titles, leaving no room for slow, strategic building. Instead of clear, familiar icons, everything is replaced with confusing symbols, making simple tasks frustrating.

Worse, there’s no option to save multiplayer games, forcing matches to be rushed instead of carefully planned. It feels like the game is designed for quick, action-heavy play rather than deep strategy. Like many modern games, it’s also been simplified too much, losing the charm and depth that made Age of Empires great for me.",False,17,2,2025-01-29 13:04:58

Why did we get a trash version of AoE2, especially when they did the smart thing and released the Definitive Edition of AoE2? No clue. Everyone that says this is the greatest game and a great upgrade, is a paid actor or something, because I have given this game repeated chance and it is just flat out, not fun, slow, boring, unoriginal, direct attempt to do what Empire Earth 3 did, just make an awful game that feels nothing like Empire Earth, and in this case, nothing like Age of Empires.

"I've played a lot of hours but the game, while it is fun at a core level, has insanely bad balance issues. Certain builds, like English early men-at-arms builds, have no counter. Even if you were much better than the English player, the ONLY way you can stop it is by also playing English and build early men-at-arms. Certain nations, such as France, are designed to be unbeatable unless you are extremely more skilled than your opponent. An RTS is meant to be a skill based game, while I really want to like aoe4 and it has good features, it is not a skill based game. Certain nations are just objectively better than others. A very high skilled order of the dragon player, for example, is almost guaranteed to lose to a very low skilled mongol player.

"It's hard not to love this game if you grew up playing AoEII. I just hope they continue to add different factions/civilizations to bring variety and replayability (Khmer Empire, please!). I like how a the tide/scale can continue to shift over long periods of time, rather than one big army push deciding the fate of an entire match.

The controls are accessible and the gameplay adds a few new features enhancing the game without escaping the core values of the franchise. I particularly love how they added the defensive towers to the walls instead of separating the two as it uses to be. It feels so much more genuine that way.

But the biggest add up to me is those mini docs they added between the chapters, teaching you about life in the dark age, the tactics, the technology etc...This makes the game not only a game but a teaching experience.

"One of my first gaming experiences was playing Age of Mythology and right from the start i used to love strategy games.
I played Starcraft II for years and eventually i heard about an new upcoming Age of Empires 4.

I admit, after the hour i wasn't completely sold (mind you, it was day 1, back in 2021) but i [b] INSTANTLY [/b] knew, that this game got something special. After a few more hours, it clicked and i was in for one of my best experiences in terms of RTS Gaming.
After over three years and over 700 hours playtime, I'll give you some insight in my thoughts about the game:



[h3] GAMEPLAY [/h3] ( 9 / 10 )
[list]
[*] the most accessible Age game so far. Good inputs, very responsive, good pathfinding
[*] very interesting civs! could be a bit overwhelming for new players (talking about multiplayer) BUT
[*] multiplayer is a lot of fun! nice community and a reasonably good match making, if you ask me
[*] balancing all those civs is obviously hard, but Relic managed to get the game into a good spot. Archers may be a but overtuned at the time of my review, but nothing major. I would say, that - right now - AOE4 is in its best spot considering balance and viability of different strategys (fast push, turteling, fast age-up, raiding, etc.) [/list]


[h3] SOUND [/h3] ( 10 / 10 )
[list]
[*] TOP NOTCH!!! the more you get into it, the more you realise how FRICKIN aswsome the soundstage is. you can localise everything based on sounds, the voiceacting is SUPERB, with very much love for the certain languages.
[*] for further information, i strongly suggest the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ2IOj_xYgA [/list]


[h3] GRAPHIC [/h3] ( 8 / 10 )
[list]
[*] good graphics in terms of strategy games
[*] good redability of units etc. (!)
[*] sometimes units looking a bit ""washed out"", but only if you scroll on top of them [/list]


[h3] SINGLEPLAYER [/h3] ( 8 / 10 )
[list]
[*] i play AOE4 almost only for the multiplayer, but i like the campaign as well. would have loved an age of mythology-type camapign tho (in game cutscenes, storytelling etc.) Instead, relic went for a documentation type of campaign, which is fine. Would have wished for something else tho, but thats subjective i guess [/list]


[h3] DLC + FUTURE CONTENT [/h3] ( 9 / 10 )

we already got 1 major DLC, which was good value for the money if you ask me. 
We got 6 new civs to play with (2 new civs + 4 variant civs, which are altered civs that are already in the game), which were fun to play with. 
On top of that, they gave us a new campaign (which i didnt play yet).
Amazing DLC, hence the 9 out of 10.

Recently were promised 2 more DLC in 2025, so we got new stuff for the future as well.




[h2] VERDICT [/h2]

- Save files still corrupt and cannot load saved skirmishes.

- Adding new civs to the game replaces old ones.
- Mods required for basic QoL from previous age games",False,1,0,2025-02-15 01:40:05
"I gotta admit, i was a hardcore AOE2 fan. this game won me over in so many ways. The gameplay is quick to get into the action, but it is also very forgiving so you don't feel completely overwhelmed. There are loads of viable strategies so you can always tailor make your own experience. The depth that the landmarks provide can make each game feel like a new experience.
Gameplay aside, the game looks and sounds incredible! I love the graphics, I like that each civ has different architectures. At the end of each game, I love looking at what my base looks like. The terrain is gorgeous, and you can customize the biome in skirmishes. Some unique upgrades will change the appearances on your units. The sound design is out of this world. I love hearing the marching and galloping of your military. The music is gorgeous and not only unique to each civ, but there are different tracks for each age. Languages your units speaks changes with each age as well and you get to witness the evolution of language through the ages. The historical detail for the civ bonuses make me happy as a history nerd. I like how unit upgrades work.

"Age of Empires IV – A Childhood Dream Brought Back to Life

I grew up playing Age of Empires, spending hours building empires, strategizing battles, and reliving history in the best way a kid could—through an epic RTS. So when Age of Empires IV was announced, I was both excited and nervous. Could it really capture that same magic?

Turns out, it absolutely does. The game feels like a love letter to longtime fans while still bringing enough fresh ideas to keep things exciting. The classic gameplay is still there—gathering resources, building armies, and outmaneuvering your enemies—but everything is more refined, more responsive, and just… smoother. The civilizations feel unique, and I love how each one has its own strengths and quirks, making every match feel different.

One of my favorite things is the campaign. It’s not just a series of battles; it’s like playing through a historical documentary, complete with real-world footage and narration that gives weight to every mission. The level of detail is insane, and it adds a layer of immersion that I didn’t even know I wanted.

And of course, multiplayer is as intense as ever. Whether you’re teaming up with friends or going head-to-head with strangers, every match is a test of skill and strategy. The developers have done a great job keeping the game balanced and fresh with updates, which is something I really appreciate.

For anyone who grew up with this series like I did, Age of Empires IV isn’t just a game—it’s a time machine back to those golden days of staying up late, just one more match before bed. If you loved the originals, this is everything you could hope for. And if you’re new? Well, you’re in for something special.

"I forced myself to play and like it several times already. Doesn't work.
Situation is similar to CoH3 - sound is bad, better than in CoH3 but still bad - everything is muffled and put through some flat filter so in the moment of action you can only recognize swords clashing (sounds like one fork is sliding on another) and peasant production. Sometimes you can hear gunpowder weapons but it would be very strange to not hear it. 
During action everything is made so that you have zero will to micro and you just ""whatever, will make more units, will make more resources..."". Starting from sounds and unit responses and ending with music and micro control - everything wants to make you quit this game. Music itself is good but how it's put is not fitting the situation, you either want to sleep or switch it off completely.
Basically, anything you can mention in this game is made better in Age of Mytholody: Retold.

Campaign is decent, quality is pretty high in this case, especially with historical videos.
Gameplay wise all strategy games feel like ""rock-paper-scissors"", AoE4 feels like ""rock-paper"".

I am not AoE fan overall, but this one, especially, I presume, is the worst. It has all the potential but relic specifically do not use any of it, or cannot - I don't know already because starting from DoW3 they are going downhill with extreme speed.",False,0,0,2025-02-11 13:08:00
"I have thousands of hours in Stronghold Crusader and recently tried AOE4. Seems like a pretty good game, a lot more polished, but combat feels wonky. I like the hotkeys, controlling villagers, and scout / fog of war mechanics are executed properly, its just combat thats really really wonky. 

In Crusader units will ""compress"" on top of each other, which is smooth but physically not realistic.
In AOE4 they occupy their own space and if you use attack move properly, they will sometimes still take some weird pathing or attack and then run around a little until attacking again, idk its just weird. Other than this I have no complaints.",True,0,0,2025-02-11 14:40:51

"I was banned for ""map hacking,"" even though I didn’t cheat—I was simply using the Imperial Spies ability from the Chinese civilization. During the match, I was dominating my opponent, and they started flaming me in chat before reporting me. Somehow, that led to me getting banned.

I submitted a ban appeal, but the response took so long that the ban is effectively over by the time they rejected it. When I asked for more information to understand what triggered the ban and how to avoid it in the future, they refused to provide any details, claiming it would ""jeopardize the integrity of their moderation system."" As a result, I have no idea what I did that caused the ban.

It’s hard to recommend a game where you can get banned simply because you’re winning and other players report you out of spite. The slow appeal process and lack of transparency make it clear: play at your own risk.

"When I heard about Age of Empires IV (AoEIV) I couldn't wait to play it, since playing all of the previous entries had gave me one of the most memorable experiences I had ever had in gaming. And here is what I have to say:

I love how AoEIV had taken the time and effort to bring us a historically-accurate stories that are tied to the gameplay. I really enjoyed the aesthetic of it; it certainly makes the game so unique with their colors, their sound design and the way you can experience the gameplay and the cinematics. I think this is the part that I love the most.

Each of the civilizations feel unique, although not as unique as in Age of Empires III (AoEIII), in my opinion, with exceptions, naturally. I think it a bit as a combination between Age of empires II (AoEII) and AoEIII, leaning a little bit towards AoEII, which, by the way, is my favorite Age of Empires due to several reasons. The strategies and battles are surely good and I enjoy having different kinds of the same group of units, each with different functions. The walls' mechanics are also a good addition and adds a lot in terms of strategies and siege.

I know for a fact that many of the updates have solved many of the issues that player the player base have experienced by now and I applaud this; it was actually the bugs that led me to abandon the game some time ago, hoping for it to get better after some updates. And it really happened, even releasing a DLC. Reading this DLC's reviews, which I won't buy at least for now, shows me that AoEIV may be in a limbo where instead of taking advantage of what it is, it is just a bit nervous about the steps they need to follow to earn new and old fans of the series.

One of the things I don't like at all is that there's too little focus on the single-player experience. What I loved about AoEII was the different heroes, scenarios and setting of the campaigns, and that is also one of the things that made AoEII so memorable for many people; the amount of content that you could experience on your own was tremendous and adding the multiplayer was just perfect for all types of players. AoEIV is lacking heavily on this side: there's only half the campaigns for each of the civilizations that you can play. This is, you can't have a designed single-player experience focused on each civilization, which I find upsetting. Even more: I believe that releasing a DLC with single-player DLC-civ's campaigns before having the base game civ's ones is unforgivable.

The game really wants to push you into multiplayer, which, of course, is a big part —maybe even the most important part— of these types of game. And even though I understand why this has been done, I think that leaving the single-player experience ins such a small featuring is something that takes too big a hit on the experience.

Finally, I want to say that I played all the campaigns but I was not able to get one of the achievements due to a long-known bug. The game has been out for years by now and I think that having this bug, something so small, still lingering in the game after all the feedback is so embarrassing. 

With that being said, I think that the game is a good one and for the time I played it I had fun. It obviously had a new and good idea of what to do and what it wanted to be, but I think that the execution is a half-baked product that leaves aside a great portion of the players. I think that the game can continue with this fresh appearance and twist on the series, which I think is amazing, but it also has to take into consideration all of the accomplishments made by previous games to be better that the sum of its parts.

Solid game, but it still needs some work.

"I've played RTS games for 18 years now (started when I was 4 with the original starcraft). I was always horrible at playing multiplayer. This is without the doubt the best RTS game to start playing multiplayer if you always wanted to give multiplayer a shot but were scared of being bad at it (like me!).

The players in ranked and quick matches are not some high level players! For the most part they are like me and you who just play this game for fun and not for being overly competitive. While the campaign is nothing really to write home about (though the cutscenes are pretty cool), I cannot recommend this game enough if you wanted to ever have a go at RTS multiplayer that is not overly sweaty!

But don't just take my word for it! Here is a very great video on the topic if you have some free time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl4myN8q_KM&t=3237s&ab_channel=CloudCuckooCountry

"The game successfully balances classic RTS elements with modern improvements, offering a satisfying and deep experience. The graphics are good, with detailed environments and beautifully designed units that bring the historical settings to life.

The gameplay is rich and engaging, offering a variety of civilizations, each with unique playstyles and strengths. Whether you're leading the Mongol hordes, defending as the English, or commanding the powerful Delhi Sultanate, each faction feels distinct and provides strategic depth. The campaigns are incredibly well-crafted, combining historical narratives with challenging missions that push you to think critically and adapt your strategies.

The game's AI is impressively competent, and the multiplayer experience is smooth and rewarding, making it a great choice for both solo play and competitive sessions. Additionally, frequent updates and expansions continue to enrich the game, adding new civilizations, maps, and features to keep the community engaged.

Overall, Age of Empires IV is a fantastic evolution of the RTS genre, with polished mechanics, a rich historical setting, and a wealth of content that will keep you coming back for hours.

"[h1] I have Praise for this game, but I also need to Rant about it... [/h1]

I have been playing Age of Empires since the late 90s as a little kid. To see a fourth game finally release with modern graphics is so awesome. Now, I can type a lot, in great detail. To avoid this, I'm simply doing a short list of praise and rant of the things I like the most, and the worst things about the game in Dec of 2024.

[b] Praise: [/b] Nostalgia is real and it feels great. I love these games and playing a modern one has been a real treat. There is plenty to do with PvE if you're not really a PvP type of gamer. There's a lot of single-player campaigns and tons of custom game options. Graphics are pretty and the mechanics feel smooth. There's a lot of uniqueness to each civilization.

[b] Rant: [/b] I'm typing this review immediately after having been kicked from a 3v3 PvP game with two of my friends VS. three other players. It is absolutely infuriating when one of your friends gets automatically kicked if they disconnect for a few seconds, and now they have to wait around for the others to finish (and probably lose) their game. But it is 100% even more aggravating to be the one that somehow loses connection to the game, gets kicked, and now has to watch as your friends have to play 2v3. It happens too often, and it sucks so much. It's not even anyone's fault that they get kicked, but you still feel bad and you're left with this awful feeling of letting your teammates down. It has been over 2 years, Relic Entertainment, please do SOMETHING about this! Rant over.

Do I recommend this game? 
Yes, if you're a casual PvPer and enjoy PvE real-time strategy games. 
No, if you're a competitive PvPer and you don't want to get kicked from a game for accidental disconnections or a sudden spike of drawn-out latency.",True,9,0,2024-12-21 05:42:05
"They really did good job even with the DLC, I would recommend it, I have almost 2k in AOE 2 (HD + DE) and this game offers a lot of stuff new, unique civs with a lot of different of units and buildings with unique technologies for each civ (similar to every AOE I guess but even though tons of civs exist in aoe2 in AOE IV feels more diverse, campaigns are really good graphics are great, and I run it with Linux on proton, which runs really faster with more FPS than on windows 10, I get some crashes though but it is normal since the game don't support Linux officially. until now i have it only in campaigns and single players.",True,10,1,2025-01-11 15:13:36

The story mode is good with full videos before each mission that attempts to tell you about the history of the next mission, but.. The voice sounds like it's AI getting a lot of names/words mispronounced. I put this game on the same shelf as Iron Harvest which was also released in 2021.

I don't want to spend hours adapting to the new mechanisms and strategies and basically learning the game over again.

"I really wanted to love Age of Empires IV, but it just didn’t feel right. The game is much more fast-paced than older titles, leaving no room for slow, strategic building. Instead of clear, familiar icons, everything is replaced with confusing symbols, making simple tasks frustrating.

Worse, there’s no option to save multiplayer games, forcing matches to be rushed instead of carefully planned.

"I absolutely loved Age of Empires 2, 3 was very meh, but this is just garbage.  Whoever the art director of this game should never ever touch the development of a video game again.  
What you don't see from the pre-selected screenshots they show, is that a lot of your units look too similar and hard to distinguish when you're actually micro-managing in combat.  The Turks for example, their combat units and builder units look 90% the same, meaning you'll grab a bunch of your villagers and bring them along with your army.
Most of the gameplay is the same as the previous ones with a few changes, the worst is they took out orders for your units.  You can't use defensive posture anymore, so its just the ""one size fits all"", and then stand ground breaks if you move so you have to keep constantly clicking it.
Overall they didn't improve the genre or add anything new or great to it, and its just a worse overall UI experience compared to the predecessor made over 2 decades ago.  Why do modern games suck so bad these days?

"“A Worthy Successor to a Legendary Series”

Age of Empires IV delivers everything I hoped for as a fan of the franchise. It beautifully blends the nostalgic feel of classic Age of Empires games with modern innovations that make it stand out as a top-tier RTS for both veterans and newcomers.

The campaigns are engaging and full of historical depth, offering unique scenarios that make each mission feel fresh. The cinematic storytelling and documentary-style videos add an educational layer that’s surprisingly fun. The civilizations feel distinct, each with their own strategies and mechanics—mastering them is a rewarding challenge.

Multiplayer is incredibly satisfying, with smooth matchmaking and balanced gameplay that keeps me coming back for more. The graphics strike a perfect balance between stylized and realistic, while the sound design (especially the music) immerses you in every battle.

[*] very interesting civs! could be a bit overwhelming for new players (talking about multiplayer) BUT
[*] multiplayer is a lot of fun! nice community and a reasonably good match making, if you ask me
[*] balancing all those civs is obviously hard, but Relic managed to get the game into a good spot. Archers may be a but overtuned at the time of my review, but nothing major. I would say, that - right now - AOE4 is in its best spot considering balance and viability of different strategys (fast push, turteling, fast age-up, raiding, etc.) [/list]


[h3] SOUND [/h3] ( 10 / 10 )
[list]
[*] TOP NOTCH!!! the more you get into it, the more you realise how FRICKIN aswsome the soundstage is. you can localise everything based on sounds, the voiceacting is SUPERB, with very much love for the certain languages.
[*] for further information, i strongly suggest the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ2IOj_xYgA [/list]


[h3] GRAPHIC [/h3] ( 8 / 10 )
[list]
[*] good graphics in terms of strategy games
[*] good redability of units etc. (!)
[*] sometimes units looking a bit ""washed out"", but only if you scroll on top of them [/list]


[h3] SINGLEPLAYER [/h3] ( 8 / 10 )
[list]
[*] i play AOE4 almost only for the multiplayer, but i like the campaign as well. would have loved an age of mythology-type camapign tho (in game cutscenes, storytelling etc.) Instead, relic went for a documentation type of campaign, which is fine. Would have wished for something else tho, but thats subjective i guess [/list]


[h3] DLC + FUTURE CONTENT [/h3] ( 9 / 10 )

we already got 1 major DLC, which was good value for the money if you ask me. 
We got 6 new civs to play with (2 new civs + 4 variant civs, which are altered civs that are already in the game), which were fun to play with. 
On top of that, they gave us a new campaign (which i didnt play yet).
Amazing DLC, hence the 9 out of 10.

Recently were promised 2 more DLC in 2025, so we got new stuff for the future as well.

I bought it basically from the nostalgia of AOE III. It has quite a few differences from it, but they are mostly welcome. They were able to fix a few glitches and exploits players used to use way too much in multiplayer gaming, and that has made the game so much more fluid and overall better. 

I loved the new addition as well of mew ways of winning a match, such as capturing sacred sites and/or building a wonder. 

The only thing I miss from AOE III is the method to earn XP in a match. I miss having the XP showing up everytime you built something, killed a unit or whatever. In this game, you get the XP at the end of the match, and it isn't directly attached to all the things you make in the match,; it's a standard value attached to a specific challenge, a victory, a defeat, earning a mastery from a civ, etc. 

But overall, I just love it.",True,0,0,2025-01-09 12:57:15

Excellent game with great balance and variety for an RTS. - constant updates as well.,True,0,0,2024-12-29 22:53:01
"Very great RTS game! The key differences between this one and a game like sc2 are a few incredibly great game design features that allow for alot more strategy.
1. Resources are generated on the map relatively {""diffused""?} with games like sc2 you fight for a location to expand to while in AOE4 you basically fight over the whole map at all times. it is more of a game of fighting for space rather than a particular location allowing for alot more diversity in the ways games are played.
2. The ability to wall for relatively cheap allows you to section off parts of the map in order to slow your opponent down or harass or play more defensively. alot of RTS games have defensive structures but the ability to wall in the way AOE4 allows you to is just brilliant.
3. Having the food/wood/gold resources instead of just min/vespene or mass/energy allows for more strategies where denying just gold or just food can work. turns the games more into denying resources on the map and getting advantage through attrition of a particular resources.

all 3 of things are what make AOE4 a far more strategic, slower paced, and positional RTS. No other RTS game has been able to make strategic and positional play as important as it is in AOE4. AOE4 feels more like chess while Starcraft 2 feels more like a pingpong match.",True,0,0,2024-12-29 19:23:43

Gameplay aside, the game looks and sounds incredible! I love the graphics, I like that each civ has different architectures. At the end of each game, I love looking at what my base looks like. The terrain is gorgeous, and you can customize the biome in skirmishes. Some unique upgrades will change the appearances on your units. The sound design is out of this world. I love hearing the marching and galloping of your military. The music is gorgeous and not only unique to each civ, but there are different tracks for each age. Languages your units speaks changes with each age as well and you get to witness the evolution of language through the ages. The historical detail for the civ bonuses make me happy as a history nerd.

"Age of Empires IV – A Childhood Dream Brought Back to Life

I grew up playing Age of Empires, spending hours building empires, strategizing battles, and reliving history in the best way a kid could—through an epic RTS. So when Age of Empires IV was announced, I was both excited and nervous. Could it really capture that same magic?

Turns out, it absolutely does. The game feels like a love letter to longtime fans while still bringing enough fresh ideas to keep things exciting. The classic gameplay is still there—gathering resources, building armies, and outmaneuvering your enemies—but everything is more refined, more responsive, and just… smoother. The civilizations feel unique, and I love how each one has its own strengths and quirks, making every match feel different.

One of my favorite things is the campaign. It’s not just a series of battles; it’s like playing through a historical documentary, complete with real-world footage and narration that gives weight to every mission. The level of detail is insane, and it adds a layer of immersion that I didn’t even know I wanted.

And of course, multiplayer is as intense as ever. Whether you’re teaming up with friends or going head-to-head with strangers, every match is a test of skill and strategy. The developers have done a great job keeping the game balanced and fresh with updates, which is something I really appreciate.

For anyone who grew up with this series like I did, Age of Empires IV isn’t just a game—it’s a time machine back to those golden days of staying up late, just one more match before bed. If you loved the originals, this is everything you could hope for. And if you’re new? Well, you’re in for something special.

"I forced myself to play and like it several times already. Doesn't work.
Situation is similar to CoH3 - sound is bad, better than in CoH3 but still bad - everything is muffled and put through some flat filter so in the moment of action you can only recognize swords clashing (sounds like one fork is sliding on another) and peasant production. Sometimes you can hear gunpowder weapons but it would be very strange to not hear it. 
During action everything is made so that you have zero will to micro and you just ""whatever, will make more units, will make more resources..."". Starting from sounds and unit responses and ending with music and micro control - everything wants to make you quit this game. Music itself is good but how it's put is not fitting the situation, you either want to sleep or switch it off completely.
Basically, anything you can mention in this game is made better in Age of Mytholody: Retold.

Campaign is decent, quality is pretty high in this case, especially with historical videos.
Gameplay wise all strategy games feel like ""rock-paper-scissors"", AoE4 feels like ""rock-paper"".

In Crusader units will ""compress"" on top of each other, which is smooth but physically not realistic.
