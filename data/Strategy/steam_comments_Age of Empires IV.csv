Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-04,"age of empires iv is a fantastic blend of nostalgia and modern strategy, bringing back the classic rts experience with fresh mechanics and stunning visuals. the game offers a great variety of civilizations, each with unique playstyles that keep things interesting. the campaigns are not only fun but also educational, featuring documentarystyle cutscenes that add depth to the historical battles. multiplayer is wellbalanced and addictive, whether you're playing casual matches with friends or diving into ranked play. regular updates and strong developer support keep the game evolving, making it a solid choice for both longtime fans and newcomers to the series."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-22,"it's fun in its own way but it fails to capture the magic of age of empires ii. the rockpaperscissors game aspect of things seems to be toned down a bit in favor of slightly more dogged adherence to historical lessons, replete with a british schoolmadam lecturing during the norman campaign. they could perhaps have tried harder making this a game first and an historical teaching tool second."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-14,the game does not run on my pc it crashes before loading the match. i played the game years ago on a f2p weekend and it worked on old pc but when bought the game on my pc no go. my specs are pc to a ryzen 7 3700 x and 3060 win 11 if you have these specs the game will not work. as a die hard aoe 2 fan i cant recommend aoe 4
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-16,"this game in no way feels like any of the previous games, it is a slow, absolutely awful attempt at recreating what was perfectly done in age of empires 2, trying to give it different mechanics and trying to make it 'look better'. why did we get a trash version of aoe2, especially when they did the smart thing and released the definitive edition of aoe2? no clue. everyone that says this is the greatest game and a great upgrade, is a paid actor or something, because i have given this game repeated chance and it is just flat out, not fun, slow, boring, unoriginal, direct attempt to do what empire earth 3 did, just make an awful game that feels nothing like empire earth, and in this case, nothing like age of empires. go back to your roots and maybe release a better version of aoe3."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,this is one of the best games i've ever played. it's like a history channel show that you get to play. great cinematics make it an immersive and compelling experience.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"age of empires iv review age of empires iv is a fantastic return to the classic rts experience that fans of the series have loved for years. the game brings back the deep strategy, historical campaigns, and intense multiplayer battles that made the franchise iconic while introducing modern enhancements that make it feel fresh. one of the highlights is the diverse civilizations, each with unique mechanics that require different strategies to master. whether you're commanding the mongols with their mobile bases or managing the economic powerhouse of the chinese, every faction feels distinct and rewarding to play. visually, the game looks great, with detailed units and impressive landscapes that bring historical battles to life. the sound design, including narration and ambient battlefield noise, adds to the immersion. multiplayer is as engaging as ever, offering competitive matches and cooperative modes that test your strategic thinking. while there have been balance tweaks and updates since launch, the game continues to evolve, keeping it fresh for returning players. overall, age of empires iv is a mustplay for strategy fans. it successfully blends nostalgia with new mechanics, delivering an experience that is both accessible for newcomers and deep enough for veterans. if you enjoy realtime strategy games, this is definitely worth your time. rating"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-04,"what an incredible introduction to rts gaming as a history nerd. the feel of each civ is unique, and the different playstyles and play modes give a great way to make everything feel fresh. would recommend"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-04,"aoe has and always will be a timeless game for all ages... good depth of play, excellent game for novices through leet mouse driven micro... fabulous overall..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-03,"i love this game! i used to play aoe ii, and i have no complaints with this one, its super fun. though it can get pretty stressful at times, and my neck and shoulders are starting to feel the stiffness when the game starting to get tense, lol. but that just shows how intense and exciting it is!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-28,as great when it first came out years ago. this game never gets old!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-27,aoe game good diversity in units and engaging story modes
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-23,"really like this game, i am still on the initial campaign trail but the graphics are great and the story mixes well with the action of playing. i recommend this game to anyone who liked coh, total war or civilization."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-23,awesome rts with the best parts of aoe ii and iii. there are fewer civs in the game but each of them are highly unique making them really fun to learn. there are no bad civs each are good in their own way. the balance is great.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-22,"amazing, great of all strategy games. can't beat it being educational, the documentaries and videos that teach about history are the best part o the game. very happy so much work was clearly put into this. hold the line."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-22,superb animations and graphics. this game drags you into the wonder of wars and history. definitely worth a try.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-21,"i am a return player of the game after many years. my experience in the past was good but today i have more interest in the story lines and history. i find this as a simulation to the actual line of events that shaped the world today. if i have a dislike is that i have had to learn a little more about processors, ram and heat distribution. again just the need to keep an open mind and continue to learn."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-21,this game is fucking great but aoe3 is better than this because of graphics and animation of units
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-20,"as somebody somewhat new to rts games, this game was very easy to learn and start playing multiplayer matches in. the graphics look great, and the game feels less clunky to control than aoe2 and the game is still actively supported and updated by the developers. highly recommend this game!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-18,"a very good game, though difficult and fastpaced."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-18,i played these games since my childhood. totally mind blowing and awesome. i'm 31 now and i'm still playing hours. highly recommended game for every one.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-18,i enjoy this game with friends. there are a few annoying bugs i wish would get fixed but i think overall its a great game.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-16,"is a great game, hopefully they will integrate more civilizations soon"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-15,"aoe veteran. playing since the days of microsoft zone. still an all around great game. won't beat aoeii, but hey! this is great. thx."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-14,"i have played rts games since i was like 5 years old mainly command and conquer. this game forces you to think strategically in order to win a game. it features many different factions and a few subfactions. the best part, the map generation is awesome. and you can choose different biomes so the terrain can look different every game?? what. i love the different strengths and weaknesses of each faction. it really makes all of them unique in their own way."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-13,"interesting gameplay of the new aoe 4. i would say it has lost its originality an uniqueness like the first aoe and the second. historically it is a little off, and not as much missions as you would expect it to be, not as many nations to play is available, but im sure devs are working on it. over all it has a lot of interesting nuances, such as research, battle tactics, and building influances."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-12,"feels like a slightly updated aoe2 but with less civilizations to play and maps that suck. graphics are not great and because i am against super intrusive anti cheat i never play online, it's even more of a nope for me. i'll stick with aoe2 and aoe3."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-10,very good game with a lot of diversity. love that you can choose a certain path of your empire while ageing up. that way you can really play each empire in a unique way and you never can be sure what to expect from your opponent
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-10,so good bro but you cant mod civs good or join back into multiplayer if u crash
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-09,"it's hard not to love this game if you grew up playing aoeii. i just hope they continue to add different factionscivilizations to bring variety and replayability khmer empire, please!. i like how a the tidescale can continue to shift over long periods of time, rather than one big army push deciding the fate of an entire match. classic experience that retains what made the second so much fun. i notice many people prefer the oldschool graphics of de, but i personally like iv's graphics more. lighter on my eyes and less stiff. colorful with beautiful biomes."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-08,"1010. wish there was exactly the same game, but with units from 2021 century"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-08,"this game has all of the magic of the original aoe 1 and 2 but made better on every front. very nice graphics, meaningful and broad differences in the factions, fine craftsmanship on every detail. for those who yearned for a new aoe to arrive after decades. it has. its a beautiful thing."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-08,"there is a lot to love about this game. first the graphics are amazing. it looks polished and very smooth. i love how they manage to set up gardens around the houses. it's really wonderfully done. the controls are accessible and the gameplay adds a few new features enhancing the game without escaping the core values of the franchise. i particularly love how they added the defensive towers to the walls instead of separating the two as it uses to be. it feels so much more genuine that way. but the biggest add up to me is those mini docs they added between the chapters, teaching you about life in the dark age, the tactics, the technology etc...this makes the game not only a game but a teaching experience. you don't see that in any historic strategy game other than age of empire and i seriously love it! i definitely recommend the game just for that!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,"an excellent, deep game with almost nonstop opportunities to learn and improve. highly recommend to any who are interested in the rts genre."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-16,lots of fun. i played aoe2 a lot when it came out and this one for me hits all the right notes. the civs are really fun as there is noticeable difference with each one.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-12,"the cons unlike the first two game, this game is fast paced all the time until the ai breaks and their villagers freeze in place and they never start farming resources again, making them target practice. this means the game is basically broken. the pros the visuals are good and the sound is fine. lots of map variations. fun to make armies."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-06,"solid game. return to form of the age 2 days though some aspects are simplified for accessibility. some will say that it doesn't innovate enough. not gonna lie i actually prefer that, sometimes too much innovation is like when kevin rudd got elected in australia because people thought yeh about time we had a change... and now we've been fkd in the as economically ever since. so yeh solid game that really feels like an age game."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-16,"i dont know if its steams fault or not, but i cant play the game anymore since 2 updates ago. everytime it updates i try playing again. however, it never works. this could be a steam issue though, because i had the same issue with civ. 6"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-05,"pretty good rts, decent interactive history lesson, fun multi player. honestly, the most impressive thing about this game is that microsoft actually went ahead and created 5 different real time strategy games, competing for the same player base."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-15,how many years?  save files still corrupt and cannot load saved skirmishes.  skirmish set up is not saved so you have to redo it all over again and again every time.  adding new civs to the game replaces old ones.  mods required for basic qol from previous age games
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-07,was an awesome game until now. now the enemy ai doesnt do anything and gets stuck in an age. by the looks of it people have been complaining about this for a long time even though it only just happened to me. i cant figure out how to fix it. dont buy until they get their s together and get this old issue resolved. will change review to positive once resolved.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-09,"i gotta admit, i was a hardcore aoe2 fan. this game won me over in so many ways. the gameplay is quick to get into the action, but it is also very forgiving so you don't feel completely overwhelmed. there are loads of viable strategies so you can always tailor make your own experience. the depth that the landmarks provide can make each game feel like a new experience. gameplay aside, the game looks and sounds incredible! i love the graphics, i like that each civ has different architectures. at the end of each game, i love looking at what my base looks like. the terrain is gorgeous, and you can customize the biome in skirmishes. some unique upgrades will change the appearances on your units. the sound design is out of this world. i love hearing the marching and galloping of your military. the music is gorgeous and not only unique to each civ, but there are different tracks for each age. languages your units speaks changes with each age as well and you get to witness the evolution of language through the ages. the historical detail for the civ bonuses make me happy as a history nerd. i like how unit upgrades work. overall, can't recommend this game enough to both new and veteran players."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-09,i play this as a coop with my friends only. very addicting. lots of details for each civilization's buildings and units. ai improved over time. i can no longer to back to aoe2
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-08,"the best game i have ever played, can't get enough! a good win rate is 50 percent because you will many different strategies that you are not prepared for"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-06,"for the love of all the is good in the world please add an adult update that has blood and gore, there is something depressing about giant battles that look like kids playing with toys. why bother making a new aoe if you cant even beat aoe2 levels of battlefield gore. starcraft 1 and 2 and all the company of heroes do it so why cant you? so sick of being forced to play with no blood etc. refunded."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-01,"very different ui in this game from previous but once you get used to it, its a great time d"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-01,"it's like playing chess, a combination of strategy and reflex."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,great game to play with friends. need feature to reconnect game.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-17,"meh, barely mid, gets boring really fast. there are much better rts games out there and ill be playing those instead."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-15,"although i don't really like playing rts, this game is really good and the dev team really put a lot of effort into it."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-15,i wanted an alternative to starcraft 2. the sound design made me play the game. there is a lot to improve but the variation of civilisations and the feeling of the battles got me hooked.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-15,"takes me back to the good old days of age i, ii, iii, and vi. been playing since the series came out and have been absolutely enjoying the special civilizations age 4 has to offer. especially with the mods in the customs lobbies. been absolutely thrilling to grind through hours of nonstop action."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-14,"it's aoe, i know there's differences between the versions and new fancy stuff, but it's just aoe."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-14,"another awesome aoe game with cinematics to dislodge your jaws, and that timeless wellbalanced gameplay that never skips a beat"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-13,"i adore this game. it's an evolution of the aoe theme, i feel much more so than aoe3 was. civs are all unique and interesting. combat is satisfying, and the campaigns are some of the best they've ever produced."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-11,great engaging gameplay. patches change the meta often enough. additionally the dlc is great.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-11,"i can't recommend it more, absolutely amazing strategy game. few glitches that don't affect the experience."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-11,i started off playing aeo 1 in the 90's. this game bring back so many memories and yet is so much better
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-11,been playing sing age of empires 2. always been a great strategy game i can come too when i'm bored
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-09,"age of empires iv  a childhood dream brought back to life i grew up playing age of empires, spending hours building empires, strategizing battles, and reliving history in the best way a kid couldthrough an epic rts. so when age of empires iv was announced, i was both excited and nervous. could it really capture that same magic? turns out, it absolutely does. the game feels like a love letter to longtime fans while still bringing enough fresh ideas to keep things exciting. the classic gameplay is still theregathering resources, building armies, and outmaneuvering your enemiesbut everything is more refined, more responsive, and just smoother. the civilizations feel unique, and i love how each one has its own strengths and quirks, making every match feel different. one of my favorite things is the campaign. its not just a series of battles its like playing through a historical documentary, complete with realworld footage and narration that gives weight to every mission. the level of detail is insane, and it adds a layer of immersion that i didnt even know i wanted. and of course, multiplayer is as intense as ever. whether youre teaming up with friends or going headtohead with strangers, every match is a test of skill and strategy. the developers have done a great job keeping the game balanced and fresh with updates, which is something i really appreciate. for anyone who grew up with this series like i did, age of empires iv isnt just a gameits a time machine back to those golden days of staying up late, just one more match before bed. if you loved the originals, this is everything you could hope for. and if youre new? well, youre in for something special."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-22,"game crashes on multiplayer 2v2 very frequently. usual trigger is as soon as you launch a major attack against the opponent, game stutters and then crashes."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-24,sultan dlc is just mini games. does not play like aoe. thumbs down
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-16,"they made it into pay to win. where you can buy broken on purpose factions. the game is dead because of this, no one plays. the ranking matching is extremely unfair because there is just not a big player base because of what previously mentioned"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-06,"this game really surprised me in a good way! a perfect blend of nostalgia and fresh mechanics that brings back the golden days of rts while adding just enough modern flair. whether you're a veteran of the series or a newcomer, age of empires iv delivers an epic experience worth every second. short history age of empires iv is the latest installment in the legendary rts franchise, bringing largescale historical battles to life with stunning visuals, deep strategy, and engaging campaigns. with multiple civilizations, each with unique mechanics, and a solid multiplayer mode, its a dream come true for strategy fans. pros  classic aoe feel with modern improvements  smooth, polished gameplay.  each civilization feels unique, adding depth and replayability.  fantastic campaign  full of historical details and great storytelling.  multiplayer is competitive and fun  perfect for 1v1 duels or big team battles. cons  some ai behaviors can be a bit questionable at times.  needs more civilizations and content to keep things fresh longterm. rating from 110 910 your boy gadev! take care."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-13,games great but decides to disconnect my computer from the internet everytime i launch it which requires me to restart my computer if i wish to go online. its been an issue with many people for months and devs have just ignored it.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-09,im a beginner to aoe4 but i mostly get level 100 players as opponents while my level is 10...too many bubs in game....stuck in assaigning screen multiple times.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-06,"every time an update changes the player stats and costtime to build, i like this game less and less."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-11,"i forced myself to play and like it several times already. doesn't work. situation is similar to coh3  sound is bad, better than in coh3 but still bad  everything is muffled and put through some flat filter so in the moment of action you can only recognize swords clashing sounds like one fork is sliding on another and peasant production. sometimes you can hear gunpowder weapons but it would be very strange to not hear it. during action everything is made so that you have zero will to micro and you just whatever, will make more units, will make more resources.... starting from sounds and unit responses and ending with music and micro control  everything wants to make you quit this game. music itself is good but how it's put is not fitting the situation, you either want to sleep or switch it off completely. basically, anything you can mention in this game is made better in age of mytholody retold. campaign is decent, quality is pretty high in this case, especially with historical videos. gameplay wise all strategy games feel like rockpaperscissors, aoe4 feels like rockpaper. i am not aoe fan overall, but this one, especially, i presume, is the worst. it has all the potential but relic specifically do not use any of it, or cannot  i don't know already because starting from dow3 they are going downhill with extreme speed."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-28,"i have reached plat 2 playing mongols villagers and traders only, they nerfed it. now i play 5tc zhu xi and i like it more"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-05,"meh, micro feels worse than aoe2 and the tutorial is terrible... edit played again and the micro seems to work properly, don't know what happened or if it's specific to the tutorial. the game is a bit different to aoe2, but pretty much the same. just play the early and late economy tutorial, the other ones except maybe the combat scenarios is just useless information. otherwise the game's good."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-11,"i have thousands of hours in stronghold crusader and recently tried aoe4. seems like a pretty good game, a lot more polished, but combat feels wonky. i like the hotkeys, controlling villagers, and scout  fog of war mechanics are executed properly, its just combat thats really really wonky. in crusader units will compress on top of each other, which is smooth but physically not realistic. in aoe4 they occupy their own space and if you use attack move properly, they will sometimes still take some weird pathing or attack and then run around a little until attacking again, idk its just weird. other than this i have no complaints."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-28,the best and smart strategy game with medieval atmosphere!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-10,this game is my favorite age of empires game. amazing all around
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-28,"aoe2 but different. same rts soul, new rules. fewer civs for now, but each one plays completely differently. not just 2 in a random stadistic, actually real gameplay changes, each civ plays wildly different. no team bonuses, no house walling, no fish traps, and no dodging arrows. and some aoe2 players would hate this including me but no hilll bonus here. winning isnt just about destroying everything. lose your landmarks? youre out. ignore sacred sites? ten minutes and its game over. wonders? actually a real win condition. trade exists in 1v1, you can build tcs in feudal, and scouts grab sheep just by walking near them. food matters more. boars hit back hard, food dont rot, and farms magically replenish without costing wood. infantry can build siege on the battlefield, mangonel shots can be dodged, but arrows? they always hit. towers get weapon upgrades, walls can be climbed, and monks dont snipe single units, they wololo everything in a big circle if they are carrying a relic. tcs hit like a truck, and vision is limited, you cant see through trees unless you have a scout. its aoe2s rebellious cousin smarter, sleeker, and objectively the betterdesigned game. the mechanics are more polished, the gameplay is more consistent, and it aligns better with realworld history. its a modern evolution of the franchise that feels cohesive and well thought out. but, for obvious reasons, it still doesnt have the sheer amount of content that aoe2 has built over decades. fewer civs, fewer campaigns, and a modding scene thats still growing. different? yes. better? absolutely. just dont try to house wall."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-08,lots of fun. highly recommend. 1010
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-08,great game. simple and super strategy game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-05,"the ranked match making is a joke. endless games of diamond players vs gold players. also, when you get randomly disconnected for no reason or the game crashes, there's no way to log back into the ranked match. billion dollar game studio???"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-21,dude the ai ally is such a coward. they never ever attacks the enemy. you are always on your own. please fix this dumb ai
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-24,"amazing game, don't think twice about trying it. fantastic rts."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-24,"is it good? yes. is it better than age 2? no, but not far."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-11,"started playing aoe1 in 1998. i have been playing aoe2 from 1999, aoe2 hd from 2013 and aoe4 since 2021. i will probably still be playing this game or a later iteration of it when i'm 80. download it and enjoy."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-08,"aoe2  aoe3 are far superior games  i love this franchise, but this game went backwards in every way possible."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-16,love the cultural music and unique traits
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-01,excellent game. definitely my number one go to rts game. i have spent countless hours grinding multiplayer. there is so much variety it feels like a new game every time. units feel flush compared to the older versions. as well as faster pace units. for sure keeps you on your toes.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-01,"the game is great. a lot of fun to play with friends and family. the one major gripe i have is how difficult it is to figure out the map creator. it is difficult to figure out and it takes a lot of processing power. i feel like if the devs spent some time working on that portion, it would make this game a lot more fun in the long term."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-26,"one of the best age of games for competitive play, the interface is clean and the gameplay is smooth. if you are new to rts games i would start with this title while you get a hold on the basics and venture into other titles after you get your feet wet. the game is balanced around ranked 1v1 but if you want to dick around and you don't care about winning team games are a ton of unbalanced fun, and the single player mode exists..... ultimately this is a multiplayer game with a single player mode tact on though."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-24,"great game, probably had some issues early on but nowdays consider this a very worthy successor to the early age of empires games."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-22,"the best rts game out right now by far. constant patches keep the game fresh, and the dlc's are bangers. the competitive scene is also very fun to watch."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-22,"good game, developers are keeping it alive with constant updates, dlcs and patches unlike many others"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-20,"it's a good game, of course, it's an aoe. the strategy is good, but not so well balanced between civilizations. the civs themselves are fun and graphics are nice. many new mechanics and ways to play. makes you want to learn and practice more. the sequel that aoe 3 should have been. that said, i have a few comments  it's always rushed and fast paced.  the civilizations are completely different from each other. it makes it more real, i agree, but really hard to keep the necessary crazy pace with a civ you're not used to.  you kinda have no time to enjoy little things in the game, as you need to focus on build orders and counters. it indeed is fun, but not close to aoe 2."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-18,"great game, i enjoy playing against other players on the ranked ladder. the game is overwhelming at first. stick with it, you will be addicted in no time."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-14,"why i cant play my saved game everytime it auto update, piece of shit"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-14,"i've played a lot of hours but the game, while it is fun at a core level, has insanely bad balance issues. certain builds, like english early menatarms builds, have no counter. even if you were much better than the english player, the only way you can stop it is by also playing english and build early menatarms. certain nations, such as france, are designed to be unbeatable unless you are extremely more skilled than your opponent. an rts is meant to be a skill based game, while i really want to like aoe4 and it has good features, it is not a skill based game. certain nations are just objectively better than others. a very high skilled order of the dragon player, for example, is almost guaranteed to lose to a very low skilled mongol player. not only that, the game is designed to reward toxic players and punish players who aren't."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-06,"amazing game, highly recommend getting this! 1010"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-03,great storyline stays true to the age of empired saga
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-23,great game but fidgity controls during skirmishes
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-19,best rts out right now. worth the effort to get to know. i can't recommend this game enough as a former sc2 player.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-08,good game high qualty i recommend
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-17,"it's a fun game, definietly more asymetrical than aoe2 the civs are more different"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-05,playing the game with family members. enjoy the entire game.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-19,hard game at first but very fun to learn and play
