Iy9J0nzOh-s,@tylerelli6565,2025-02-27T04:00:12Z,"the problem with the game is that there is no way to quickly and cheaply own all the content. i got everything on sale but even the free stuff requires you to claim them in steam when they should just be unlocked as soon as you start playing. its really annoying having so much content locked behind a pay wall but for me it was worth getting everything because I am a huge fan of warhammer fantasy and the immortal empires campaign makes for the best fantasy strategy experience every created by far. There is nothing in this genre that even comes close to the scale and depth this game offers with 24 different races, all with unique legendary lords that are like sub factions with their own mechanics and, strengths and weaknesses. There is so many hours worth of game play here and replay ability, especially in immortal empires which is playable when all 3 games are owned. immortal empires spans the entire warhammer fantasy world and each legendary lord has their own start position where they must fight smaller factions for control and compete with the other legendary lords for victory, which there are different conditions depending on if you want a short campaign or a long one. The game can be described as a sandbox because one playthrough with a legendary lord will be completely different then another playthrough based on player choice and also the choices of the ai, meaning some can be easier then others but it's always fun and you're always learning and getting better. I give this game an 8/10, the only real downside is it is not cheap or convenient to get started and there is a difficult learning curve, especially if you have never played a total war game before.",0

Iy9J0nzOh-s,@AaronWOfficial,2024-10-20T10:59:34Z,"First Impression after an hour of play:

I never played a total war game in my life, I also know next to nothing about warhammer I could never get into it. Just picked up the trilogy for like ¬£15 because I was itching to play a new strategy game but wanted something a bit different from the usual RTS games I play or Turn Based games like Civilization, played the prologue about an hour and I regret nothing so far. 

Best way I can describe this game, is everything I hated about civilization isn't present but everything I liked about it is there. It is hybrid turn based\rts so basically like 2 games in 1 game. Checked some videos on yt to see how hectic the game can get, and gotta say my mind is blown. Never seen a strategy game this epic in my life. It is also quite forgiving on new players it seems, explains its systems quite well in the prologue I don't feel overwhelmed at all. Seems very easy to pick up for a newbie. My favourite part about this game is you can zoom your camera right into the battle so close and the animations\detail in the battles are amazing, something a lot of strategy games do not let you do.

If you are like me and have been on the fence about this game for a while because the retail price for the trilogy is insane, you can get it for -86% discount right now on cdkeys. 100% worth the money, if you get the trilogy you get all the content from the first 2 games in warhammer 3 so it is totally worth it. Don't need to install the other 2, as long as you own them the content is unlocked in warhammer 3.

As for performance. i5-13600k, 4070 super running 1440p ultra recommended settings. Ran all benchmarks. Battle fps sits around 100, campaign fps sits around 90. So assuming you have a mid-range pc, you are fine. I have seen people with 8gb cards and 10th\11th gen intel cpu's running it ok so any of those people that are worrying about VRAM or older gen cpu's can rest easy, just be prepared to play in 1080p and maybe drop a few settings if you want a smooth experience.",1

Iy9J0nzOh-s,@Shoxpyre,2024-10-05T17:34:32Z,"Growing up I loved mage knight tabletop game and age of empires, warcraft, and any tactics based game I could get my hands on. Eventually found a Warhammer 40k game on ds that had actions for the units and limited ammo for the units etc I thought it was amazing.

The motto for war is, why only feed your own cells with your blood, But the artists of the games for playing the worst of life as a little hobby dolls game on computers have reached such level of character that entire histories and cultures and civilisations and the myriad reasons why war happens could be written by those familiar with fantasy worlds just by nutting out eah species and their war fashion and attitude and completing the non-warrior aspects of their species and we could perhaps believe that they had something to defend if overpopulation caused them to begin to destroy so many other species that the childrens and adults fairy stories about principals and virtue and the symbiotic nature of nature and the sage wisdom and the many other lessons of life could be learnt off the battlefield. In fact I believe in a way we pump a lot of attention into these games until they can do more than combat which is quite simplistic really and done more like a sport with a morbid theme. I hope the culture is not too imbedded now to move on with the potential we all somewhere feel for computer games to greater things, great works of art and culture that may even transcend Earths own but if we don't destroy too many species may be able to be brought back to nature to show that life is best lived in love and learning and all the aching years of wage slavery and war and bad romance and abusive relationships has not been for nothing and that now we can finally live and truly truly weep when we are to die like cultures falling in love with the landscape used to before the whole epic project thing began on that first step thousands of years ago towards huge group projects of ""well we'll need to kidnap some people to do the physical work and enslave them and their descendants, we'll be finished in no time.""",0

Greenskins: Ridiculously overhauled tech and economy. The unique personal quests they never had are still missing, and the mechanics are just barely passable. 1/10.

In Total War: Three Kingdoms, soldiers are able to fight effectively even when clustered together in melee combat. However, in Total War: Warhammer and other Total War games (excluding titles prior to Empire: Total War), soldiers often fail to engage when grouped tightly, leaving them vulnerable to enemy attacks and resulting in heavy losses. Please implement a patch to improve melee combat mechanics so units can perform as effectively as they do in Three Kingdoms. It is incredibly frustrating to see soldiers standing idle in close formations, unable to fight back and eventually getting wiped out. Additionally, when ordered to pursue retreating enemies, units often just follow them without engaging in attacks for an extended period. This is extremely frustrating. When enemy generals flee, it becomes nearly impossible to catch them with melee units unless you have long-range attacks, making it feel like melee units are at a severe disadvantage. This issue seems to stem from the same underlying mechanics, and it urgently needs to be fixed as well.",0

Elves in Warhammer tend to hide a lot of double-meanings in their words, statements that could read like a compliment could actually be a deep insult and many of them take great amusement at doing things like, especially if the other party doesn't know. Combine that with Thorgrim being highly suspicious of elven intentions, given the long, long history of bad blood between the two races, and it makes sense why he would immediately interpret it as an insult.

Actually, they can develop the Warhammer title, I've no problem with that, but where is Medieval III Total War? The latest two historical total war entries were disastrous. Thankfully, we have some good modders, even being CA completely failing about historical content, at least we found some consolation with these mods. Such as Medieval Kingdoms1212.
Edit: Do me a favor Warhammer fans. Apparently, none of you played historical total war games before considerably. So don't come up with rubbish childish replies. As a ""mature"" total war player, I  share my thoughts based on my experiences. (For example, I've got a ""Caesar Reborn"" achievement on Total War Attila. According to the steam statistics, there is only 0.01 percent of players have that achievement.) And I don't see any bright future for historical content anymore. CA is entirely messing up on this.
Edit2: Unless one of you comes with a ""rational"" reply, I'll rewrite this comment all the time. So stop bothering me with your pathetic answers. Thank you.",5

tbE-0Gjz93M,@Mrdoughlicious,2023-03-14T16:17:28Z,"Few more beginner tips, maybe some a little bit advanced:

1.) Trade Agreements. Get them with as many factions you can (that you don't plan on going to war with). These can double your income per turn, and you have zero military obligations to the factions you are trading with, other than not attacking them.

2.) Do NOT group your units too closely together. The AI likes to do this, but you should always spread all of your units out a little bit for a few reasons. a.) It makes units a little bit easier to see and control when in combat. b). It makes you hard to flank and c.) It prevents your entire army from being decimated by certain artillery and magic. Which brings me to my next tip:

3.) Magic! Understanding how and when to use magic, and how the winds of magic works, is definitely an advanced mechanic. But as a TWW3 player, you NEED to learn this. Magic can and will single handedly turn the tide of battles time and time again, and it is not uncommon to see wizards with 400+ kills after every battle. TL;DR: If you can put a wizard type hero in your army, do it. It is always worth it. Which brings me to my LAST tip:

4.) Heros! Heros are single entity units that can be placed in an army or used on the campaign map for functions your lord wouldn't do. Heros have MANY functions, but all heros level up just like your lords. They are incredibly versatile and can make both campaign and battles easier. Some heros can even destroy enemy cities without a battle (on the campaign map, looking at you Lord Kroak). They take up a unit slot in your army, but usually they are a worth it to place in your army as most of them are both potent in battle and buff your army in some way. 

I have over 3500 hours among the TW:WH games, and I think that covers most of the basic stuff. If I missed anything, please let me know. Have fun!",163

Harald was originally named ""Uthmog Elvenbane,"" and the name for Harald internally among GW was ""Harry the Hammer,"" said internal name eventually leading to becoming ""Harald Hammerstorm"". I'm unsure exactly when the Harald Hammerstorm name became the canon, but I know this: Harald Hammerstorm was the primary inspiration for Sigmar Heldenhammer. Harald's Warhammer is even officially named ""The Hammer of Harry"" as a callback to that internal name.
Yes. Sigmar, the face and soul of the Empire, was based on a Chaos Lord.",2

SgRvKZ5LYFo,@Watchxes,2024-07-14T09:33:51Z,"A possibly very useful tip for absolute beginners that i think was not mentioned in the video:
Make sure that the individual units in your starting army are not completely wiped out early on. There are some enormously useful and strong units in it, e.g. artillery etc., which you can only recruit much later. If they fall, you cannot replace them with the same for the time being, which can make the early battles more difficult. If you take care of them and let them survive, they will also level up with each battle and become much stronger later in the game.
If you mess up in battle and get flanked, sometimes it's better to use some cheap, replaceable archers to bodyblock the flanking enemy and protect your more valuable range units (like artillery) until your meele units make it back to support.",3

Btw you don't need to do that, you have allot of factions and commanders with the base game, it was more of a personal preference, but I have to say giving all the triple A failures with 60¬£+ even with all I paid to unlock all factions it was so worth it. Maybe for veterans who played hundreds of hours or even thousands would not seems so but for me as new it was worth every penny which is rare these days in gaming, huge amount of content and so much fun, I can't put it down lol.

Chaos Dwarfs are still Dwarfs - they don't make shoddy, prone to break/explode things, while Clan Skryre contraptions usually kill half as many Skaven as the enemy. Basically - if it's made by a Dwarf, Chaos or not, it will work as intended. That's the main reason it's the Dawi Zhar, and not the Skaven, who supply the Chaos hordes with the vast majority of their artillery and war machines.

Skaven are physically weak, prone to laziness and treason, and may carry dangerous diseases - sometimes on purpose. As a result - taught by bitter experience - Skaven are, as a matter of policy, the only race Chaos Dwarfs would not enslave to work in their mines and forges. Any Skaven prisoners Chaos Dwarfs might take are simply executed.",1

IuqF7U6jX44,@SpicyFuecoco,2024-12-16T07:23:46Z,"I hard disagree that refraining from using pause/slow-motion will make you a better player. In fact, I would go so far as to go in the opposite direction and saying that playing in Slow-Motion will actually HELP you improve. And refusing to pause will actually make you a WORSE player.

When you start doing weight-lifting, you don't immediately start off with bench-pressing an entire car. When you learn martial-arts, you take things slowly at first, to make sure you've got things right, and reinforced good muscle-memory, then speed up over time.

When ever you find yourself in a situation, and don't know what to do, PAUSE THE GAME IMMEDIATELY. Stop and think about the situation, and find the best solution to that situation.

Let's say you just charged your cavalry into the enemy's rear. But then you spot a unit of spearmen who are about to crush your cavalry between a wall of spears and the unit you just flanked. What do you do in that situation? If your answer is to panic and lose all your cavalry, then you will never get better because you will ALWAYS panic and lose all your cavalry in that situation. Then bemoan the fact that you are bad at the game.

Only when you have gotten good at playing the game paused/in slow-motion should you then take what you've learned, and practice and reinforce those tactics and strategies in real time. If you practice in increments, getting faster and faster, eventually you may be able to play the game at 3x Speed.",1

IuqF7U6jX44,@DSzaks,2024-10-10T06:11:39Z,"I don't think playing on slow mo/pause makes you a worse player. Maybe in multiplayer sure. But just playing the campaigns I don't think it make a differences. Sure you might be slower to react, but you have longer to react anyway so.... at worst its just cancels out. And pausing gives you infinite time to react so there is literally no downside to that in single player, unless you really want to play on legendary battle difficulty. But if not it's fine. Also don't think the hotkeys for spells are really important since, again, if you pause you have infinite time to waste dragging your mouse anywhere you want. Just comes down to what kind of pace the player prefers.

The formation and movement type hotkeys however are really important to know though. When I learned about those it practically blew my mind. Couple other good pointers are multi clicking orders for units because for some reason they programmed the unit AI pathing to disregard half your orders if you don't keep inputting over and over again, especially if your trying to move a unit out of combat. Also be wary of locking formation on unit groups as it does some really weird things to unit attack orders, especially on missile units if you trying to get them all to shoot at something specific.

Another great tip is turn off freaking skirmish mode on ALL your units. Best bet is to go in the option and just have it off by default. Could have been a great feature, but the problem is that it completely overrides any order you give the unit. So if there is any enemy w/o 2 miles of a unit they just become completely uncontrollable, and if your new and don't know why a unit won't listen to you it can be really frustrating.

On a nitpicky note you can waste earthblood if you cast it on units already at full health. This can be a little tricky because even if a units health bar isn't full they can still be at full health. Because each model in a unit has it's own health and if some of them are dead it will show a depleted health bar even if all the other models in the unit are completely undamaged. So if your trying to heal and the hp isn't going up this is probably why. This is why healing is best used on big high hp units w/ low or single model counts as apposed most infantry units. Also if you see a little gold line at the end of the health bar it means they have hit their healing limit and can't be healed any more that battle.",0

A very interesting start for the Campaign with all these Vampire Pirates, never really given him much attention in WH3 but I assumed it was going to be mainly a Cathayan dogpile.

May I offer an alternative?

Taking the entirety of Grand Cathay will eat up time that you've said you want to spend retaking Naggaroth and Ulthuan, and you'll have to defend that land from invasions from the North and West.

Instead, take the coasts/large river provinces.  For the rest of Cathay, ally or vassalize (I don't know if Delves can vassalize) another Cathay faction, probably Zhao Ming.  Your inland flanks will then be covered by this ally while you traverse the seas.  You'll get access to Cathayan recruitment to make Lokhir's army a bit more exotic.  

You could RP it off as ""By taking the entirety of the Cathayan coast, the Krakenlord has proved his dominance of the region.  However, he has no personal interest in the inner governing of a vast land of humans when dominating all Druchii and Asur kind are at his fingertips.  Thus, he managed to convince the mentally unstable Zhao Ming that he will 'protect' the Cathay coastline for a 'small' fee of gold, ivory and slaves...""",2

Each campaign has very different mechanics so if you‚Äôre gonna spend money you‚Äôll get a lot of time out of it. 
The Great Book of Grudges for the dwarves is neat and gives you a really good idea of what you need to be doing

So yeah just pick the one that makes you ‚Äúthat‚Äôs badass‚Äù and go from there.

PSA: it‚Äôs not shown in a lot of videos but if you only buy Total Warhammer 3

Fjb_zJxw1lo,@warcrafthumanlord,2025-01-10T17:06:15Z,"I'll be honest my learning curve for total war warhammer went like this (I did play Shogun previously but a long time ago)

1. I started with Warhammer II since it was the cheaper option and I wanted to play Skaven
2. I played Skaven and was really frustrated since those little buggers run off if the enemy even sneezes in their general direction
3. I tried to cheese the game by going all in on artillery and ranged units, which worked fine until I started fighting the wood elves (blasted pointy ears) which just outgun you
4. At that point I progressed very little on the campaign map in 30-40 hours of playtime I barely had 3-4 full provinces, fighting skirmish wars in the desert, the jungle and the mainland
5. I quit Skaven because it wasn't as fun especially when fighting against Bretonnia cavalry or the ranged wood elves (my tactic to win against the wood elves was to use the engineer, make undercities and then blow them up from within).

6. I then wanted to try and play as the vampire coast as I liked the concept of undead (and didn't like vampire counts since they didn't have ranged). Also since I spent a lot of time at Sea as the Skaven I thought it would be a cool way to play just jumping from province to province, taking easy settlements and getting money through sea treasure piles. I bought the DLC and I thought I would enjoy it however after starting as Noctilus it just didn't feel right. I can't put my finger on it, but the units just felt off. So I stopped that campaign

7. I then bought warhammer 1 for the factions it gives in warhammer 2, (it was on 90% sale) and decided what the hell why not play the dwarves. For the first time I actually enjoyed playing warhammer 2. The dwarves had these cool battle callouts, they were really grumpy and moody, even down to the nice echoey way the lord tells the orc army in front to sodd off when he is in a dwarf fortress on the campaign map (reminds me of the hobbit scene). I picked the Ironbrow expedition as I liked the desert setting and I actually enjoyed myself, finished the long campaign with them. Basically having a large chunk of the map under my control and then military alliances with all the dwarves and the empire.
8. The dwarves helped me learn the rock paper scissors of warhammer (different units matchups and who wins what) also due to their resilience it actually allowed me to play with the army at large instead of constantly micromanaging my front line. The dwarves also made it very apparent how the lack of cavalry and monster units were detrimental to them, I even did the hammer and anvil tactics (which I thought of on my own, without looking at tutorials) using the slayers. And it worked fine but I thought It would be better if I had faster units. This prompted me to get Ogre camps and get cavalry from them, which was a major success.

9. After enjoying and finishing the dwarves I wanted to try and play the undead again, I avoided the vampire counts again and decided to buy the tomb kings DLC. Then since most of their factions are in the desert (and I already played in that area as the dwarves) I decided to pick the Exhiles of Nehek and fight against the dark elves in the north west (since they were pretty much the only faction I didn't get to fight as the dwarves since they were on the other side of the map). The tomb kings were nice, they had their own mechanic and relied on free units and instead working with unit/lord caps. Played that for a few hours, I beat Malekith and decided to call that a win and end their campaign. This allowed me to play with magic and chariots, as well as teaching me to micromanage my magic power reserve.

10. At this point I wasn't drawn in any of the races available in wh1/2 and the DLC's. I though maybe lizardmen, but in the end decided to buy Wh3 and try Grand Cathay. I played the intro scenario and got hooked on the whole demon prince story line. I played the demon prince which was super hard, a lot of unit choices with very different synergies and a lot of options (except the lack of good artillery). In the end I finished the short campaign as the demon prince and was pretty satisfied overall. I liked the customization but felt like his skill tree and lack of items really hold the lord back compared to other legendary lords. This gave me skills to play the flying units and use them to harass the ranged enemies. As well as teaching me the various different abilities and spells (since you get those depending on body parts)

11. Since I played a lot with Khorn units as the demon prince I decided to play as Khorn next, specifically Skarbrand (since I liked the Exalted Bloodthirster which in the end came close to be equal or maybe even stronger than my legendary demon prince lord). Skarbrand starts in the desert again (which was a bit disappointing to be honest) but at least the faction starting locations shuffled a bit. Playing as Skarbrand upped my lord micro managing as well as going full in on the flesh hounds and cycle charging. I am close to finishing that short campaign as well, I cleared the desert from vampires and Orcs, currently in the process of cleaning up the humans. Skarbrand so far was the hardest campaign mostly due to being surrounded by enemy factions and relying on being very aggressive in combat (usually I play defensively) but he gets progressively easier with the blood host that just start piling up as you go, however it forces you to constantly be at war as their economy is almost non-existant and relies heavily on raiding, combat and sacking settlements.


In short I actually enjoy warhammer now and it was because of the dwarves, I don't agree with this video since I think you shouldn't avoid them. What you should avoid however is just sticking to one faction. Play one, see its strengths and weaknesses then you can jump to another faction which is the polar opposite, or just a faction you think has cool units. In the end you will probably find what works for you and then play with that.",0

It plays completely differently from other total war gamez

Just as much as ""get used to the basic units of infantry, cavalry, and archers"" is good advice ""Get used to monsterous infantry, artilery, and flying units"" is just as good advice

Don't treat this like a total war game, there are not really formations and stuff like that, you really gotta focus on the strengths of a faction.

Dwarves can be assaulters if you build them right and there are dwarf factions that are harder to play like iron hand and his slayers and they have airborne units to make up for the lack of their land speed and the slayers are their form of flankers. Sure, they're not as fast as the horsemen of britania or the empire but for the dwarves they work fine as flankers for their tactics.

Elves are a good faction to learn the basics with but they're almost too basic imo, like they have little flare, i personally think the empire is a good fit because it teaches people to utilize their specialty units such as cav, arty, and heros. It also teaches them to match up unit types against their best suited targets.

Sure those swordsmen got steamrolled by those monsterous infantry, but like that is the same with the elves swordsmen, if they were empire halberds they would have held the line well because they are matched for those units

Empire is a solid faction for learning how to play warhammer, maybe not total war games in general, but like, it's warhammer no other total war game has literally 70% of the units that this has",0

Fjb_zJxw1lo,@Eagleye735495,2024-11-18T00:13:03Z,"I'm sure this video is full of good information, but there's a couple things I have discrepancies with.

2:55 - I could be wrong, but artillery (Helstorm Rockets featured here) is a higher tier weapon meaning you have to work up to them. You'll get your opportunity to play with ""infantry and cavalry and using all your units properly"" while you progress up toward them.

3:23 - Not being reliant on ""experimenting with aggressive builds"" or different tactics is absolutely perfect for a new player who is probably just trying to come to grips with moving an army around in general. Saying that's bad for a new player because once they play any other faction it'll be different is like saying the Huns from Age of Empires 2 are a bad beginner civilization because they don't need to build houses. New players have enough on their minds in both of those games. Not needing to remember to build houses or command cavalry in Warhammer is actually a good thing to help them zone in on getting to grips with other things. After a Dwarf player feels comfortable enough with the bare basics they can hop on over to something like Bretonnia if they want to then focus on cavalry. 

I think you're taking the wrong angle here when it comes to how to ease new players into the game. I think this is a case of an experienced person forgetting where they themselves started from.",1

Fjb_zJxw1lo,@tombkings6279,2024-11-14T18:34:53Z,"The Tomb Kings, known as the Priest Kings in their former lives, are the undying rulers of Nehekhara, an ancient Human civilisation that formed a great and powerful empire some two thousand five hundred years before the birth of Sigmar Heldenhammer and the founding of the Empire. Out of all the unliving creatures that would claim dominion and royalty over the dead, only the Tomb Kings could truly claim such masterful and undisputed sovereignty. For they had once ruled a mighty and far-flung empire during a time when the rest of Mankind were little more than savage barbarians.

Long ago, during an ancient and forgotten age, Nehekhara stood as a shining beacon of civilisation and Human achievement; a golden age when its cities shone with a majestic splendour, its buildings crafted from magnificent marble and limestone, its armies capable of conquering entire kingdoms. In this long-lost age, Nehekhara's mighty rulers reigned as living gods amongst men. But this great realm was destroyed millennia ago through acts of great treachery and powerful sorcery. The living of Nehekhara perished long ago in a single, mournful night, and in their absence, the dead stirred from their graves and claimed the land anew.

Even as their ancient civilisation now lies buried beneath the sand, its once verdant plains turned to searing desert and their mighty and glorious empire fractured and in ruin, the Tomb Kings have once more awoken from their deep sleep. Rising from their decrepit sarcophagi, the mummified rulers of Nehekhara awoke with eyes of burning balefire, their thirst for power, conquest and vengeance just as strong in death as in life.

They have returned to reclaim that which is rightfully theirs, their legions innumerable, rising up from the scorching sand brandishing weapons of polished bronze and priceless gold. Ancient, emotionless and spiteful to all those that have slighted them, woe betide those foolish enough to stand before their silent onslaught.",0

Fjb_zJxw1lo,@Trihahalos,2024-10-11T17:10:54Z,"My two cents here...

1.) Tyrion and basically any high elf campaign is easy. 

2.) Gor-Rok is ok. Last defenders is also easy. They got 3/4 secure flanks and Kalida and the vampires are a joke. And then you got a strong base to stomp the world. Oxyotl is also a beast but ok, you gotta have half a brain to play with him.

3.) I would not rate any chaos dwarf as easy to play. They are a very strong faction but they are not easy. They need patience, you gotta be able to face early-mid game with armies that field a lot of crap units and a handful of elites. You don't need to be a genius player but you gotta know some stuff about the game to do that. Plus they got a lot of mechanics and they get attacked from all sides in higher difficulties. 

4.) Kairos... ehm... ehm... True he got genuinely one of the best starting armies and early tzeench armies absolutely stomp opposition (if you got the right DLC). However... They got no economy and you will have to make the most of that early advantage because they are coming for you from all sides. Oxyotl is no joke and the the rest of your opponents are no joke either. And they will outnumber you. To make a joke out of the campaign you need to know how to play and also how to utilize your powers. 

5.) Kislev? Really? No. Just no. All Kislev campaigns are brutal. No two ways about it. You will be attacked from all sides, you will have to face some of the toughest enemies at once. And you got no allies. Your army is ok but warriors of chaos are better and their heroes are stronger. All Kislev campaigns are genuinely among the hardest ones. If there is a single noob that can last more than 20 turns in one, I have yet to meet this person. If you are new to the game, for your own sake, please stay away from Kislev. These campaigns are hard even for people that easily win other campaigns. 

My suggestions

1.) Any high elf. Especially on the island. You beat everyone, noone can touch you. Profit. 

2.) Any beastman. Especially Taurox. Read his mechanics for 5 minutes. Build the best units you can. Point and click. Win. Repeat. Many times. 

3.) Last defenders. Solid flanks. Solid army. Easy opponents. Advance and dominate. 

4.) Grimgor. He is a damage dealer and a tank at the same time. And starting orcs are very good. Just attack and steamroll opposition. He will snowball too. Grom is also supposedly easy but the AI is too aggressive against him and you got 3 opponents in turn 3 or something. If you manage to beat that, you are good though. All the orcs are decently easy anyway.

5.) Archaon. Is there anything that can stop him really? The answer is no. 

6.) Ikkit claw. Just do it. The other skaven are not that hard either (ok maybe the rat ogre guy is). But Ikkit is a beast. And his capital is one of the best cities on the map. If not the best. 

Noob traps

1.) No Skarbrand. He can be a beast in turn 5 or something. But you absolutely gotta know what you are doing to achieve that. If you don't, you got a constantly underlevelled lord, chasing his tail and pondering why you lack the funds for even one stack when everyone got like 3-4.

2.) No chaos demons of any kind. They need their mechanics to be good. And their starting positions are not easy. 

3.) No empire. That is accurate. Though our man Karl has received a buff and the rest are in a better state too. 

4.) No Brettonia. Many will be attracted to the knights aesthetic. Brettonia is really lackluster though and it will disappoing most new players.",1

4) one appeal of warhammer is to create doomstacks and have fun with them. this is a game after all.

but I do agree on other points:
2) retreat is a mess, randomly screwing up armies, and this is especially irritating if I initiated the battle (maybe just a misclick).
3) discipline of elite units is a good idea. one hand splitting units is annoying, but on the other hand the stickiness allows slower units to keep being relevant (see early TW games where cavalry was everything). discipline for the elite is a good middle ground.
5) being able to get a full view of the battlefield in a strategy game should be basic feature. I mean, there is the 2d view, but that is not practical.

and adding more:
a) movements including embark/disembark are horribly clunky. sometimes you don't even know if you end up in the water or on land. other times it just messes up you movements. for example you want to go to the other side of a bay, and if you click it wants to go around only on land, while there might be an option to embark in the shoreline city and disembark on the other beach.
b) damage to be done at contact when doing a charge. if the attacked entity falls or become staggered, they often don't get the hit on hp, running down lower weight single entities is sometimes an unfunny joke. 
c) casting on or under bridges in settlement battles is a mess. and if we are at it siege battles have lots of issues. asspull ladders should be at least selective, not for all units. and then assladder units should be able to siege without building equipment. rams and towers are a redundant feature anyway, waiting a turn to siege can rarely be afforded. range of towers is incorrectly marked, they shoot way farther if they are higher. the whole point-accumulating-tower-defense system is a failed feature.",2

dqv01Fh1d84,@TrapsterJ,2025-02-27T02:37:15Z,"I‚Äôd really like for an option, similar to that dropped order thing you mentioned, that you can input commands or moves as locked or prioritised, so that instead of having to spam click a unit to get them out of a pile and babysit them, or a unit getting distracted by something else such as when chasing a lord, it will lock it the same as if you was spam clicking and would ignore everything else besides getting to that location or chasing that enemy.

Also, the queued or routed command for cavalry or flankers. Why is it you can draw an intricate line for a flank, but when it gets to the end target, it doesn‚Äôt get its charge bonus? Having to micromanage everything is annoying enough as it is, so why can‚Äôt we just have a cavalry unit be sent by itself with that drawn route and actually do a hammer and anvil that we expect instead of slowly walking into them with no charge? 

I also want an option, especially for the end of battles, to send all units to chase down their closest targets that are fleeing, instead of having to one by one select a unit to an enemy. And they wouldn‚Äôt all pick the same one, they‚Äôd differentiate by speed perhaps or whoever is further away or by unit worth. The amount of times you have a clump of units by the end and you just highlight them all and click one key enemy to make sure it dies and you have a conga line of wasted units and enemies that get away for free, especially with their dropped orders being a factor as well and rubber banding units not actually landing any damage or attacking.

I‚Äôd also like a line of sight feature for ranged units, particularly gunpowder ones. At least to show the gradient of land that they can actually fire one and then others that are blocked by terrain or by friendly fire.

I unfortunately think that CA won‚Äôt add quality of life features that actually streamline the experience or take away some of the unnecessary slog of the game. It goes with just general DLC concerns, there is so much potential left for this game to actually be wrapped up and be warranted to be the end of the series but I can foresee it ending with lacklustre content and having to rely on modders for the rest of it.",0

If a unit escape to the the flag point, that unit should be still alive in the overworld. But apparently the game calculate itself and chose who dies and who lived, making escaping tactic in the battlefield is kind of worthless. I have been trying to save my precious heavy arty in ambushed situation, but when i sacrificed a fodder or two, the arty that i have been kitting towards retreat flag are dead. So whenever i fight skaven 3 stacks (especially Eshin) in ambushed situation, i would auto resolve it and let all die 90% of the time. The other 10% is basically let the trapped army become the fodder to weaken the enemy while my second army wait in the back.",3

LENDexWIsGc,@freyrTV,2025-02-27T19:50:19Z,"Great stream! Love that Bretonnia got a showcase! Definitely some hard match ups this tourney. That being said I think they are very misunderstood as a faction and I've some thoughts below.

First thing is Bertonnian cav and its a lot to cover: I have done extensive testing the only thing that sets bretonnian cav apart - and i know this ability get memed on a lot - is lance formation. Its a giga strong ability but you have to know what its for. In addition to giving very high charge bonus, it makes it so the unit can punch through a non braced unit without models getting stuck, getting off a ton of charge + impact damage without taking much in return. Their cav is the only cav in the game that can do this barring monstrous cav like for example skull crushers . Meaning bret cav plays more like chariots than cav from other factions. You have to remember ur ABC's, Always Be Charging! That being said this ability comes with some glaring weaknesses. It lowers your melee defence by 8 so if you keep it on for an extended fight you will lose most trades. You can simply turn it off, but its taxing micro. Also because of the formation, enemy cav will simply obliterate you because they wrap around you. NEVER use this ability charging into cavalry or monstrous units. Versus cav you want as wide a unit formation as possible. 

Units:
Yeomen: These are absolute trash. Treat them like felbats / dogs.
Knights errant: These are your bread and butter. On par with empire knights, jade lancers etc.
Knights of the realm: These are your anti cav/large because of the anti large (obviously) but also the high charge bonus. Which incidentally also makes them great at cycle charging infantry. Very good.
Questing knights: Better version of knights errant. Best bet versus high armor. Will underperform against cav because of their low charge bonus despite the AP. Mind they are not knights of the black rose, do not treat them as such.
Pegasus knights: Very high burst damage but very squishy. They can do 70% of a units hp in the charge but then their damage falls off a cliff. Because of no splash damage and low model count they struggle to kill models. Easy to fall into the trap of staying to finish off a unit but then losing 50% of your health before its done. Keep cycle charging!

Second thing is their infantry. You dont have killy infantry, they will lose most trades, but they do have insane holding power if combined with grail relique, knight nearby and encourage. Whopping 65 leadership on men-at-arms and 56 on peasants is insane for the cost. This cheap holding power and capture weight allows for cav superiority. And as everyone knows archers are very good, especially with pox arrows.

In summary bret cav is very good but you need to always be charging, requiring insane micro. A common error is thinking their cav is better because of superior stats, but thats not really the case. Its better because of lance formation shenanigans and unit variety.

In a lot of these games i see Turin charging his cav in and letting it stay there to grind it out until it dies. Thats like a cardinal sin for brets imo. Almost comparable to sending your ranged units in melee and expecting them to do good.

TL;DR
Always Be Charging. For the lady!",0

When a rat becomes infected with the parasite (usually by coming into contact with cat feces), it alters its behavior, and instead of avoiding the smell of cats the rat is attracted to it. This allows the protozoa to complete its life cycle, as eventually the cat-loving rat gets killed and devoured by a cat, allowing the parasite to infect a new cat's digestive tract. Scientists discovered that the ""loves the smell of cats"" effect also works on humans infected with toxoplasmosis...and that the areas with the largest infection rates of toxoplasmosis are also the areas with the highest number of pet cats per capita. In short, cats are using a mind-altering parasite to enslave the human population.",1

I know it‚Äôs early to talk about mods and, especially since it‚Äôs your first Nurgle campaign you should play it as vanilla as possible in terms of Nurgle specific mechanics. 
If you‚Äôre interested later in the campaign there are some mods to make plagues more interesting and cults better as, at least imo, Nurgle has maybe the worst cult buildings.  The plague mod by shadow521, it may be a bit OP‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs been fun and I enabled it after I set a certain goal in my campaign (confederating Kugath and Epidemius).  
But I love making a plague cultist with the attrition and siege debuffs and sending him into an area I‚Äôm about to conquer to weaken it as I send my armies through. 
There‚Äôs also a nice lore mod that will give you some info/background on places, units, and characters. I don‚Äôt read all of them, but the story of tamurkhan was interesting and it gave you the story little by little as you conquered territory.",0

So the Beasts of Nurgle are actually really happy and excitable and really just want to play and/or have a hug, but while they do so, they squish their ne friends/toys and cause them to rot and vomit with their aura. When they are slain, they are sent confused, scared and in pain back into the Aethyr (warp basically) and then pupate like caterpillars or beetle larvae, their fear turning to hatred. When they emerge, they are Rotflies (the plague drone mounts) and have a much more hatful demeanour. These rotflies usually kill by plucking the heads off enemies, which are semi-digested and turned into the death heads that are thrown by some plague bearers (including those who mount them). However, if they ever find the person who original killed them in their Beast of Nurgle form, they will eat them whole and that person will spend eternity in their abdomen, digesting but never dying.",129

Kind of a random question but how recent is the version you're playing here?  The reason I ask is because there's another creator that also launched a Gorbad campaign today, but his panel is showing 15 and 25 for the tactics as contrasted with your 5 and 15.

9ZrEO2-WknQ,@Robert-re2kz,2023-01-14T01:00:51Z,"Hack: join wars with factions that are super far away from you, often you can milk a ton of money out of the AI and never have to fight them. 

Example: As Karl Franz, ask cathay if you can join wars with everybody in their area. Every time, balance the diplomacy, some factions will give you $2500+ per war.

Also ALWAYS balance diplomacy, you can get SO MUCH money from balancing every time you have a green diplomacy.",12

9ZrEO2-WknQ,@aceofspades3018,2023-01-13T23:07:47Z,One tip I would of added is if you are going to declare war on another faction see if there are other factions that you want to be friends with or want to gain some rep that are already at war and declare war via diplomacy.,16
9ZrEO2-WknQ,@WiseG33k,2023-01-13T21:49:52Z,"I use one key mod that changes the entire game dynamic: Unit Caps For All. It makes it so all factions have the Tomb King mechanics limiting high-tier unit capacity. If you want more, you need to build additional recruitment buildings. I find it's very well balanced that way and prevents doomstacking.",5
9ZrEO2-WknQ,@Toad_Licker120,2023-01-13T21:26:25Z,Ok so i should spend my first money on buildings for growth and stuff. But i should Also fill my army up as soon as possible? Which one is it? Sorry if I missunderstood something.,1
9ZrEO2-WknQ,@Razielts1,2023-01-13T21:25:35Z,"3:20 Not necessarily. Armies that are static on home provinces can be useful due to the fact that lords that stay a few turns in a province while building get the builder, up to architect trait ( name is changed in warhammer 3 ).

 This increases economy by 7% and also reduces building costs for the same amount, so while recruiting, or even just building without enemies it isnt bad not to use the armies.

This is the reason why i build heroes to be hybrid, cuz while the army is static, the heroes are killing other heroes, spying and stealing technology.

5:20 to add to this specific point, in wh3 they made it so that public order also contributes to growth, so you wanna rush both. In factions that have corruption, you also want to rush corruption in addition to growth and control ( public order in wh3 ).",1

9ZrEO2-WknQ,@keilanl1784,2023-01-13T19:26:34Z,"One caveat to spending your gold on settlements: upgrade your province capitol before upgrading your minor settlements. Depending on the campaign, you can't defend your minor settlements and still expand your sphere of influence. Prioritize your larger settlements that get stronger garrisons and walls. If a tier 1 minor settlement gets taken by an enemy, you didnt lose a lot of gold, as you still have it in your treasury instead of burning on a beastman's spear.

Make sure your minor settlements are safe before investing more than 1 building into them",170

On top of that, Malakai is a ranged hero, so his melee skills are garbage. Best to keep him at range in a group of other ranged units, like Thunderers or some such. Also, Gotrek and Felix are also not terribly tanky, but keeping them together makes for a powerful team that can take on nearly any unit in the game... but ""keeping them together"" is the key phrase there. Individually, they're okay but not all that impressive. Together, they're unit-crushers and single-creature destroyers.",0

My lord, VLad, with a full stack faces two stacks of Jagged Horn Tribe. One with a single lord; the other a full stack. Vlad attacks the single lord stack.
Setting up behind the single lord, so as to intercept the oncoming reinforcements, Vlad and his vampire entourage killed the beastman lord before their arrival. Choice: WIN or wait for the arrival of the other forces. 
The choice of WIN meant that both Jagged Horn stacks lost. As they had marched they could not flee. Result = both stacks were destroyed even though only one lord had faced the Vlad forces.

They should have added an option, like would be perfectly normal for mercenaries, to extend their ""contract"" instead of the only option being to replace them with a (new) lord from your pool.

15000 for each lord, my goodness, dwarfs seriously do hold grudges for real. And having a global tracker of every factions progress gives the impression that all dwarfs go forth toward a common goal, but some really don't to like each other.

Dwarf lords/heroes really don't seem to be very durable in 1:1 situations strangely enough. But then again, Malakai is a missile and not melee specialist.

With a lantern in hand, the engineer runs through the darkness of the tunnels, spare part in hand, back towards their gyrocopter. Behind them, a host of different noises echo from the darkness from nearby sources of origin that seem to be following the engineer. All that it will take to get away to safety is to install the new part swiftly and then take to the air. Safety is but a short flight through a large open underground cave away with more dwarfs at the end point. At the landsight where the engineer has left their gyrocopter, the engineer sets down his lantern and quickly goes to work putting the new part which he retrieved from a hidden stash into his means of escape. The part slides smoothly into place, and the first several bolts go into their respective holes on the first try before being quickly screwed in. However the last two take several seconds longer each. As he tightens down the last bolt to the appropriate level of tightness, the noises appear again and are close at hand!
 
The engineer shoves his tools back into their storage compartment as these noises begin rapidly approaching, and sweat starts running down the forehead of the engineer as they climb into the cockpit with a loaded weapon at their side.The first attempt to start the engine doesn't work, and the second still isn't enough to get the rotor blades spinning. One the third attempt, the engine turns over and the rotor blades start spinning and picking up speed, but the engineer spots eyes in the darkness from which he came about to leap out and swarm him before he can escape! The outline of multiple skaven becomes clear and they rapidly approach as the engineer tries to reach takeoff speed and escape their reach! Suddenly, a new sound overtakes the noises of the skaven and his gyrocopter in the ears of the engineer and it rapidly approaches. The skaven emerge from the darkness of the cave onto the large landing pad, but they come to a screeching halt as a large group of gyrocopters joins the fray.
 
Using their brimstone guns, half of the group creates a wall of fire to push the skaven back and illuminate the area.
 
From his gyrocopter at the front of the group, Morgris Ironside looks down at the engineer, ""We've got you covered, now get in the air my friend! No one left behind!"" With the several seconds bought by his fellow pilots, the engineer gets his gyrocopter up to takeoff speed and lifts off from the ground before the flames die away. ""He's up and away everyone, let's get back to base so we can retrieve help and then come back to clear these pests out of this area once and for all."" As the skaven retreat into the darkness, Morgris leads the now twenty five strong group through the massive cave and up to the surface. As the group heads for the exit of the cave system, Morgris takes note of the weather, ""Brace yourselves; the wind has shifted and the snow is flying. It is getting dark out so keep your eyes sharp and don't delay. We're going to take the most direct route back to the airfield and land."" Emerging from the cave into the overcast sky as the sun sets behind the clouds, the group turns slightly to the northwest and moves at full speed towards safety. Three minutes of flying almost perpendicular to the wind at speed and in formation eventually pays off as the airfield and its lamps come into view. As they approach, the pilots watch as the doors to their hangar open to them. One by one, the pilots land safely until everyone is safe within the hangar bay and the doors close to seal out the wind.
 
Morgris is among the last to climb out of their machines, and he immediately looks to the engineer, ""Someone get him a drink, something soothing preferably after that kind of a close call."" He looks up to a platform near the hangar ceiling. ""Is everyone back here at the base yet or is someone still out there?""
 
A dwarf pops their head over the edge of the platform's rail, ""Aye sir, you're the last ones in. Everyone is accounted for and safe but the group that came in just a mere minute before yours spotted rats in the underway and not the small kind though there are probably those too.""
 
""So did we, we pulled this engineer from a nasty spot of trouble alright,"" Morgris replies. ""We'll have to send in soldiers to flush them out and clear the area else we'll be forced to take a longer and more dangerous route south."" With his weapon in hand, Morgris exists the hangar and after he turns it in, goes to another part of the base where he meets up with a fair maiden. ""How goes your work Aragris on this big idea of yours?""
 
Aragris Ironside smiles, ""It is progressing in the right direction."" Morgris immediately comments how this is what she has said for the last several times that he has asked. ""Fair, I suppose that I could elaborate. The stress test that we conducted today went well and this little idea of mine sufficiently passed despite being made to do an atypically stressful workload. However, there is more important news that we need to discuss. Lord Makaisson is debating if he should start an adventure that sends him after our cousins in the east or the elves and he asked for the opinions of others which I think is very wise and kind of him. I've already put my vote into the hat of going east for many reasons which you know already. Our older brother and younger sister voted the same way as I.""
 
""As do I,"" Morgris replies. The thought of going east and facing off against the dawi-zhar, slaying them in battle, invokes a personal and deep sense of vengeful desire within him. ""If you will excuse me sister, I must go cast my vote. Then I will come back to talk with you about a few ideas that I have that we should consider for our gyrocopters. I am sure that our siblings will find them to their liking though not in the way that you and I will.""",4

When I play dark elves, I make it a point to absolutely never end a turn with over 800 slaves (at least in the early game, after a while I relax the number to 2000, as above that is the point where you start getting faction wide control loss). I prioritize using the sell slaves diktat until I'm out of provinces that can use it for the turn and then if I still have some left over they go into construction.

l_feq00fdOE,@AsaelTheBeast,2024-07-17T01:03:49Z,"Black ark Corsairs are great, you're just not very good with them.
It's got excellent stats for a T1. More importantly, hand crossbows can skirmish. with a little micro you'll decimate all but the toughest or fastest enemies. They can also get stalk under certain circumstances.

The ideal way to play dark elves is to not even get into melee until you are nearing the point of Killing Prowess proccing.  Use your magic, artillery, and Black arks to blast the shit out of your foes before they even get close. If you aren't using every charge of your black ark abilities every battle (or got forbid, fighting too far away from your black arks to be supported.) then you are doing it wrong. 
Realistically, you aren't often going to have things work out ideally- but the more enemies you can kill before actually meeting the enemy in melee, the better. Build your armies around that- use cav and chariots to slow the enemy down and break up their formations a bit to get a couple more volleys in, if you can. Every little bit counts.

Secondly, there is no benefit to hoarding slaves. If you have around two thousand of them, you should be spending them. In fact, their current mechanics strongly incentivise this.  I don't remember if they had Diktats back when this video was posted, but you can litterally just turn slaves to money or growth or public order. And you should, frequently.


Now, personally, I've never been great with Chariots. But if they work for you, more power to you. DE cav isn't the best around, but you can get some good utility out of them with some micro.",0

J'ai environ 1000h sur le 3 mais je cumule plus de 2500h sur les 2 pr√©c√©dents.
Le jeu est plut√¥t bon, le jeu offre une tr√®s bonne jouabilit√© et rejouable et une vari√©t√©s de gameplay et une richesse ind√©niable. 

Mais je suis plut√¥t d√©√ßu d'une part par un lancement d√©cevant et un d√©veloppement chaotique pendants des mois ! (que CA s'efforce plus ou moins de corriger).
Et d'autre part le partie pris par CA au niveau de la difficult√© du jeu ! le joueur est trop buff√© et l'IA √† la ramasse depuis le d√©but :/
Pour un joueur occasionnel cela offre un d√©fi mais pour un joueur confirm√© c'est plut√¥t niveau bac √† sable ! m√™me en l√©gendaire ou TD.

FRANCHEMENT la politique du DLC est la moins pire des mod√®les √©conomiques du JV ! Rien n'oblige d'acheter tout DLCs et  day one !
Sachant qu'il y a tr√®s r√©guli√®rement des soldes sur steam ou autres.
Par contre je d√©plore la direction de CA au sujet du contenu annexes des DLC pour d√©bloquer 1 unit√© dans certaines autres factions que le DLC de base, il faut 1 DLC en particulier ! sachant qu'il faut plusieurs DLC pour avoir les 2-3 unit√©s compl√©mentaires soit 2-3 DLC !


PS : question Hardware üòâ
Le jeux est vraiment opti Intel ? je souhait changer de config mais les intel core ultra ne m'inspire vraiment pas tout comme la gen14 :/
A l'occasion une petite vid√©o guide d'achat cpu / GPU sp√©ciale TWW3 ? un ratio heures de jeux / achat config peut √™tre sympa :D

S-2ddcnR8Dw,@Xemnas1er,2025-01-07T15:06:05Z,"super vid√©o!
 je rajouterais deux points perso (600h de jeu) j'ai commenc√© en 2023 les ttw  en commencant directement par les warhammer donc en vrai je suis un joueur ""r√©cent"". 

Je suis pas d'accord sur la politique commerciale. Franchement par rapport √† d'autres studio je trouve pas la politique commerciale d√©lirante. il y a tellement de contenu ... All√© pour 100‚Ç¨ tu peux avoir l√©galement la plupart des seigneurs et factions int√©ressantes √† jouer. Et je parle m√™me pas des outils de modding. Certes les moddeurs sont hyper d√©ter et c'est trop cool, mais c'est aussi gr√¢ce au studio qui leur met en place des vrais outils et leurs permet plein de choses. La vid√©o les compare √† Activision franchement c'est rude. pour avoir jouer √† beaucoup de leurs jeux il y a quand m√™me moins d'abus sur ttw.  honnetement activision pourraient fusionner plusieurs de leurs calls of en un seul pour essayer de faire un jeu un peu ultime comme ttw warhammer, mais ils le vendraient 100e de plus m√™me si t'avais les jeux pr√©c√©dents.

Et pour les d√©fauts :  pour moi le seul d√©faut r√©ellement g√™nant, les autres me d√©rangent pas (par exemple l'ia il suffit de te mettre en embuscade et il arr√™te de te fuir la plupart du temps)
pour moi le gros d√©faut du jeu c'est surtout que pass√© 15 / 20 provinces en ta possession √ßa devient vraiment une usine √† gaz √† g√©rer. √ßa manque d'outil de gestion pour les items, les provinces, les arm√©es, les ordres de provinces... franchement pas pouvoir faire de file d'attente de construction de b√¢timents dans un jeu ou le but c'est de contr√¥ler la carte enti√®re c'est d√©lirant je trouve. j'ai pas beaucoup explor√© les mods √† ce niveau l√† peut etre qu'il y en a.

Ce qui m'a aid√© √† profond√©ment renouveler l'exp√©rience sur l'ensemble c'est les mods, un en particulier qui retouche √©norm√©ment de choses. J'entend par l√† SFO : Grimhammer 3 (2 pour TWW2). Le mode √©quilibre l'IA, les races, retouches des statistiques, ajoute des talents, des b√¢timents, unit√©s et m√™me des m√©caniques, le tout en restant coh√©rent avec lore de Warhammer. Pour moi c'est ce qui m'a fortement aid√© √† rester aussi longtemps sur TW Warhammer car m√™me si je fais une pause de 2 mois par exemple, les patchs, ajouts, mods etc continuent d'enrichir le jeu de mani√®re ph√©nom√©nale et me font toujours revenir dessus. Alors oui, si on compte l'ensemble des 3 jeux ainsi que les DLC pour une exp√©rience compl√®te cela revient cher, parfois l'IA est √† la ramasse (beaucoup moins avec le mod SFO) mais j'ai fais peu de jeu sur lesquels j'ai pu passer autant de temps que sur cette licence.

Je ne supporte pas l'optimisation de ce jeu, le proce crache tellement ses poumons que j'ai d√ª baisser la vitesse du ventilo, c'√©tait infernal le bruit qu'il faisait. Les graphisme sont baiss√©s √† √©lev√© et pourtant en Immortal √ßa rame √† mort, alors que le 2 √©tait en Ultra et √ßa passer comme un pet sur du verglas. Alors oui le 3 est plus beau, oui, si vous jouez en √©lev√© ou Ultra avec une b√©cane qui suit, mais si pour que le jeu soit fluide je dois le mettre en moyen, ben il est d√©gueulasse est plus moche que le 2, c'est pas normale. En suite le prix des DLC m'avait tout simplement d√©gout√©s, mais le pire c'est ces 3 r√©gions que sont Ind, Nippons et Kuresh qui sont l√† est ne servent √† rien, parce que d'ici qu'ils mettent ces DLC l√†, alors qu'il reste encore les DLC des races pr√©sentes et des updates de ces races qui sont devenues injouables tellement qu'elles sont nazes, ben on sera fin 2025 ou mi 2026. Jouer des vampires pirates cathay, ou des samurais ou des hommes serpent √ßa m'aurait fait plus plaisir que de jouer un  peaux verte suppl√©mentaire ou baba yaga de mes 2 ou un √©ni√®me Nurgle, m√™me si j'aurai √©norm√©ment appr√©ci√© leurs arriv√©s dans une fin de vie du jeu par exemple, et √ßa n'aurait pas emp√™cher des updates gratuit d'anciennes races.
