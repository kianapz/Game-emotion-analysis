Total War: Warhammer III - Is it Worth It? Should You Play it?,Iy9J0nzOh-s,@AaronWOfficial,"First Impression after an hour of play:

I never played a total war game in my life, I also know next to nothing about warhammer I could never get into it. Just picked up the trilogy for like ¬£15 because I was itching to play a new strategy game but wanted something a bit different from the usual RTS games I play or Turn Based games like Civilization, played the prologue about an hour and I regret nothing so far. 

Best way I can describe this game, is everything I hated about civilization isn't present but everything I liked about it is there. It is hybrid turn based\rts so basically like 2 games in 1 game. Checked some videos on yt to see how hectic the game can get, and gotta say my mind is blown. Never seen a strategy game this epic in my life. It is also quite forgiving on new players it seems, explains its systems quite well in the prologue I don't feel overwhelmed at all. Seems very easy to pick up for a newbie. My favourite part about this game is you can zoom your camera right into the battle so close and the animations\detail in the battles are amazing, something a lot of strategy games do not let you do.

If you are like me and have been on the fence about this game for a while because the retail price for the trilogy is insane, you can get it for -86% discount right now on cdkeys. 100% worth the money, if you get the trilogy you get all the content from the first 2 games in warhammer 3 so it is totally worth it. Don't need to install the other 2, as long as you own them the content is unlocked in warhammer 3.

As for performance. i5-13600k, 4070 super running 1440p ultra recommended settings. Ran all benchmarks. Battle fps sits around 100, campaign fps sits around 90. So assuming you have a mid-range pc, you are fine. I have seen people with 8gb cards and 10th\11th gen intel cpu's running it ok so any of those people that are worrying about VRAM or older gen cpu's can rest easy, just be prepared to play in 1080p and maybe drop a few settings if you want a smooth experience.",1

Should You Play it?,Iy9J0nzOh-s,@Shoxpyre,"Growing up I loved mage knight tabletop game and age of empires, warcraft, and any tactics based game I could get my hands on. Eventually found a Warhammer 40k game on ds that had actions for the units and limited ammo for the units etc I thought it was amazing. Always wished there was a definitive amazing rts to play that was like that but ultimately I moved on to a lot of other hobbies and genres of games I'm sure I've missed out on some great ones!",0

Total War Warhammer 3 Review,ZRJo3R3ANsw,@cgametheory1423,"Google has taken down it's motto ""do no evil"" several years ago as government pressure has denied them the right to use that motto with what governments are forcing them to do, medical doctors took down there pledge almost globally several years ago too, their pledge was ""do no harm"" and they swore on it before that before they were allowed to graduate before a few years ago, largely for the same reasons as google. The motto for war is, why only feed your own cells with your blood, But the artists of the games for playing the worst of life as a little hobby dolls game on computers have reached such level of character that entire histories and cultures and civilisations and the myriad reasons why war happens could be written by those familiar with fantasy worlds just by nutting out eah species and their war fashion and attitude and completing the non-warrior aspects of their species and we could perhaps believe that they had something to defend if overpopulation caused them to begin to destroy so many other species that the childrens and adults fairy stories about principals and virtue and the symbiotic nature of nature and the sage wisdom and the many other lessons of life could be learnt off the battlefield. In fact I believe in a way we pump a lot of attention into these games until they can do more than combat which is quite simplistic really and done more like a sport with a morbid theme. I hope the culture is not too imbedded now to move on with the potential we all somewhere feel for computer games to greater things, great works of art and culture that may even transcend Earths own but if we don't destroy too many species may be able to be brought back to nature to show that life is best lived in love and learning and all the aching years of wage slavery and war and bad romance and abusive relationships has not been for nothing and that now we can finally live and truly truly weep when we are to die like cultures falling in love with the landscape used to before the whole epic project thing began on that first step thousands of years ago towards huge group projects of ""well we'll need to kidnap some people to do the physical work and enslave them and their descendants, we'll be finished in no time.""",0
