Iy9J0nzOh-s,@AaronWOfficial,"First Impression after an hour of play:

I never played a total war game in my life, I also know next to nothing about warhammer I could never get into it. Just picked up the trilogy for like ¬£15 because I was itching to play a new strategy game but wanted something a bit different from the usual RTS games I play or Turn Based games like Civilization, played the prologue about an hour and I regret nothing so far. 

Best way I can describe this game, is everything I hated about civilization isn't present but everything I liked about it is there. It is hybrid turn based\rts so basically like 2 games in 1 game. Checked some videos on yt to see how hectic the game can get, and gotta say my mind is blown. Never seen a strategy game this epic in my life. It is also quite forgiving on new players it seems, explains its systems quite well in the prologue I don't feel overwhelmed at all. Seems very easy to pick up for a newbie. My favourite part about this game is you can zoom your camera right into the battle so close and the animations\detail in the battles are amazing, something a lot of strategy games do not let you do.

If you are like me and have been on the fence about this game for a while because the retail price for the trilogy is insane, you can get it for -86% discount right now on cdkeys. 100% worth the money, if you get the trilogy you get all the content from the first 2 games in warhammer 3 so it is totally worth it. Don't need to install the other 2, as long as you own them the content is unlocked in warhammer 3.

As for performance. i5-13600k, 4070 super running 1440p ultra recommended settings. Ran all benchmarks. Battle fps sits around 100, campaign fps sits around 90. So assuming you have a mid-range pc, you are fine. I have seen people with 8gb cards and 10th\11th gen intel cpu's running it ok so any of those people that are worrying about VRAM or older gen cpu's can rest easy, just be prepared to play in 1080p and maybe drop a few settings if you want a smooth experience.",2024-10-20T10:59:34Z,1

I understand many people enjoy the game, but for my part it's far too immersion breaking from every standpoint, it's systems are overly simplistic, and the ""unique"" elements of each ""faction"" only serve to make any desire to attempt other start locations off putting - if you like the mechanics of one faction you may hate others and rather than expanding upon the players desire to develop their own society they are forcibly locked into a predetermined playstyle with each faction.

Regardless of all that, Total War Warhammer is a game, it's sold well, and it's marketability as a result of whatever factors have been good for the developing company and publisher. I hope that a more down to earth and comprehensibly responsive design to player interaction is taken in titles going forwards.",2023-04-01T14:02:18Z,0

The motto for war is, why only feed your own cells with your blood, But the artists of the games for playing the worst of life as a little hobby dolls game on computers have reached such level of character that entire histories and cultures and civilisations and the myriad reasons why war happens could be written by those familiar with fantasy worlds just by nutting out eah species and their war fashion and attitude and completing the non-warrior aspects of their species and we could perhaps believe that they had something to defend if overpopulation caused them to begin to destroy so many other species that the childrens and adults fairy stories about principals and virtue and the symbiotic nature of nature and the sage wisdom and the many other lessons of life could be learnt off the battlefield. In fact I believe in a way we pump a lot of attention into these games until they can do more than combat which is quite simplistic really and done more like a sport with a morbid theme. I hope the culture is not too imbedded now to move on with the potential we all somewhere feel for computer games to greater things, great works of art and culture that may even transcend Earths own but if we don't destroy too many species may be able to be brought back to nature to show that life is best lived in love and learning and all the aching years of wage slavery and war and bad romance and abusive relationships has not been for nothing and that now we can finally live and truly truly weep when we are to die like cultures falling in love with the landscape used to before the whole epic project thing began on that first step thousands of years ago towards huge group projects of ""well we'll need to kidnap some people to do the physical work and enslave them and their descendants, we'll be finished in no time.""",2025-01-28T20:30:36Z,0

Khorne: Nobody likes playing as the Bloodbound, okay? The Bloodthirster has no proper stats or animations. 0/10.
Ogre Kingdoms: Boring combat experience, feels overpowered just for the sake of it. 0/10.
Greenskins: Ridiculously overhauled tech and economy. The unique personal quests they never had are still missing, and the mechanics are just barely passable. 1/10.

In conclusion: Players spend money on games to enjoy themselves, not to be ‚Äútaught how to play.‚Äù We buy DLCs to have fun, but does this DLC make players happy? No, it doesn‚Äôt.

83chO9NuWAg,@hellohowareyou8295,"Hey man, I love your game, definitely the best strategy game, but I think you need to focus on this bug patch than anything else. In Total War: Three Kingdoms, soldiers are able to fight effectively even when clustered together in melee combat. However, in Total War: Warhammer and other Total War games (excluding titles prior to Empire: Total War), soldiers often fail to engage when grouped tightly, leaving them vulnerable to enemy attacks and resulting in heavy losses. Please implement a patch to improve melee combat mechanics so units can perform as effectively as they do in Three Kingdoms. It is incredibly frustrating to see soldiers standing idle in close formations, unable to fight back and eventually getting wiped out. Additionally, when ordered to pursue retreating enemies, units often just follow them without engaging in attacks for an extended period. This is extremely frustrating. When enemy generals flee, it becomes nearly impossible to catch them with melee units unless you have long-range attacks, making it feel like melee units are at a severe disadvantage. This issue seems to stem from the same underlying mechanics, and it urgently needs to be fixed as well.",2024-12-01T17:57:46Z,0

tbE-0Gjz93M,@Mrdoughlicious,"Few more beginner tips, maybe some a little bit advanced:

1.) Trade Agreements. Get them with as many factions you can (that you don't plan on going to war with). These can double your income per turn, and you have zero military obligations to the factions you are trading with, other than not attacking them.

2.) Do NOT group your units too closely together. The AI likes to do this, but you should always spread all of your units out a little bit for a few reasons. a.) It makes units a little bit easier to see and control when in combat. b). It makes you hard to flank and c.) It prevents your entire army from being decimated by certain artillery and magic. Which brings me to my next tip:

3.) Magic! Understanding how and when to use magic, and how the winds of magic works, is definitely an advanced mechanic. But as a TWW3 player, you NEED to learn this. Magic can and will single handedly turn the tide of battles time and time again, and it is not uncommon to see wizards with 400+ kills after every battle. TL;DR: If you can put a wizard type hero in your army, do it. It is always worth it. Which brings me to my LAST tip:

4.) Heros! Heros are single entity units that can be placed in an army or used on the campaign map for functions your lord wouldn't do. Heros have MANY functions, but all heros level up just like your lords. They are incredibly versatile and can make both campaign and battles easier. Some heros can even destroy enemy cities without a battle (on the campaign map, looking at you Lord Kroak). They take up a unit slot in your army, but usually they are a worth it to place in your army as most of them are both potent in battle and buff your army in some way. 

I have over 3500 hours among the TW:WH games, and I think that covers most of the basic stuff. If I missed anything, please let me know. Have fun!",2023-03-14T16:17:28Z,161

Make sure that the individual units in your starting army are not completely wiped out early on.

If they fall, you cannot replace them with the same for the time being, which can make the early battles more difficult. If you take care of them and let them survive, they will also level up with each battle and become much stronger later in the game.
If you mess up in battle and get flanked, sometimes it's better to use some cheap, replaceable archers to bodyblock the flanking enemy and protect your more valuable range units (like artillery) until your meele units make it back to support.",2024-07-14T09:33:51Z,3

Elves in Warhammer tend to hide a lot of double-meanings in their words, statements that could read like a compliment could actually be a deep insult and many of them take great amusement at doing things like, especially if the other party doesn't know. Combine that with Thorgrim being highly suspicious of elven intentions, given the long, long history of bad blood between the two races, and it makes sense why he would immediately interpret it as an insult.

GK0JIp13MLc,@Michael-kd1ho,"It's funny that Dawi Zhar and Skaven weapons engineering, while both relying on Chaos sorcery, are completely diffrent at core. Chaos Dwarfs are still Dwarfs - they don't make shoddy, prone to break/explode things, while Clan Skryre contraptions usually kill half as many Skaven as the enemy. Basically - if it's made by a Dwarf, Chaos or not, it will work as intended. That's the main reason it's the Dawi Zhar, and not the Skaven, who supply the Chaos hordes with the vast majority of their artillery and war machines.

Skaven are physically weak, prone to laziness and treason, and may carry dangerous diseases - sometimes on purpose. As a result - taught by bitter experience - Skaven are, as a matter of policy, the only race Chaos Dwarfs would not enslave to work in their mines and forges. Any Skaven prisoners Chaos Dwarfs might take are simply executed.",2024-08-14T20:35:16Z,1

HAr7yUlM0Po,@angelscorrangell5371,"CA betrayed the real total wargamers. The franchise began with historical content games, and it should have continued like that. But the CA turned their back to the real total war players and kept releasing that Warhammer games. Actually, they can develop the Warhammer title, I've no problem with that, but where is Medieval III Total War? The latest two historical total war entries were disastrous. Thankfully, we have some good modders, even being CA completely failing about historical content, at least we found some consolation with these mods. Such as Medieval Kingdoms1212.
Edit: Do me a favor Warhammer fans. Apparently, none of you played historical total war games before considerably. So don't come up with rubbish childish replies. As a ""mature"" total war player, I  share my thoughts based on my experiences. (For example, I've got a ""Caesar Reborn"" achievement on Total War Attila. According to the steam statistics, there is only 0.01 percent of players have that achievement.) And I don't see any bright future for historical content anymore. CA is entirely messing up on this.

Harald was originally named ""Uthmog Elvenbane,"" and the name for Harald internally among GW was ""Harry the Hammer,"" said internal name eventually leading to becoming ""Harald Hammerstorm"". I'm unsure exactly when the Harald Hammerstorm name became the canon, but I know this: Harald Hammerstorm was the primary inspiration for Sigmar Heldenhammer. Harald's Warhammer is even officially named ""The Hammer of Harry"" as a callback to that internal name.

IuqF7U6jX44,@SpicyFuecoco,"I hard disagree that refraining from using pause/slow-motion will make you a better player. In fact, I would go so far as to go in the opposite direction and saying that playing in Slow-Motion will actually HELP you improve. And refusing to pause will actually make you a WORSE player.

When you start doing weight-lifting, you don't immediately start off with bench-pressing an entire car. When you learn martial-arts, you take things slowly at first, to make sure you've got things right, and reinforced good muscle-memory, then speed up over time.

When ever you find yourself in a situation, and don't know what to do, PAUSE THE GAME IMMEDIATELY. Stop and think about the situation, and find the best solution to that situation.

Let's say you just charged your cavalry into the enemy's rear. But then you spot a unit of spearmen who are about to crush your cavalry between a wall of spears and the unit you just flanked. What do you do in that situation? If your answer is to panic and lose all your cavalry, then you will never get better because you will ALWAYS panic and lose all your cavalry in that situation. Then bemoan the fact that you are bad at the game.

Only when you have gotten good at playing the game paused/in slow-motion should you then take what you've learned, and practice and reinforce those tactics and strategies in real time. If you practice in increments, getting faster and faster, eventually you may be able to play the game at 3x Speed.",2024-12-16T07:23:46Z,1

IuqF7U6jX44,@DSzaks,"I don't think playing on slow mo/pause makes you a worse player. Maybe in multiplayer sure. But just playing the campaigns I don't think it make a differences. Sure you might be slower to react, but you have longer to react anyway so.... at worst its just cancels out. And pausing gives you infinite time to react so there is literally no downside to that in single player, unless you really want to play on legendary battle difficulty. But if not it's fine. Also don't think the hotkeys for spells are really important since, again, if you pause you have infinite time to waste dragging your mouse anywhere you want. Just comes down to what kind of pace the player prefers.

The formation and movement type hotkeys however are really important to know though. When I learned about those it practically blew my mind. Couple other good pointers are multi clicking orders for units because for some reason they programmed the unit AI pathing to disregard half your orders if you don't keep inputting over and over again, especially if your trying to move a unit out of combat. Also be wary of locking formation on unit groups as it does some really weird things to unit attack orders, especially on missile units if you trying to get them all to shoot at something specific.

Another great tip is turn off freaking skirmish mode on ALL your units. Best bet is to go in the option and just have it off by default. Could have been a great feature, but the problem is that it completely overrides any order you give the unit. So if there is any enemy w/o 2 miles of a unit they just become completely uncontrollable, and if your new and don't know why a unit won't listen to you it can be really frustrating.

On a nitpicky note you can waste earthblood if you cast it on units already at full health. This can be a little tricky because even if a units health bar isn't full they can still be at full health. Because each model in a unit has it's own health and if some of them are dead it will show a depleted health bar even if all the other models in the unit are completely undamaged. So if your trying to heal and the hp isn't going up this is probably why. This is why healing is best used on big high hp units w/ low or single model counts as apposed most infantry units. Also if you see a little gold line at the end of the health bar it means they have hit their healing limit and can't be healed any more that battle.",2024-10-10T06:11:39Z,0

May I offer an alternative?

Taking the entirety of Grand Cathay will eat up time that you've said you want to spend retaking Naggaroth and Ulthuan, and you'll have to defend that land from invasions from the North and West.

Instead, take the coasts/large river provinces.  For the rest of Cathay, ally or vassalize (I don't know if Delves can vassalize) another Cathay faction, probably Zhao Ming.  Your inland flanks will then be covered by this ally while you traverse the seas.  You'll get access to Cathayan recruitment to make Lokhir's army a bit more exotic.  

You could RP it off as ""By taking the entirety of the Cathayan coast, the Krakenlord has proved his dominance of the region.  However, he has no personal interest in the inner governing of a vast land of humans when dominating all Druchii and Asur kind are at his fingertips.  Thus, he managed to convince the mentally unstable Zhao Ming that he will 'protect' the Cathay coastline for a 'small' fee of gold, ivory and slaves...""",2024-09-05T08:57:21Z,2

Fjb_zJxw1lo,@warcrafthumanlord,"I'll be honest my learning curve for total war warhammer went like this (I did play Shogun previously but a long time ago)

1. I started with Warhammer II since it was the cheaper option and I wanted to play Skaven
2. I played Skaven and was really frustrated since those little buggers run off if the enemy even sneezes in their general direction
3. I tried to cheese the game by going all in on artillery and ranged units, which worked fine until I started fighting the wood elves (blasted pointy ears) which just outgun you
4. At that point I progressed very little on the campaign map in 30-40 hours of playtime I barely had 3-4 full provinces, fighting skirmish wars in the desert, the jungle and the mainland
5. I quit Skaven because it wasn't as fun especially when fighting against Bretonnia cavalry or the ranged wood elves (my tactic to win against the wood elves was to use the engineer, make undercities and then blow them up from within).

6. I then wanted to try and play as the vampire coast as I liked the concept of undead (and didn't like vampire counts since they didn't have ranged). Also since I spent a lot of time at Sea as the Skaven I thought it would be a cool way to play just jumping from province to province, taking easy settlements and getting money through sea treasure piles. I bought the DLC and I thought I would enjoy it however after starting as Noctilus it just didn't feel right. I can't put my finger on it, but the units just felt off. So I stopped that campaign

7. I then bought warhammer 1 for the factions it gives in warhammer 2, (it was on 90% sale) and decided what the hell why not play the dwarves. For the first time I actually enjoyed playing warhammer 2. The dwarves had these cool battle callouts, they were really grumpy and moody, even down to the nice echoey way the lord tells the orc army in front to sodd off when he is in a dwarf fortress on the campaign map (reminds me of the hobbit scene). I picked the Ironbrow expedition as I liked the desert setting and I actually enjoyed myself, finished the long campaign with them. Basically having a large chunk of the map under my control and then military alliances with all the dwarves and the empire.
8. The dwarves helped me learn the rock paper scissors of warhammer (different units matchups and who wins what) also due to their resilience it actually allowed me to play with the army at large instead of constantly micromanaging my front line. The dwarves also made it very apparent how the lack of cavalry and monster units were detrimental to them, I even did the hammer and anvil tactics (which I thought of on my own, without looking at tutorials) using the slayers. And it worked fine but I thought It would be better if I had faster units. This prompted me to get Ogre camps and get cavalry from them, which was a major success.

9. After enjoying and finishing the dwarves I wanted to try and play the undead again, I avoided the vampire counts again and decided to buy the tomb kings DLC. Then since most of their factions are in the desert (and I already played in that area as the dwarves) I decided to pick the Exhiles of Nehek and fight against the dark elves in the north west (since they were pretty much the only faction I didn't get to fight as the dwarves since they were on the other side of the map). The tomb kings were nice, they had their own mechanic and relied on free units and instead working with unit/lord caps. Played that for a few hours, I beat Malekith and decided to call that a win and end their campaign. This allowed me to play with magic and chariots, as well as teaching me to micromanage my magic power reserve.

10. At this point I wasn't drawn in any of the races available in wh1/2 and the DLC's. I though maybe lizardmen, but in the end decided to buy Wh3 and try Grand Cathay. I played the intro scenario and got hooked on the whole demon prince story line. I played the demon prince which was super hard, a lot of unit choices with very different synergies and a lot of options (except the lack of good artillery). In the end I finished the short campaign as the demon prince and was pretty satisfied overall. I liked the customization but felt like his skill tree and lack of items really hold the lord back compared to other legendary lords. This gave me skills to play the flying units and use them to harass the ranged enemies. As well as teaching me the various different abilities and spells (since you get those depending on body parts)

11. Since I played a lot with Khorn units as the demon prince I decided to play as Khorn next, specifically Skarbrand (since I liked the Exalted Bloodthirster which in the end came close to be equal or maybe even stronger than my legendary demon prince lord). Skarbrand starts in the desert again (which was a bit disappointing to be honest) but at least the faction starting locations shuffled a bit. Playing as Skarbrand upped my lord micro managing as well as going full in on the flesh hounds and cycle charging. I am close to finishing that short campaign as well, I cleared the desert from vampires and Orcs, currently in the process of cleaning up the humans. Skarbrand so far was the hardest campaign mostly due to being surrounded by enemy factions and relying on being very aggressive in combat (usually I play defensively) but he gets progressively easier with the blood host that just start piling up as you go, however it forces you to constantly be at war as their economy is almost non-existant and relies heavily on raiding, combat and sacking settlements.


In short I actually enjoy warhammer now and it was because of the dwarves, I don't agree with this video since I think you shouldn't avoid them. What you should avoid however is just sticking to one faction. Play one, see its strengths and weaknesses then you can jump to another faction which is the polar opposite, or just a faction you think has cool units. In the end you will probably find what works for you and then play with that.",2025-01-10T17:06:15Z,0

Fjb_zJxw1lo,@Mercaerts,"tbh i would suggest trying out factions in skirmish and just using what you like

It plays completely differently from other total war gamez

Just as much as ""get used to the basic units of infantry, cavalry, and archers"" is good advice ""Get used to monsterous infantry, artilery, and flying units"" is just as good advice

Don't treat this like a total war game, there are not really formations and stuff like that, you really gotta focus on the strengths of a faction.

Dwarves can be assaulters if you build them right and there are dwarf factions that are harder to play like iron hand and his slayers and they have airborne units to make up for the lack of their land speed and the slayers are their form of flankers. Sure, they're not as fast as the horsemen of britania or the empire but for the dwarves they work fine as flankers for their tactics.

Elves are a good faction to learn the basics with but they're almost too basic imo, like they have little flare, i personally think the empire is a good fit because it teaches people to utilize their specialty units such as cav, arty, and heros. It also teaches them to match up unit types against their best suited targets.

Sure those swordsmen got steamrolled by those monsterous infantry, but like that is the same with the elves swordsmen, if they were empire halberds they would have held the line well because they are matched for those units

Empire is a solid faction for learning how to play warhammer, maybe not total war games in general, but like, it's warhammer no other total war game has literally 70% of the units that this has",2024-12-19T18:30:55Z,0

Fjb_zJxw1lo,@Eagleye735495,"I'm sure this video is full of good information, but there's a couple things I have discrepancies with.

2:55 - I could be wrong, but artillery (Helstorm Rockets featured here) is a higher tier weapon meaning you have to work up to them. You'll get your opportunity to play with ""infantry and cavalry and using all your units properly"" while you progress up toward them.

3:23 - Not being reliant on ""experimenting with aggressive builds"" or different tactics is absolutely perfect for a new player who is probably just trying to come to grips with moving an army around in general. Saying that's bad for a new player because once they play any other faction it'll be different is like saying the Huns from Age of Empires 2 are a bad beginner civilization because they don't need to build houses. New players have enough on their minds in both of those games. Not needing to remember to build houses or command cavalry in Warhammer is actually a good thing to help them zone in on getting to grips with other things. After a Dwarf player feels comfortable enough with the bare basics they can hop on over to something like Bretonnia if they want to then focus on cavalry. 

I think you're taking the wrong angle here when it comes to how to ease new players into the game. I think this is a case of an experienced person forgetting where they themselves started from.",2024-11-18T00:13:03Z,1

Fjb_zJxw1lo,@tombkings6279,"The Tomb Kings, known as the Priest Kings in their former lives, are the undying rulers of Nehekhara, an ancient Human civilisation that formed a great and powerful empire some two thousand five hundred years before the birth of Sigmar Heldenhammer and the founding of the Empire. Out of all the unliving creatures that would claim dominion and royalty over the dead, only the Tomb Kings could truly claim such masterful and undisputed sovereignty. For they had once ruled a mighty and far-flung empire during a time when the rest of Mankind were little more than savage barbarians.

Long ago, during an ancient and forgotten age, Nehekhara stood as a shining beacon of civilisation and Human achievement; a golden age when its cities shone with a majestic splendour, its buildings crafted from magnificent marble and limestone, its armies capable of conquering entire kingdoms. In this long-lost age, Nehekhara's mighty rulers reigned as living gods amongst men. But this great realm was destroyed millennia ago through acts of great treachery and powerful sorcery. The living of Nehekhara perished long ago in a single, mournful night, and in their absence, the dead stirred from their graves and claimed the land anew.

Even as their ancient civilisation now lies buried beneath the sand, its once verdant plains turned to searing desert and their mighty and glorious empire fractured and in ruin, the Tomb Kings have once more awoken from their deep sleep. Rising from their decrepit sarcophagi, the mummified rulers of Nehekhara awoke with eyes of burning balefire, their thirst for power, conquest and vengeance just as strong in death as in life.

They have returned to reclaim that which is rightfully theirs, their legions innumerable, rising up from the scorching sand brandishing weapons of polished bronze and priceless gold. Ancient, emotionless and spiteful to all those that have slighted them, woe betide those foolish enough to stand before their silent onslaught.",2024-11-14T18:34:53Z,0

Fjb_zJxw1lo,@Trihahalos,"My two cents here...

1.) Tyrion and basically any high elf campaign is easy. 

2.) Gor-Rok is ok. Last defenders is also easy. They got 3/4 secure flanks and Kalida and the vampires are a joke. And then you got a strong base to stomp the world. Oxyotl is also a beast but ok, you gotta have half a brain to play with him.

3.) I would not rate any chaos dwarf as easy to play. They are a very strong faction but they are not easy. They need patience, you gotta be able to face early-mid game with armies that field a lot of crap units and a handful of elites. You don't need to be a genius player but you gotta know some stuff about the game to do that. Plus they got a lot of mechanics and they get attacked from all sides in higher difficulties. 

4.) Kairos... ehm... ehm... True he got genuinely one of the best starting armies and early tzeench armies absolutely stomp opposition (if you got the right DLC). However... They got no economy and you will have to make the most of that early advantage because they are coming for you from all sides. Oxyotl is no joke and the the rest of your opponents are no joke either. And they will outnumber you. To make a joke out of the campaign you need to know how to play and also how to utilize your powers. 

5.) Kislev? Really? No. Just no. All Kislev campaigns are brutal. No two ways about it. You will be attacked from all sides, you will have to face some of the toughest enemies at once. And you got no allies. Your army is ok but warriors of chaos are better and their heroes are stronger. All Kislev campaigns are genuinely among the hardest ones. If there is a single noob that can last more than 20 turns in one, I have yet to meet this person. If you are new to the game, for your own sake, please stay away from Kislev. These campaigns are hard even for people that easily win other campaigns. 

My suggestions

1.) Any high elf. Especially on the island. You beat everyone, noone can touch you. Profit. 

2.) Any beastman. Especially Taurox. Read his mechanics for 5 minutes. Build the best units you can. Point and click. Win. Repeat. Many times. 

3.) Last defenders. Solid flanks. Solid army. Easy opponents. Advance and dominate. 

4.) Grimgor. He is a damage dealer and a tank at the same time. And starting orcs are very good. Just attack and steamroll opposition. He will snowball too. Grom is also supposedly easy but the AI is too aggressive against him and you got 3 opponents in turn 3 or something. If you manage to beat that, you are good though. All the orcs are decently easy anyway.

5.) Archaon. Is there anything that can stop him really? The answer is no. 

6.) Ikkit claw. Just do it. The other skaven are not that hard either (ok maybe the rat ogre guy is). But Ikkit is a beast. And his capital is one of the best cities on the map. If not the best. 

Noob traps

1.) No Skarbrand. He can be a beast in turn 5 or something. But you absolutely gotta know what you are doing to achieve that. If you don't, you got a constantly underlevelled lord, chasing his tail and pondering why you lack the funds for even one stack when everyone got like 3-4.

2.) No chaos demons of any kind. They need their mechanics to be good. And their starting positions are not easy. 

3.) No empire. That is accurate. Though our man Karl has received a buff and the rest are in a better state too. 

4.) No Brettonia. Many will be attracted to the knights aesthetic. Brettonia is really lackluster though and it will disappoing most new players.",2024-10-11T17:10:54Z,1

J'ai environ 1000h sur le 3 mais je cumule plus de 2500h sur les 2 pr√©c√©dents.
Le jeu est plut√¥t bon, le jeu offre une tr√®s bonne jouabilit√© et rejouable et une vari√©t√©s de gameplay et une richesse ind√©niable. 

Mais je suis plut√¥t d√©√ßu d'une part par un lancement d√©cevant et un d√©veloppement chaotique pendants des mois ! (que CA s'efforce plus ou moins de corriger).
Et d'autre part le partie pris par CA au niveau de la difficult√© du jeu ! le joueur est trop buff√© et l'IA √† la ramasse depuis le d√©but :/
Pour un joueur occasionnel cela offre un d√©fi mais pour un joueur confirm√© c'est plut√¥t niveau bac √† sable ! m√™me en l√©gendaire ou TD.

FRANCHEMENT la politique du DLC est la moins pire des mod√®les √©conomiques du JV ! Rien n'oblige d'acheter tout DLCs et  day one !
Sachant qu'il y a tr√®s r√©guli√®rement des soldes sur steam ou autres.
Par contre je d√©plore la direction de CA au sujet du contenu annexes des DLC pour d√©bloquer 1 unit√© dans certaines autres factions que le DLC de base, il faut 1 DLC en particulier ! sachant qu'il faut plusieurs DLC pour avoir les 2-3 unit√©s compl√©mentaires soit 2-3 DLC !


PS : question Hardware üòâ

 je rajouterais deux points perso (600h de jeu) j'ai commenc√© en 2023 les ttw  en commencant directement par les warhammer donc en vrai je suis un joueur ""r√©cent"". 

Je suis pas d'accord sur la politique commerciale. Franchement par rapport √† d'autres studio je trouve pas la politique commerciale d√©lirante. il y a tellement de contenu ... All√© pour 100‚Ç¨ tu peux avoir l√©galement la plupart des seigneurs et factions int√©ressantes √† jouer. Et je parle m√™me pas des outils de modding. Certes les moddeurs sont hyper d√©ter et c'est trop cool, mais c'est aussi gr√¢ce au studio qui leur met en place des vrais outils et leurs permet plein de choses. La vid√©o les compare √† Activision franchement c'est rude. pour avoir jouer √† beaucoup de leurs jeux il y a quand m√™me moins d'abus sur ttw.  honnetement activision pourraient fusionner plusieurs de leurs calls of en un seul pour essayer de faire un jeu un peu ultime comme ttw warhammer, mais ils le vendraient 100e de plus m√™me si t'avais les jeux pr√©c√©dents.

Et pour les d√©fauts :  pour moi le seul d√©faut r√©ellement g√™nant, les autres me d√©rangent pas (par exemple l'ia il suffit de te mettre en embuscade et il arr√™te de te fuir la plupart du temps)
pour moi le gros d√©faut du jeu c'est surtout que pass√© 15 / 20 provinces en ta possession √ßa devient vraiment une usine √† gaz √† g√©rer. √ßa manque d'outil de gestion pour les items, les provinces, les arm√©es, les ordres de provinces... franchement pas pouvoir faire de file d'attente de construction de b√¢timents dans un jeu ou le but c'est de contr√¥ler la carte enti√®re c'est d√©lirant je trouve. j'ai pas beaucoup explor√© les mods √† ce niveau l√† peut etre qu'il y en a.

Ce qui m'a aid√© √† profond√©ment renouveler l'exp√©rience sur l'ensemble c'est les mods, un en particulier qui retouche √©norm√©ment de choses. J'entend par l√† SFO : Grimhammer 3 (2 pour TWW2). Le mode √©quilibre l'IA, les races, retouches des statistiques, ajoute des talents, des b√¢timents, unit√©s et m√™me des m√©caniques, le tout en restant coh√©rent avec lore de Warhammer. Pour moi c'est ce qui m'a fortement aid√© √† rester aussi longtemps sur TW Warhammer car m√™me si je fais une pause de 2 mois par exemple, les patchs, ajouts, mods etc continuent d'enrichir le jeu de mani√®re ph√©nom√©nale et me font toujours revenir dessus.

When a rat becomes infected with the parasite (usually by coming into contact with cat feces), it alters its behavior, and instead of avoiding the smell of cats the rat is attracted to it. This allows the protozoa to complete its life cycle, as eventually the cat-loving rat gets killed and devoured by a cat, allowing the parasite to infect a new cat's digestive tract. Scientists discovered that the ""loves the smell of cats"" effect also works on humans infected with toxoplasmosis...and that the areas with the largest infection rates of toxoplasmosis are also the areas with the highest number of pet cats per capita. In short, cats are using a mind-altering parasite to enslave the human population.",2024-07-12T19:00:11Z,1

I know it‚Äôs early to talk about mods and, especially since it‚Äôs your first Nurgle campaign you should play it as vanilla as possible in terms of Nurgle specific mechanics. 
If you‚Äôre interested later in the campaign there are some mods to make plagues more interesting and cults better as, at least imo, Nurgle has maybe the worst cult buildings.  The plague mod by shadow521, it may be a bit OP‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs been fun and I enabled it after I set a certain goal in my campaign (confederating Kugath and Epidemius).  
But I love making a plague cultist with the attrition and siege debuffs and sending him into an area I‚Äôm about to conquer to weaken it as I send my armies through. 
There‚Äôs also a nice lore mod that will give you some info/background on places, units, and characters. I don‚Äôt read all of them, but the story of tamurkhan was interesting and it gave you the story little by little as you conquered territory.",2024-07-12T14:13:20Z,0

7Y9lzEpOcTA,@GideonGleeful95,"Fun Nurgle Fact:
So the Beasts of Nurgle are actually really happy and excitable and really just want to play and/or have a hug, but while they do so, they squish their ne friends/toys and cause them to rot and vomit with their aura. When they are slain, they are sent confused, scared and in pain back into the Aethyr (warp basically) and then pupate like caterpillars or beetle larvae, their fear turning to hatred. When they emerge, they are Rotflies (the plague drone mounts) and have a much more hatful demeanour. These rotflies usually kill by plucking the heads off enemies, which are semi-digested and turned into the death heads that are thrown by some plague bearers (including those who mount them). However, if they ever find the person who original killed them in their Beast of Nurgle form, they will eat them whole and that person will spend eternity in their abdomen, digesting but never dying.",2024-07-11T20:18:01Z,127

9ZrEO2-WknQ,@Razielts1,"3:20 Not necessarily. Armies that are static on home provinces can be useful due to the fact that lords that stay a few turns in a province while building get the builder, up to architect trait ( name is changed in warhammer 3 ).

 This increases economy by 7% and also reduces building costs for the same amount, so while recruiting, or even just building without enemies it isnt bad not to use the armies.

This is the reason why i build heroes to be hybrid, cuz while the army is static, the heroes are killing other heroes, spying and stealing technology.

5:20 to add to this specific point, in wh3 they made it so that public order also contributes to growth, so you wanna rush both. In factions that have corruption, you also want to rush corruption in addition to growth and control ( public order in wh3 ).",2023-01-13T21:25:35Z,1

gUimmwuJszU,@SirTayluh,"Kairos's start location is a letter cost in itself. Oxyotl only gets a pass for being in the southern chaos wastes because he teleports out of it. He'd be fun if he was anywhere else imo, but the race does need alot of love. Although imo all the demons still suck on the campaign side of the game, if fun in battle. I seriously think all of them need a serious economy buff. Their race abilities in campaign are cool, but you never feel like you're making the money you should be. The literal ""end of the world"" factions feel like beastmen level of ""nuisances at best""

I love v.coast but they definitely need love. I would love to see the wh2 campaign implemented for them, doing the quest battle and getting some kind of reward for beating the other 3 factions. Maybe an army ability when fighting on a port settlement or something, idk.

Honestly, I think one of the things that I'd love to see before the end of wh3 that I haven't seen anyone else talk about is one final map update. Make places like the jungle not a pain in the ass to move through EVEN for the jungle factions. Maybe do one final reorganizing of start locations. Not alot, but maybe for lords that were clearly placed somewhere because that's where space was instead of reason to be there. Malus and Kairos both at the very least. Or give them both some teleport mechanic if they must stay. Both the northern and southern chaos wastes are bad start locations, either make them good i.e. expand them a bit, maybe add the demon realms from Realms of Chaos, or make it a ""safe staging ground"" and give them some way to get into the rest of the map faster, if not faction mechanics, then water teleport routes or something of the like. Maybe expand some places, ind/khuresh, even if its just more cathay land, maybe put kairos there since kairos/tzeentch and cathay have been together alot in marketing. Or put zhatan down there and give kairos the wall to fight like in the ads. I'd love something for the water but idk what to do there so don't expect anything, but making it more interesting would be nice. Maybe give the galleons graveyard something more interesting as a location related to how cool it is lorewise. The lore for it is so neat yet theres nothing there specific about it besides immunity to ocean attrition I think, and iirc only for non coast factions who conquer it. MAKE THE GRAND CATHAY WALL MORE INTERESTING ITS NOWHERE NEAR AS COOL AS IT COULD BE.

I could go on, but you get the idea as far as the map onceover goes. More landmarks, rearrange some things like start locations or change the map to make bad ones work bc someone has to be there. Those little 'i's' on the map that give you info when you rollover them could be added a bit more for lore nuts like me.

Finally, a rework of the ""endgame crisis"" system. It was made to solve a real problem but needs to be redone/worked on. For example, they shouldnt spawn in your territory specifically, if I roll skaven and I have the mountains from karak kadrin down to thorgrims start, I shouldn't have queek spawn in the middle of my settlements/land, that doesnt make sense. But tretch certainly bc ""i dont own that settlement, idk whats going on over there"". Possibly make the end crisis ""smart"" in a way instead of a roll. By this I mean, when the end crisis comes, have the ai determine which races still standing are the strongest and then do the buff/armies thing for them instead of reviving dead factions. If they're an ally, still war. It doesn't have to be single race either. If I'm playing demons, make it the ordertide. If I'm orks, the chorfs or the dwarves or the skaven or all three. Have it either be the strongest remaining races or your races mortal enemies or something. Unless you play karl specifically, then make every other race the endgame crisis (mostly a joke)",2025-02-18T15:04:10Z,0

gUimmwuJszU,@Monochromatic_Spider,"Don't know how Tomb Kings ended up in S tier or how VCoast ended up in B tier. Both suck.

TK because the start is so boring. Once you get them set up and actually have units to recruit, it really opens up a lot but early game you're just pounding sand. Literally.

VCoast because everything is slow. It's supposed to be undead dwarfy gunlines but there's no proper holding infantry that actually does that job reasonably well, the artillery is pretty bad since the AI is so good at dodging, the magic isn't overwhelming, the raw numbers approach is undermined a bit by the loyalty nonsense, their economy isn't all that great, the pirate cove mechanic was nerfed into oblivion, and you can't even go full undead zerker rush army because you just don't have the right units for it. 

And you can't hero spam because heroes are tied to pirate coves, which means the more factions you kill, the less heroes you can have. And of course you can't confed other pirate lords either. But at least you've got absolutely useless treasure maps. And infamy that you can't really use for much of anything!!

Putting either of those above Kairos feels a bit biased. Kairos actually isn't all that bad. Not the greatest campaign but it's not that bad. Changeling, on the other hand...",2025-02-17T23:58:13Z,0

gUimmwuJszU,@jasonquigley2633,"I think you were too hard on Kislev. They're in better shape than the other factions in C rank.

The first thing is they have an interesting varied army roster with unique lores of magic that complement their playstyle. They do need a bit more (maybe some more interesting elite infantry options, as they're supposed to be an infantry faction and shadows of change mostly gave monsters).

What I think sets them apart is they have one of the more interesting start positions. The core region of Kislev has a lot of flavour (the big 3 cities are fun to build up), and your campaign can easily go in many different directions.

What's lacking is that their campaign mechanics are iffy (they're hinting at a Kislev update, so we'll see how that pans out), and they're lacking in generic lord and hero variety.  For example they have no duelist, tank or archer heroes, all of which would fit the faction.",2025-02-17T23:32:27Z,3

gUimmwuJszU,@Canuovea,"Player inserts are odd? I mean, c'mon, whose first thought wasn't: ""Oh cool, I can make my own leader character and trick their models out? Sweet!"" Okay, maybe not everyone thought that...

Dark Elves need Murderous Prowess redone. Lokhir is still their best lord, though. Not sure what units could be added in a DLC for them...

High Elves are missing content from their actual armybook, and Martial Prowess should probably not depend on unit losses and instead only be active to the front (so not functioning against flankers). It'd make them more interesting to both play and fight in battle, which would help with how they can feel sort of fire and forgetty.

Elspeth is probably the most fun Legendary Lord in the game right now. Empire is great. 

Wood Elves are great, but Araloth would be nice to give a LL that actually plays like an Elf. More importantly, perhaps, the fact that you can only have one ritual of rebirth going at once makes the long campaign feel very artificially stretched. It's not good.

Bretonnia needs a huge rework and bandit units.
Chaos dwaves need a 4th lord, away from the 3 current ones.
Daniel needs to have a tech tree and real skill lines.
Dark elves need the same slave management UI as chaos dwarves, morathi needs more slaneesh stuff, just deamonettes is lame.
Dwarves need uniques mecanics for every lords, not just belegar. CA really missed the mark on that.
Cathay needs a lot of things, uniques mecanics for the first two lords, a better compass mecanic, a better great wall mecanic, a better harmony mecanic (where you don't get negatives in the local harmony of a settlement but you have a global harmony that adds all the harmony of your settlements and needs to stay... in harmony at all time, otherwise, you get very nasty negatives)
Greenskins have the same problem as dwarves, every one of their lords badly needs a mecanic.
High elves needs both mecanics for lords, a complete rework of their influence mecanic and sea caravans (+give alarielle something actually interesting to do)
Tzeentch needs to have two lords others than kairos (changeling doesn't exist atm, he's a debug mode when played and doesn't do anything as an AI) and a tech tree that doesn't smell like nurgle's ass
Khorne is fine
Nurgle is fine
Slaneesh need stuff but we'll see after their dlc, I see this faction as kind of in limbo right now
Kislev is horrible. bring oztankya where arbaal is and move arbaal anywhere you want, give ancient widow anything (summon, transformation, anything), change every single mecanics they have either to make it finally good or just throw them into the garbage bin. give the three first lors their unique emcanics (the ice court mecanic could be reworked into a unique mecanic for katarin if better fleshed out and less random, for example)
Lizardmen have the dwarves/greenskins problem + daniel problem. lord unique mecanics and a tech tree that doesn't make you want to end your life. even the settlement buildings need to be reworked into something usable. And make the webway into something that actually exist.
Norsca... Idk man, at least fix the bugged hunts?
Ogre kingdoms is fine
Skaven obviously needs more-more love. Never-never enough attention. Joke aside, just give cool mecanics for the first 3 lords and we're good.
Empire, volkmar and  markus need reworks to their mecanics... where is boris? wtf?
Tomb kings needs a full rework and a tech tree overall, the're terrible to play because of how slow their gameplay is compared to everybody else. You're technically prevented to play the game for the first 15 turns (except for arkhan, who start with two armies slots) and it feels terrible. garbage. horrible. I just want to have fun playing as my mummy mommy, please!
Vampire coasts needs a better undercity mecanic, they have the worst one in the game, omg. also a buff to their gunpowder units. and make aranessa more unique (as in, living faction, no vampire corruption, living units)
Vampire counts join the club of races where every lords need a unique mecanic + the red duke is RIGHT HERE! why can't I play him? wtf?

gUimmwuJszU,@IlBuonDiavolo131313,"a couple of thoughts : 

**BRETONNIA:** their Lords NEED something unique for each,

Something that makes their infantry more viable, possibly something like a ""Sergeant-at-Arms"" that boosts paesants, maybe some more ""fanatic units"" like more Battle Pilgrims variants. Also Knights-on-Foot, we NEED THEM!

**EMPIRE:** a biiit more focus to the ""Faith"" aspects of the Empire wouldn't hurt, as i feel it's not aknowledged as it should be.
Knightly Orders and the ""Chapter Master"" generic Lord would be such welcome additions! 

**HIGH ELVES:** like you said, Teclis and Tyrion need something unique for them, and the ""High Elf Influence"" mechanic needs some SERIOUS rework. 8 times out of 10 i barely feel like it's there.

**KISLEV:**  they need some SERIOUS rework,
The ""Support Race"" should feel less like a ""race"" to the top, and more like an ever-shifting battle for the hearts of Kislevite peoples.

Could probably go even harder on his focuses (like give him a unique landmark or skill that buffs ogre mercs stats factionwide).

A lot of the ""vanilla"" factions can be easily fixed by fixing up the race as a whole a bit and make the race mechanics a bit smoother and then give each of them a strong focus.

Their infantry crumbles quickly vs almost anything. Once you get questing knights, they do alright as a front line unless you‚Äôre going against a bunch of halberds, and then grail units are amazing after their buff a couple years ago.

Omens of Destruction is less than Thrones of Decay but still leagues better than Shadows of Change. It's a good title with some minor issues as explained in the video above. CA need to explain why these DLC's are taking so long as this doesn't feel as BIG as Thrones was.
The plus side is the DLC keeps to the sameish quaity (although a bit smaller) as Thrones and that means the mistakes of Shadows of Change have been learnt.

You can build 10 of these all up which give stacking -5% cooldown reduction faction wide for Big and Little Waaagh spells. This adds up to -50% cooldown reduction faction wide. Then Wurrzag gives another -10% reduction faction wide bringing total cooldown reduction to -60%. 

Each caster can get another -20% cooldown reduction by putting full talent points into the skill tree for the spell, eg. Foot of Gork. That's -80% cooldown reduction all up.

This makes Wurrzag's faction a powerhouse casting faction.

QnjSpdmA-Lk,@MasterOfBaiter,I am curious to play skull taker. Khorne in general is very much a general hater where you just want to fight it doesn't really matter who since it matters not where the blood comes from so in practice I was more just going to the closest fight rather than any other specific considerations. Meanwhile skull taker is a more exquisite taste he is not just a hater he is THE hater. A hater that is very specific about his hatering and thus would push you to move in specific directions rather than just being a natural catastrophe destroying indiscriminately like skarbrand.,2024-12-11T09:20:57Z,0

I think if that‚Äôs going to remain possible then the game should force a reinforcement battle before the main battle where your lone unit is isolated until your main army can join in - thus your diversionary unit would have to face a whole army by themselves for about two minutes until your army could join - at the same time as their reinforcing stack. IRL you‚Äôd just sally forth and crush them, you wouldn‚Äôt just stand there on the ramparts cursing the siege of one bloke on a horse! üòÇ",2024-11-12T07:18:11Z,0
cTKs2Be9Lz8,@cyphi474,"One on strategical level. You can initiate war between two factions that doesnt like each other much, by selling settlement to one side thats in province held by another. AI will always fight for full province control(unless they are ideologically alligned, dwarfs-dwarfs, elves-elves, etc.), so if settlement is held by another unfriendly faction, its very likelly they will try fight for it. It might take bit time, but it can give you time to deal with another threat first. Its not without risks, they will hate you for selling settlement to enemy, but if both sides are strong, they will get stuck in that war for while.
You can groom some friendly faction to protect your border that way. Just keep grabbing what they lost and sell it back to them, so they can regrow again and be thorn in your enemy side without direct need for Deffensive or Military aliance that can push you into wrong war at the wrong time(looking at you, Ogres).
And its very profitable aswell. You can make tons of money selling settlements to rich factions like Vampires. Carstein Bank is always open.",2024-10-15T12:26:44Z,3

You don't need to control territory to win, just occupy raze or loot lots of different locations usually. So just keep a few provinces and let the overpowered AI ally manage the territory with their 20 full stack armies..

In Warhammer 2 I make sure they have magic items/gear already on em before I dismiss them to the reserves, W3 you don't have to worry since you can instantly transfer items to a lord.

cTKs2Be9Lz8,@scorch6297,"Honestly, I‚Äôm at the point where I think auto resolve has become too strong.

Even if you get a pyrrhic victory, auto-resolve will typically destroy the entire enemy army, whereas a victory of the same nature that you fought might end up with several units escaping to hide, encamp and reinforce/replenish or BOTH if against certain factions.

Why risk it? Just auto resolve, wipe the army out and take the minor losses compared to wiping out an entire enemy army stack. Or more since I've been finding that I'll often get Heroic Victories for auto resolve.

This might be controversial, but the old Auto Resolve system was a dice roll system for a reason. It forced you to fight your most crucial of battles while allowing you to handwave the trivial and less consequential ones.",2024-03-01T11:30:59Z,28
cTKs2Be9Lz8,@detorrV2,"About the point #2, only single entitites leave with the same health they had in battle. Multientity units leave with the models they had in battle but each fully healed. So if a unit of minos flee with 11 models out of 12 they will have 90% of the health the next time no matter how beaten up they were in battle. 
Also, you dont need to kill the unit completely, just leave it with less than 10% of the models. (a bit less if you lose the battle)",2024-03-01T11:29:25Z,115
