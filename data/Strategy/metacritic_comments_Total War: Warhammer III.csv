Roger1868,100,"Best of I, II, and III. Game is exciting and infinitely replayable. What more can we want? All thanks to CA ! !"
aitorsibo,70,"It's a fun game for some time, if you like CA's RTS games then you'll like this one. The thing is the formula has not changed at all ever since the first Total War. Combat is refreshed with leaders and magic, but campaign map stuff is too simple. It's basically a game of building big armies fast and keep on conquering settlements, there are almost no strategic layers unlike civilization. Coop campaign mode is appreciated, but I wish they revamp the campaign mode to add more depth."
Cromenus,40,"When you pay more then 60 euros for a game, you expect it to have at least half of the available factions,not just 19,not to mention the very expensive DLS, and that's not even taking info account the many nuances that many people don't like to mention."
albertisthelord,100,"It's getting better. The devs are doing all the right things. I like this game alot, I hope you do too!"
RefinedInsights,20,"Meh, why bother making a total war game about Warhammer? History is much better than some geeky franchise that most people don't know about. I tried getting into it, but it felt cheesy and lame."
BrayDSA999,80,"the game is made with the feet, if it wasn't for the work shop I would give it a 5. THANK YOU MODDERS FOR SAVING THIS GAME FROM THE NEGLECTFUL MANAGEMENT OF The Creative Assembly."
greywolf00,60,"Better than 1, but much weaker than 2 imo. Props for the attempted innovation on the portals and city fights, but the portals especially just turn this game into a massive slog that stays well past its welcome. Couple that with a bunch of very poor DLC deliveries and pricing and the Mixed score is understandable. The build your own demon prince was a great addition and I hope this become a core feature they continue to build on. I would never recommend this over 2, and unless you really want to play one of the new factions you can pretty safely skip it. And unless the portal suppression mod gets fixed strap in for incredibly long, drawn out games."
Nemonjkntr,90,"After 3759 hours I can say I really, really like the game. But you do need all the DLCs to enjoy it fully. If not for that, it would be 10/10 for me."
SenatorAranor,70,"I'm a fan of the Total War: Warhammer series, even though I'm not much into the Warhammer series in other medias (not because I dislike it, I simply never got to it). The game is good, don't get me wrong. I've played, and still play, plenty of it. However I felt disappointed. There wasn't much improvement over the second game. The campaign added in the third game is okay, to be honest. There are interesting things to it. Can't help but feel like the devs insist on disappointing us when it comes to battles however. Especially with trailers that show cannons and such on the walls. This could be so much more than it is. As a game on it's own, I'd give this 8. As the third game of the series? 7 is pulling it a little bit higher - I'd say 6.5 even."
Moaned,50,Warhammer 3 is just :- U will buy this game but you will not put money in it? Will no fun for u
cvi1978,100,"best updated game and patched, has a lot of fun with it. Thx CA for the great work with it"
GTaylor00,80,the combat system has all the positives and negatives that you expect from a total war game. With that said it is a great entry that further tightens up the existing systems. with these games giving you access to content unlocked in past games the totalwarhammer sandbox is as fun as its ever been.
deniszek,80,Very good game with vast world which is being continuously expanded with DLCs. There are many factions to play as. Finishing the game takes very long time. Contains multiple scenarios of how to achieve victory. My main concern is that DLCs are rather unreasonably expensive.
Erwan62,50,"Franchement, encore une fois la même chose : une bonne licence détruite par la cupidité et la médiocratie. Sans les Mods, ce jeu est injouable. Un grand merci à la communauté motivée qui pallie aux GROS défaut des développeurs et des pressions commerciales."
YoMammy,100,i havn't finished the tutorial yet but everything so far seems good. i like all of the other total war games so i don't see how this one could disappoint me.
Beloth,90,Großartiges abwechslungsreiches Fantasystrategiespiel. Eine absolute Empfehlung für jede*n der/die auf epische und große Fantasyschlachten steht
68ALF69,100,"Play Total War games for more than 15 years. This one is unreal. You will need to buy all the top content though. Check youtube for the best dlc factions, also make sure you buy all 3 games in a triology pack for the best price. It has so many different mechanics and units, the battles and the campaign map are stunning. It's not perfect but they have really come a long way from warhammer 1. The only thing I would move recommend, would be to add the possibility to customize banners, units, cities and lords."
Aleksione,0,"Some things are hard to believe and I personally can’t believe that people call this piece of undigested feces a game. Kal is 2 years old and there are still bugs in it that simply do not allow you to “play”. Do you want to see how your warriors fight up close, like in any other unit? But here we don’t do that! Moving the camera closer to the warriors makes them invisible. I spent more time looking for a solution to this problem than I spent playing this game. Various recommendations were made: Turn off the ""proximity fading"" setting; Install ""Better Camera Mod""; Check local files; Restart stool; Restart the computer; Reinstall cal. Surprisingly, nothing helped. My hardware: 3060ti, 32gb ram, R7 5800x. A mediocre rant from a mediocre publisher and mediocre developers."
yondon1,90,"there is no game like the total war warhammer series. this was my first pc game and dive into the warhammer universe, it truly an experience consoles cannot offer with high replay value and constant DLCs."
Lusarys,90,"Os preços das DLC são absurdos, mesmo assim comprei, e posso dizer que entregam o que prometem e o game em si é impecável."
Tactichan,60,"Compared to the previous two installments, TW:WH 3 is a step backwards in playability and function."
Sogumadan,0,Ruined castle wars for me. Played 250 hours first game 2000 hours second game. Could play this sheet 30 hours. Appearently gamepass game afterall
Destrukt,10,"Since the website does not allow to format text, I'll only state my reason for low score without talking deeper about the game.Chat in multiplayer has been removed. Unlike TW:WH II The game has shipped without chat but developer assured that it will be implemented after they develop a good way of moderating it (aka censoring). However, 2 years after release not only there is still no chat... In may 2023 CA released patch to previous TW titles which removed chat from multiplayer from them! They did that even to Empire released in 2009 and doing that also broke mods. Chat is a vital feature needed to communicate with other players in multiplayer games. I can not accept that it is being removed from old titles which were sold as including it. I politely asked many times CA to add chat to TW:WH III but never received reply."
rochaeterno,100,É triste dizer isso mas por mais que esse jogo seja bom ele não merece seu dinheiro. Não quando o desenvolvedor não tem nenhum respeito pelo consumidor negando nosso direito atémesmo de opinar sobre um produto que consumimos.
FoxForce,10,"The amount of money you have to pour into this game to be able to play it fully is insane. Even at maximum discount an average working person not from first world countries will never be able to play this game. The pricing of the game like most AAA games is not fair for less fortunate individuals in developing countries. All in all there is nothing that would justify the price tag. The quality of the game is irrelevant when you can not have access to it, directly because of the publishers decisions."
Celey,90,One of the best or the best strategy game I have ever played.
Trix122,0,"260€ of DLC's, hell no."
ravonline,0,Imagine CA had Mercedes Benz called model Warhammer 2. And then these geniuses took that and turned it into a Lada - model Warhammer 3. And now imagine they are selling you a deflated spare tire (WH3 DLCs) at a cost which is nearly equal to half the price of the Lada model WH3. **** Legends.
MEGarrus,0,"So many bugs, youre too busy making expansive dlcs that offer NOTHING. Fix the fckin game before even considering adding new lord and units, absolutely pathetic"
XxSilentiumxX,0,"This game would be an outstanding 10/10 if CA/Sega would give it the proper support it deserve. E.g.: notable DLC, custodian team for maintenance, FLC again?, grander mechanic changes with updates, etc.. Unfortunately I can not support this studios recent LACK of intelligent planning around this franchise. I am not buying anything from CA or Sega until they turn around their recent events surrounding this game. I encourage any newcomers to hold off from purchasing any of their products until the suits of the aforementioned fully pull their you-know-whats out of their you-know-wheres and adequately support this game. If you don't, you are choosing to support a company whose current approach is: milk them till they bleed and give nothing back. It had a rough launch (entirely their fault) and was starting to look better with previous two DLC till this recent dead stop. Shadows of Change...fitting title. Turn it around CA/Sega, this game deserves better from you... When/If I feel this community has been adequately heard and RESPECTED (looking at you, RB), I will resume purchasing their products and remove my negative ratings on all sites."
Leelareso,0,"Huge prices for DLC with no content, bugged since the premiere, optimization is poor (on the campaign map it takes up 9300MB of VRAM in 1080p), the AI is still weak and doesn't know what to do with itself on the campaign and battle maps, but threatening the community broke the camel's back. I'm not a deviant to get ****** for my own money."
Doctorotto,10,"I fan of total war games, but that its that the worsts game on my experience from total war. You shout to spent too much money for open all race DLC in this game. Worst camping what I ever play. The worst game for what I ever pay in my life."
Davitt333,0,"I love Warhammer and Total War, so I invested a lot of time in the hope of what was to come. What was to come has not come, and is not coming. Here are the main issues why I do not like this game, and would recommend Warhammer 2 over it: - Sieges: I don't know how they did it, but they made the worst sieges I have witnessed in the Total War franchise. They have no plans to fix this, and in a war game, this is a critical mistake. - Balancing: Chaos rules all in this game. Human factions are weak and in dire need of updates to make them even playable. - Networking: Loads of crashes and glitches while playing online, leading to lots of restarting and lost save files. - DLC pricing: It seems CA is giving less content for double the price, which really makes me worried as this game is supposed to be given content for 10 years. I'm not sure if I want to pay that money for such little content when the base game is so lacking already. All in all, I am pretty disappointed. I'll stick with Total War mods on the older games and Warhammer 2."
mambofffan,20,"Plus d'an an d'existence et pourtant encore pas mal de bugs et d'équilibrages aux fraises et CA se permet malgré ça de proposer une augmentation de 150% du tarif DLC. À croire qu'ils veulent que les joueurs se contentent des mods, parfois plus généreux en contenu."
sirmel,10,"only fix bug every half year also each DLC now are extreme overprice 25€ is almost half of one full game for less than 20% content this is definitely an anti-consumer practice,"
redsuns,0,many bugs ignored and left unfix for months. Overpriced dlcs that can buy a full game. Wind has changed for CA. Spend your time and money elsewhere.
Keelanv10,0,"The bugs in this game are atrocious, the dlc pricing is exploitative, the the developers hate their customers. Take it from someone with hundreds of hours of playtime in the previous games, don’t give this greedy leech of a company any of your hard earned dollars"
Arkess,30,"Awful experience compared to TTW2. After more than year it feels like a beta or the Early Access. The game developers are definitely not the same who designed the brilliant tomb kings and vampire coast. While playing the same faction in TWW3, you can get more broken mechanics and much more boring gameplay as it was."
Cinecz,10,"Game itself is not that but but the support of it is abysmal, paid DLCs are broken (Alariel and Nakai) and do not recieve bugfixes. Do not recomend"
Andrudis,10,The worst of all Total War games... looks like devs are more interested in playing politics than in making good game...
angmarec,80,"On the start game was not really finished, and campaign is boring, but Immortal Empires campaign is great. Still need some work, and many races need updates, but now game is great"
Valent1,70,Très bon jeu de stratégie avec des combats et un mode campagne bien réalisés. J'enlève -1 pour la note car il y avait d'énormes problèmes d'optimisation au début mais il n'y en a plus beaucoup malgré des latences et des pertes de connexion à certains moments notamment pour les campagnes en coop.
Deatheagle,40,The Game offers epic battles with many races and a beautiful lore. I love how the Studio is trying to make the best out of this Game and continues to listen to the Community. As a Slaaneshi Player i am very pleased with Most of the Units. As a Suggestion it would be very nice if you could buff Chosen of Slaanesh because they feel very weak and disapointing. I know you are doing ur best guys keep on the good work!
ttrueno,0,"I just bought it to play with Vampire Counts, and was just after buying it that I realize that you only can play with that faction if you own WH1 and WH2 with all their DLC, what a way to scam their costumers"
chellicklida,0,"игры вне политики, мудилы They stopped supporting the Russian language."
Sushpanzer,0,"I would like to put aside political issues, which in principle should not exist in the gaming industry, so I will speak dryly and to the point. When any software developer, before selling a product, declares any product features and receives money for this product upon sale, he undertakes to provide the promised functionality. When the functionality is declared, the product is released, sold, but stops working after the sale - this is a scam. This is theft. The game was announced support for the Russian language. People bought this product on pre-orders. After 2 years, the Russian language is cut out of the game. This is theft. This is rudeness. Do not preorder from these companies. They will steal your money and wipe their feet on you. They are thieves."
Loki696,0,"Russian has always been a positive attitude towards this game, but what happened shocked me, Creative Assembly stopped supporting the Russian language a week before the release of the new DLC, it's just outrageous, such an attitude towards the consumer and the Russian community of the game is extremely upsetting, if it was done for political reasons, then it's disgusting. I believe that games should be outside politics and I will remind all Russophobes that for many Ukrainians Russian is their native language, and there is no purely Ukrainian language in the game, so this act is inappropriate and stupid in any case."
ber_aleks,10,No politics in games! Stop denigrating the Russian people and their language!
ViniPuh,10,They stopped supporting the Russian language. Harassment of Russian-speaking players.
Jblitz,100,"The games have been patched very well now; I love it so much. Super addictive, and there have been so many small but noteworthy additions that work. Like sieges now cause attrition. If a rival nation lord is parading your lands, you can threaten war if they don’t leave pronto. The new factions are great. The sieges with supplies introduced a more protected asymmetric warfare for even more trickery with the defending army."
