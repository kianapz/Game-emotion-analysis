Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"this is about as big as it gets in gaming announcements short of halflife 3. the hd version of aoeii has sold 4.5 million in 4 years just on steam, making it one of the 20 best selling pc games of all time, and that's just the remastered version, not the original that's been out since 1999. when the topic of what game do you have the fondest memories of or what game franchise do you most wish would make a comeback comes up on popular subreddits like askreddit and others, age of empires always dominates the conversation. which is a semilong winded way of saying this is huge, regardless of whether you like the games or not. i'm incredibly excited, personally."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,everyone needs to pump their brakes. relic is making this. nothing against them but we know that switching devs on a beloved franchise is hit or miss with a whole lot of misses. microsoft really fucked up when the shuttered ensemble and every other mgs studio and went all in on the xbox. they had no vision for pc gaming. if relic abandons what we all loved then it's just another franchise whored for easy sales because it's not like relic doesn't have their own rts games they could make.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"the thing that i loved most about age of empires ii was the singleplayer campaign mode. multiple different campaigns designed to relate historical events surrounding reallife historical figures in an entertaining way. if the campaign is going to be the same as age of empires iii, as in a single poorlywritten pseudohistorical fantasy, then i have no interest whatsoever in purchasing or playing age of empires iv. i remember finishing the campaign in aoe iii and thinking, well, that was corny and terrible, but hopefully the rest of the campaigns will be decent and historical! only to find that there were no other campaigns. that shit about the fountain of youth was all there was and i've been pissed off about it ever since."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,i say this as a huge aoe fan who still plays aoe2 religiously  this trailer was shit. i actually got bored before the halfway point. between the slow talking voice that says nothing significant except cliches recyled between hundreds of other games and the images that looked like they could be pasted to a new civilization game...disappointing presentation.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,i was in totally hyped disbelief until i saw... windows 10.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,is that first sound the same one as the town portal from diablo 2?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,my elephant and car cavalries will conquer all!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,now all we need is another age of mythology and we're golden
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,wow what a cool trailer i learned so much about the changes they are making.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,so this is how windows 10 will be the best windows
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,its like a mobile game trailer. doesn't show anything about the game
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,yassssssss
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,can we just get age of empires ii 2?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"what the hell is an announce? is it some kind of event when you announce something? is it kind of like an announcement? because there is a word for that1. unless perhaps this is an english learners issue, and the trailer production company just didn't know the correct word to use. in that case, it's quite understandable, though i don't know why they wouldn't hire a nativespeaking english major to proofread. 1 announcement"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,if it dont suppurt vr it will be old
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,the last time i played this was on windows 95 with usb support with the rise of rome expansion. i use to play it on the microsoft gaming zone!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,these games are my childhood
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,nostalgic for sure. although all i remember from aoe2 is dying to scorpion spam from my dad. anyone know how you're supposed to counter that?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,so pumped.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"now i just need a new cc based on red alert 2 or cc 3 tiberium wars, age of mythology, evil genius already announced and impossible creatures. that's my small request to be in peace with the rts genre"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,well that was incredibly boring and absurdly poorly done. that looks like something from 2004.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"i love age of empires, but this trailer tells me absolutely nothing about the game or how it's different from earlier versions. anyone have any details?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"wow an actual rts coming out. there will be so much hype around this i really hope they can deliver on it. grew up on rts games, aoe, warcraft, aom, coh, there was no reason the genre should have died out i just hope this game can bring it back."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,i bet it doesn't run on linux
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"i'm still really sad that microsoft killed off ensemble only to have aoe4 made, but at least they're getting a studio like relic to make it"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"despite how aoe3 has not held up well, it was actually a pretty good game by all rights when it first came out. i expect at least that from this, and we can always roll the dice on this becoming as timeless as aoe2."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"i hope it doesn't have the really gay population control like the 3rd one did. i hate it when games try to balance gameplay by making units count for 2 or 3 population points. games like american conquest, planetary annihilation and age of empires 2 are at least in my opinion the best rts games because they don't limit your game. when i play an rts i want to feel like i can take over the map and not be limited by stupid rules like that."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"for the love of all that is holy, please don't fuck this up with an mlg focus and microtransactions, relic. aoe iii was one of the biggest disappointments in pc gaming to me. they put in a dumb card system, the campaigns centered around the fountain of motherfucking youth and the story sucked, the map editor that was a sandbox paradise in aoe i and ii was difficult to understand and not fun to use, the animations looked slow, and the maps looked dull and unrealistic."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"and i wanted to finish college in the next two years, bye bye studies"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,while its nice and all remember 2 things.  1 they gonna fuck it up somehow.  2 they gonna monetize the living fuck out of it.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"although the trailer might bring up some vibe, it tells me absolutely nothing about ingame experience. i mean this trailer fits to most middle ages war games."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"i am very excited about this, but at the same time i have strong reservations because of relics involvement after the dow 3 fiasco where they basically destroyed the franchise. incoming ages of empires moba edition. please no bill, please."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"no gameplay footage yeah no just the same old strategy of buying up old ip, make a shitty game but market the hell out of it and then collecting preorderdlc monies."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"sigh  the windows 10 at the end. windows 10 exclusivity is shitty enough, but i bet it's a windows store exclusive too."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,i keep throwing money at the screen but nothing's happening!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,is it just me or is that the voice of tywin lannister?

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"anyone else think the trailer is made less impactful by flashing age of empires iv official announce trailer at the beginning? i mean imagine watching all of that wondering oooh what game could this be?!then boom! you're hit with the reveal at the end. instead, the whole time i'm waitingwanting for actual gameplay that never comes, and the trailer ends up disappointing. oh well, at least the game exists at all! can't wait to play it!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,only available on windows 10 store. i'd put money on that.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,what!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,linux version? lol
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,tywin lannister is the announcer voice. westeros confirmed to be in the game.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,what a shitty trailer. more like a teaser. no gameplay footage tells me that the game doesn't come out either in few years or they are unhappy how it looks right now but someone wanted to announce it from higher up.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,i pray to the gods that this game is released on steam and not on windows marketplace for games.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,is it just me or did this trailer feel a lot like the civilization vi announcement trailer? even had a got star as the narrator.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,so i guess we will have to wait until the game is fully released to ever see any gameplay? and it won't even come from microsoft.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,i'm getting real sick of games that are being released for pc suddenly switching to saying they are being released for windows 10 specifically. it creates ambiguity as to whether it works on older versions of windows which it probably does. is microsoft paying them to do this to advertise windows 10?

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,oh my fucking god. its happening!!!!!!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,holy shit this came out of the blue! i'm so hyped!!! aoe ii was the shit when i was younger.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,please don't screw it up with a windows store only release
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"so, where's the gameplay?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"i'm sorry to say but after aoe 3, i don't have high hopes for this. it looked great, the actual system of playing was great but the ai was probably the worst i've ever seen in a rts, the maps were absolutely tiny and it seemed like the devs simply gave up on single player altogether which, while people enjoy multiplayer, is just fucking lazy when they can't be bothered to give the cpu a decent ai and to at least try to cater to the people who have been playing this franchise since day one. we went from aok, which is an absolute cult classic, still getting new content to this day, great ai, awesome maps, millions of configuration options to aoe 3 which it seemed like they stopped developing the moment it could connect to the internet and find opponents online. i'm expecting a great looking game with even less actual history and more bullshit, zero replay value for single player and all the focus on multiplayer, which becomes dead after six months because they never bothered to give people a reason to like the game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,looks kind of disappointing... the whole point of advancing the series in the past has been advancing the civilization levels another generation. aoe had up to the colonial level so i was hoping it would take us to at least ww1 this time around if not ending at ww2 possibly. the trailer makes it look like aoe 3 with more races which is not a bad thing but not really worth a whole new game is it?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"i was on the hype train, then remembered ensemble is dead. then saw relic is making it. then remembered company of heroes 2. then remembered sega owns relic. then remembered sega owns creative assembly. then remembered what sega did with the rome 2 total war launch. then i got off the hype train ."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,the art direction on this trailer is solid af
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,i've been wanting an aoeiv for years now. but actually i'd rather have a reboot because a setting past iii is too modern for me. wwiii is used to much in games already. i think i'll wait for the remaster of iiii.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,so long as it's like ii not iii
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,wololo

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,there was an aoe iii?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,where is gameplay?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"i hope that this game doesn't neglect the single player aspect, because to me, age was first and foremost a single player game, the campaigns were all fun and skirmishes were so fun to play against the ai"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,so they also announced remastered versions of aoe 2 and 3. ...didn't aoe 2 hd release  5 years ago?

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,hopefully they don't have latency problems.. age of empires ii age of kings is my favorite game and age of empires ii hd is one of my favorites also but i can not even play hd online because of how they use outdated connection system.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-26,title says announce trailer. does that mean they just came up with the idea last week and haven't started the project so they have no gameplay footage?

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,they will fuck this up. i guarantee it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,looks like a freemium ios game trailer.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"no one will probably read this. i spent hundreds of hours on age of empires 1  2 and age of mythology. playing through the campaigns endlessly, creating stupid custom ai wars with explosive saboteurs, naval battles... i have vivid memories of joan of arc and william the conqueror campains... i remember lan parties with my friends on large maps where each of us would dominate a corner, build an army, and just go at it in the middle of that blackunknown. it makes me sad to know i won't be able to play this just because i own a mac. i would buy this in a heartbeat, as well as any expansion that came with it. i sincerely hope this has a port to mac. i'm going to be absolutely devastated if it doesn't."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,what's the point if ensemble studios aren't making this game? it's just another rts with aoe name slapped on it!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"i opened the trailer, noticed it wasn't immediately gameplay, skipped ahead, then closed it. i am tired of bullshit announce trailers. either show me a reason to get excited or stop. it's one thing if it's a new game in a franchise that is active, but there's no guarantee the people making this are even competent."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"let's be honest, it's going to be tainted with disgusting modern practices, it will have day 1 dlc, probably unlocking some faction to use in skirmish mode that was in the base game to begin with, probably some crazy dlc giving you an extra hero character, or some better unique troops, and some horrid drm that will prevent you from playing this mostly single player game without having an internet connection. don't get hyped, be excited that it might be a good game, but don't be hyped because you'll be crushed when you find out it's going to be tainted with these practices."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,this had better be good. aoe 3 sucked. i've tried like 4 times to get into it and it just isn't good.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,wait...there was an age of empires 3?

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,so what can we likely expect from this one? to pick up after aoe 3 left off? or will they revisit a particular time period as logistically a world wars era game will be harder to make in the aor style? or do we really have no way of knowing?

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"i've not played the original, tell me what makes it a good game. i have civ 5 and struggled to play past gunpowder as it lost my attention"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,well shit... did not expect that. be interesting to see actual gameplay though and what kind of twist they will put on the formula. especially if it's made by relic who's games are all squad and cover based not traditional aoe style rts.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"i thought they were done making age of empires. i grew up on this, and age of mythology. i can't wait to see how this will turn out."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"so they basically killed ensemble studios. and then they replace them with relic? i don't know how to feel about this. company of heroes is the best rts i've played since aoe iii. but i really wanted the teams that made aoeiii to come back. aoeiii is still the best rts i've played, provided you have both expansions. and i feel like the fanbase didn't give the game a chance. yes, the base game was a letdown. but they were comparing aoeii with its expansion to the base aoeiii. the asian dynasties basically changed the entire game. and i loved the card system allowing for different people to play the same race different ways. spamming rice patties and daimyo was crazy. but it seems like the vast majority of fans never stuck with the game that long. anyway, that's my long pessimistic way of saying i'm hyped. but trying to remain cautious."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,all it took was a solar eclipse to get us the game we've been waiting for. see you guys in 75 years for aoe5.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,hopefully it sticks to its roots and is a hell of a lot better than 3. i was a fan of aoe but 3 was meh. didn't get into it. i just stuck with 2 and mods.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,will this be windows 10 only?? will a girl with pink hair and a gender studies degree be the producer or lead animator?? i'm about to loose my shit!!!!!!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,a new age is upon us i hope it isn't modern or futuristic. also aoe 13 were also released on osx since microsoft owns this i really hope it isn't windows only.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"thanks, bill. my son and i loved the originals. i started him out when he was maybe 4 years old. he hadn't played video games before, and i just showed him how to create the little guys and to click on the images to do whatever he wanted, then went to the other computer to start my empire. 30 minutes later, i'm still taking my time gathering resources, and my son says, daddy, how do i send my guys to your house? i thought, that's so cute, he wants to come visit me. i go over to his computer and he has a dozen club men and half a dozen archers ready to go. i had nothing but a half dozen serfs slaving away. a born conqueror that kid was. thankfully, a dozen years of tv have turned him squishy and docile."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"well that trailer got my testosterone pumping. i'm hard as steel, gents."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"i hope they learn from both 2 and 3. i loved 3 with the wsuper wide range of things that you could do, but it wasn't great for competitive play. while 2 was still awesome it also was well balanced enough for competitive play. hope we get the best of both."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"dude. my dad plays age of mythology religiously. every night. he never really got into aoe even though the hd version came out, but he's been searching for over ten years for a new game that comes close to either. this is going to blow his mind. i'm beyond happy i'll be able to show him something new and be able to play an updated game with him again. thank god one of these two games finally gets the remake they deserve. i wish it was aom but i understand there's a bigger backing for accurate gameplay."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,it'd be amazing for this game to take place initially during the franco prussian war or the american civil war and lead into ww1 for the final part where most of the strategies you've learned are now outdated. they could really play with the march of progress theme.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,i wonder if people might feel a bit short changed you know. i'm looking forward to any campaigns in particular but core aoe gameplay is extremely simplistic compared to other rts and in the same field as grand strategy it might fee a bit underwhelming if it stay true to its roots. when it came out this was par for the course but now i think we expect more gameplay mechanics

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"is it bad that i'm incredibly sceptical about this? i sunk hundreds of hours in aoeror, and especially aoe ii, but i feel there is no way we're gonna get anything close to those two games. i honestly doubt the developers are going to stay true to the original formula. it's been a decade since the last aoe game came out, meanwhile there's a whole new generation out there that's probably never even heard of the series. most likely they're going to attempt a balancing act between reeling in new players who have never played an aoe game before, and giving everyone else a taste of nostalgia. that could mean a bunch of things, having this as a pc exclusive does give me hope, but i'm afraid they're going to tone down a lot of things and implement some mechanics the kids today are familiar with. aoe iii already felt like a step down in that regard. i could never get into aoe iii, it felt restricted where are my goddamn unit formations and commands?!, slowpaced, and clunky to play. going from isometric to full 3d was part of the problem. if you've ever watched competitive aoe ii matches, you'll understand what i mean. but that's just something you have to get used to i guess. not a big fan of the colonial era to begin with, so i guess i was biased from the getgo. that said, having a game like aoe ii pretty much define my childhood experience with video games, anything that's not an exact replica of that is probably going to feel like a disappointment. at least to me, though i doubt i'm alone in this. in a perfect world, relic would involve the playerbase in the development of the game, like they did with the new ut game, which is also a dearly loved series with a high nostalgia factor. but that's not going to happen is it?"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"is this not the game they advertise in every add for like years now, in like youtube videos or anything not premium. i don't know the name just sounds familiar."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,that was a weak assed trailer. what was that 20 frames?

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"anyone knows if this is going to be all ages like empire earth or they will just keep going to modern age? i miss priests, they were so unique"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,and that trailer tells me absolutely nothing except that there is a project in the works and it's part of the franchise...

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"i'm intrigued, but not excited, partially because no gameplay has been revealed yet, and partially because i didn't love aoe 3, the last installment. it was ok, it could be very well enjoyable, but not great. aoe, aok and aom were fantastic, though. i suppose this new game will cover the end of the 19th century and will get well at least into mid 20th century, to cover the world wars. i wouldn't be surprised if the last age were our current era. not my favourite setting for an rts. also, the age of games focus heavily on the idea of starting from scratch,and the only reason it was believeable in aoe3 was because it focused on the colonies and left out all the wars in europe religion wars, wars against the ottomans, and the napoleonic wars. how could that work in the 20th century? because of that, i halfexpect this to focus on war more than building up cities and an economy."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,another beloved franchise for relic entertainment to fuck up. now they just need to kill off coh and they'll have a hatrick.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"when i saw this on the front page i literally gasped. now, i am an adult, but not a single thing in recent years has made me feel this way. this surely hit out of the blue, and the amount of unprepared happiness is overwhelming, thank you microsoft!"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"i'm concerned how this will turn out  relic did a decent job with dow i and a good job with dow ii, but dow iii is a complete waste of money that tries to be both a moba and an rts, and fails to do either one well. company of heroes is fun though, and overall relic has done decent to good work, so i'm hopeful. it'll be great to get back into classic rts style games from the golden age of rts in the late 90s and early 2000s."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"aoe is my favourite series of all time, i still play aok online whenever i get the chance i remember playing on msn zone back in the day, it was by far my first experience with online gaming, and it was so different from today, people were actually awesome and while being super competitive it never got as nasty as todays lobbys got a couple of nicknames in the 1900s and had some epic battles, good times"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,so.. uhm.. does anyone have any ideas which ages this might be set in?

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,i hope microsoft won't be retarded enough to only release this game on windows store like they did on definitive edition.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,i think i'm a minority here but i think this will be sadly windows only and windows store only makes it harder for wine user's.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"but what time period would aoe 4 be set in though? this is what i hate about people begging for it, they never thought about the time and place setting. just said for a fourth, nothing else. probably better es to focus on the problems in the first 3 instalments, an example is the campaigns in aoe 3 they should make chapters, or at least levels that focus on historical figures that were hugely involved with the new world, such as christopher columbus, ponce de leon, ferdinand  isabella, etc. once the problems are fixed and people are enjoying all 3 instalments, then we can talk about aoe 4."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,this game defined my childhood. aoe2 came out when i was 10. my neighbor had 4 computers all set up in one roomhis dad retired at 40 from microsoft they were loaded.. my friend and i would lan almost daily with each other and then other friends would come over on the weekends and we would all play.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,i can relate. we used to have sessions of 2v2 where we agreed to not engage in combat for 2 hours. after a 2 hour build period we spent the next 36 hours trying to take down opponents through gates and walls that were 5 layers thick just on the outermost edges. break through that and now you get to deal with the internal fortifications. it was an absurd amount of fun. as for what we just watched? pretty weak as far as modern announcement trailers go and i'm okay with that. i hope it doesn't over rely on its past success and reputation just to make money. i'm optimistic!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,used to play aoe ii in my elective computer class with the teacher and other students.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,to be fair they probably don't have anything they're willing to show yet. it's probably being built from scratch so they might just be working on the game engine and haven't nailed any of the gameplay details yet. i'm guessing release date early 2020.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,each game is supposed to be for a different era httpfarm1.static.flickr.com335567751825f950ab1a.jpg
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"imo, if they're continuing it in the tradition of the older games, it should begin in the napoleonic wars and end in world war 1. aoe3 seemed to end in some weird limbo between the napoleonic wars and the crimean war. keeping a broad but still limited time period would allow them to put some extra love into the units, buildings, and systems i feel, and having ww1 techs like tanks, airplanes, chlorine gas, etc slaughtering armies and burning empires would be a poetic end to every match. if they went beyond that into world war 2 or beyond, they'd risk becoming just another bland ww2 rts game which are a dime a dozen. nbsp edit thinking more about it actually, that's probably unlikely. they'd risk being called out for having it be too similar to aoe3. a more likely scenario is probably ww1 to cold war, either the beginning or the end of it. there'd be a visible, tangible feeling of progression and change through the various ages, but it'd all be fairly similar tanks, infantry, airplanes, etc, just getting upgraded and they have plenty of units they could introduce in later ages missiles, helicopters, etc maybe you'd get a chance to adopt an ideology like in civ 5 that helps fuel conflict, create temporary alliances, and give you certain bonuses?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"microsoft owns rise of nations, which spans multiple ages. honestly i prefer ron to aoe, but i don't really play rts games so it might just be more fun due to its accessibility. maybe if this game goes down well we could see a rise of nations 2 although there was a fantasy spin off that didnt sell that well"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"that's certainly an opinion. age of empires 3 and its expansions were quite well received. they obviously didn't live up to its predecessor, but it's pretty hard to beat the nostalgia and wellroundedness of of aoe 2 and the conquerors. visually, aoe was quite a beautiful game. the sound effects were great and the card system and whatnot added a lot of depth to it. plus, the online multiplayer system was way better than the garbage that age of empires 2 was back in the day, at least. i thought it was a great game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"you couldn't play defensive at all. walls were terrible, and you had a cap of like 6 towers. strong defenses were one of the great things about aoe2."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,it was way too complex. the series peaked with aoe2 because it was all about balanced gameplay and execution of your chosen strategy.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,they just did starcraft i remastered though
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,with paid loot crates
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,valve should join in with halflife 4 .... wait
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"lets be honest, there is no way they could release warcraft 4 as long as wow is still a thing. plus the story got so fucked up when they went to the binary alliancehorde thing, even when rocft managed to show us that even among the 4 major racial factions there were numbers of smaller factions below the surface that didn't care for each other."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"they think the genre is dead. but in reality, they just made a shit rts and fucked up a huge selling point for a lot of people ums games. that doesn't mean all rts' are going to do poorly."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,and valve with halflife 4!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"i mean they did just remaster starcraft, so i'd say they are out in front on this one"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,by the time i'm done with aoe4 and warcraft starcraft 3 should be around the corner. in which they have to add at least 1 more faction
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,not when they can continue to destroy the lore with another wow expansion pack.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,i didn't care for it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,ea would probably view it as too similar to battlefield to make.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,yeah... they also made dow3 most recently though...
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,play company of heroes. it's a fantastic rts and gives me confidence in their handling of aoe.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,relic has a long history of amazing games and then flopped on dawn of war 3. there's no predicting the future but relic has definitely made a name for themselves in creating amazing rts titles. i have more faith that they'll do this right than they'll do it wrong like they did with dow 3. their track record speaks for itself.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"i am gonna say it now, it will suck massive cock. it's relic. they can't make proper games anymore. look at dow3 or coh2. they will make crap game with fuckton of microtransactions. ms is holding the purse strings, ms will decide if it's full of microtransactionswhatever or not. you seem to have forgotten how the aoe franchise has been treated by them in the past few years. the aoe ii expansions and the hdextended rereleases of all the old ensemble games have gone pretty well. they could have opted to fuck around with those games in that process and didn't. so i do think they've learned."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"literally booted no, no they didn't. that isn't how literally works at all."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,blizzard wants to have a word with you
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,well but they did in way. microsoft was the one that stopped funding ensemble studios. and now it's microsoft saying hey let's pay some developers to make aoe 4 so... they had a choice. and they made it. fingers crossed it all works out.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"a lot of them went over to robot entertainment and bonfire studios. however bonfire failed, i think. so they're pretty spread out."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,an xbox live account is an account for them to manage online gameplay with. there's nothing wrong with them using a service they already have and many players may already have. it doesn't mean it is going to be on xbox or require a controller to play

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"ok, announcement trailer  useless"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,i did not like the change in campaign from historical events to pseudo fantasy.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"i don't think it tops aoe2, but age of empires 3 wasis a fantastic game. i'm shocked people didn't like it. added much more depth to the games without being overly complex, imo."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"the first one i played was aoe3, and i loved it. one of my favorite games ever. i probably wouldn't have liked it if i played aoe2 first. but i hate the look of aoe2."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"the hate for aoe3 is not warranted and i think a major issue is some people just play the campaigns of these games and also the expansions to aoe3 are awesome, they really expanded the game into a positive direction."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,it's not worth the hate at least. it's a bit more complicated but it's not hard to understand

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"what is so complex about aoe3? only thing that could make it more complex for you was home city, special map objectivestrade postnatives and cannons dominating wrong positioning of infantry. both of these two are easy to understand and if you played for more then few seconds you would really not consider them complex.  home cities add lot of replayability."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"oh, i got that. it just killed the visual flow of the whole trailer is all."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"aoe3 was my favorite as well, i have 1000 hours in that game. however i think the home city system was it's downfall. the main complaints about rts games are their overwhelming complexity and lack of accessibility for beginners, so they took the most mechanically complex rts and added more imo unnecessary layers of complexity to it. the same thing goes for trade routes, native american settlements etc. i think these factors made the barrier of entry too high for online multiplayer and led to it's r relatively early demise."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-22,"yeah, that's what i meant. we know they can make awesome games. hopefully they'll stick to what made aoe2 awesome."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"actually looks like a pretty creative use of existing material to make a captivating trailer, most likely with little direction. i'd say they did an amazing job without using any ingame footage."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,it only shows past ages from the older age of empires games and says we are entering a new age well new game pretty much finally. so it's hard to say if it will follow suite but i give it about a 70 chance it will be set in an era after aoe 3. i do wish it would be set in the era of aoe 12 though.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,i think late 1800s to wwi would be pretty awesome.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"agree, to me it was more like aoe2 is nostalgic and aoe3 was innovating. now they're both nostalgic lol."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,quite honestly i don't get the hate for aoe3. it improved so many aspects of aoe2 gameplay wise. it was also very straight forward and easy to learn. i was 12 and figured it out easily.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"i completely agree, aoe3 is probably the pinnacle of pc gaming it adds on every aspect of aoe2 and betters it, leaving one of the best rts games ever."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,as long as it isn't a complete mess i'll enjoy it. any idea if its a new era or multiple eras? i am not sure if the trailer just recaps the released aoes or if it tries to tell us that we can play through the whole timeframe. edit if its one era after aoe 3 i'd hope for anything but ww2 because thats been done to death. ww1 would be fine though imo. everything before that might be too similar to aoe3 in terms of technology and stuff like the 7 years war or napoleon would be really eurocentric anyway so there isn't really any other choice.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,there are more units and unit types in aoe 2 than in aoe 3. to be perfectly frank aoe 3 was ahead of its time and remains an incredible game but suffered from abysmal multiplayer unlock system. the cards and home city mechanic allows for dynamic and strategically rewarding game play however having to grind out those cards was what killed it. with the xp mod nowadays that issue is circumvented but it really killed its launch.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"see rise of nations for an example of how to properly evolve the gameplay established in aoe2. it was grander than aoe2 in pretty much every single way covered a much broader scope of history, had far more upgrades, added unit upgrades, added air combat, missiles, and nukes, more structures, more advanced resource collection, more gameplay types and win conditions, more units, more advanced options in combat like formations, yet it was still a pretty accessible game. honestly, i'm sad that it never seemed to receive the same attention that aoe2 did, because it's the far superior game in my opinion."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"i disagree. the problem with rts games now is that for a long time now, they have all been chasing the success of starcraft in trying to be the next big esport. devs need to stop trying to pander to the hardcore competetive market and maybe go back to trying to make a fun game. a microheavy clickfest might be interesting and challenging to some people, but it's really really offputting when a game tries to do that to the detriment of all other aspects. and i absolutely hope they keep any and all mobalike mechanics far far far away from this game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,"think of what csgo did for fps or dota2 did for moba's. they didn't reinvent anything just crisp, refined, responsive and fun gameplay. hopefully aoe can be to rts what those games are to their genres."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-23,"i feel your pain, aoe3 is definitely the redheaded step child of the series for some reason. however, we should try to identify the reasons why it didn't last so the devs avoid these pitfalls in aoe4. aoe3 sold a boatload of copies at launch meaning tons of people gave it a chance, but the online scene was dead after just a few years. for whatever reason, many franchise fans did not stick around. years later, aom and aoe2 still have a small and dedicated playerbase while aoe3 is basically dead. we might think aoe3 was perfect the way it was but i would prefer to have a slightly less complex game if it means that i can actually find a match online."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,"i think the preference between dow1 and dow2 is actually fairly evenly split. that's why they tried to make dow3 be something that both sides could enjoy, but ended up making something neither side did."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,they did made dawn of war 3 like that. and people didn't liked it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,"how was dow2 aimed at moba players? it played more like coh with a hero twist. both dow1 and dow2 are masterpieces in rts. last stand was a nice distraction but by no means the main attraction of dow2. my only complaint with dow2 is that they didnt milk it enough. wheres my tau and necrons? they made last stand heroes but never full factions, such a shame."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,new ips are difficult to inject into a niche market unless they are exceptional games.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,"at launch, yes. but it grew into being the best coh."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-04,"it depends on what definition you use. indie studio usually just means independent studio, which in this case relic is. however, indie studio could also mean simply a small studio or a studio with only internal funding. so pick whatever youd like. however, age of empires is not owned by relic and owned by microsoft which funds relic to makeupdate age of empires 4 so that shouldnt matter. edit im not defending the top comments stupid take, just providing some insight on what is considered an indie studio."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-06,starcraft 3 will come when you pry wow from blizzard's cold dead fingers. the success of wow basically doomed all of their other franchises because they can be as shitty as they want to be and still have wow. only reason they were acquired is because its freaking microsoft and they have a lot of money to throw around.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,"yeah i think dow 2 is the better game, and just generally more polished, put together, and a fantastic representation of wh as a game and a universe. dow 1 is easier to get into, easier to just play a quick game and dick around in. they're different enough that i like having both, whereas something like total war warhammer is supplanted by its latest installments completely"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,basically the story of coh 3 too. with shit art decisions thrown in the mix on top
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,there's certainly stuff from dow2 to take also and the campaign was particularly good. if memory serves they cut the base building out of it though which is something people liked a lot in dow1.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,you must be joking. dow 3 had nothing in common with dow 1. zero.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,"if its not another wokeinclusive nonsense it will have audience. like imagine 10y old boy who want play game, do you want look at ugly women and narrator have voice like your mom?? guess what, no they don't want that! you want inspiring alpha general that spread terror in enemy lanes. medieval times were brutal and about conquering resources and subjugate enemy tribe. even joanofarc was better made in aoe2 then in aoe4."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,"really? what makes it good now? for reference i didn't like the  esports focus  tank shells looking like fireballs..? tone of the effects feeling a little.. cartoonish..?  xp system for unlocking commanders  the focus on this in my opinion awful and frustrating frostbite mechanic  i don't remember exactly, but i recall there being something with setting up pve games being wonky.. i just don't see much reason to play coh2 over 1 as it stands. would love to be convinced, because coh is such an awesome game done right. coh 2 made me not even bother with coh 3, even if i love 1."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,maybe they should make their own ancestor legacy because it really feels like waste of combat mechanics. at least when i played last many of mechanics just fell in the background because of how the base building works so better to focus on pumpning units rather than good placement and movement.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,"aoe 1 was amazing wayy back in the day. both of them wet aoe2. while there are more people playing now, so there's more likes and dislikes, it wad better received then. but yea, not much can really match when they did when they were new"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,the one that is objectively better. it would be last out of all of them.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,"their last few games are dawn of war 3, which was despised, age of empires 4, which isn't bad, but i also don't really see anyone talk about it either, and company of heroes 3, which has aggressively mediocre reviews on steam because it released far too early and added microtransactions. now after several updates people are still saying company of heroes 2 is way better. so yea, relic's track record of late isn't the best."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,relic is notorious for not keeping talented developers on board. theres almost no way any of the developers who worked there 20 years ago are still there. at best theres some upper level management left.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,i'd be tempted to do the same thing but i'd find it tough to throw all that money away on an rts developer when that genre is unlikely to be commercially viable without dumbing it down for the mass market.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,"when coh 2 released, i remember a big focus on esports and having these battles showcased on the front page. reason why i say focus is because they were in my opinion pretty clearly trying to set up tournaments and the gameplay seemed to reflect that. but that is just my perspective. pvai is what i meant yes  but i remember not all game modes being available to play vs ai and having some restrictions due to you setting up an online lobby first and filling it with ai. if i recall this incorrectly, please forgive me as it has been many years since i played the game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,"maybe i should try ranked games again but last time i played units numbers and compilation mattered more than unit placement and for winning the game i have never won a game through tactical battles, it was always unit number and economy. for exemple never have i been ablr to be ambushed or ambush enemies hidding troops in the forest. and yes i probably are looking for another type of game but i want the combat mechanics that aoe 4 offers which i find better than ancestor legacy."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,this exactly. thats why it depends on the definition.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-07,bro the game isnt even out yet and so far it looks anything but the opposite of promising.  why are you so pessimistic or what makes you so skeptical about it??
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,pretty much yeah. they did that in coh2 too though
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,"that's my issue with it. it's not bad, but i don't find myself wanting to ever play it."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,"you will always need to have a decent production of units, even with said tactics."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-07,the game will be freetoplay with free and monetized content
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,"i played it and it isn't great, too much aoe3 influence and agenda driven bs. compare it to aoe2, even age of mythology is better. color palette was weird, and general game flow was off and not straightforward. so many times i wasn't sure if i win battle or not, and it was too fast paced, so not much time for strategy... maybe without that stupid rockets and canons it would be better game, lack of europeans factions and longer interesting campaigns like original aoe2aom have. it wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either. ui was utter trash i hate 2d 2colored icons wit all looks same they should make ui like in age of empires 2aom , full handdrawn colored icons and all easily distinguishable from each other!!! units looked weird designed, with weird looking weapons too big, like bowmen and spearmen looked superweird. pricing was off, it should start at 20 and gradually go to 105 and sell dlc for 37 with proper 3x6missions campaigns per dlc, it will be successful. architecture were not distinguish enough, all looks the same and blend with each other, overall units upgrades ui was mess and so on. unit taunts were superweird and cringe overall pretty uninspiring.  .... it wasn't aoe2 successor we wish for."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,still almost every match i have lost has been an number game not unit placement game. but still i understand that i am asking for another type of game just wish they use this combat mechanic so it is not wasted because it truly gives me old school total war vibe
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-19,"and? so a game being f2p automatically is dead on arrival to you? what kind of logic is that? id understand if it was ubisoft, or ea, or heck..., any kind of scummy 3a developer out there, but imho it being f2p will only be the right choice for it, as rts are basically a dead genre, if it was 60 on at launch then the multiplayer would be dead quickly, but it being f2p gives peoples a chance to try and play it, and also, sc2 is also f2p man, it has turned f2p even recently btw.... cmon, dont let this irrational fear get to you, youre not afraid of f2ps, youre afraid of scummy 3a companies, id rather be scummed by a f2p than a paid game, at least f2ps are, well, free, so if i get scammed at least i wouldnt have paid anything to begin with, , the problem here is shitty monetization practices, not f2p, its like blaming the air for being a vector for the plague and various airtransmittible illnesses, but i dont see you complaining about oxygen...., and i hope that you get my point lol, basically in short, blame the thinger, not the thing, f2p isnt so inherently evil concept per se, it was a honest thing before battle passes and the likes, look at dragons dogma 2, scummy micros, despite being a fully paid game, or the thousands of micros on every literally other little paid game out there, f2p isnt the problem."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,"agenda driven bs. alright, i'll bite. pray tell what is agenda driven in this game?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,youre not wrong that production will beat clever tactics at most levels of gameplay. until you get to the really high level play where players have production so optimized that the tactics come back.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-19,"sorry if ive repeated myself several times and  or being superfluos lol, i havent slept."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,agree but still wish they did an manor lord type battle game to fully get the use of their combat mechanics
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-19,"but anyways, its the company behind it that will make me question if i want to give something a chance or not, what has the studio behind stormgate done so far? nothing cuz i believe this is their 1 title since theyre from a bunch of exblizzard devs, so ill give it a chance, and since its f2p, it allows me the chance to do so. and lastly, splitgate is also f2p and monetized, but again, its not evil cuz the guys behind it arent from ea lol."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-19,"oh right this is for really lastly, just look at, again, diablo 4, paid yet it has a battlepass and scummy micros, so yeah idk how else to tell you that f2p has nothing to do with how evil something is lol."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,great work! where is heroes of might and magic 3? should be in the top 10!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"good work and an interesting list. the big problem with it is the sourcing. during the period from 1989 to 2000, there were dozens of pc game magazines that comprehensively reviewed computer games. they were far more indepth and they were contemporaneous to the games being released, not a list put together after years of hindsight. consequently, the modern list providers are going back thirty or more years, looking at hindsight memory and sales. games that definitely should be on this list are left out largely because their genres didn't grow into industry leaders, even though sports and flight sims, and puzzle games, were much, much bigger back then. games i would've expected based on their rep at the time would've included earl weaver baseball from circa 198687 wolfenstein 3d from 1993 the secret of monkey island from 1991 ish falcon 3.0 from 1990 or thereabouts wing commander from 1993, fifa international soccer from 1994 descent freepspace from 1998ish. that's just off the top of my head. but all of those were considered genredefining at one point, and certainly were among the best reviewed games ever. reviewing also used to be much tougher. modern games that get an 80 would often have been a 50 or a 60 in equivalents of the time. so operating from hindsight sort of robs this of accuracy, to me. but it's a good list, nonetheless."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"maybe i missed it but it's weird not seeing heroes of might and magic iii anywhere, as this is still a cult game..."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"awesome data! 1 question could you explain this part more? also gave a certain amount of extra points for simply being on the listotherwise games that ranked low would get basically no advantage over games that didn't rank at all. the amount differed based on whether the list was a top 50, top 100, top 200, and so on. making it onto more exclusive lists obviously granted more points. 1 maybe more of a comment than a question sorry did you control for date of release? as you've written it, any game released later than 2018 is disadvantaged by being excluded from evefifry previous list. what i mean is, hades or elden ring are excluded from lists before 2020 or 2022, respectively. i can see the justification here being that newer games should be disadvantaged in a best games of all time list to counteract the cultofthenew aspect, but i'd be intersted in how that was actually approached  dealt with, if at all. and finally, 2 comments  it's interesting that there aren't any vr games. beat saber is the biggest one that comes to mind. sports games in general are really underrepresented, i don't know if that's related.  pole position 1983 got robbed."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"is it just me or is this list just a tiny bit biased against pc games? world of warcraft completely redefined gaming, was the most popular game in the world for years, and isn't even in the top 30. same story for doom. and baldur's gate didn't even make the top100. and i could go on for a while. to be clear, not blaming op for that. they are just aggregating data. and it's a very interesting post. just speaking out about such lists in general."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"honestly? seems about as good as a list like this can be. i dont personally agree with it but i know my bias is all over the place and i can see reason for this list far more than any other ive seen recently. i am especially pleased with how high shadow of the colossus is, considering i hold it in extremely high regard."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"really interesting to see! i think portal is pretty much as close to perfect of a video game as you can get so it's weird seeing it so far down. same deal with hades, but that's less of a surprise due to its genre not being for everyone."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,blood absolutely deserves to be in top of all time lists. i didn't play it when it came out but went on a binge playing old games and it was one of the clear standouts alongside morrowind. i've played through it three times and the fanmade death wish campaign and it's just so damn fun.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i think these lists are pretty pointless usually so much about them is based on nostalgia and the time in which the games were released mario64 and mario bros 3 arent even close to being the best 3d2d mario games yet they are at the top

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,nice post! bloodbourne beating out dark souls and elden ring is certainty a surprise result for me.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"very cool post. i'm honestly surprised not to see total war in there at all, not even the heavy hitters like rome 1, medieval ii, shogun 2, warhammer. in fact strategy seems to be rather underrepresented generally, probably due to being largely pc only. some other omissions which surprise me  no hitman, no elite, no homeworld, no wolfenstein. morrowind not being on there when oblivion is is objectively mad, but makes sense given how oblivion benefited from solid console presence. tomb raider is shockingly low on the list given how massive it was. i'm surprised that bioshock is higher than halo. one other observation  an awful lot of massive franchises are woefully represented  almost all sports and racing games, but also major series like call of duty, medal of honor, battlefield. goes to show that people don't necessarily rate games they play the most of as being their highest quality gaming experiences."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,for me the biggest surprise is resident evil4. the game is amazing but 6th best of all time with so many games that created or defined genres bellow it? could it be due to the context of the year it released? or i'm just not seeing how good that game is?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"there's a bias in your data against games released after some of the polls were released, so only games 5 years old have the highest ranking potential. there's also recency bias though which maybe cancels it out probably not though."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"unless i missed it, command and conquer missed the list which is shocking. wasn't expecting top 10 but not even in 200?! also counter strike missing is crazy."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"overall a decent list. but a game like starfox 64 being there instead of warcraft 3 is a bit funny. wc3 is one of the best games of all time. amazing campaign, amazing online competetive multiplayer, amazing as an esport, amazing custom games with tower defenses, footman frenzy and of course dota. basically contained one of the best games in the world, that spawned a genre in itself."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i find nostalgia makes these lists useless. like objectively i can't really support the idea that tetris is a best game of all time, like sure i get how important and influential the game was for the industry at the time, but i don't think that makes it among the best. something can be influential and groundbreaking, but still be replaced by objectively better games they inspired."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"glad to see your shout outs to zork and terraria. most of this seems to fit my perception of what people have enjoyed, though i'm a little surprised hollow knight isn't in the top 20 or so, and shocked it's as low as 101. seeing shadow of the colossus up there. damn i wish the ps4 remaster and the ico remaster from the ps3, and the last guardian were available on pc."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i think what this shows is that to get a goty or similar has more to do with being easy for reviewers to play, aka narratively driven or relatively easy games as a whole. the list also heavily favour rpgs and fps games, we only have a handful of strategy games, a lot of which are civilization."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i think it mostly works, with a few notable exceptions. starcraft should probably be much higher, its a better game overall than say any gta entry by far. halo 2 should be way above dishonored 2 best mp halo hands down. fallout 3 is above portal and kotor. bg2, perhaps the best crpg of all time, should be smack dab next to chrono trigger. dos 2, oblivion way above that is silly. even da o righty above it is. deus ex maybe should be top 20 because it transcends just about every other game story by teaching you about how the real world works creeping centralization of power and authoritarianism. also no tribes 2"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"y'all need to stop trying to treat the list as a presentation of objective truth. the games are ranked as they are because the aggregated opinions of the reviewers and players work out that way. arguing about what is correct is pointless because everyone's enjoyment of a game is massively impacted by their own experiences and when in their life they play it. like 70 of the people you ask will tell you their favorite game was something they played as a kid. that's not because game develepment was objectively better then, they were just at a point in their life when it made a bigger impact."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,what i find interesting about this list is how it shows the goodness of a game is in part also its release date. eg. sim city probably doesnt make the list if it was released in 2020. so you could apply a further score mechanic that biases towards newer games and find the top ten games that anyone playing today should seriously consider playing. and of course on that list should be titanfall2

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"my issue with a lot of top game lists is it takes into account personal preference seemingly a lot more than game design or timeliness. oot being 1 is a hallmark of this tbh, that game does not hold as someone who didn't grow up with it. sm64 is a much better game to start playing now than ocarina is by far. even as a big fan of ffvii as i am, i probably would not put it in my top 25 best games of all time. it would be number one on my favorite games of all time or high on impactful games of all time up there with oot."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"the continual circlejerk around breath of the fucking wild is just completely beyond me. it is an utterly mediocre game at the absolute best. it does nothing new. it's fairly free of bugs is about the nicest thing i can say about it. the world is a massive empty field of nothingness. the physics simulation is incredibly limited compared to things like gmod we had 20 god damn years ago, the narrative is about as basic and poorly done as a narrative can be. can't even give it points for voice acting. they made a vanilla as fuck, empty, lifeless, collectathon game filled with 100 repetitive, identically themed dungeon puzzles that are simple enough for any 3rd grader to solve with little effort, and just the flatout most absurd weapon damage system i've ever encountered... and motherfuckers are insisting it's amongst the greatest games of all time. if that game had released as a new ip instead of a zelda sequel it wouldn't even have been in the top 20 games of the year it released, let alone of all time."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"this might be an unpopular opinion but i dont think the last of us 1 should be that high. on the one hand it is a highly influential title for narrative driven games. but it really only has the story going for it, the gameplay gets very boring and repetitive. i ended up enjoying tlou2 far more due to the gameplay i also really like the story of the 2nd one. there was a just a lot more to the encounters and freedom in how you approach them as well as the tools available. i would not replay tlou1, its kind of a slog to play through outside of the characters and narrative. i think it did a lot for the industry and it does tell a good story, but it is the awkward stepping stone, that has a lot of flaws that are especially noticeable after 10 years. i have similar feelings to gtav as well, have you tried replaying that game? it has hours of truly awful boring missions"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"interesting post. however, these types of list always favor the older games. as time goes by, newer games will start facing more competition due to the need to compete with sheer quantity of games being released in addition to competing with the already established leader, i.e. ocarina of time. imho, elden ring should be far higher up the list and baldur's gate 3 is easily the best game of all time. these kinds of list also favor the english speaking world, hence why you can see countries like the canadaausuk dominating the lists while in reality i feel eastern and central europe make games that are favorably comparable to those countries. also japanese dominance is something noteworthy. they are one of the least english speaking countries in the world, yet their performance is superlative. i'd imagine if more of these greatest lists came from asian countries, the gap would be even greater. there is some truth in the saying that japanese games are better."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"an interesting caveat with these lists is how exclusives and platform variations play into these lists. if platform has very important exclusives these will end up higher on the overall lists and more so if the platform has less choice  either games overall or in that genre  compared to competitors. maybe a flamebait example but would legends of zeldas be that high up in these lists if on one side the games themselves were multiplatform and on the other side, if the platform had more games? this is particularly interesting when comparing platforms that have many significant exclusives to pc but also in a less significant way across consoles and generations. metacritic top of al time lists are a good place to see that in action  check the multiplatform games starting maybe with gta or rdr2in most cases less targeted platforms get lower score for the same game and pc id usually lower than that. console differences vary by a lot but same game on pc pretty much universally gets lower score. with few examples of contrary  disco elysium is a notable one, i think. this is not to infer any of the games in the lists are bad, they are all extremely incredible. zeldas i used as an example are absolutely excellent."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"hot take ocarina of time has aged poorly. maybe it was the greatest of its time, but some of the combat mechanics are dated and clunky."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,dota 2 and deus ex too low on the list
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i really appreciate this post, but since we all have known for years that lots of game rankings and reviews are paid for or bogus, i'm well aware that even with an average, it's definitely skewed. there are genre defining games at the bottom of the list that honestly we would all agree would be much higher."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"unless i'm mistaken i'm not seeing red dead redemption 2 anywhere and i'm actually quite happy the first one does show up. for all the hype rdr2 gets, especially on reddit, i'm glad rdr gets some credit because it was always my personal opinion that it stands head and shoulders above its younger brother. could be a strong nostalgia bias though."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i have yet to play it, and i hear it's well deserved, but it always surprises me how quietly disco elysium moves up the ranks."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"the last of us story and storytelling is a solid 10 out of 10, it's so gripping. the gameplay is more like 710, it's descent, but there is so many annoyances, like enemies spotting you through a wall, or shooting you when a micrometer of your head is visible in a window. also movement is sometimes janky, both from you and the ai. the ai is wobbling between clever and very stupid at times too. i've still played it through several times, though i'd never punish myself with the higher difficulties, the scrounging gets really old as you play, even on first play through, after several you begin rembering where stuff is, but it feels annoying to have to find all the trash to craft stuff."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"seeing lists like this, makes me really want to try witcher again. i love games like that, but i couldnt get into it, skyrim aswell. i love open world rpgs but i found them both too overwhelming"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,ghost of tsushima being at 140 is an absolute crime

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"very cool. i just started my first playthrough of ocarina of time and in my opinion it will be regarded like the godfather. as in, completely revolutionary and amazing when it came out. huge impact on everything that follows. but when played today without context, hard to see what the fuss is all about. and for reference im mid thirties and grew up with a ps instead of n64  so never got to play a lot of the nintendo games as they came out. playing now on emulator via steam deck."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,this is awesome work. now i feel more shame for not playing resident evil 4 up to this date. i did something similar for rmovies at the start of the year and didn't get a single comment lol
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"thanks for compiling this list! in some ways, this shows how useless these kind of lists are, though  vanilla street fighter ii is on there the by far least refined version of that game but the one that of course had the biggest impact as is sonic 1 but not sonic 3 it's just a popularity contest and long running series are bound to get in their early installments as well, because have you actually played the very first zelda game recently? still some good stuff on here, don't get me wrong, and it's obviously not your fault, but it really shows what these lists really are. thank you!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,did i miss it or is there not mortal kombat games?

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,just seeing nier automata on the list makes me happy.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i feel like historical significance shouldnt be a factor in determining the quality of a game. i dont care what you say or the impact it had, super mario bros isnt a great game. its a basic and 2dimensional in more than one way game with very little depth aside from speed running. its also very short. this is not its own fault, but older games just dont have a chance. they walked so newer ones could run. ocarina of time is a great game, and introduced a lot of common features nowadays, but its nowhere near the quality of breath of the wild, any dark souls game, etc. thats just my two cents."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,this will be copy pasted by a news article saying a random redditor listed their favourite games...

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,im so confused. arent i supposed to be telling op what his top 25 games says about him? what is this!?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,do they want us to discuss what the list says about them or something else? it's been so long i've forgotten what to do.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i really hate how badly arcade games get ignored on these lists. so many of the best and most influential games from the first half of gaming history were arcade titles. oh well!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,it just brought a smile to my face to see it. many great memories.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"it should be top 20 tbh, incredibly unique and groundbreaking game. truly nothing else like it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,really hoping restitched does a good job of bringing that style of game to the modern era
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"yep, too bad the studio doesnt want anymore lbp anymore"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"other than street fighter ii and cod modern warfare, every game above wow on this list appears to be focused on the single player experience. they may feature multiplayer, but they have very strong single player. maybe that's why wow is only 31? i agree it's genre defining and has a huge player base."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"there are a lot of games that could be considered the goat of their genre that are way down on the list. from blizzard alone diablo 2  starcraft are both down around the 50 mark despite beng arguably the most culturally influential releases for both genres. rts in general is hugely snubbed with aoe2 down at like 120 and warcraft 3 not even on the list, which is insane considering the impact it had on the whole gaming landscape i get that custom games are hard to include on these kinds of lists, but how does starcraft 2 make a list like this but not wc3?. these genres just haven't been that relevant for the last 10 or more years so even the influential titles are thought of much later, especially since this is only looking at lists from the last 5 years."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"san andreas is probably the best gta for its time. it deserves to be up higher. i feel that gtav is very good, but benefits from recency bias."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"also, world of warcraft. defined a genre for almost 20 years. but always seems to get shafted on lists like this. it's the typical live long enough to become the villain type of thing, i think. they had an extremely good track record  but they also had enough time to make a huge load of mistakes. and that obviously shifts the perspective on the game."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"gta 5 being so high in general seems really weird to me. gta 3 and gta san andreas both seem to be more cultural standouts, not sure what makes gta 5 so worthy that its listed this high on so many rankings?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"my first thought too, obviously i'm biased but the fact that every game in the same genre for the last 2 decades has had the goal to be the wow killer and failed really says something."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"for other series differentials, i was shocked to see such a big difference between fo3 and fonv. i think if you flipped their relative spots no one would really bat an eye. fo3 was better received on release but nv has aged a lot better in the eyes of fans"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,in what fucking universe is earning 31 out of 200 spots getting shafted? what a daft take.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"youre misinterpreting the data. lists like these just take an average of how people feel about a game, and its usually a recent feeling shortly after these games come out. stuff like wow defining a genre for 20 yearstrue wouldnt be included in these numbers, and the numbers reflect the fact that a lot of people simply dont enjoy that genre of games at all. if you polled 1 million gamers today asked them to select games from a list that were extremely influential, and wow was on that list, im sure it would rank very high. basically what im saying is that youre right, but the list is also right. its like, by definition right since its simply averaging out ratings. it cant however tell you the things youre talking aboutinfluence."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,man big ups on that warcraft comment fr so true and its still the standard pretty much
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"csgo isn't even on the list and starcraft ii isn't in the top 100. it's interesting to me that some of the most iconic games ever made are just completely absent, but the bias is pretty clear competitive rtsfps are not what these reviewers focus on."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"the fact that wow isn't a top 5 game on every list is laughable. it was a cultural phenomenon. it's still a good game 19 years later. it still dominates an entire genre. it is, in my opinion, the single greatest game ever made. it's timeless."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"the fundamental issue with lists like this and by no means is this the fault of op since they just aggregated other lists is that they seem to mix up the concepts of best game, and most influential game and throw them into one list. if this is a list of best games, tetris doesn't deserve to be anywhere near the top like it currently is. tetris can be an enjoyable way to pass time, but it's hard to argue that it's better than most of the 195 other games on the list... if this was an influential game list, then it absolutely deserves to be there. but if this is an influential game list gta5 as you said doesn't belong this high up when it is effectively just a derivative of all the other 3d gta games, with the addition of some cover shooter and weapon wheel mechanics from other games that did it first. perhaps you could argue that the multiplayer influenced a decade of horrible microtransactions and live service games... but i think usually these lists look for a positive influence..."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,the fact that gtav is even in the top 20 is all i need to know about the quality of this ranking system.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"gta games have always been a big deal. gta3 changed video games, and pregtav, san andreas was nearly universally considered the best game in the franchise. had to be there, i guess."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,there's not a big number of pconly games on the list.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i think the issue with a game like wow or fortnite is the question of is the game actually good, or is it the community i.e playing it with friends because its so popular everyone plays it. ive played wow since vanilla, easily 100x more time put into it than any other game, but it would never crack my top 10 because it isnt the game itself thats good."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,its amusing to me because for me personally v is far and away the worst gta main game of the 3d era.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i will never understand why gta v is so highly praised. the campaign was incredibly boring, and the online mode is pay to win. it was technically impressive at the time, but the actual missions were largely forgettable and uninteresting outside of the handful of heists."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"gta v is at the 3 spot but the next gta is down at 60. if gta v was never made, would san andreas still be down there? the same happens with other franchises, imo. ffvi is quite down the list. ffix and ffx aged better than ffvii, and are further down. fft is even better and probably the best ff, but it gets shafted or forgotten frequently because it is not part of the main games so it gets even lower."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"to be fair, despite defining a genre it's bee riddled with questionable design choices that was only saved by the sheer number of players invested in the game. any new mmo making those same mistakes would not be nearly as big. wows current success would not likely be as intense if released today whereas all the other games on this list are static and stand the test of time"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"wow suffers from the same syndrome league of legends or path of exile do the fact that a gameplay loop is so addicting people are constantly playing like it's heroin doesn't necessarily mean the game is great, just that it scratches a certain itch nothing else can. in fact, with such rabid fanbases devoting so much time to the game, just one bad patch can ruin your perception of the entire experience and throw the game out of any top ten lists you could make. hell, i've played more than 15k lol matches and i wouldn't include it in my top 20 games of all time."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"recency bias has to be one of the reason wow isn't there. it was a genre defining game, a global phenomenon referenced on countless occasions in many spheres of life. yet the game's glory is tarnished by the last few debacles from blizzard."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"maybe, but also gta s.a. might not be remembered nearly as much if gta v wasn't keeping gta so relevant. for wow, i think it's acknowledged that it's a very different type of game. it's closer to a social media platformsecond life esque object than a game, and i think a lot of people who like wow can acknowledge that it's a really different type of object. wow also has the issue that it's perpetually difficult to play in the form it's being recommended in. oot just as an example is the same game it was on release, and it's arguably better as its puzzle style feels more relatively unique and its themes of nostalgia resonate much more now that it looks like a fossil. anyone who recommends wow is recommending a game that'll be qualitatively different very soon after the recommendation."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i think gta v is a unique beast in itself, gta online is one of the games most of my friends and other kids would go play through middle and high school. i dont see san andreas being that."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"yeah that's why i hate lists like this, they are always bad. for me a greatest game of all time list should rank everything purely on individual merit, i do not care about it's iconic or it's legacy or what is done for gaming etc i understand tetris and pacman did a lot for gaming at the time and also at the time they were considered amazing but with the thousands of releases since they should not be anywhere near the top 500 let alone top 10. you're telling me games like skyrim, binding of isaac and slay the spire aren't as good as the original tetris? that's insane and hurts the integrity of the whole list imo. and i know this post is a compilation or other lists and all that but it's just the issue with these lists in general"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i think that's really simple. wow wasn't that great. and it definitely isn't great now. wow exploded because of, essentially, technical and environmental reasons. the game was just good enough to enable said explosion. saying wow got shafted is like saying beat saber got shafted. they are mount rushmore games in terms of importance to the industry and social climate of gaming, but they didn't get there because they were singularly great. they spearheaded movements of moments in time in the industry. gta v or minecraft or halo show what happens when a game is that, and also great isolated. gta v has the great single player, and online for the impact on gaming culture. halo is mostly both. minecraft does both at once. because if you get down to it, most people who would say they loved wow actually loved the environment it created or the idea of wow. obviously there are people who just actually straight love wow, but they're much much more of a minority in comparison to the split for games like minecraft. all that meaning wow's impact ran well ahead of both how people reacted to and remember the game itself, and ahead of critique's conclusions."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,agreed on wow. should be a top 10 game on any list for any number of reasons.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"these lists are heavy on the singleplayer bias. they should rename it to best singleplayer games of all time. multiplayer games, especially competitive multiplayer games, will always be ranked low on lists like these. you know the stereotype about game journalists. haha."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"also, world of warcraft. defined a genre for almost 20 years. but always seems to get shafted on lists like this. it defined the genre that's maximally inaccessible. eve online is, i think, the best game i've ever played, but it's so damn inaccessible it can't possibly make a list like this. i can't play as an adult despite it being my favourite game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"also, world of warcraft. defined a genre for almost 20 years. but always seems to get shafted on lists like this. indeed. also, starcraft became a legit sport in some countries still low. mortal kombat spawned 10 great games, plus movies, series, comics and whatnot not even in the top 10 of franchisings but somehow half life and portal with only 2 games are there. i love the work done here, still something seems a little off."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"funnily enough pokemon is the opposite, rb almost always top lists even though they are the worst games in the series, just because they kicked it off"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i can't believe gta6 didn't make the list
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"the fact wow isn't on this list just shows most people don't count mmos in these lists, they seems to only rank single player experiences."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"wow didnt just define the genre, wow is basically the only mmo that has ever actually mattered. every few years a wow killer comes out and is crippled within 6 months even if you hate it, indisputably the most influential game ever made. if youve played pc games youve probably played a wow expansion"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,wow is 31
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i failed physics in 4th year because of san andreas. damn.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,to be honest the list doesnt really mean much and there are genres that just get excluded such as mmos or crpgs . video game review is a different thing to other media so stuff like nostalgia gets an extra boost and my point is super mario bros 3 isnt the 12th best game of all time . lists like this would take years of playing video game consistently to get a lost that isnt riddled with bias and whats populariconic so take it with alot of salt .
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"im not sure about wow. i think its getting a fair shake. it wasnt the most innovative game, following the forumla of everquest and ultimata online. if you want to call a game genre defining i think uo takes it for mmorpgs. i lost a lot of years to wow, but i wouldnt say it was the best. if it hadnt had the blizzard name and existing ip to push it, im not sure it would have done as well. just my .02"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"gta v being so popular never makes any sense to me, can someone explain? is the online mode that good? i played the single player pretty extensively and it was alright. nothing incredible and the story got a little disjointed at times because it was possible to do missions out of order for some reason. i only played multiplayer a couple times, maybe 2 hours max, and every time i would get killed by someone cheating over and over. i just don't get what's so great about it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i think yes about gta. great game. top 60 is huge
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i mean this is just popular games that the masses like that's all it is it's not a list of the best games it's a list of the most popular and mainstream games. yes i get it what other metric do we have to measure something's quality then by how well it sells i've heard this argument a million times i still don't buy it all you have to do is look at the top selling musical artists of every year and you can clearly see that it's not about quality.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,wow players hate the game almost as much as they hate themselves for continuing to play it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,san andreas is better in every way except graphics. should be waaaaaay higher.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i was looking for wow myself, and also kind of surprised to see blizzard not in the dev list. sure they are a shell of their former selves, but still a titan in the industry none the less."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"also, world of warcraft. defined a genre for almost 20 years. i think games like wow which are drammatically different based on versionpatchexpansioncommunity always suck there."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"looking at the comments this might be an unpopular opinion, but i don't think wow did anything novel or genre defining. they definitely hit that mmo formula perfectly to capture player interest more than any other mmo, but i can't think of anything they did that wasn't done already before in one form or another across other mmo games. maybe no one mmo game had quite the mix and set of features wow had, but they were still tweaks of already existing gameplay elements that you could find in other games."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i quit playing wow about 10 years ago, and i still somehow have over 10,000 hours played in it. i still get the itch to fire it up from time to time. don't feel that for any other game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"lists like these are better read as 200 most popular games of all time, rather than best. wow gets shafted because it's a pc exclusive with a high barrier of entry, ergo less popular among the general public. that's why over 70 of the list had a home console release."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,zelda always seems so over represented too.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,that's how it is for dota as well. way further down.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,open world games always have vast recency bias. hence why botw and gtav are so high up.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"sa should be higher but i can see why it isnt. certain parts of it have aged like shit. some of the controls like shooting suck and to be honest always sucked even back then but nobody cared because the rest of the game was insane. it is cool to go back and play it and see how much of its style, the loading screens, ui, writing etc still holds up today, just feels like im playing v in a shittier resolution on a small ass tv sometimes."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,it definitely is a weird sorting. resident evil 4 is only 6 because of the absolute bombshell it dropped when it first released and has nothing to do with how good it is now. yet wow sits at 31 even though its considered the best and is the most successful mmo of all time and held that title undeniably for about 67 years straight.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"is wow good, or just addictive?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"that's because lists like this don't matter. i've never owned a nintendo console, but i absolutely don't feel like i'm missing out on the best games of all time because i'm much more content with not owning nintendo products and getting my rpg fix from other games which are at least as good, but don't have a rabid fanbase of 11 year old trolls."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"also, world of warcraft. defined a genre for almost 20 years. but always seems to get shafted on lists like this. there's no denying that wow had one of the biggest impacts in the gaming industry. i think the reason why it isn't a 10best game is that it's too difficult to rate based on the total body of work. some expansions were bangers while others missed the mark. if individual expansions were included on this list, you'd probably see vanilla, tbc and wrath all inside the top 30, possibly inside the top 20."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"world of warcraft has its players, its players will either always keep coming back to it in phases or will just play it all the time. there are too many people who have never played and will never play it for it to be where it should be on these lists."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,amen. this list is great but wow is the best game ever made so far. i havent played it for 45 years but the memories in that game outshine any other memories where i have with a mouse in my hand.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i'll put it like this is wow my favorite vanilla game ? one of them sure, i'm a oot fan so that's 1. do i think vanilla wow is the best game ever developed? yes, yes i do."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"if you asked this same list 10 years ago, wow would have gotten first place no doubts. defined not just a genre but the entire mmo market and beyond. everyone wanted to be like wow, everyone wanted the money wow was making and everyone was playing wow. not only one of the biggest franchises ever made, but also responsible for modern blizzard as a whole."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"it's very important to acknowledge how these lists are made, what people's biases are etc. for example, many have pointed out how this list is absolutely dominated by single player games or games that mainly focus on it. this is understandable as with the notable exception of minecraft and a few other titles these games usually last the player between 20100 hours, most around 4060, and those hours are great. but looking at games like world of warcraft, league of legends, fortnite, destiny 2, etc. these are games that people often spend thousands of hours in. that has to count for something, right? in that time people often develop a... unique relationship with said game. there is the common saying that nobody hates game x more than x players. and still they play it day in and day out. these games are huge achievements and can provide good experiences a lot longer than any story game. but the first 60 hours you spend with a game like rdr2 are still incredible and unforgettable experiences, which is what these lists are biased towards. oh, and also nostalgia, that's a big one."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-01,i just cant believe 4 didnt make it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-10,i think mmos have to be excluded and categorized on their own

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"12100 and couple of those only few hours. made me realise how i have not played that many games, i just play same games long time."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,125 here. didn't include ones i only played a few minutes. maybe 130 if i did. played everything in top 20 except last of us played a few minutes only.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"recent bias in action. certainly a product of reviews still being in traditional media and magazines at the time. no one is going back on metacritic to review games they played 20 years ago. warcraft 3 spawned an entire genre of mobas in its wake and underpinned the most successful mmo of all time. all while being super popular and revolutionary in its own right. features we take for granted today like automatic match making, ranked play, modding communities, etc. took giant leaps forward in that title. it is easily one of the top 10 if not top 5 most influential titles of all time."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i played multiple hundreds of games in my life, warcraft 3 is still 1. it's just objectively such a fucking good game, from the campaign, to the sound design, music, atmosphere, story, competitive potential, responsiveness, character design, innovativity relative to its time, the custom games, replayability, the legacy it left, how well it holds up today. i'm sorry, but if a top 200 list doesn't include it, i can't take that list seriously. in no fucking universe 200 games are better than war3."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"league of legends and dota are on the list, both were spawned off warcraft 3. the spirit of w3 lives on."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"the big issue with judging warcraft 3, and by extension the frozen throne, is that most people didn't actually care about the game itself. warcraft 3 was seen by many as a game that existed solely for custom games. dota alone sold countless copies of warcraft 3, and dota had a much bigger presence in warcraft 3 than legitimate games of warcraft 3 did."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,warcraft 2  3
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"because it's a critic bias. the best game of the year tends to be a contest on who made the best storyrpg console game. other genres tend to get completely overlooked. i wouldn't worry too much about it though, because it's honestly harder to rank games that tend to be somewhat more niche, or that have more cultural impact down the line. it's way easier to critique a game based on its story than it's gameplay."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"how many rts games are on the list? i saw aoeii, but for the most part it's not a very popular genre."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,i'm more surprised overwatch is on the list even though it doesn't exist.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"hardly anyone played it, comparatively. there really weren't that many people playing on pc back then, just like now, as a percentage of the whole. i remember when i first played warcraft 2 on my friend's dad's pc. i got into pc gaming when my family first got a pc in maybe 1997ish. so lucky there, i got to play half life, homeworld, fallout 1 and 2, bg 1 and 2, warcraft, total annihilation, all when they were new. i used to love pc gamer magazine, and i remember that for years and years, the original half life was considered to be the best game out there. it was always 1. but what i remember more is that medal of honor took the top spot and stayed there for a really long time. i'm surprised it isn't in here at all, but it really isn't talked about now, at all. it's been forgotten, didn't age well and the franchise was beaten to death. same goes for deus ex invisible war was a disaster. talked about and talked about for years in pc spacespublications, but odds are most people playing games now wouldn't know it if they saw it barring the more recent additions. a lot of people maybe don't remember, but the expansions for warcraft 3 contained some eerily familiar twists on the rts system to make it play like an rpg, and it pretty much played like a precursor to wow. the wc3 mod scene spawned the concept of tower defense which was absolutely huge for a while, and the pvpve concept that became dota and all the other dotaalikes. same as arma pvpve mods  battle royale  pubgwarzone, dayz, etc."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,its probably because fallout 3 mostly worked at launch so its easier to review higher. fallout new vegas was a disaster at launch.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"everyone says nv is better, and i don't doubt that, but i could never get into it as much as 3. i tried twice, about 10 years apart, and didn't get far. fallout 3 on the other hand, i played that so much that it largely contributed to two red ringed xboxes. i also played it within the last few years, and got all the way through all dlcs and got most achievements again."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"new vegas grew in popularity over time. pretty much everyone i knew didnt like it much when it came out, including me. but, a couple of years later i picked it up and tried again and fell in love and is now one of my favorites ever. i think fallout 3 is very bethesda, immediately addicting and awesome and super fun world to just be in. new vegas is one that takes time to get into but i think is so much more rewarding once you do."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i agree with the placement but also agree that you would not have thought it would be that way round considering comments on many forums.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"fallout 3 was honestly a much more memorable experience for me. i remember most of the possible companions in fo3 and several notable npc's, the most memorable thing i remember about fonv was the start, the ranger base i spoke to three npc's using the same voice actor within two minutes of each other and then the ending i got. people love new vegas because it was obsidian returning to the franchise to fix bethesda's shortcomings. it fell flat for me."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i, like most, agree nv is far superior but its not too difficult to see why many rank 3 higher. the bugs and lack of polish in nv made it so much harder to enjoy. yeah 3 was still a bethesda game with all its warts but at least it functions. even to this day, i reinstall nv sometimes with a bunch of stability mods and it still crashes every 2 seconds."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"at the time, fallout 3 was insane. fallout nv came late in the console lifespan, was seen as dlc by some, was a buggy mess at launch, and to the laymen wasnt wow enough after fallout 3. it also didnt have the same marketing and hype around it. all that said nv is a way better game than 3 without a doubt in my mind"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"3 sold way, way more and was a flagship title for a new generation of consoles. nv is basically a great expansion for 3. its better for sure but was built so heavily on fo3 that it pales in comparison"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"new vegas may be be the better game, but its still fundamentally a derivative sequel to fallout 3, which meant that it was never in a position to be as disruptive to the industry as fo3. its harder to appreciate now that open world actionrpgs are so ubiquitous that the success of a traditional crpg like baldur's gate iii is considered newsworthy, but there was a time when the shift from traditional rpg combat as poorly defined as that is to action combat was deeply controversial. some of it comes down to timing, but between the weirdass vats system tricking rpg players into playing an fps and the physicsbased gore vanity cam tricking dudebros into playing an rpg, fallout 3 is arguably the game most responsible for the industry shifting towards arpgs and away from traditional rpgs."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"not me, i thought 3 was way better but i agree it seems to be an unpopular opinion these days. my reason is that 3 has a more emotional and cohesive story where as new vegas has a really strong opening and then it seems like the main story quickly unravels into a bunch of side quests."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,the joke was you could watch a saturday morning cartoon in the time it took to go through most doors in new vegas. the joke didn't exaggerate much. perceptions of the game improve exponentially as the perspective person tried it later in time.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,new vegas had poorer ratings on release because of how buggy it was and the poor performance. once the patches fixed it however it was vastly superior to fallout 3 in every way.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,half life alyx is vr and made the list. newer games are naturally disadvantaged and theres not really a good way to fix this without giving them some type of consolation points for lists they werent yet released forbut i also cant just assume they wouldve been on those lists.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,pc gaming is less accessible. the reach of nintendo consoles is insane. people who haven't played a game won't vote for it no matter how good it is. pcexclusives also include the more complex games that were too hard to develop for console as well as indie games that benefitted from pc being a more open platform. having a smaller audience is inherent to both.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"the same can be said about pokemon. as iconic as red and blue are, those games are broken as shit and later iterations are so much more polished. hell even leaf green and fire red are a huge improvement on the originals. but nostalgia be a hell of a drug"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,then what about metal gear solid at 7? mario 64 at 9? have those aged all that well?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i was looking for this. super mario kart 1992 wasn't that popular at all and isn't very good. mario kart 64 1996 was incredible and somehow not on the list at all? i will also accept double dash i can only imagine people think mario kart 64 is actually super mario kart since that is the first one they know in the series. otherwise i feel like i'm taking crazy pills. super mario kart 1992 is garbage to mediocre. no game deserves to be on a list if it's sequel made the original completely obsolete or at least higher than the more popular sequel, like how portal 2 is higher than portal..."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"because games age differently than movies . old games usually miss a lot of qol stuff we take for granted today , like fast travel , no durabilityinventory limit, minimaps and many other things you just don't think about because every game usually has them movies don't suffer from that . aside from cgi and visual quality, a movie filmed and edited on 30 year old hardware wouldn't be so different from the same movie filmed and edited on modern hardware."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"the bioshock love is utterly baffling to me. i played it on release and had a good time, but forgot it very quickly. i can think of a bunch of similar first person games that were better to play and more memorable."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i think it would be nearly impossible to get an agreed upon top 10. games never age well. even the best ones are worse now than on release. but, given that, botw seems like a fairly safe pick. and i mean that literally. it's extremely polished in basically every area, from gameplay to story to visuals. it's one of the few games where it's really hard to find generally objective critiques. that's why it's here lots of other games have flaws that will push them out of the top 10 on various lists, whereas botw is a safe inclusion on all of them. also it did all that on the wii u, so given that handicap i think 2 is justifiable."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,maybe swap it with mario 64.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,and here come the zelda haters botw made the wife if my best buddy into a game at her late 30s and she even started going to graphic design school afterwards quitting her job i really understand that botw fails to make a few hardcore gamers online happy and its ok  no game wins everyone over  but i read so many comments here slandering the game by people who do not understand its game design philosophy and that makes me sad
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,i actually laughed out loud when i saw it
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,2 is too high but you cant deny what it started in the industry. its a top 25 in the all time.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,and this comment was right here is why internet opinions should be discarded. you have no understanding of why it deserves that spot.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"agreed. combined with ftl, they are the best example showing that you can create the feeling of exploration while being the opposite of an open world game. on top of that, sts is mechanically distinct and fun enough that it spawned an entire ecosystem of stslikes. and even though it was released almost 5 years ago, i still think it is the best of its kind."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"oot is like citizen kane. we all just collectively agreed it's the best and we just don't question it. it's not my favorite game, but if i saw the witcher 3 above it, i would think that's not right."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,gta 5 at 3rd is weird to me.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"the weapon break feature nearly ruined the game for me. botw and oot are awesome games, for sure, but the greatness of zelda started with a link to the past for me. man, what a game!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i feel like elden ring would be much higher but it released after half of these articles came out so the fact its at the 60 spot is pretty crazy
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,this is the problem i have with greatest game ever lists  they're scored on how good they were for their era and also just nostalgia. like is zelda oot still the best game we have in 2023? it would be interesting to see the top 100 lists of the younger generations in comparison to millennials.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"don't worry , as long as you are having fun you are doing it right"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,compared to most other games on this list it's quite obscure. the fact it's in here speaks for it's quality i think.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,same. i play suikoden i and ii every couple years. the nostalgia just hits different.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i wasn't expecting top 10, but not seeing terraria on this list at all is surprising."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"is it really that biased? zelda has always been the benchmark for single player dungeon crawling and puzzle solving, and mario basically invented the modern day 3d platformer. skyward sword is considered one of the worst 3d zelda's and i agree with that statement, yet i still can't think of a single adventure title from that console generation with better designed dungeon and puzzle mechanics than that one outside of okami. if that title is considered a low point for a franchise, then i don't really understand how people can think that it's overhyped or biased."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"what is up with rgaming's heavy antinintendo slant? i've seen like several posts on this thread wondering why nintendo has so many highly rated games. a lot of these games are just obviously good. i have heard people love and consider ocarina of time and majora's mask their favorites for decades. same with games like super mario 64, galaxy, odyssey. same with metroid and metroid prime. anyone who grew up gaming throughout the 90s, 2000s, and 2010s just... shouldn't be surprised that nintendo dominates a large part of this list."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,it's because these all time lists are heavily swayed by nostalgia and nintendo ruled the community for a long time.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i mean, honestly, the fact that basic games like that make it so high is a testament to how important they are in the grand schemes of things. is tetris a graphically impressive game? is it the most techinically challenging game of its time? probably not in both cases, but its impact on gaming as a whole gets it so much credit. its a game that everyone and their mothers have played. its has world wide recognition. it is a game that has inspired other newer puzzle games. in the micro is tetris the 5 game of all time. no. in the macro? does it deserve top billing, hell to the yes."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,tetris is amazing
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"completely agree with you. just played through the remake actually, and while i enjoyed a lot about it, the gameplay and map design was ridiculously simple and not really worthy of top 25 of all time considering some of the games with both amazing gameplay and other aspects as well."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"gameplay wise, sure. but writing and design?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,there is a remaster with improved controls if thats whats bothering you.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,the hate around the sequel is because of the poor story direction

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"absolutely, i was just thinking the same thing! the first one has a very classic buttonmashy vibe but the second is an actual game with a lot of interesting mechanisms and tons of replayability"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"no fps would be on this list were not for halflife uh.. doom existed before halflife did. i'm not arguing that halflife wasn't a revolutionary game, but even halflife has to give credit to games that which came before it, and inspired it."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"sources are biased mostly by being recent. wildly disagree. doom, halflife, etc. whenever they list alltime they are biased towards nostalgia, ie age or at least age of series zelda, mario."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,yeah hl1 being that low is really surprising. hl2 should even be a bit higher. there's no way biohock if better than hl2
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"not deniyng recency bias here, that certainly exists. but a game can be a genre definercreator or popularizer, and still not hold the test of time. whatever half life holds upthe original, not black mesa is up to you, i personally dont think it holds up to well. and a game of all times needs to at least partially account for what if its played today. you can give older games leeway in graphics and presentation, but if otheraspects that are not explained by its old are worse then contemporary today then thats that."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,botw  yes ocarina of time  no

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,the problem with a lot of these lists is that it factors its impact by the time it was released. was it the best game in 1998? it probably is. is the the best game in 2023? highly doubt it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,ignorance.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,give it 5 years. it will be very high on these lists
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,it was probably compiled from lists that don't have it yet listed as it's brand new and hasn't received goty yet

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"nah it aint  the fact that it is basically okay for all ages, is a quintessential adventure with fully open world and exploration unseen in a game before it, that games like genshin impact ripped off because it was so great and groundbreaking at the time is what makes it such a great game. if its not your particular favorite, at least get your insult right. zelda isnt just for kids. and breath of the wild is not very overrated."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i have played a lot of zelda and i know i am in the minority of people in the same situation as me, but botw is just more fun to play than any of the other zeldas. i absolutely loved the stories of like oot and majora's mask, but even as a kid when they were all i had, the puzzles felt nonsensical and the back and forth felt frustrating"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,lmao its literally the best zelds game and its not even close. you are in such a tiny minority but you think youre loud because youre screeching.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"by this logic, all these games will mage outdated in like 30 years. this is an evolving art form. nostalgia is part of the bias but also these games are good in general."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"nostalgia plays a huge part. modern games have never been better, especially this year."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"man that's wild. i can still play oot it holds up so well. yes it's showing its age but when i played it on release it was life changing. gaming was never the same and it shaped the genre. when i played elden ring i beat godrick or we his name was and lost interest.  although great, i do agree that botw is a bit overrated."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"its not a perfect comparison at all, but its like silent film and movies with sound. the arcade experience was undoubtedly hugely influential to all of gaming as we know it, but the last two cultural generations dont really even have a reference point for it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"not super shocking. they had a huge influence, but i'd rather play just about any game on the snes than most classic arcade games, and i love arcades. i worked at one when i was 1620, and a common sight was a 50 yearold getting excited to see the old games, head over, sit down for 15 minutes, then look bored, get up and leave. outside of breakout, centipede, and a few others which hold up and are still just extremely fun in 2023. those games were always taken and had a few extra people watching."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"just out of curiosity, which games are you referring to? funny enough, i went the largest arcade in america last week galloping ghost and played a couple of these games. i was pretty upset i couldn't find marvel vs. capcom 2. maybe it was out of service."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i think most of these lists kinda ignore mmorpgs in favor of single player story based games. with special exceptions for shooters and fighting games. but i think the reason is because most of compelling nature of mmorpgs and the motivation to continue to play is dependent on the social circle you engage with. someone who plays wow or eve online probably wont play long if they dont get involved in a solid clan or corp or group. mmorpgs, when you take away the mmo part dont always hold up against the others on the list. they are a different breed."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i feel it's really hard to quantify how good a multiplayer game is, since it's so intrinsically linked to each one's own personal experience that's going to vary wildly depending on when they started to play it, how good the servers were, how toxic other players were in their servers, how many mods and customization options were availableallowed on those servers and probably other factors that haven't even crossed my mind. wow has an even greater variable considering how long it's running, player experiences in each time and expansion is going to be very different."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"idk why you're being downvoted for this. i think the wording was slightly aggressive, but you absolutely nailed my own thoughts on the matter. lists are cool to read, and finding similarities or general good qualities for games to have is always fun. ultimately, though, everyone has experienced games differently. i've never played wow, so i have no idea what it has defined for the genre. i have played er, botw, dmc games, etc. it is cool to see these, but it is ultimately the individual who decides how important or good the game is."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i would much rather play tetris than the glitchy, boring mess that is skyrim, but i think your optics are off even further than you realise. i had 8 people in my apartment last night and i showed off my mame arcade cabinet. people wanted to play pacman, donkey kong, and street fighter 2. they had the option to play anything up to the end of the dreamcast era. people love the classics for good reason."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i mean, tetris is 5. thats ok though."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"youre right, but thats why wow is revered. mmos were clunky messes until blizzard came along and polished and streamlined it. and i think thats what mmos needed into order to fully come into their own."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"lmao, you think more people have played portal 2 or shadow of the colossus than wow? the game literally defined the genre for 19 years and you think not enough people have played it to warrant a higher spot on the list?"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,100. the world of games has changed monumentally since the likes of warcraft 3 and many other old genre defining games. many of which are ignored or put so low on the list to be a little insulting. botw is maybe a top 50 game while halflife somehow doesn't make top 50.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"wc3 deserves top 10 at least for the impact it had on gaming, people still play dota, lol and wow to this day. and also it's like a top 10 game based on its on merit."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,warcraft 3 was for a while the biggest esport in the world behind only cs 1.6.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"dota had a much bigger presence in warcraft 3 than legitimate games of warcraft 3 did. i don't think that's true at all. dota was the most popular custom map at the time but there were other custom maps with an active player base as well. even all custom maps combined weren't anywhere near as popular as classic wc3 was though. that being said, today wc3 is mostly known for it's esport scene and custom maps but back then it was primarly known for it's excellent campaign. the moba genre only became mainstream popular around 2010 when games like lol and heroes of newearth came out."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i may misremember but i feel like you are overselling dota here, warcraft iii was pretty big."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,what? wasn't it famous for its campaign first?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,warcraft 3 esports was huge for a while and i've seen several people say it has the best campaign of any real time strategy game.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"my personal experience with warcraft 3 was the inverse i only ever played the single player, touched a few mods, and to this day couldnt tell you what dota is."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,dota had a much bigger presence in warcraft 3 than legitimate games of warcraft 3 did. lol youre out of your mind. you clearly werent around in wc3 prime days.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"this is completely false. warcraft 3 was an absolute milestone and was extremely popular online too. dota came much, much earlier. you know which game actually sold millions of copies and never got played original half life. i remember at the times of counter strike 1.6 asking my clan mates who of them played hl, none did, i only got to the room with the lasers and got bored. that's not to say that hl hasn't had millions of fans and people that played it, but i'm quite sure more of the keys sold where for the mods. i really don't think that was the case with dota."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,that shouldn't be a negative against it and anyways the campaign was great and everyone was raving over it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,this. i got it the year it came out and never once played the storyline.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,how do you think dota became so popular? it's because a lot of people were playing wc3 in the first place. just because dota eventually took over as the bigger reason people played doesn't mean it wasn't immensely popular in the first place.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,this is just insanely wrong.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"some pretty weird takes here honestly. warcraft 3 sold over a million copies in the first month. im not sure how you could argue that hardly anyone played it, it was a massively popular game. also your history of the games spawned from it is pretty flawed. tower defense games and dota precursors both existed in starcraft before warcraft 3 existed."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"quick question, might this be geographical? almost everyone i knew growing up in the 90s were pc gamers, warcraft, starcraft, cs, quake, diablo were the go to games in denmark. there might be a console bias for the us and a fair few other countries."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i think not including wc3 runs into the issue of it being a game with staying power. it still has esports tournaments and pro players. few games have lasted as long as it has in the pvp genre without being replaced by the new thing. i will agree it is more famous for its custom games and that they sold more copies than the base game. that should count as part of its strength and not detract from it. there was more content there than in any other game until roblox or modern sandbox games.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,things that are good don't need to get milked until they lose all relevance they once had. let bioshock be good and let it inspire new things or let the studio make a new good ip.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"2 was fine, it was an extension of one which made it tolerable. infinite was like playing a different franchise. i was shooting rocket launchers and was recharging halo shields before the first set piece. no tension, no drama, no mystery just explosions."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"infinite had problems, but was vastly better than bioshock 2 i don't think i could disagree with a gaming opinion any harder. infinite has absolute dogshit gameplay compared to 2. like the design decisons in infinite just had me angry the whole time i was playing it. maybe the worst game i have ever played to completion."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"which game, bioshock? i mean, it depends on the time youre viewing it from. sure, now its gameplay might not be considered something special, but 2007 was a different time"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"going back now, bioshock 2 is much more playable by modern standards as it refined on all the aspects of the original. it might not have the twist of the first game but imo it's the better of the trilogy"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,the first bioshock's gameplay was definitely innovative when it came out. no other game before it did special abilities  fps as well.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"wow you're right, i'm also shocked titanfall 2 isn't up there! one of the best fps campaigns ever"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,terraria is literally one of the best selling games of all time and is famous for all the free updates it's released.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i'm with you, and i love both. but 3 was a way cooler area to explore and i had a lot more fun with it than i did nv. nv had a better story but felt like nothingness to me in between plot points. can't wait to get flamed for this comment."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"exploration is much better in fallout 3. everyone makes a big deal about choices in nv, but they arent as earth shattering as everyone makes them out to be."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,fallout 3 has less rpg elements than nv
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"fallout 3 does a great job of slowly showing you how the game works and opening up at the right times and guiding you to be in the places you should be without overwhelming the player whereas, new vegas just kind of throws you out there and hands you a lot of different systems and elements pretty quickly, which i think makes it a little too complicated for the average gamer."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"yeah, it's funny nobody ever talks about that. i wasn't high on fo3, but immediately enjoyed nv. some of my friends and people i know irl didn't like it though, and i saw that sentiment echoed a lot online. flash forward to now and it's considered the definitive fo experience to the point where people are begging obsidian or bethesda somebody to make a worthy spiritual successor."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"seconded. whenever people praise nv like it was an instant classic, i have to wonder if i slipped into bizarro world, because back when it came out, i remember both the outlets and the online discourse loathing it as a cheap, rushed cashgrab dlc sold at full price. among all my friends, both online and offline, i was pretty much the only one who liked it, warts and all, and seeing it getting unanimous praise nowadays and everyone pretending they always loved the game is just baffling."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,it still is massive. hundreds of thousands of people have been playing it every day for more than 2 decades. how many other games can say that?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"paradox strategy games are a very niche market. they have a very solid fanbase, but they were never truly big enough to be featured on lists like this and i say this as a fan."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"this is going to be countered at least somewhat by the other flaw in the methodology. points are given solely by ranking regardless of year. therefore newer games are going to get fewer points because they didn't exist when several of the polls used were created. a game in 2023 could be 1 on every list created after the game was released, and still get fewer points than an older game that scores even moderately on every source used, because they get 10 extra scores to add to their total."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"why, when emulation is so easy?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,theyre really great and also overrated. theres a lot of games in the series so id check some out.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,skyward sword and phantom hourglass are both absolute bangers in my opinion. spirit tracks though... boy that game is rough.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"they're good games, but a more important reason is that they're very casual friendly while still offering an actual gameplay experience, rather than something arcadey. very few casual games manage to get anyone invested in them, and zelda has built it entire legacy on it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,botw is very different from most zelda games. i wouldn't write off the series as a whole just cause you didn't like botw
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"between breath and tears, i think tears is a better game overall, although it does get a lot of criticism for being botw 2.0. the building mechanics alone make it much more interesting and fun to experiment with, and there's a wider variety of enemies. weapon degradation is still there, but the fusion mechanic more than makes up for it there's also an enemy in the game that allows you to restore weapons, although i'm not sure if that was intentional on nintendo's part. both games are also very different in the franchise for not relying on linear story progression. ocarina is probably the most nostalgic out of all of them. it introduced many musical motifs that have since become a mainstay in the franchise, and it has so many memorable characters and moments. that said, the gameplay and camera do suffer from that early 3d jank like many games in that era. if you ask individual zelda fans what there favorite game is, you're likely to get wildly different answers, but i think that's a testament to the franchise as a whole that you can have so many different experiences depending on the game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,tears of the kingdom isnt up there. its ocarina of time.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"huge same. i played zelda oot when i was a kid and it was by far the greatest gaming experience of my life. then majoras mask, which was amazing but not as revolutionary. then sort of lost interest, tried twilight princess and didn't like it. fast forward to last year i pick up botw to play with my son. he loves it, similar magic to oot i experienced, but for me...not so much. it's really just uninteresting, feels very flat and procedurally generated. fun to see it through his eyes though, i just pretend to be having more fun than i am. honestly zelda fans will just give their games a 12 point bump for nostalgia, which pushes it into overrated terrority."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"try a link to the past. different game from a different age, but i think it still stands strong. the world is much, much smaller than botw but is much more dense. the dungeon design is top notch. you will get lost, you will get confused, and you will die. but that's all a part of the adventure. i'm curious what is in your top 10 if they didn't get near what you see in the top 10 here."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"by far, still has some gems though but it was better before breath of the wild. does my head in when people claim it's the best game of all time. it's just an open world rpg, but 10 years after everyone else started doing them."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"the games appeal to a very broad, general audience. fantastic for true casual gamers, but often pretty boring for people that want more than that. so yeah, overrated is probably a good way to describe them? they're solidly good games almost all of them, but nothing particularly exceptional. but they appeal to a wide audience so they do extremely well on ratingpolls like this, as they should tbh."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"my number 1 zelda game changes almost everyday of the week but it rotates between breath of the wild, link to the past and windwaker"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"this basically, don't get me wrong i myself love most zelda games and several are amongst my fav of all time but there is no denying just putting the name zelda on the box bumps the rating by about 10"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"great comparison, nintendo to pop music. definitely both are made by talented individuals, but the actual product is nothing special or innovative. frankly every game has been the same for like 20 years. like how do you even rank one super smash over the other? theyre all the same."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,yeah problem is there are too many people that these rankings are overly important. i love a lot of games that have good rankings and reviews but a few of my all time fav games are also games that arent as highly reviewed.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i couldn't disagree more, baldur's gate 3 was the proof that it wasn't me getting older and more grumpy, it showed that i still could enjoy games like i did 25 years ago. high budget games are being made for the lowest common denominator, maximizing profits over innovation, depth and fun. and it has all to do with how the industry is set up at that level, where games are made with investors putting money in with the guarantee they get more money out. stopping devs from taking any risks. a game like bg3 isn't perfect, but it shows what's possible if you don't have to stop development when market research tells your return on investment will only decrease by allocating more dev time. when was the last time a aaa studio surprised you with something new and interesting? and we're not talking here about better graphics or executing a proven genre to perfection."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,a pretty good comparison. i also think that a big part of it is that arcade games were much better enjoyed in the arcade environment competing with friends for high scores. i feel like most people who try an arcade game for the first time today will play maybe four or five rounds and then never touch it again.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i would say that neither space invaders nor galaga not being on the list is outrageous. frogger, asteroids, centipede, missile defense and many other arcade classics i would expect to see at least one or two of these on here."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,im guessing you never spent a fair amount of time creating levels or playing user created levels. the amount of things you could do with a little creativity was astonishing. idk how anyone could get bored with it as a platformer honestly.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"mmorpgs are also notoriously difficult to review. reviewers don't have the time to invest, and people looking for a new mmorpg will use word of mouth to find it  they'll play what their friends are already playing."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"yeah my wording could be better but ranking tetris over thousands of other titles is crazy, it's fun but there's hundreds of mobile games people would call crappy that are more fun, it simply can't compete with modern games. also the other commenter who mentioned gta v is number 3 but san andreas is down at like 60. if rockstar shut down for whatever reason and san andreas was the last gta game ever then it would shoot up to like 7ish on lists like this because you would need to represent an iconic franchise near the top as opposed to it just being ranked on its own merit."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"that may be but for how long would they play those games? i mean, i had a ton of fun with lemmings, worms, wolfenstein or duke nukem as a kid but i surely would not have a long time of fun with those games. when i fire up a newer game wich is not on that list i would most likely get hours of fun out of them. thats not because the old games were bad, but games as a whole evolved. there are for sure some outlierlike the og pomemon, old zelda games, evergreens basicaly but the majority of newer games is superior to the majority of older games imo."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"honestly, i have no interest whatsoever in buying an overpriced switch and paying full price for games that are years old. and since i can emulate them and have chosen to play other games instead, i don't think some of the games being on a best games ever list is necessarily convincing or compelling enough to get me to emulate. there are other games that are incredibly good that don't require jumping through hoops to emulate or forking over unreasonable sums of cash to a shitty company to play."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i think you misunderstood what i meant and thought i think wow should be at 31. more people will look upon those games more favorably than they would wow. wow in my opinion should be easily regarded as the best video game of all time, its longevity and amount of users over those years surpasses anything we probably will ever see online. wow easily should be 1 on every best video game of all time list, but like i said, there are too many people who make a point of never playing wow for it to be placed higher on opinion lists."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"hardly anyone played it, comparatively, is what i said. if you were to go around asking people who played computer games in 2002 have you played warcraft 3?, i think you'd find that the vast majority of them had a ps2 or some older console and didn't know what warcraft was. nearly 20 million people bought ps2s in 2002. that was also around when vice city came out, which was a ps2 game first and foremost same as san andreas. people on this specific website might be more inclined to think otherwise, but there's a selection bias at work there because people on this site are more likely to have grown up with pcs. you're right about starcraft, i'd forgotten about that. back then regular internet access was not common. i didn't play starcraft, didn't know anyone who did at the time, slipped my mind. the ones that took were derived from wc3, is what i should have said."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"yep, same experience here. '96 kid. everyone and their father not even figuratively played war3, diablo 2, age of empires, cs, metin 2, gta sa, or cod 2. not a single kid in my school had a console. we all played on pc. i think the more you go east in europe, the more prevalent it becomes."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"not in terms of country, but maybe by wealth. you had to have a pc in the house. internet access was another thing entirely. the console 'bias' is and was universal. there's also the fact that having a pc and being a pc gamer meant that you'd naturally gravitate to other people like you i did. pc wasis a tiny industry compared to consoles. it might just be that you were from the right kind of place where people had and could afford pcs. out of the people i knew back then, same time, only a few of us played pc. most people had playstations. statistically, i think you'd find that by the time wc3 came out, the console market was 30x larger mostly ps2 than the pc market. that's why the 2000s was so shit for pc gaming, lot of big releases were halfbaked console ports for over a decade. remember you're on reddit, not out in the world. good chance you're a technologically literate 30something year old male who grew up in a reasonably wealthy household and you knew other people like you."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i wouldn't call bioshock innovative. bioshock was the spiritual successor to system shock 2 hence the name, which introduced pretty much all of the gameplay concepts in bioshock also the plot was very similiar, with the same basic story and twists just in a different setting. what bioshock did was perfect the formula. ss2 was a great game but had serious balancing problems with the tech tree."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"in fallout 3, the main plot doesn't take you to much of the map at all, when you look at it. fnv takes you all over the place. and sidequests are often triggered in places where the main plot takes you. so fallout 3 rewarded exploration more. all sorts of side quests hidden where you actually had to go and search them out. plus the encounters in the wasteland were completely different. in fnv, you could say now a gecko will run in from the left, whereas in fo3, the best you could say is something will happen in this place, when i come up to it for the first time. here's jon, from many a true nerd, with 2 hours on why fo3 is good. httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v5z8xhe2noae"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i'm so glad this thread has allowed me to finally find the words i need to properly express how i feel about the games. it also makes me realise that baldur's gate 3 has most of the things about both that i like most, and lacks many of the elements i don't. as much as i loved oblivion, fallout 3 was probably the first game that made me fall in love with open world exploration and side quests."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"speaking as a pc gamer, the only console brand i buy is nintendo, mainly stemming from the fact i want to play zelda and mario. pretty much all of the mainline games with those ip are gonna be good. i have yet to be disappointed."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"if you were actually part of the nintendo community, you'd realize they're usually just as critical of nintendo games as anyone else. alot of nintendo games are just actually super good."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,people will really choose to get an olympic medal in mental gymnastics before admitting that nintendo makes great games.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"nintendo games routinely place higher than they should am i correct to assume that 1994 is the year you were born? are you actually aware how much influence nintendo had on almost every game you play nowadays? be it with mario 64oot or analogue stick, rumble, motion control, digi pad, trigger button, shoulder button etc."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"or maybe they actually make good games, think about it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i don't really care for nintendo. i always skipped their conferences at e3. just not my typical kind of games. i did play a couple pokemon and zelda games on gameboy when i was a kid though. i did also buy a switch just for botw. i now own 2 games on the switch. botw and totk.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"quite unlike anything any other developerpublisher has there have been published comparisons of nintendo and apple loyalty for decades, so its not entirely unique in its influence."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"yeah it's like the equivalent of disney, both are quality products but they place higher than they should"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"nintendo games routinely have flaws that would be inexcusable in other games that the fans totally ignore. nintendo the company has some horrid practices, and they would be discussed in the same breath as ea if it weren't for the reality distortion field."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,yeah i agree. i like most nintendo games but almost none of them rank in my top favorites. i dont think ill ever get the zelda fascination.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,they also have a ton of people who drool over nostalgic feelings like why is mario bros 3 even in the top 100? let alone so close to the top
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-08,and patrick...what is the reason why they are diehard?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,because they are brilliant games and one of a kind.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"it's so easy to take this stance if you didn't actually play it at the time, and instead just in reflection. it was literally game changing in every way for the genre. it's easy to look back in hindsight and recognize its faults"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,wrong comment?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,y'all should bone
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"to be fair those are very different than previous zelda games. the traditional zelda formula has never really hooked me, but i loved botw and totk."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i haven't played the other zelda games. so i can't comment on them. i do believe you that for example ocarina of time is very different though and it perhaps it was revolutionary at the time of its release. i didn't play it back then though, so it can't have an educated opinion on that game. it's difficult to revisit games that old and adequately judge them. same with a game like morrowind. i think that game was mindblowing at the time of release, now it feels rather dated. my problem is that zelda fans absolutely rave about botw and i personally found it a very middling game. so i'm just very skeptical about what those same people have to say about games in general. simply based on how a lot of people go crazy for botw, i've always just assumed that there are a lot of zelda fans who are dedicated nintendo gamers and who have not played openworld games with actual qualitative content like rdr2 or the witcher 3. maybe that's an unfair assumption though."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,tears is 1000 a better game in every aspect. its does everything better and is easily one of the best games ever made
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"yeah they're still good but they're not top of all time, breath of the wild was so popular because of the switch and nintendo gamers wanting an open world like other franchises that have been popular, even halo eventually jumped on that train. neither infinite or botw are revolutionary or of spectacular quality lol but thoughts like these bring haters"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"botw is really good but god did it not feel like a zelda game to me. what i love the most about zelda is that you know youre in for a grand, epic adventure with ancient magic, ruined temples, etc and a straightforward but cool story and lore. but botw felt more like a theme park than an epic adventure to me, a lot of time because i felt thrown from gimmicky mini game to mini game for hundred of hours. great fun to be had but not what i sought when i played it. i found that more in elden ring, funnily enough. the darksiders game are also amazing zelda like with a bit tougher gameplay and a not very cheery universe"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,it's because nintendo gamers are a completely different set of people and target audience. it's kinda wild how disconnected they are from the rest of the games industry.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"water temple is overrated, difficultywise. it climbs up people's lists because they have ptsd from doing it while having a smooth, 10 yearold's brain."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i started the demo and realized my kids need their father so i deleted it and never went back.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"yeah, it's not nostalgia. with hindsight, you'd have to wait like, 15 years or more for an arguably better game, and you'd really have to argue."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i haven't played sekiro yet, but elden ring fuckin' slaps. that game is seriously incredible."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"yeah elden ring will be a universal top 20 in another decade, if not top 10."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"minmaxers sometimes think that because an exploit exists, that they must use it, and then complain that the game is trivialized because of its existence that they chose to use."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"ironically that sounds like my experience with breath of the wild! i found it a total bore to play. i don't think outer wilds is about a 'big reveal' at all. certainly it has some, but it's more a series of smaller discoveries on the way. anyway, as they say the less said about the game the better as discovery is pretty much its main selling point, but if it's not doing it for you so far then too bad. it probably doesn't help that it's been hyped up beyond belief."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"yes, but collectors aren't ranking their collection based on best of all time. most influential, maybe, but not best. it's an entirely different metric. because the best cars of all time list if aging is removed from the equation would be dominated by modern cars, which have infinitely better safety, faster speeds, better suspension, softer seats, etc, etc. video games aren't quite as bad as cars for that, but both graphics and gameplay are features that age extremely poorly. every generation gives much better graphics, so every game aiming for top tier graphical fidelity is going to look bad in hindsight. gameplay of popular games also gets ripped off and refined, so what was once revolutionary gameplay becomes modern day cliche gameplay. it's impossible to separate such things when talking about best. each person has their own metrics for determining how much gameplay and graphics aging affects them. for some people, what might matter is just how they felt when it first released for others, it might matter how well it holds up if it were first played today. basically, you can't dismiss aging when talking about the quality of games its intrinsically tied to them."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i've been a gamer since the early 80s, and i can totally get ocarina being 1, but the one game that just mesmerized everyone i knew when it came out was mario 64. you don't often have dudes sitting around watching another dude play a 1player game, but that went on for months and months as my friends and i took turns playing it. goldeneye could be higher too since it's one of the most fun console multiplayer games of all time."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"yea i really do not understand this narrative that botw started or revolutionized open world games like ... it really did not look at horizon which came out at a very similar time and that games open world is so much more beautiful and lively with more interesting and more diverse enemies, better combat, better gear progression etc."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"if anything nintendo was 10 years late, and then people tried to give them credit as if they had just done something special, mental."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"as far as i can tell, the thing it did was not put icons on the map. that makes the exploration more rewarding. but like, there's not much to find beyond korok seeds."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-29,httpsyoutu.beavpxkdsegnq?si0xoeo3mbgruuypss i think we take for granted a lot of things that botw innovated on.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,not sure what you mean by collectathon. you can literally just go directly to the main quests. everything collectible is just optional content. it's really not so dissimilar to the earlier zelda games in that regard.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,ocarina of time wasn't the same thing in that regard?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"yes ive had a couple of replies that sound like they think i think botw was the start of open world wilderness games. what i actually noticed in the wake of botw was a very particular tone of exploration. small things like the style of soundtrack, the cooking, having a glider and freeclimb abilities. and again, im not saying botw invented any of these, it just feels like the progenitor to a wave of similarplaying titles like genshin impact, tchia and immortals fenyx rising."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i would also like to hear why. i generally liked it but there was nothing earth shattering about it. the only thing the game did that i cant remember being done before was the environmental impact on certain things like dropping some food in a cold area to make it icy. the enemies were recycled to death. exploration wasnt that great. sure you can climb anything but for what? to find the millionth korok seed. assasins creed style towers everywhere, etc."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"always i mean, it definitely wasn't overrated in 1998 lol. how to account for tech advance in games will forever be a subject of debate. but i agree that nothing in this world can forever stay the best."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,in my opinion majoras mask and wind waker are way better.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,as someone who's a zelda fan i fully agree lol. how the fuck is ocarina of time over red dead redemption 2
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,ahahahahahaha
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"eh id say its maybe slightly overrated at most. replaying it again on the 3ds and it still has an amazing adventure to it. it controls well, the puzzles and dungeons are still great, most of it still holds up imo. botw is the massively overrated one in my opinion"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,if you're playing a game you absolutely shouldn't hold age against it within reason but when you're having a discussion about the greatest of all time i think it's fair that it has to stand up against all time to get the title without adjusting for nostalgia or historical impact.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,all i'm saying is nostalgia and history shouldn't trump gameplay.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"it holds up well but the problem is that halflife 2 exists. i heard a comment somewhere that basically summed it up as if hl1 was the greatest fps ever, then hl2 is the greatest game ever so if your goal is to make a list of the best games ever, it would be weird to put hl1 over hl2 just because hl1 was an original when hl2 is a better game same reason why world of warcraft frequently makes these sorts of lists but everquest doesn't. everquest was certainly a pioneer, but that doesn't make it better. if we gave extra weight simply for being first, these lists would just be like pong, breakout, galaga"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i'm not sure what you guys are on about. starting from late 2007 dota allstars had a higher player count than wow. estimated monthly active users outside of china were around 2030 million. it was basically the only reason wc3 sold copies in the later years.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"yeah but if it was one of the most popular games in esports, and also extremely popular for the custom games to a extent that there are spin offs, it clearly was just an immensely popular game all around, fully contradicting your first comment."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,later i meant.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"youre grossly exaggerating how niche computer gaming was at that time, just because its grown so much doesnt mean it was some obscure thing. i knew plenty of people at that time who played starcraft and then warcraft 3 on the computer. it set the record for fastest selling computer game at the time. comparing it to the ps2s numbers is really misleading too. the ps2 is the best selling console of all time, nothing matched its numbers. it doesnt invalidate every other form of gaming as being niche. besides the numbers are vastly inflated in terms of how many people were gaming because it was one of the cheapest dvd players at the time which was a big part of how much it sold. beyond that there are several games on the list that had much smaller player bases. i mean even oregon trail is on there, computer gaming was even less at that time. im amazed anyones ever heard of such a niche game. there were only like 3 people playing computer games then right?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i'm a 38 year old techliterate male on reddit, correct, but i grew up in a bottom 10 income household single mother with low paying job living in the middle of nowhere, late access to internet, so wrong there. also, pc gaming was to a fair few people the cheaper option due to, well, piracy burned cdslan sharing, not online. throughout all of my education, the pattern of pc gaming as being predominant has been constant, usually 68 people in a class were gaming, a few also had consoles, but most were pc gaming. usually, the people with consoles were the wealthier kids who had both a pc and a console, so there's that. again, i think it might be based on countries. the us and uk has been mainly console dominated, and most international game journalism stems from those countries for obvious reasons. they're also quite large countries, so it might be correct when representing a western audience, but it'd still be interesting to see whether or not there's a geographical tie here."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,it was puzzle based dungeon crawler. the games replayability wasnt built around collecting like botw 900 seeds are you kidding me??. botw story can be completed in like 5 hours. collectibles will keep you busy for 60 hours. botw is much closer to mario 64 in terms of collecting than oot. even oot has more enemy variety despite being 30 years older.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-29,"the environment impact was a lot of what made the game special. you can burn grass and paraglide on the updraft, cut down trees and float on the log down the river, things like that. use bombs to propel minecarts. electricity actually conducts through metal items and does area of effect damage in waterrain. there's actually a lot of mechanics to this game, i think a lot of people underestimate it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"the overworld in oot was a joke in 1998, too."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"definitely agree on majora's mask, but wind waker seriously dropped the ball when it came to dungeons."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"probably because it inventedcreated a ton of systems that games red dead redemption 2 uses to this day. ztargeting? the concept that you can lock the camera onto an enemy and swivel it around them on an axis? ocarina of time pioneered that. it was a groundbreaking mechanic. no one had thought of it before nintendo did. virtually every developer who has developed a modern 3rd person actionadventureshooter has used that mechanic to some degree. from rockstar's grand theft auto and red dead series, to horizon, to god of war, to the witcher 3, to metroid prime, to middle earth, to assassin's creed, to the batman arkham and modern spiderman titles, to kingdom hearts, to devil may cry. they all owe a massive amount of their gameplay design to that one single mechanic. id software's john cormack basically the godfather of the modern day first person shooter is on record stating that super mario 64 and ocarina of time are easily the most influential 3d video games ever, and that every developer who has developed a big 3d blockbuster ever since owes a lot to the mechanics nintendo basically invented for the genre. does ocarina of time hold up now, nearly 30 years later? not really. but i don't think there has been such a consensus this is without a doubt the greatest video game ever made sort of title released since. and that means an awful lot."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"this is more or less how i feel. tetris is apparently the fifth best game humanity has created, it's still better than almost every single modern release? being historically significant doesn't make it an objectively good game in 2023."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,ok well then i'll talk about the 3ds version which has sufficient polygons and better controls. it's still better than almost anything else imo
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"he used metacritic top scoring games of all time. they were all reviewed in era. i mean, this isn't that hard to grasp. ocarina of time wasn't reviewed this year dummy... it was reviewed in 1998 and metacritic actually has the links of those reviews in their score. come on now. you can't be that glib. he used read polls of this year.... so, in fact, you would think new games would actually score better... but... they didn't. cause they're not as good. it's not hard to grasp."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,yes. x200b you're telling me.. lets take.... 2007. x200b that those games would replace... get ready to get rocked x200b mass effect bioshock call of duty 4 modern warfare halo 3 the orange box unreal tournament 3 super mario galaxy uncharted god of war 2 crysis x200b x200b boom. your modern games just got rekt. x200b and it doesn't end. the 2000s has every year like this good or near this good.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i play old games all the time. they're better. i was playing fallout 3 recently and it's better than any game releases in the last 5 years. sorry but it's true. i was playing ut99 yesterday for four hours, and it's better than any comp fps released in the last 10 years. it is what it is man. i play games all the time, new games are shit. they're just simply not as good."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"agreed, even fortnite is a bit hard to nail down because the gameplay has changed so significantly since the start. sure, same overarching goal, battle royale, but the mechanics and features have varied pretty drastically between 2018 and 2023. wow has a pretty good spot, but these lists are games that you want to play, not games that had a big impact on the genre"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"do you have to evaluate the experiences that a new player would have during each of those moments, or someone who's always been there the whole time? yes. and if they don't, they are a dirty casual and shouldn't review it. and if they disagree with my assessment they are dumb and wrong."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"what you haven't considered is, while gta sa and vice city made lots of improvements, gta 3 is what set the foundation and is therefore the most revolutionary and important game of the franchise"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,oh i'm right there with you. played from vanilla until the first tier of shadowlands andjuay couldn't keep up as a raider anymore. certain design decisions also rubbed me the wrong wa enough times as well as the rising just going in a word direction
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,but does that make the game better? or suits this game just better in your lifestyle?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,holy thats a throwback. the cover art for blue dragon is still implanted in my brain
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,thats me and ff13. i get why most people call it mediocre but something about that game just vibed with me.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"notably, its boss themehttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vhblsgxkhps0 is sung by the lead singer of deep purple. which is just a bizarre crossover."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"it clearly was just an immensely popular game all around, fully contradicting your first comment. that doesn't contradict it at all. people were buying warcraft 3 just to play dota, it was huge  especially in the philippines and china. the dotaallstars website was getting over a million unique hits monthly until riot games bought the website out from its owner. it had over a million registered members on its forums and this is just the presence it had in english speaking communities. most dota players didn't care about warcraft 3's ladder experience, they wanted to play dota."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"dota 1 and the frozen throne came out the same year, it wasn't something that came out much, much later. tft only came out in the second half of 2003."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i'm not saying anything is invalid, i don't know what you're getting at. what i'm saying is that if you spoke to someone who played computer games in general at that time, most of them wouldn't know what wc3 was, and it's unlikely many of them had internet access either or played online games. as a result, it's not nearly as likely to end up on lists made by people today who didn't grow up playing pc games in the late 90searly 00s like you or i did. no need to get your nose out of joint about it, it's not a personal attack."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,did you play the dlc for infinite?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"would you rank it top ten? i tried to play it for the first time this year too. xbox had the bundle on sale, got a few hours into the first one and it just wasn't doing it for me. maybe i'll try again, maybe there were just some other games i was more interested in at the time."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"yeah man i agree. dozen, if not hundreds, of millions of people around the world are experiencing mass psychosis and are buying, playing, and complimenting games they don't actually like because.... nostalgia. including children. nostalgia. nostalgic children. yeah dude my 6 year old nephew is definitely nostalgic for mario kart and pokemon from playing them back in the 90s  why would you expose yourself as a weird coping console warrior like this in public lmao i can practically hear the coping and seething from your comment."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,and it seems to originate from baldurs gate 3 fanboyism since theres stiff competition for goty between the two. it's reemerged with bg3 fanboyism but it goes back waaaay further than that.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i'm on zelda subreddits and the bg3 and dos subreddits, and i don't think there's any statistically relevant correlation between bg3 love and zelda hate. besides, bg3 if anything made me appreciate zelda more. they're very simple, fun games."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"it's not a hate boner, more of a meh boner. i have nothing against nintendo, they make very good games, but it's hard to deny that they're definitely graded on a bit of a curve."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,yes rehashing games is definitely better
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i have played a large amount of games from all sorts of publishers and nintendo games would still dominate my top 100, they just make good games."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"people don't become die hards for a franchise for no reason. you know how nintendo got that fan base? by making great games in the first place, and keeping up that quality in an era where triple aaa garbage filled with micro transactions and pointless grinding is more and more prevalent."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,if they had a point to make it'd include a criticism of the game instead of criticisms of the fans.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"all i have to do is turn on my switch and look up my hours played. yeah i have crazy hours on rocket league, league of legends, csgo, warcraft and diablo too, im not discounting other games at all. nintendo games in my opinion are legit. i love them and can always just power on and play for hours on end. im not doing that to defend a company brother i dont have the time to play a game i dont enjoy playing, its not that hard really. also with nintendo prices im the first one to let others know when theyve dropped the ball mario party, tennis, strikers were all kinda meh."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,the unbiased take would be people are all welcome to their opinions. but we shouldn't take someone's opinion in good faith if they're not willing to do it for others.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"nintendo publisherdeveloper has a huge fanbase who will defend the company to the death and only play nintendo their games yeah dude, he really has a point. bro is onto nothing."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,this whole comment is useless. here's this random scenerio i came up with and here is definitely how it would play out breath of the wild would still be a fantastic game without the zelda ip behind it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"this doesn't even make sense if you think about it for a second. the game sold 10 times more copies than previous zelda games. if being a zelda game is the main factor than it should've only sold a couple of million copies like the previous games. it doesn't explain why it sold that much better. also because it sold way more copies than previous zelda games, that means that this was probably the first zelda game for a lot of ppl. so there couldn't have been any nostalgia involved for those ppl."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"not everything is to everyone's tastes, of course many people will just not care about the types of games they make. but cultish? you're really just proving my point. their games are typically very good and extremely consistent, and the rabid following that people make fun of is quite simply people who are used to that and expect it from them."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,it is very very far from it lol its not even the best 2d mario game
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,thank you i am in the same boat i sunk alot of time into pokemon games and still do but apart from starting the series the redbluegreen games are just horrible games by todays standards and apart from nostalgia there is 0 reason to play them over any of the other mainline games dont even get me started on metriod man. the first metroid game is just not a good game. it was totally passable for the time lets be real. basically all the nes games are hot garbage but literally every other metroid game is far better like this is a best games of all time list. not a biggest impact at the time list but in the gaming subs on reddit there is such a ton of nostalgia drooling for the old pokemon games its insane. i recently saw a screenshot of gen 2not the remakes and people talked about how great and atmospheric it looks like ... cmon how can you be so delusional. gen2 is already really bad but hyping it for its looks is just ...
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"generations behind in power and processing and they get no hate seriously? that's the goto meme about nintendo. if you're not seeing that, you're likely upset about something else."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,it's like cleaning your plate at a restaurant then telling the chef you didn't like the dish
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,man i guess i just dont understand what other peoples lives are like that they can put hundreds of hours into a game they dont love. like how do you have the time
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,people actually spend alot of timemoney on things and in the end dont view those things as great or amazing why?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,it's pretty much the same reason people keep up addictions well past the point they're enjoyable.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i'm saying it's not on these lists for its technicalgraphical merits or to stroke the nostalgia feels. it has plenty of quirks, features, and other minutiae which makes it so much worse than many games just like on a list of best scifi movies of all time, you might find 2001 towards the top of every time. but you also wouldn't have to try very hard to name a scifi movie that has a better story, better effects, and aligns more closely to a modern audience. but 2001 is there. why? it did so many things first. things we take for granted in modern cinematography. and frankly it's as simple as that. you get bonus points for really being the first to do something, moreover something that set the standard for almost every 3d game we play today."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,not the best zelda game and not the best open world 3d game of its time. mario 64 was just better.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i don't think there's a single zelda game that you could class as a jrpg. also it's been pretty easy to use a controller on a pc for at least 15 years. as for jrpgs with mkb, i found they generally translate well to keyboard, there's no need for a mouse, but that's personal preference, and you're allowed to not like it, could be related to the fact i was playing pc games before a mouse was common."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"well pc gamers are a small minority of gamers, and zelda isnt a jrpg anyway."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,wouldnt say its necessarily much better overall since horizon does have quite a few flaws imo but the open world in horizon just feels so much better and botw is really bland and empty in comparison
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-29,i thought this video comparison was pretty notorious httpsyoutu.beavpxkdsegnq?si0xoeo3mbgruuypss
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-29,imagine seriously thinking that
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-29,oh man ... i really cant with such videos they are so bad and so pointless
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i feel so validated by comments like this i feel like i was taking crazy pills for a while with this game. people are always like its absolute freedom you can do literally anything like, yeah, like play any other game! tell me what i'm suppose to do with this one!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"no one is expected to get all the korok seeds. there are 900 so that you will get plenty just playing normally. they literally give you a golden shit if you are weird enough to collect them all. also, zelda puzzles are barely qualified to be called that. there's an unlit torch in this room. you gotta light it isn't really a satisfying puzzle"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"puzzles are things you have to think about, push the block is not a puzzle. zelda games barely had anything that could be considered a puzzle before the water temple. alttp has nothing that could be considered a puzzle in it. the only thing that i can think of that is a puzzle from link's awakening is the maze at the end of the game which is less of a puzzle you have to think about and more so just a hard requirement to make you do the trade side quest."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,we speak a different language. i wish you well.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"eh, i think the dungeons in ww are pretty on par with oot. oot houses some god awful dungeons in forest temple and jabu jabu's belly. both oot and ww share the same problem in the map of the game being way too big, and there being way too much travel time between locations."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"fair opinion, maybe its my nostalgia for wind waker."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i play rockstar games on pc using a mouse and keyboard so no ztargeting there. here is the thing, i personally don't care who invented what. if someone invents something and someone else improves that invention i would say the improved version is the definitive version. as someone who've put thousands of hours into zelda i'm baffled how someone still prefer ocarina of time over the newer games. it's nostalgia speaking and that's pretty much it. ocarina of time being a better video game than a game such as red dead redemption 2 is a totally insane take to have. you can make an argument for a game of its time, but as a game of all time then just no."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,he used metacritic top scoring games of all time. he used the 2023 metacritic score as one of 14 equally weighted scores. dummy.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,you literally picked one of the best years in gaming. that specific year would beat almost any other year in history. not exactly fair since the original argument was the 2000s as a whole. to say no game this year would be a contender in any year in the 2000s is genuinely a brain dead take. baldur's gate 3 is probably one of the best video games ever made. and that's not even a hot take. it would probably win game of the year in 2007 if it came out at that time. yes over all the games you listed. the 2000s has every year like this good or near this good. i grew up in the 2000s. it absolutely does not have every year as good as 2007. 2023 beats out multiple years in the 2000s.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,... you took the best year ever in gaming. that isn't really fair
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"i also played fallout 3 recently and no, it's not even close to being better than any game release in the last 5 years. if fallout 3 released this year it wouldn't even crack top 15 games this year. let's not even count the last 5 years of games like rdr2, gowragnarok, returnal, elden ring, sekiro, ghost of tsushima, zelda botw  totk etc... that blow it out of the water."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"yeah, sl was absolute ass i think pretty much everyone agrees there. dragonflight has been pretty refreshing though, and i was unexpectedly encouraged by this year's blizzcon presentation. with metzen back, it really looks like they're putting in the effort to clean up the story and tie up a lot of loose ends."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"obviously it's lifestyle, but i'd wager the general population will align with this experience."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,mine too! i was obsessed with that game and lost odyssey. the stories in the latter really made that game special. goosebumps thinking about it bahah i need to replay both asap

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"dota was not very popular for many years. i was there, i was on battle net, i played cafone or grubby in competitive tft, i played garena, dota was not a warcraft 3 seller. it really started getting a bit more popular in version 6, which was close to league of legends, hon and dota 2 releases."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"yeah dude my 6 year old nephew is definitely nostalgic for mario kart and pokemon from playing them back in the 90s bro, i said that's why you like them. your nephew likes them because they're simplistic games that 6 year olds can play and feel good at. why would you expose yourself as a weird coping console warrior cause i'm not? i don't have a problem with nintendo. i have a problem with ranking a game so utterly basic it comes wrapped in a scarf with a pair of ugg boots and a coupon for a pumpkin spice latte from starbucks among the best of all time. i've got zero issues with ocarina of time at the top. it was absolutely a ground breaking game at the time. breath of the wild could have come out a decade earlier and it still wouldn't have been groundbreaking. the only interesting about it is that it's a relatively bug free experience. that's it. that's the only interesting thing about the entire fucking game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"because they're basic ass games that little kids can play. same reason you liked them when you were a little kid, they've just got updated graphics. the question isn't why does your kid like them. it's why do you."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,because you bought the damn game and set it up for them to play. they can only play what you put in front of themallow.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,yeah this isn't like the market niche that apple controls. nintendo is out there competing at the same price and yet maintains this supposedly rabid fanbase for no apparent reason? without any other justification like oh the product costs 5x as much so of course the fan base defends it more vigilantly or only nintendo makes these kinds of games what you have is just the free market speaking.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"people don't become die hards for a franchise for no reason lmao yes they 100 do, all the time. nostalgia, peer pressure, how things get covered, the time in which someone played something, and a ton of other factors can make someone a diehard fan of a franchise. none of which have anything to do with the quality of the game. most of this list is nostalgia."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"people don't become die hards for a franchise for no reason. yeah, they do. there's people defending no man's sky to the hilt in every thread concerning any game getting patched."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,i'm confused as to what about that you think isn't answered by the massive increase in the number of people enjoying videogames year over year or by the massive marketing campaigns that target nostalgia and fomo via social media and regular videogame journalists popular and 2nd best game of all time aren't synonyms.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"to each their own, your opinion is just unpopular is all."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,yea its a running meme but its also something that people defend all the time. x nintendo game never had amazing graphics the games are still fun not everything needs to be super realistic etc. while there is some truth to this. its also a terrible excuse that still appeaers way too often
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"from my own experience sometimes the hype really gets to you and for some reason you decide to keep playing only to find out what others see in a particular game, until you finally realize that that moment won't ever happen. sometimes the sunkencost fallacy makes you keep playing till the end since you already got so far. alternatively, a game may have some good aspects or moments that you keep playing for, even if the cons outweigh the pros."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,different reasons why but thats not the point here
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-29,because sometimes things are just entertaining and good fun without ever being great or amazing.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-30,so they are mkb feasts?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"pc gamers are the vast majority of gamers, as long as you don't count mobile users."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-30,lol.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,if you want to do a thousand very basic puzzles called dungeons then botw is right up your alley. personally i found horizon's gameplay had way more depth to it. much more innovative enemy design. more diverse set of content and absolutely stunning designed world. botw felt barren and empty.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"the best way i can explain it is that playing botw and horizon at the same time recently btw, i come to games late is that there are mechanics in botw that weren't there in horizon and that i was a bit spoiled on. the oftmentioned you're genuinely free in botw, you can go anywhere mechanic is true to an extent. but i wanted to explore horizon more, and i wanted to see where its story went more."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-29,if you actually play both games it's a rather easy conclusion to come to. the combat system is way more complex and engaging. one has a very detailed and great story and the other not so much. horizons world is detailed and feels alive while botw is just void and barren. you travel for ages and see nothing. the graphics aren't even comparable. horizon is still one of the best looking games ever created. horizon did a great job with enemy design. really good variety with unique mechanics to each of them.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-29,"it's from six years ago, but for me it shows a lot of why botw was game of the year. it was more interactive with it's environment than similar games that came out then."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"its not about expectation, its about the games sustenance. most games are split nearly 5050 between main story and side content. if a game takes 50 hours to 100, then 2030hours of that is main story and the rest is side content. botw is split 1090. its built around exploring and doing side stuff. thats what gives the game playability. it sustains itself with its collectibles. and a puzzle is a puzzle despite simplicity. the games are made for children, they shouldnt be difficult for a full grown adult."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,ah yes because the ability to wind bomb over many of the shrines in botw is what youd consider a puzzle.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"lol, whatever. i mean, like you can have the opinion. it's wrong. but i'm not going to convince you. x200b and for fucks sake, one great game does not make a year great you need at least 5 truly great games for a year to be considered great. bg3 is the only really good game this year. i don't think it's great. if it were great i wouldn't have gotten so bored with it. x200b because i'm still playing ut99 or..... fallout 3 or... mass effect 2.... or counter strike, or re4.... years and years and decades later. x200b no one will be playing any of these new games in 5 years... let alone 10, 15, 20. x200b i mean half life just had it's 25th anniversary and it's one of steams most played games lol. because it's great. it has a legacy. these modern games do not, and will not. x200b but cheers man. go play the bg3 if it's so great. don't waste your time with me. shit i know in 2007 i didn't have to convince anyone that cod4 was an all timer or than ut3 waas great or that bioshock was off the hook. everyone just kinda knew they were. we took it for granted. we didn't know how great we had it. but.... you now. casuals and mega corps ruin everything eventually gaming is just the latest, and coolest, thing they've ruined. x200b and i'm not saying that bg3 isn't good. it is good. i mean, the fact that it doesn't try to game the player and has actual engaging content, for 2023... that's a big deal."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"a lot of nintendo's continued success and the rabidness of the fan base is due to nostalgia. if another company came into the market and tried to make the same types of games without the benefit of these beloved franchises and characters, they would be absolutely eviscerated. that doesn't mean nintendo makes bad games, or that they are a bad company, but they are in a rather unique spot compared to most other game companies. they need to maintain their brand loyalty and they need to maintain the value of their franchises to succeed. if they started dumping out microtransaction filled garbage games, they would be done within decade."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i mean how good a game is goes beyond whether you personally enjoyed playing it or not i did enjoy alot of games when i was younger that i would not call very good games even if i had fun with them maybe my opinion is unpopular amongst the very small minority of people that voted on this list. which wouldnt surprise me at all because the average person who voted on this seems to be atleast 10 years older than me if we look at the games on here doesnt really mean anything. dont think there is any real argument that mario bros 3 is better than like ... mario wonder apart from i had more fun with it 25 years ago when i was 8yo

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-29,"just the fact that you talk about the world feeling more alive in horizon shows how much your opinion is purely subjective, as npcs in botw have objectively a shit ton more different routines and behaviors, that change depending on hour and weather, and interactivity and physics system that are on another level. between all the good and bad sides of both games for example the plot, that is weaker in zelda you chose the worst possibile comparison and still you said the clear loser in that aspect horizon is the better one, for you. so it's not easy at all to come to your conclusion. there's a reason if one is regarded as a masterpiece and the other is not even in the top 3 of 2017."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i wouldn't consider either to be puzzle based dungeon crawler games. i don't know how you got me saying that from what i wrote.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"no, no you do not. people do take it into account yeah, but that's exactly what my argument is lol. stop taking it into account. when i ask what the greatest game of all time is i want to hear what the greatest game is, not the game that invented and evolved the most. i loved super mario 64 as a kid. i bought 3d all stars and have only played through the first level. it's outdated and just not as fun compared to today's standard. i personally wouldn't call that great. it was great for its time, but it's worse than games from the current time. greatest game of all time literally implies it needs to be better than games from the current time."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"that's just preference. i dislike the gameplay of baldur's gate 3 and my favorite video game this year is tears of the kingdom, but there's no doubt in my mind that baldur's gate doesn't get game of the year. i prefer tears of the kingdom, but baldur's gate 3 is objectively the better game."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-29,"botw didn't invent the open world game, it perfected it. i was unaware empty world maps and identically themed dungeons which people raked skyrim over the coals for that don't even make ludonarrative sense were perfection. i can tell the weapon degradation system was perfection because of how many games have copied it since which is 0, cause it's trash. i was unaware that a completely forgettable narrative that rarely makes any sense at all and most of which is hidden behind the super perfect activity of... running all over the empty, lifeless map to stand still but excitingly! and watch a cutscene of something that happened earlier in the story... is open world gameplay and narrative perfection. but it's okay, they had the 4 boss dungeons that... were laughable and barely worth the effort to complete. perfection! or maybe you enjoyed the perfect inventory system that required you to... pick up random rocks and hope there was a seed underneath so you could turn it in to an npc who then, for absolutely no actual reason, would give you more inventory space. cause i know when someone gives me my favorite, apparently very easily found food, i sew them a couple extra pockets on their invisible backpack. the game design is actual trash. i hear some of the stuff under the hood is actually quite impressive because it needed to be in order to run on such an underpowered system, but the actual game design is laughably bad. any new ip from any other publisher that tried to release like that would end up ignored and forgotten within a week of release."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,if another company came into the market and tried to make the same types of games without the benefit of these beloved franchises and characters genshin impact copied a lot from botw and became one of the most popular games. does that count?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-29,"my issue with this whole sub thread is that nintendo does make bad games sometimes and they're not running around saying how great they are. botw is one of the best games that nintendo has ever produced, and it is competitive with the best games from other outlets. that's a fact."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,a fantastic game this is the delusion and dogpiling i'm talking about. every single time. increasingly convinced the overwhelming majority of people defending the game have never played it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,what does this have to do with anything? you said nobody would care. it's literally listed as the 2nd best game of all time in the op and you're using it's popularity as proof that it's a great game. i don't get what you're confused about here. everybody knows what zelda is whether or not they've ever played a zelda game. it is a cultural touchstone for a large portion of the world. it's cool to like zelda. people like zelda because they've been told to like zelda.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,i mean how good a game is goes beyond whether you personally enjoyed playing it or not no it doesn't. video games are an artform. there is no objectively right or wrong when it comes to good. it's literally all subjective. i think elden ring is a bad game but everyone else would tell you otherwise. i'm not wrong and neither are they. maybe my opinion is unpopular amongst the very small minority of people that voted on this list. your opinion is unpopular against the majority of people who play video games. it's an extremely popular opinion that super mario bros 3 is one of the best video games ever made. doesnt really mean anything. dont think there is any real argument that mario bros 3 is better than like ... mario wonder apart from i had more fun with it 25 years ago when i was 8yo this is an extremely short sighted way of looking at things
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,because it was just about the fact that you can spend alot of time on something in this case botw and still do not like it as much in the end not sure whats so special about this tbh. people spend huge parts of their lives on lots of things and those are definitly not always their favourites. no matter what hobby

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,i don't really care about downvotes. reddit is a hivemind of mostly libs and zoomers. i'm not too concerned. and it's a fact that our game industry millennials was better than the modern one zoomers. that's why 60 percent of the best reviewed games are form the 90s and 2000s. and overwheling majority of the great games were made for the millennial gamers. it's not nostalgia. it's just facts. i know reddit doesn't like facts. but it's just facts. i don't care about downvotes i don't care about upvotes. i say what i say and then keep it moving.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"there are an insane amount of platformer games and rpgs that are as good as or in some cases way better than anything nintendo puts out, but they aren't nearly as accessible and don't get nearly as much attention. i am not saying that nintendo doesn't do a good job of hitting their target demographic, i am just saying that without the nostalgia and the generational passing down of the torch of these casual friendly games from parents to kids, nintendo would probably be struggling. they did a great job of building their brand and they reign supreme in that market, but the quality of their games is not even close to the main reason for their success."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"so you're saying the majority of the people who have spent hard earned money on the game and logged hundreds of hours on it have never played it? should i assume every single one of the 20k reviews on the steam page, as well as 850k people on the subreddit, are just bots?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"it's literally listed as the 2nd best game of all time in the op and you're using it's popularity as proof that it's a great game. i don't get what you're confused about here. that isn't what i said. i said its success cannot be explained by simply being a zelda game, because it sold exceptionally well even for a zelda game. your argument was that nobody would care about this game if it weren't a zelda game. i never commented on whether or not it deserves the 2cnd place in the list.  everybody knows what zelda is whether or not they've ever played a zelda game. and pokemon and mario are even more popular than zelda, but their latests games sold less copies than botw. which also fits my argument that franchise popularity isn't the deciding factor why botw sold as well as it did."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,uhm yes it very much does there are also objective markers about other art forms. not everything is a stylistic choice. there a drawings that have alot of anatomic inaccuracies. there are books that have terrible writing. just because the person who did it isnt as good at their art form. that doesnt mean those pieces of art have 0 fans same is true for video games. and yes saying elden ring is a bad game is a horribly wrong and bad take. elden ring is in no way a bad game. you can say that you personally dont like which i would even agree with because i am not a fan of the type of combat and equipment system that all the souls like games have but that doesnt make it a bad game i think you are living too much in a bubble of older people when it comes to games i am 99 sure that a large majority of people who play games nowadays have never touched mario bros 3. even just other 2d mario titles are much more popular let alone any of the big multiplayer games care to explain why its short sighted? im pretty sure that you cant make a compelling argument on why mario bros 3 is supposedly a better game than mario wonder. yes you can talk about how good it was at the time but that is a totally different topic than best games of alm time.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-26,"who considers zelda a puzzle game? most games in the series don't have puzzles. ocarina of time is the first game in the whole series to have anything that could even remotely be considered a puzzle in the water temple, and that's one out of the twelve dungeons in the game. push the block onto the switch is not a puzzle. reflect the light onto the face is not a puzzle. pulling a lever is not a puzzle. zelda 1, 2, link's awakening, and a link to the past don't have anything that could be considered puzzle like about their dungeon designs."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"isn't there is a best ongoing game category specifically for games that, you know, still get content years after it was released. so i think a dlc should fall under that criteria, no? last year cyberpunk won it, mainly because of their solid dlc and rightfully so!. i mean, they could have released the game and called it a day, but the devs decided to put extra time and effort into the game post launch and add new content albeit content that you had to pay for. that's what an ongoing game means in my book. you just can't compare the effort of making a game from scratch to making a dlc. it's just much less work, as 80 of the work is already done, so it should not be up against games that actually had to do all the work. if elden ring was up for best ongoing i would say, yes, the deserve that statue. but being nominated for the actual goty? that's pushing it. however, i can see a dlc getting best narrative or art direction if the narrative or art of the dlc is so drastically different from what the base game offers and is really good which i would also not say elden ring dlc has. but best game direction is also pushing it a bit. the game and the art were already directed"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,the only thing i can say for sure is baldurs gate 3 has best community support of the games in those categories. they added more in free updates than most rpgs add in entire episodes of paid content.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,the fact they put dlc on the nomination list shows it going to win as the jury picks the winner. doesn't vote count for 10 of result?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,elden ring dlc winning is gonna be a joke. a dlc should never be a nominee for goty. let it win in its own category.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"honestly, even if i was ok with sote being nominated for goty i'm not, it's stupid as it doesn't even deserve it. let's be real, it's an expansion, and as far as expansions go, especially for from standards, it wasn't even that great.  huge stretches of map locations completely empty  reused bosses, again, and reused bosses within the dlc, like i can at least forgive reusing bosses from the base game, but reusing bosses within the same dlc is insane  bosses are wildly incoherent, you go from insanely boring, to nice fights, to great fights, to frustating and broken, to straight up almost impossible  there is even less coherent story than the usual from standard and it's obvious a lot of the story was cut, literally all of the trailers make absolutely no sense when you play the dlc all of that bit with marika and the gate? the betrayal?  cookbooks, enough said imo. black myth wukong deserves the win, it's pioneering the chinese gaming scene and while it has its problems, it is a quality game with tight and fun gameplay, at times way better than erfrom for presentation and feel. edit truth be told i didn't play a lot of the other games on the list so bmw winning is my own bias, i am sure if i played the others and liked them more my opinion could and would change."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"the charge is specifically for customizing the 3rd party spatial audio everyone gets the uncustomized spatial audio for free to create a personalized profile that takes into account the players physical attributes, such as the shape of their ear or head, whatever the fuck that means in practice. based on the comments from the fools that did buy it, there's apparently no noticeable difference lol either way i really wouldn't nominate bo6 for audio design simply because it's really not that good the game itself is, the audio isn't. hell, it's not even the best by cod standards. vanguard had better audio until you butchered your guns with attachments that affected how your gunfire sounds... and it was a low point in the series."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,yeah that is ridiculous for the goty award.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,its sad that a dlc is better than all other games this year yes. it still should win though
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,dlc is an interesting one. like shadow of the erdtree was larger than most games and more complicated in design than most games. it is literally an entire game onto itself. that deserves consideration for a nomination at minimum. but seasons? like battle passes? if thats what you are referring to then hell no!! its literally the same game that youre playing to simply unlock new cosmetics and stuff as rewards. that shouldnt be up for consideration at all because its not a new game in anyway.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,why not?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"a dlc was nominated in 2022, nobody complained, and it almost won..."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"not only that, it already won best fighting game in 2022 when it was a beta."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,preach.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"i think remasters, just graphical upgrades, shouldn't be allowed, but if you are significantly remaking the game, to sequel level, with at least different world, story, characters, or gameplay for example turn based vs real time, should be allowed."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,agreed. its like a directors cut rerelease with 30 minutes of added footage being nominated for best picture after the theatrical cut already won. its ridiculous to me.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,and it's not goty material imo. the basegame is just plain better.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i mean, they have to get to 5 somehow."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,ikr multiversus is basically a mobile game at this point.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"if larian released dlc for baldur's gate 3 it could easily smoke elden ring, wukong, ff, metaphor and any other game you can name."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,that makes more sense than helldivers 2 being nominated for ongoing game months after it came out.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,actually insane snub but i'm not surprised looking at who voted. the average gamer will never be well represented here.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,afaik there is not much competiton in sim games. and for some reason plenty people play ea sports game. actually wonder why is there so little alternatives.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i have a feeling it will, sadly. i loved sote, but god no, no dlc should get nominated for goty. love fromsoft fans acting like sote was the first time a game ever got a massive dlc before."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"unfortunately, it's got lower odds of winning than a wheel of fortune card. which is to say nope!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"yeah i understand it was very well loved, but it's so baffling when a dlc gets an actual goty nomination over full releases"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,would it have made the list satisfactory?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"for what i remember, vampire survivor was there two years ago,"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,2nd. stardew valley lost to overwatch in 2016
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,animal well is a solo dev too
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,definitely yes.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-23,"enjoy the crack, bitches. you're welcome."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,theyre probably nominating sote in response people being upset about phantom liberty not being nominated last year
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"phantom liberty shouldve gotten a nom last year if dlc apply? it was eligible, it just obviously didn't get the votes for the nomination. this seems like they did it just to glaze elden ring. they being... the game awards? they're the not the ones who dictate what goes in the nomination list. they just tally the votes from the jury."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"pl was eligable though but it wasnt better than the other nominees shadow of the erdtree is the clear best content released this year, hope it wins for the absolute meltdown"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,phantom liberty is basically what cyberpunk should have been on release except they charged you for an extra dlc
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,they literally skipped over best indie game last year and didn't invite sabotage studios on stage... i mean... why?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"they need a separate category for dlc. with all of the ridiculous categories they already have, they could add a new one."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,always has been. why do people act so surprised every year?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,yeah it is insane that it didnt at least get a best indie game nomination. definitely wouldnt expect it to win but the show is sadly nothing but a popularity contest it is my goty at least such an incredible game
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"the game awards confirms that expansions, dlcs  remakes are eligible for awards, including game of the year"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"from their faq the game awards aims to recognize the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that contents release. expansion packs, new game seasons, dlcs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination. factors such as the newness of the content and its pricevalue should be taken into consideration."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,httpswww.videogameschronicle.comnewsthegameawardsconfirmsthatdlcremakesandremasterswillbeeligibleforgameoftheyear
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"good thing i voted for astrobot instead. i fucking loved sotet, but i don't think it deserves goty. astrobot also wasn't pantsshittingly perfect, but it's been so long since we've gotten such an amazingly high quality platformer from someone besides nintendo. shit needs to be recognized and rewarded. i don't hate nintendo, by the way, we just need more options besides bingbing wahoo."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,right. but around 30 hours to beat looks like a full game on a pure dev point of view. without mentioning all detail of the gameplay. i think it deserves at least a nomination.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"i might say it was probably because it was a remake but then again, resident evil 2 and 4 remake got nominated for goty in the previous years"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,you're 100 right
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,id almost prefer a best remakeremaster category tbh to your point about sequels that's not really the same thing to me at least although i'd be willing to compromise on 1 per franchise per generation or something i do definitely agree that dlc should definitely be its category and should not be nominated for goty
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"quote the witcher 3 made headlines when it won best rpg in 2015 as well as game of the year and then immediately scored another win in the same category the following year for its blood and wine dlc. to date, blood and wine remains the only dlc or expansion to win the award. so even if not goty, a dlc still got an equivalent award. so not completely absurd to nominate a dlc for goty"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,dlc should not be eligible because it is an expansion on the game and can not be bought by itself why does that matter?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i'm 250 hours into balatro and still playing religiously, only games to ever get that from me were civilisations, eu4, wow, diablo and a few crpgs like fallout 2 and wotr"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,agreed. or just have a best dlc category. so many games have dlc or expansions that you could definitely fill out a decent amount of nominations.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"so if sote launched as a separate client it would then count all of a sudden? like it or hate it, sote is better than most stuff that came out this year."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"it's a good year for gaming if you play a variety of genres, what are you people talking about lmao broaden your horizons"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"not suprised, as much as i adore the game, they hardly gave much nomination for doom eternal either and as close as sm2 is to de this year, it's pretty disappointing. sm2 needs more nominations"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,they should definitely have a best dlc category instead imo
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"yeah, or like are we going to get elden ring director's cut nominated one year? where does it end."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,or silent hill 2??
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"what makes metaphor such a good game? i'm currently playing p3r and it's gonna be some time before i finish it, especially since i'm playing in japanese and i have to look up like half the words. but i'm tempted to drop it and just go straight into metaphor."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,bump
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"bro anyone ? like even a friend who got the my card thing now can't find it , where is it ?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"the game is literally broken at a fundamental, mathematical level. there's not much to beating it on the last difficulty, just rng drawing what you need. there's no strategy to it, you just find the good multiplier cards or don't. i liked it until i was regularly playing on gold stake."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"it's nominated for two  best multiplayer and best action. deserving of more than that, of course, but at least it's being acknowledged."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i hate to say it, but it's not a mind blowing game outside of the fandom of w40k. it's good. just not good enough"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,came here to say let's go balatro!!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"do what i do, not watch it for any reason and then check out the trailers on youtube the next day not on the official game awards channel either"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"welcome to the joke awards 2024, which is probably going to be a new thing going forward. i mean racing and sports games in the same category what??? why did he think it was a good idea to put an f1 raving game against soccer, football, and basketball. there's no way it'll win that's doing a disservice to the devs. i mean, it's bad enough having e sport teams and players in this. there are 3 categories i would like to skip because i know absolutely nothing on the individuals in them."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,i wouldnt lump remakes into the same category as dlcs and passes since the good ones are straight up just new games
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i play way too many video games. 1000xresist is the best written game i've seen in half a decade. also probably the one with the best cinematography, which is wild to type for a narrativecentric adventure game. this would be like skipping disco in 2019. truly a game awards moment."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,there's a jury that take the most popular games and narrow them down. who they are though i'm not sure.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,watched about 5 episodes and i can't tell you what's happening. little to no action and tons of time jumps. it just feels like a bad drama or almost soap opera. was really hoping it would be as crazy and fun as the games but they really missed the mark
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,i would not be mad if it took home a bunch of its nominations tbh
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"i guess they dont count it good enough for goty, but doing good throughout this whole year idk"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"a lot of these nominees make no sense, the community has been shitting on destinys pisspoor support for years now. diablo 4 and helldivers 2 are both way too recent to even consider them for ongoing support. the only game that has any business beeing in the ongoing list is ffxiv."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"black myth wukong isnt nominated for best score and music, but astro bot is? i really hope they don't skip over this category. it feels like an injustice to not have a performance of one of the tracks from the winning soundtrack on stage. ff16 soundtrack in 2023 just being done as rapidfire just felt wrong."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,battlepass winning goty next year
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"it was nominated for best indie game, they kinda just wrote wrong."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"whatchu mean, its in all three of those?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,i love seeing balatro next to those behemoths. its awesome
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"most of those gamers don't want variety, they just want to feel validated that the things they like are goodpopular."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,gamers dont care about variety because if they did theyd find that there are plenty of unique games. they care about their favourite aaa publishers making different games. people dont have the energy to actually seek out new games and just rely on online discussion and marketing to reach them
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"yup, they're really losing credibility here with their lack of consistency. if sote actually wins goty over any of these full games, i'm seriously considering not even bothering to follow the results in the future."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"yeah i feel the same way. everybody always talking about gta6, but it's been 5 years longer since the last metroid prime."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,it got innovation in accessibility nomination alongside star wars outlaws.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i thought the deadline was yesterday?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"im personally very excited for death stranding 2, but if gta 6 doesnt win that category, then that would be just factually incorrect."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,it got two though.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,the nobody saves the world sequel i did not see coming!

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-21,it's on there twice?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"me too. i wish they would have at least mentioned what each game offered, e.g. contrast display options, over 100 language translations, bluegreen colorblind mode, one handed gameplay. those are just examples and are not real, but that is the kind of thing i would like to see listed."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,agreed.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"iirc the phantom liberty didnt win best ongoing. cyberpunk 2077 itself won that award. best i can come up with was because the phantom liberty was the final culmination in the ongoingcontinual process of fixing cyberpunk from its original release think no mans sky. might be why it was seen as an ongoing effort. whereas elden ring obviously hasnt been doing that. few patches here and there but generally not an ongoing process to continually update and improve the game. its just a game that came out, and then later pumped out an expansion. best i can come up with on this one. it definitely feels inconsistent at a glance, even if i can kind of see the nuance."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"because according to chronically online gamers, every year is the worst year for gaming. modern games are either dog shit or goat and there's no in between anymore."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,just like the awards
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,same
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,people dont like china. bmw was an incredible game. if it were fromsoftware it would win goty easily
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,either way ella purnell is winning
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,we were spoiled this year
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"not even on the simstrategy nomination, completely snubbed."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"i enjoyed knuckles, but there is no way in hell it should be up there. it should only get an also participated ribbon."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"that's a really tough one. on one hand, fallout is objectively a better adaptation of the source material in terms of making the viewer feel like they are watching a show of fallout. but on the other hand arcane, imo is a better show and also has a hand in rewriting the runeterra the world of lol lore from what i understand, so that's pretty damn impressive even if you don't like the show as much as fallout. i personally favor arcane more, but if fallout gets it, i won't complain at all. i loved it especially considering i had 0 expectations of it being any good."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,i hope mlbb win this time
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,its laughable that cod gets that category every year. its so silly to me lol
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"im so happy it got so many nominations. i hope it sweeps most categories, absolute treasure of a game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"that game had a zillion touches of polish on it. was leary of paying full price for a platformer, did not regret it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,astro bot is what i'd believe a hypothetical super mario galaxy 3 would be
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,them being in hot waters with nintendo probably has something to do with it
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"next year should be tougher, there will be wilds, and death stranding 2 probably. there are some other great titles to be released next year as well iirc."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,did you play these games?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,do correct me if i am wrong but i believe the jury is overwhelmingly english speaking. they wouldn't be good judges for the performance of actors in other languages. that would probably be best left for award events in the countries where those languages are natively spoken.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,college football is missing...
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"one of the best games i've ever played, hands down"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,which is why it got nominated. elden ring art direction has no equal. fromsoftware in general has no equal for designs and art direction.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,its a whole new map with different locales and environments
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i don't like playing poker and so i've just written it off is it interesting if poker bluffing and making hands isn't interesting to me?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i wouldn't be surprised it's fanbase has given up lol
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,maybe theres a rule you cant win that two years in a row
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,therefore it's definitely coming out before 1212
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"then factorio space age should have been just selected as goty without nomination process, lol."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"this is more a celebration of the developers, as the oscar's are a celebration of the team who made the film. i agree with you wholeheartedly though. some people will fully ignore a game if it doesn't win anything. makes no sense."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"winning is good for marketing though. lets say balatro wins goty. i have no interest in the game but hey, it won goty, maybe i should try it. then i buy it, and play it, then loved it. now it became good marketing for balatro since gamingnews sites will report it. balatro will get more money to make better games in the future. well, thats my stance on it. its a marketing win if your game wins. personally, i wouldnt have the courage to try elden ring if it didnt win goty years before, i tried it as my first soulsgame and now its my favorite and tried other soulslike games too. another example is it takes two. it was outside my radar, and only knew about it because it won goty. one day my wife wants a new game to play, and suggested her it takes two. so i bought it and played it with her. i wouldnt have suggested it takes two if it didnt won goty. the game awards is basically marketing. well, as you can see how all the trailers are and their stage time. all marketing schemes."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,real. its game of the year. shadow of the erdtree isnt standalone like the other games. its useless unless you buy the main game and complete a significant amount of material.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,well its been a bad year for gaming im amazed veilguard and outlaws even exist on this list. but dlcs should be its on category thats true.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,there's music? i couldn't tell from the sounds of constant explosions and bullets flying over head lol.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i mean the music is good but it's no ff vii rebirth, astro bot or metaphor refantazio"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i disagree, metaphor is amazing, unless you mean the overall quality of the picks in which case yeah..."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"hey, i will happily say unironically that i love all of the trailers yes, ads for upcoming games. there is always such hope in them, ya know?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,nah ff7 is practically a new game also the story isnt exactly the same
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"remakes should be included if they are totaly new, dlcs on other hand hell no"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"nah, remakes are fine. go play ff7 remake then go play ff7 on ps1 and tell me it's the same game. it's not the same as a remaster, which is the exact same game, just with updated graphics. completely agree about the dlc though."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"8 years ago a dlc won best role playing game rightfuly, but i'm biased, so there is a precedent."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,no man's sky is still getting updates as well.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i am absolutely shocked at this snub too. i was expecting at least a best indie nom.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"not pissed, but if dlc can be goty, theres zero reason any given season of some live service shouldnt be able to win it. its a slippery slope. elden ring had its time in the light. hell, id go so far as to take any annualized ip off the table. call of duty dlc pack 2024 isnt a standalone game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,fans can vote for games to win but im pretty sure they dont pick the nominees.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,if im not mistaken that how blood and wine for witcher 3 was nominated. it also won
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,this dlc is way longer than some actual whole games
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,totally agree.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"i absolutely agree, but ff7 rebirth can hardly be counted as a remake and it deserves its place on the game of the year nominations. it is fundamentally a new game and fundamentally different from its inspiration. it is an entire reimagining of what ff7 is, for better or worse depending on who you ask. and it is a fully fleshed out game that stands on its own merits and breaks new ground in the final fantasy franchise despite containing a beat for beat retelling of an old story. it's my pick for goty but even if it doesn't win there's some solid contenders it deserves its place among the nominees."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i think it wins best rpg easy tho
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i agree.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,silent hill 2 remake was a great game and surpassed expectations despite being critiqued months before release. the fact it not nominated over a dlc as example is insulting to game devs? i doubt bafta will nominate elden ring. i feel bad cause i like elden ring it slayed it's year.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,a terrible year? have we been playing the same games? this year has been excellent for gaming.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"if elden ring is allowed to be nominated, it makes zero sense to me that they snubbed phantom liberty last year. in my opinion, dlcs have no business being nominated for goty. it takes a lot more effort to create a new game from the ground up than to add content to an existing one."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,and college football 25 was snubbed for best sports game
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"because the people who say that have shallow taste in games. all they care about are the big aaa studio releases, when the aa and indie industry has been shelling out bangers throughout the year."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"yeah last year's lineup was an exception, not the norm. you had bg3, alan wake 2 and phantom liberty in one year, all incredible experiences in their own league, it's impossible to expect the same level each year."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,hideo kojima noticed her
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"fire emblem also historically gets categorized as strategy in the game awards so stuff like unicorn landing there isn't exactly a surprise. that said, if unicorn was to compete in the rpg category this year, i don't think it would have been nominated at all anyway. the competition was too strong with how many high profile and popular stuff there's been."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,innovation in accessibility. had to put it somewhere... lol
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,highest rated games according to the game journalists
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,yeah definitely a weak year. 2022 and 2023 were pretty obvious. next year looks to be much stronger
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,black myth wukong is easily the best game this year
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,not everyone hates the game as you apparently. some people have good taste in games.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"i assume you mean the elden ring dlc, but which is the other?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"the fact john eric bentley didnt get a nomination for barret is wild to me. briana white is great, but there are stronger performances in the cast."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"is fallout really gonna beat arcane? they were both so good, and both deserve to win not gonna lie"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,arcane is on the list btw
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,same here.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"i mean, to be fair to ffvii rebirth, it isn't a 11 to remake. it adds a ton of story, gameplay, and even changes plot points or when they happen. it mostly just took ffvii's skeleton and added a whole new body."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"shadow of the erdtree is higher rated than both of those. yes, metacritic ratings are bullshit but they are the average of what the people who pick the candidates think of each game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"dont wanna discuss the dlc nomination but what makes you think stellar blade should be nominated? it was nice to look at, otherwise it was just ok. story was ok, characters were ok, soundtrack was good, gameplay was ok but repetetive."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,balatro? lol
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i believe that was protectors of the earth by two steps from hell.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,might win if it were nominated for the biggest disappointment award
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i mean it's bad enough the guy's trying to get a patent so he can have the rights to anything with game awards in it. tells all you need to know of who this guy is.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"the amount of attention and care poured into factorio is astounding. i would have replaced the game just for the 2.0 changes, but space age is a whole can of worms. basically a toptobottom overhaul of the game's progression and a massive load of new content. it would have gotten my vote. maybe it's just too niche for any award show attention, who knows. i'll continue enjoying the expansion regardless."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"factorio doesn't put any money into marketing, there's nothing tga would gain by celebrating factorio. tga is not about recognizing good games, it's a big advertisement event"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"remasters will tend to naturally select themselves out. if i can use crisis core reunion as an example. as far as remasters go, its on the higher end. wholly new model replacements, fresh voice acting including previously unvoiced dialogue or entirely new dialogue. animation upgrades. small but entirely new mechanics being added, etc. but there was also no getting around the fact that at its core, its built and feels like a 2007 psp game, because thats what it is. youd need to do an actual ground up remake to get rid of that. and things like that dont tend to hold up under scrutiny now as they did back at the original release. consequently those old legacy issues tend to get hauled up on reviews and detract from scores. which would naturally filter them out from consideration for awards season. remasters of more recentish games tlou, horizon, etc dont necessarily have that issue, but they do run afoul of often feeling unnecessary or tampering with something that didnt actually need tampering with. so they too will select themselves out in most cases."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"ubisoft has an article about the accessibility in the gamehttpsnews.ubisoft.comenusarticle4j5xweveccm1lbsduyij2hstarwarsoutlawsaccessibilityspotlight. usually innovation in accessibility is accounting for different types of disabilities being able to play the game without issue. color blind modes, audio narration, etc. the last of us 2 could be beaten by someone who's entirely blind"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"if i remember right, outlaws has a helluva lot of customizable options for color blind and so forth. kind of like how the last of us part 2 and then part 1 did some really cool things to make the games more approachable."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"accessibility means settings and assistance for those that may struggle playing the game normally. think color blind modes, contrast settings, audio descriptors, subtitles, and other assists. forza motorsport won the same award because it had so many driving assists for example."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,lul jrpgs winning anything?? this is comical
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,honestly yeah. wow even had an expansion drop too. it's defs not as big as it was back in the day. but it's probably by far the biggest on going game ever.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,this was my exact thought. thank you.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,even people that liked it knew it wasn't getting nominated.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,inquisition winning in 2014 was basically a tallest dwarf situation. there's maybe one other year 2019 where inquisition would even have been nominated. 2014 was kind of a down year for gaming.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"personal goty but it's not gonna win over baldur's gate 3 if it did get nominated. my problem is if erdtree got a nomination, pl should've gotten a nomination too. personally over totk or spiderman 2. to hell, with the same argument, blood and wine should've at least gotten a nomination over any of 2016 nominee list overwatch, titanfall 2, inside, uncharted 4, and doom. just make a separate list for best dlcexpansions."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,lawl phantom liberty better than baldurs gate and elden ring is overrated? those are some takes!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,you say elden ring is overrated then mention phantom liberty? and winning over bg3? lmao
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,it's a poker rogue like and it's like crack. seriously i can't tell you how much time i played this game while i should have done something productive.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"its sort of like a pokersolitaire game thats a roguelike, and its very addicting"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,it's probably my goty tbh. definitely most hours played.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,crack. it's crack.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,it's like poker but awesome
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,a great game
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"one of the best roguelike game to release. it's incredible. it blew up as well, i'm surprised you haven't heard of it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,also he kept pronouncing balatro wrong
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"what jank? it was fairly smooth sailing when i played it.. everyone i know that played it, loved it and had no issues?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,yes. it is the most addictive game i have ever played.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"yes, yes it does."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,balatro has 2 million sales. it is a brilliantly designed game. i have been playing it for at least 200 hours. you don't know what you're talking about.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,they should create a category for horror game of the year honestly
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,hopefully it wins narrative not sure about this one since it's basically the same narrative as the og and best performance.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i honestly think they're gonna give to elden ring dlc.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i think astro will be a contender. critics really liked it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,this all the way
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,what lol its been a great year for every category except maybe shooters. rpgs alone had one of the best years in recent memory. not 2023 good but the year as a whole is easily a 8.510
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,you mean that dlc with 5060 hours of top tier gameplay across a completely new a giant open world map? that dlc?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"honestly, the ff7 remake has been different enough that it really is a new game. the story being different enough to constitute a new narrative is arguable, i think that's person to person. maybe it's more of an audit on the state of current game narratives that a rehashed version of a story from 25 years ago is widely declared one of the best stories of the year"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"silent hill 2 is also head and shoulders better than the original. it tells the same story, but with a significantly more mature and sophisticated voice, for lack of a better word, than the original. there's enough different about the telling of the story that, even though it is the same story, it deserves recognition for showing how far gaming has come as a storytelling medium. it shouldn't win, but i do think the nom is a good nod for just how well bloober translated sh2 to modern standards."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"one which noone said a negative about  which would indicate that it's good, yes? well, there are games that have nearly no flaws but probably don't deserve goty, but astro bot is still extremely good in my opinion and many others'. i do agree with the first half of your comment though."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,they needed a dlc for a game that already won game of the year there for some reason.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,no rules were changed. dlcs have always been allowed nominations in all categories. the witcher 3 blood and wine won best rpg over dark souls 3.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,hahahahha i was trying to take your post seriously but then you mentioned wukong deserved to win.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,warframe has been going for over 10 years and i don't think they ever got a nomination on tga.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"relink deserves a lot more recognition. i havent played ravenswatch since january or something, thought it was very soso. would you say it has improved drastically since its full launch?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"hard to draw lines and definitions, but id argue that these ground up rebuild projects count  resident evil 2, ff7s new installments, stuff like that, while the remasters and more simple upgrades do not. yes the narrative is the same, but were dealing with entirely new control schemes and cameras, significant redesigns of the entire mechanical systems, the physics engines, the actual button pushing gameplay is 100 different  and also narrative rewriting in some scale ff7 is a lot different, and one could say the trilogy is as much a sequel to the og, as it is a remake of it. things like resident evil 4? that feels like pushing it. all thats been done is general modernization, the camera already worked like that, the action already played that way on a controller, etc  its just better now. how do you separate them on a list like this? lol no idea"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,rebirth isnt a remake
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"yeah, i agree"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i would rather a remake over a dlc.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,it won best rpg
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i dont know why they were vocal about it. now they get to see the game not winning because is not that good of a game.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,millions of people loved wukong. the question is why is a dlc up there over anything else
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i especially feel like best remaster should be a category because it's sort of about preserving history. there are so many games out there that are basically unplayable, 95 of gamers can't get to because they don't have the hard way to play it. a remaster category would be a celebration of look at these games that we brought from the shadows for anyone people to play"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"that being said, i can see a dlc getting best narrative or art direction if the narrative or art of the dlc is so drastically different from what the base game offers and is really good. but i would not say the art direction for the dlc is so different from the main game, and it is not up for best narrative. but best game direction is also pushing it a bit, as the game was already directed. they just add more content within the same direction they were already headed and were awarded for prior!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,wukong didnt have any real controversies. just unrelevant game journalists spouting missinformation for clicks
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"agree. any of those should be knocked off for silent hill 2 easily, but probably the dlc should definitely be because it's a fucking dlc."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,veilguard was pretty bad tbf
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,because its absolute shit?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,veilguard is actually nominated for innovation in accessibility. so its just not nominated for a real award.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,cause its writing is worse than mediocre. the kind a teenage girl would write to insert herself. rip bioware.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,veilguard got one more nomination than it deserved.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,cause everything in this show is arbitrarily set as they go
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"genshin impact is a modern zeitgeist for sure. i think theyve already won a few awards already, so maybe they just what to keep the playing field open?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"as some that has thousands of hours in destiny 2 and played diablo 4 and helldivers 2 as well i am not! haha kick these 3 out and give warframe, poe and genshin impact a seat at the table. never played that one but it cant possibly be worse than d2 in its current state."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,sins of a solar empire 2 not making it for the strategy genre is a crime
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,what is forgotten sands doing here?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"i hate veilguard but you have a point, atleast veilguard wasn't as broken as outlaws lmao"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,agreed.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,which are you referring to?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,no and it damn well shouldn't. don't get me wrong i liked shadow of the erdtree but it should be in a different category.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,if there was 15 nominees it shouldnt would be up there. lots didnt make this list. thats not one of them
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"the game i don't like received many nominations, it must be that sony payed for it! you guys are absolutely ridicolous"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"what do you mean, it was one of the best received games this year..."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"it got nominated for accessibility, so it was eligible."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,it was eligible its just not a good game
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"not that i'm against big expansions being nominatable, but arguably titles like yakuza 8, animal well or satisfactory would fit that description sans the aaa since that isn't even a requirement and weren't nominated."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i honestly don't know why people hyped up erdtree so much. about 40 of the overworld is barren and has basically no content. if that's what classifies as goty then i don't know anymore.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,why doesn't wukong make sense? it's a very solid game from what i've seen and heard
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,how does wukong not make sense?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,deleted
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,palworld is in early access. there's no early access game as a goty
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"if palworld was the only game that released this year it still wouldn't deserve a nomination. it's a horrible, clunky mess of a game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"hades 2 is still in ea, stellar blade is nominated, palworld is an ok game and helldivers is nominated and had many problems. what are you talking about?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"hades isn't out, but yeah this is a weird list tbh"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i think astrobot is very likely to win... tga historically do not like jrpg's the two best games on the list.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"wukong got goty nomination and dragon age got almost nothing, crazy how reality always collide with the fake outrage some, with too much free time, have been desperately trying to manufacture for months."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,family games are worth nominating. no challenge is subjective. depth isn't required for any game. plot isn't required for any game. wholesomeness isn't a detractor. you clearly either don't knowcare about ps history or platformers. that's ok.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,yeah... that's not true. similar to mario odyssey there are a lot of optional challenges if you seek them. it has many innovative mechanics and an unprecedented dual sense implementation. the wholesomeness is just the cherry on top.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,it's the only game that's made me smile since the reignited trilogy. games don't have to have challenge or a meaningful plot to be fun. remember when games were just fun?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"helldivers 2 deserved to be in several categories it didn't get a nom for. i'd have even put it in contention for goty, personally, but not giving it a nom for that score and music? come on now."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,the most idiotic take. it's been an insanely great year wtf are you talking about.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"ufo 50 is fantastic, but you must be smoking something if you think it wins a popularity contest with any of the 6 nominees."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i mean nine sols didn't get nominated for best indie either.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"ff vii rebirth could get completely shut out. given that the committee changed the rules to include erdtree and that astrobot was more well received, it's odds are questionable in most categories."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"it's up against very stiff competition for goty so i'm not holding my breath, but at the very least it should take score, direction, sound design, rpg, and briana white absolutely deserves best performance."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"infinite wealth, helldivers 2, tekken 8, another crab's treasure, mullet madjack, persona 3 reload, prince of persia, age of mythology retold... need i keep going?"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,"it's only for sure win in music. and probably rpg, which is what i picked."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,"it's a jrpg, and even worse, a ff game. you get the added slander of it being a remake even though it adds a ton of content and changes substantial parts. it's going to get snubbed."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,probably the most popular indie game this year. its a poker based roguelike.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,really hyped good rouge like card game. basically poker 2
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"it's a great game, very addicting, one of my favourite card games for the feeling of synergy and luck now, but i disagree with it being goty nominated. maybe because of animal well i already have an indie pick which there is usually only one of the 6 being an indie game for the goty nominees."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i voted for balatro as game of the year so i can say it's pretty good.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"it's between ff7 rebirth, metaphor, and astrobot. astrobot imo has the highest chance of winning imo. there is a chance elden ring dlc wins but i don't think that will happen. don't really know why it was nominated tbh."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,ff7 is definitely a contender as well
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"no it's going to the shadow of the erdtree, which is why they made the exception for dlc this year."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"if this was a normal ass competition it would be between ff7, metaphor and astro bot"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,balatro is 110 worthy of goty nomination.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"idk, if a remake can win game of the year, why can't a dlc with enough new content to be an entire game win it? this feels like one of the very few times a dlc could win it just because of both the competition and the qualityquantity of sote."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,tbh when was the last time wow even put out an expansion that was remotely noteworthy? the game has been in decline for years now. every expansion that ffxiv has put out has been almost as good as the last one if not better. the player numbers are skyrocketing and its clear se are putting time and effort into making it one of the best mmo's to play. wow may have its history but its not the best mmo anymore.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,what is wow
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i hope it dang doesn't

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,while my vote goes to shadow of the erdtree i can see wukong easily taking it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i mean sony had a good year
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,sony incestfest 2024!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,hades 2 and palworld are still early access
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,calling balatro a random card game is crazy
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,hades 2 and palworld are both in early access so would not be eligible although if dlc can win why not early access. this year has been very lackluster in games if i am honest. i really struggled to name nominations but this also could be as i havent had chance to play as much.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"random card game? its the most popular indie game this year. player count doesnt mean shit, the quality of the game does. wukong is a shit game. doesnt matter that lots of grifters played it. hades is in alpha, not officially out yet, helldivers fucked up with how they handled the game. palworld is undergoing a lawsuit for copyright infringement and nintendo would be very upset if they were nominated."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,why the fuck is a dlc nominated for game of the year and why did they ignore helldivers and palworld and space marine and hades which are all incredible games ahhhhhhhhhh

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,not sure why being a poker roguelike makes it weak. that's just what it is. eldenring was a open world soulslike. what makes one genre more deserving than another? balatro is basically video game crack. games are to entertain and balatro did that better than most this year.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"it might get the accessibility award, but that'll be a token victory. i'd still rather it didn't though, the head writer doesn't need the ego boost."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i mean, it has a 94 on metacritic, it's obviously very good. you just might not have enjoyed it and that's ok"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,they hate konami
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,cause dlc more deserving? lol
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,then why comment at all?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,you left a comment so you obviously do.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"the vast majority only cares about the announcements in the show, at least this is why most watch it"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i think it's fun. i don't take it seriously and don't care if i disagree with certain picks, so it can be a fun conversation to have between friends. plus it's all about the announcements at the show anyway."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,just have some fun with it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"bro, youre trying to critique an entire game based on one bad feature. the only thing missing the mark here is you. it is a phenomenal game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,dawg i think your eyes are just bad ngl
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,the most overrated game of the year
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,most anticipated game are all games that aren't out yet. that's the point.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,as someone who agrees shadow of the erdtree deserves nominations. the argument of dlc is basically a sequel is the biggest load of nonsense i've ever heard
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,thats not how it works lol
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,you fogot the s brother
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,objectively lol
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,wukong is the lowest quality game on this list and this list includes dlc which shouldnt qualify either.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"just because cod is slightly better this year, doesnt mean they should get awards. it was good, but not that good."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i'd say some shade when you can do  bulleted lists
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,you're both right.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"games that got a solid expansion i really hate bundling everything under the dlc term. actual expansions should be called as such should be eligible for the ongoing game awards, but definitely not any of the other categories."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,manor lords it's in one category i can't remember
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"agreed! and there were specific settings you could alter too, instead of just hard, easy, story, you could adjust individual aspects of these difficulty settings like shell health and more."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,you mean a faqing monkey!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,video game awards has always been rigged. this one isnt doing much effort to hide it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,absolutely. i knew as soon as they made the announcement of its eligibility that this was going to happen.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,it's definitely not better than balatro.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"but it's not a game unto itself. it doesn't exist in a vacuum and is balanced around you bringing in a character from the base game with gear and equipment from that base game. i'm all for celebrating the quality and quantity of shadow of the erdtree, but i think expansions shouldn't be eligible for goty regardless of how much content they have. it's still something that builds on an existing game that most of the work was already done for. i also think it becomes impossible for people to separate their love of elden ring with their love of shadow of the erdtree."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,it is literally an entire game onto itself. they should've sold it as a standalone game then. they sold it as dlc that requires the base game.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,most would probably agree with this but the game should've been a standalone not apart of the base game. this is the main reason. it doesn't matter if it's the size of the base game or not. it does deserve to be in a different category like best dlc or best ongoing like cyberpunk was last year.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"if you need the base game to play it, it's not a game and shouldn't be nominated."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"for one dlc has a much bigger advantage in development over brand new games. there's much less preproduction and base systems that need to be worked on. even something like totk last year at least had entire new gameplay mechanics to work out. sote is good and all, but the bulk of the work needed for it has already been done and awarded appropriately."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"2022 was stray, horizon forbidden west, a plague tale requiem, xenoblade 3, elden ring, and god of war ragnarok. which of those is dlc"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,rivals of aether 2....
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"undernight 2, rivals of aether 2, hell even the 2xko alpha belongs up there more than mv"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"true. however this does not change the fact that there should be a separate nomination for dlcs, remakes and such."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,baldurs gate wouldn't have beaten elden ring in 2022
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,man i wish i live in that timeline where we got a bg3 expansion
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,it's likely demographics of the nominating committee toocollege football isn't that popular in the northeast us and american football overall isn't that popular outside of north america
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,what can you say? the house always wins!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,it should win best debut indie. its a fucking blast and ive purchased it on almost every platform.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,it was only nominated for best debut indie game and by the time vs fully released there were freelance devs on the team helping out
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,it wasn't nominated goty
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"stardew was only nominated for best indie game in 2016. goty nominees were overwatch, doom, inside, titanfall 2 and uncharted 4"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,is it just that overwatch sucks now and was good in 2016 or does it feel to me like stardew should absolutely have won
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"yep, fantastic game, but it's not goty nom."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"game awards and geoff have always had a relationship with from software, i expect it more favortism from that. i would expect the same if kojima released a large expansion to a game"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"better than spiderman 2 and re4 the other i didnt play so i can comment but it looks better than alan wake 2 for me, so why you lying."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,tell me you havent played cyberpunk without telling me you havent played cyberpunk.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"seriously, a best dlc and expansion category."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,not surprised at all.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,if only they changed the rules a year ago then phantom liberty could've been nominated
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i actually really agree with this sentiment. if a dlc is good enough on its own to be a goty contender, then why not? erdtree i think deserves to at least be a nom."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"hey now, bingbing wahoo is one of the greatest games of all time. much better than that ripoff mario. show some respect!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"not for goty it doesn't. it's not a game, it's an expansion. imagine if fortnite season whateverthefuck it is now, was up for goty, that's what this looks like."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"not in the slightest, not even close. from the point of view of an actual game developer, me. building a dlc on top of an existing fully realised video game is taking practically all of the hard parts out of the equation."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,and ff7 rebirth got nominated this year.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,a you have to own the base game b you have to complete specific requirements to even access the expansion in fact someone looked into it and only 42 of players currently can even access the dlc in question.httpsx.comsubtxtstatus1858583715909165239?s46tnvun3vate1chhfbqy1cv6w so yes these things do matter
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"have you tried baldur's gate 3? based on your list it feels like you'd dump a ton of time there too, lol. but yeah, balatro is so goated."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"yes! a dedicated dlc category would be so much better. it's a slippery slope of if this is allowed, why not this?. like would cod campaigns suddenly be considered? if a game came out 8 years ago but suddenly releases a dlc, is it now eligible? just seems like a weird thing to do."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"maybe, it's just that dlc by definition build on an already preexisting completed game hence downloadable content. that, and also you still need said preexisting game to play it. i don't think it's bad or anything, it's just weird to put dlc there when there's a better fitting category for it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,yes? that's pretty much what they're saying? if i wanted to play sote i'd have to buy a whole different game and play thru some of it before i could even try the dlc it isn't a standalone game or experience
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,yeah i didn't expect any different to be honest. i did expect at the very least it getting art design or sound design though.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,or just lump it in with ongoing. it's the game still getting support.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"i dont really know how to summarize it. its art direction is among the best atlus has ever done, but aside from that all i can really say is that its got the persona sauce. i felt the same hole in my soul when i beat it that i did when i beat p5r and p3r. for a new ip to do that is really impressive. the persona games had the advantage of being set in high school while i was in high school, but the fact that metaphor managed to do it without that advantage i think speaks to the extraordinary craftsmanship of this game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,ikr nobody knows where is it lol
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"son, you will eat your flush simulator and you will like it!"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-23,"there's no strategy to it disagree on this. i've spent way too much time in balatro and there's literally thousands of ways to break the game, but that's kind of the whole point. getting to that point through surviving different antes is the whole fun. that's what a roguelike is."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i agree wholeheartedly. here's the wild thing i do not typically enjoy narrativeonly games. i bounced off disco elysium hard. if i want to read a book i'll read a book. but this was so well presented, so intriguing, so good in just the positive feedback of questioning and understanding, and so moving. every time i played i came away stunned. i'm a massive nier fan. nier automata was a huge deal for me. when i first saw this i almost dismised it as a poor knockoff, but it's wildly different, and a honestly far more succesful, coherent narrative."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"seriously. and not only isnt diablo a bit too recent, people arent necessarily praising it for its seasonsseason passes either. some were decent but a lot of the them get criticized. i personally stoped after the second season because i didnt like how they did seasonal content. edit i also find it funny that destiny gets nominated in best ongoing, this year, when it is arguably at its lowest in that regard and last year for best support, when it was at its lowest in that regard. with all the layoffs and what not."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,it's literally just name recognitionpopularity.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"oops, didn't see that. thank you! well, now i'm doubly salty salty i was wrong, and saltier that it's a nomination veilguard actually deserves."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,cheers
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,and because these fools only play games from major aaa studios. people who say that it's a bad year for games because of this joke of a nominations list have unironically very shallow taste in games.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,lol the same gun samples they used 10 years ago. true innovation.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,on top of which its very much a western focused awards ceremony. so naturally the assumption would also be that the vast majority of their audience are familiar with the english actorsperformances predominantly.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,with the same art...
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"its a very creative take on the drafting roguelite genre, like slay the spire. the poker stuff is mostly theme, it doesnt play like poker at all for the most part"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i would think for the devs, seeing people, actual players and fans, love and praise your game on social media, youtube, in comment sections, rating sites, and everywhere else is far more meaningful than a few select people who decide what is and isn't the best. the mass of people who love what you'd made should be far more important than a statue that collects dust. statues and awards are temporary, but the memories and experiences you gave people are forever."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"from a marketing perspective i totally get that. in fact earlier this year i said that if ff7 rebirth won game of the year, it would help boost it's poor sales by showing people that it's some special worth playing. ii likened it to the witcher 3 which wasn't some massive hit when it first came out and it became more popular over time and rebirth has that same thing going for it where it'll keep selling at a steady pace and do well in the long run, especially when part 3 comes out to get people more invested in the trilogy. i know baldurs gate 3 winning got me to check the game out when i originally had no interest because i had a hunch i wouldn't like it. unfortunately i was right and i couldnt play more than an hour before refunding it because it just wasnt for me. but that doesnt lessen other peoples enjoyment of the game. that's what gets me are the people that play the games who get all bent out of shape when their favorite game isn't nominated or doesn't win. it's like they take it personally, as if they're being told their favorite is inferior to the winner or that it's not as good, when at the end of the day only your opinion and enjoyment of it matters."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,the only music i remember is when you're first dropping onto the planet
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"yea, my bad, i should have worded it better. meta is still something i'm interested in, but don't see myself playing for a long time. i just think the picks overall are disappointing. i was gunna say where the hell is bg3, then remembered it was released last year."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"same, i really love sitting down with my dad and brother watching the new game releases. either we get hyped or start being absolute assholes and make fun of them."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"yeah, as much as i don't like the ff7 remakes, they're essentially new games built from the groundup. they should be eligible. remasters and dlcs shouldn't be."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,yeah but theyve been doing it forever. so does sea of thieves. we cant give them the prize every year! both games were also very much not ready at launch...
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"theres zero reason any given season of some live service shouldnt be able to win it there is. it needs to be really good to win, which most dlcs are not."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"overwatch won goty that year 2016. bw wasnt nominated for that category. it was nominated for best rpg, and won that."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,no cause dlc has been added as best game contender this year for the first time.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,you are mistaken as witcher 3 wild hunt won in 2015 which was the year of release. overwatch won 2016 which was the year blood and wine was released
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,don't forget botw dlc last year
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,and yet you cannot play it without owning the base game. hard to justify having content that literally cannot be played on its own and requires owning and practically having beaten a game from 2022 to even begin playing it as game of the year.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"exactly. if it's not a standalone game, i don't think it should be considered."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,not even close. it doesn't hold a candle to the other nominations. let alone games not nominated like silent hill 2.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"yeah you're right, it'll probably be the closest vote out of all categories."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"honest if more games did remakes the way ff7r has been done, id be a lot less salty about the entire phenomenon."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"i consider it a great actionadventure game. had a blast with its combat, enjoyed the world and the narrative."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"that's it, yep. don't even need to listen to it to know. i used to have that on a playlist a long time ago, probably so i could find it easier and avoid this exact scenario of trying to remember it.. but the version i had must have gotten deleted or something because it's not there anymore."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,yes it may have all that but you need the 2022 game to play it no?? that makes it a dlc and not a game of the year. i giving elden ring the chance to win twice which is why it not a great look imo.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"by this logic, every fortnite season should be it's own entry"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,it's alright op i agree with you. it is such a massive dlc and it could have been sold as a separate game. if it is being nominated for game of the year that means those running the show thought it was worthy of the title. you will never please everyone and redditors think down voting makes them right... it doesn't. let's see what happens and hopefully sotet wins some awards.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,it shouldnt be in the same category as actual games regardless
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"then its just stupid then. dlc's should have their own section, it is part of a game that already won goty, therefore sote already has won goty."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,in that case i advise opening the steam page for manor lords which is nominated for simstrategy. early access rules don't apply when geoff wants to suck dick of a game that was hype at some point.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,balatro is not nearly as popular as any of the other goty nominees but it got the nod anyway. ufo 50 is better than balatro and better than most of the nominees in there imho. it absolutely deserved to be there

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"so? it's that your point? are you another shill a hole from miyazaki fanboy? i'm going to straight here. black myth wukong deserves to win in almost all the categories it has been nominated, and they even prevented it from getting more nominations such as in the category of best music lmao. a dlc should never be nominated for major categories, doesn't matter how good it is. heck if that's the case the best dlcs of all time the old hunters, blood and wine, half life 2 episode 2 should have gotten their nomination at least lmao. shadow of the erdtree objectively speaking is no way near as good as these, the problems are the people, the gamers, the industry and more  you just want radom responses to every single critical aspect that affects the industry and your hobbies nowadays, even if it is really bad. they really destroyed warhammer 30k and stellar blade in so many ways, which is ridiculous"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,but infinite wealth is made by sega
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"had more content, and i enjoyed it way more"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,how is it phenomenal if i'm deaf or hardofhearing and need visible captions in order to play and understand the game? a basic design element would have allowed literally thousands if not more people to buy and play the game but they failed in implementing such basic design. it's not even that hard just make sure there's a black background whenever text shows up which you can do when you are coding in the captions part. it was probably more work to code in the accessibility features then it would have been to add a black background over any spoken texts or dialogue.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,you can also critique the game for being a bad soulslike that has no idea whether it wants to be an action rpg or a soulslike more with poor feeling attacks and unreasonably large health pools
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,they legitimately are but that still doesn't address how the developers failed to add in a simple design element that has been in games since literally the 90s if not probably before then. a black background with white text in order to make a text readable has been around since the f 90s if not probably earlier than that as a design element. because it's a simple fact that it makes text more readable. it's really basic design and for people that don't know if you make your product usable by people with disabilities like in this case people who may be deaf or hardofhearing they go out and buy your product which means even more money for your product which i thought companies loved. they bothered to add in complex accessibility features into the game but they forgot the most basic design element when it comes to accessibility which is to add a f black background to your white f text to make it readable so it doesn't disappear whenever white text shows up in the scene. do it right or don't do it at all.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"nah that title easily goes to something like refantazio. if youre a 40k fan, space marine 2s campaign is a religious experience, plus its just nice to have a campaign that respects your time and isnt 2050 hours long. plus the coop is phenomenal and the multiplayer is that simple 360era pvp i love without tons of bullshit thrown in."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"yes, professor. i'm over here asking if that's even a good idea at all?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"okay let me rephrase a dlc of this magnitude and scope is basically a sequel. i mean what's the difference between this and gow ragnarok for example? both have the same mechanics and use the same engine, both have completely different maps, enemies, soundtrack etc."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,what if halflife 3 gets released in two weeks? they redo the nominations?!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,alright do tell how is it an indie game.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,what's wrong with objectivity man
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,lowest quality? stop spreading misinformation and go play the game for real.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,lmao sure man
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"using slightly better lets me know you have no idea what youre talking about. the community, aka the people who actually play the game, recognize it as being leaps and bounds better than mw3 in all three categories. cod bad doesnt negate reality. bo6 is a high quality product with ridiculous replay value. that epitomizes what goty is"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,and you are also right that they are right
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"delusional, it absolutely is. it shouldn't win goty or be nominated at all but it towers over everything else released this year"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i mean, thats true, but the precedent was set with blood and wine with the witcher 3 a long time ago"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i just don't see why that should be relevant? the packaging and marketing of the product shouldn't impact its qualification imo.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"are you saying that like im unaware of that? yeah dude, no fucking shit."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"you know youre not necessarily wrong, but the precedent was set a long time ago with blood and wine with the witcher 3"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i agree. i think that's a fair reason. i actually agreed with the post that i questioned, but wanted to understand their thoughts. lol at the downvotes for asking a question."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,try a guess
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"yeah dlcremakes should have theirs own categories for sure. there will be some grey area games though, like resident evil 4 and silent hill 2 remakes where it's kind of the same game but expanded upon with some differences, the remaster games which are basically graphic updates, or ff7 remakerebirth which are entirely different games with the same characters and story beats."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,wow what a year
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,how the fuck did ow win
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"stardew not ever being nominated for game of the year aside, i think a lot of people are jaded by the genre and blizzard in general. but in 2016 i would say overwatch was extremely good all around and deserving of goty"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"oh yes, that is true! i see what you mean now"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"you're not on the judging board like game reviewers are mate, sote is the highest rated gamecontent release of the year, pl wasn't even top 3"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,played it on launch and played phantom liberty. although i never got to finish my original playthrough because panam got bugged sitting midair next to where she was supposed to be which disabled my ability to progress the main quest. just the worst bug i experienced on that trainwreck of a launch
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,they didn't change the rules. phantom liberty just simply didn't get enough votes to get the nomination.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"it was nominated for some things, it wasn't good enough for goty."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i still believe er dlc is still bigger and better than many other  full games . i understand that many wouldnt share this opinion. if a dlc is big enough to be considered like technically bigger and more complex than other full games, i still dont get why it wouldnt be nominated?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"again, why does that matter? does that impact the amount of new content provided in the expansion? does it impact the quality? i don't get why you people are so worked up over a pretty minor detail when it comes to awarding software that was released within a year."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,there isn't a better fitting category for it. the expansion is it's own self contained experience. it's a very large unique map with all new locations.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"yea, in japan many of their games refer to dlc as game addons. as the name implies it adds onto the game, not create a brand new one. they rely on the fact that they are not building a entirely brand new game and instead reuse assets from the game it's based on to continue the storygameplay."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"you can buy the two together right now. it launched that way. yes, you have to play some of elden ring to access the expansion, but i don't see why that ultimately says anything about what that expansion content is."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,you like jumping into sequels before playing the original?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,who cares? i wouldn't recommend that anyone play final fantasy 7 rebirth without playing remake either.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,at first. it becomes number go up the same way every time or you just die early if unlucky. there should be more variation and depth to it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-24,i can just use a calculator to do that
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-23,"there's ways, but not viable ways to win at gold stake. at least not how it was on launch. i've since read that it's been nerfed and the increased cost of packs and 1 hand size are both gone so they gutted the difficulty to keep more things viable i guess?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i'm on the other end of the scale i mostly play narrativecentric games. some have pretty complicated gameplay, some are basically visual novels or walking sims, and i'm cool with that. still amongst those, 1000xresist is an outlier. it's daring and clever and rolls back into all its themes and points and stray sentences. nothing is irrelevant it has things to say, and it will say them. i've played automata but i wouldn't compare the two, because they're super far apart in ambition, focus, and setting. the closest simile i've played is probably tacoma? it's another scifi talkcentric adventure game with a move forward and backwards in time as you explore memories system. but 1000xresist is so fucking weird that it's hard to find an equivalence honestly."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"imo, it's a good thing. if it didn't have a single nomination, the fanboys could be high in denial about hey, maybe next year, the game just came out. but by acknowledging that it was only good enough for a super small award, the message is clear you're not goty worth it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,there is nothing like the cerulean coast in any other part of the game.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"and, elden ring art is still unmatched. what is your point?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"hell yeah, i love that too goddamn, this game sounds fucking awful..."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,blood and wine won rpg of the year.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"so what? that does not make the dlc any less worth. plus, the base game and the dlc are still way more than just worth the asking price and last about 200 hours."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"nope. the game awards don't mean anything, bmw has already beaten every game this year in metrics that actually matter"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"i think if a remake is transformative enough from the original it can be counted as a new game. ff7 from the 90s and rebirth are worlds apart. though i do think on the other hand having separate categories for such games would allow more games to be viable for a place, as opposed to cluttering fewer categories with fewer games. so maybe they should indeed split them up?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,ff7 rebirth isn't a remake though.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,yeah the emotional range and weight that bentley has is next level. barret is the emotional rock of the party and bentley crushes it. the scene where he confronts dynne is the best performance of the year for me easily. games dont make me cry but damn did barret get me in that moment. christian and baron are ahead of white for me too. baron is extremely underrated as tifa.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,and mario odyssey. nintendo was arguably competing with themselves more than anything else
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,persona 5 is why i say this it got robbed jrpgs historically dont win game of the year this is sadly a fact. jprgs are clearly my most favourite genre.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-24,jrpgs are regularly some of the best games year over year lol.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,not really and i say that as someone who absolutely adores elden ring.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,geoff keighley is a brain dead dipshit confirmed
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,why does it matter? you'd rather another remake and a series known for repurposing 90 of its assets be nominated instead?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,who cares if you need the og game to play it? doesn't change the fact that it's more game than most of the games ever nominated for goty. i don't get where these rules are coming from that people are inventing for a game to be eligible for recognition at the end of the year.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"fortnite gets a tweaked version of an existing map and is the very definition of ongoing live service game so, no."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,there is more actual game in that dlc than 45 astro bot's put together.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,in yet there is no dlc category and the precedent has been set for years. if they didnt want this outcome they should have announced rule changes months ago.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,deleted
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,which doesn't mean in any way that most people feel that way tho.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"tbf i never thought that having the story locked behind a payed expansion is an issue, but a the really old ones should become free or at least get drastically reduced in price and b they outright removed story from the game and their attempt of in game what happened so far is absolutely abysmal. but yeah, the main problem right now is uncertainty. if they know what destinys future looks like theyre doing a shit job at communicating that to the player base. and regarding diablo and helldivers, yeah my point exactly! how do they count as ongoing? diablo 4 was last year but its ongoing content got criticized with every season. helldivers 2 is good but it has been out for just 9 months"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"ohh okay. didnt play ff so dont know, but always heard that its good. but i cant judge."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i think they might have given it to aeriths actress as cody still got 3rd game which is when he gonna have a big moment.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,but the nominations are not based on the games people talk more about on the internet.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,ayo when did people start hating on wukong?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,truly the hottest take in here.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-21,"yeah that's another game that's just fun. haven't picked it up since i'm not sure i'd appreciated it much without being onto wh. too many games these days focus on some big narrative, or open world, or some kind of socialpolitical message rather than just being a fun game and giving gamers what they love. luckily the overly preachy or pc games from this year have all failed incredibly, so i think people are finally rejecting them."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"helldivers 2 had the potential to truly be the best multiplayer game of the year by a mile with its emergent story telling based on community efforts. instead it's like jumping on a trampoline, the game can fly high, it comes down, then up again, and then the game messes up your ankle."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"for me personally, i've heard of balatro far before ufo 50. i only discovered ufo 50 when jerma played it last week. but that's fair though."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,rebirth is just ff ubisoft edition with a worse story than the og. the fact this even reviewed well means gaming is dying.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"the witcher 3's blood and wine dlc already won best rpg a few years back. it's not something new, it's just a rare occurance."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,released 2004! that ones still alive??
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,dont hurt me
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,lol
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,hades 2 which is early access still.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,agreed
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"i'll bother replying. not for you cause you have nothing to offer, but for others who may happen upon your comment and think you're... what was the word, oh yes, ignorant. why do you feel the need to stay ignorant? if you don't even bother to check someone's facts as trueuntrue the the fool is you all. 1. very poor english. 2. it's not my job to factcheck others when they make claims, it's the duty of the individual who made the claim to provide evidence. clearly they have none, so i didn't care to ask for some. 3. that's how the world works, and the only one who's ignorant is the person who opposes the rule because they're uneducated."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,weak year? its one of the strongest in a while
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"no, its to reward innovations in accessibility. just because you dont care about it doesnt make it valueless."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"fuck off dude, i've only played one miyazaki game, take your snide attitude elsewhere. i don't care about any of your points, i won't read them. all i said was erdtree was obviously not a bad game if it got 94 on metacritic and you decided to white knight some other game. very cool response, i'm glad you typed it out"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"do you have actual reason then cuz we're 2 comments deep now and you've just said it's a bad idea and never articulated why it's a fun way to drum up interest in the next release slate. the game awards is also an advertisement. it's fun and it's functional, i don't see the issue. what's yours?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,what's the issue with it? it's a fun category
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"the difference is one is a sequel, the other is an additional part of an existing game. all for shadow of the erdtree getting the acclaim it deserves but if i have to spend hundreds of hours on a game that released a couple of years ago to get to the part of the game up for nomination, then it shouldn't be put up for nomination"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"no, it would qualify for tga 2025."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,it was independently developed and then published by bigmode who are a publisher that focus on independent small development teams to bring attention to good work being done by said independent teams
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,because it isn't. an award show can by definition never be objective.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"its the truth i actually play a ton of games in my spare time. what games have you completed this year outside of wukong? if you really want a degen nomination, stellar blade was better than wukong"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,i'm amazed that anyone who played through the abyssal woods or the multiple finger ruins could genuinely still believe that.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"sure, but i didn't like that either, and i don't think it was nominated for game of the year, it was other categories."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,you don't see why a dlc that requires a base game to play shouldn't be game of the year?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,there absolutely should be a category for best dlc or addon.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,i feel like blood and wine has been getting its due praise man
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,you make the claim and really can not just answer? lol
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,because ow at launch was an amazing game.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,no but i think he helps in changing the rules and format that allow certain games to make list. and do you really think geoff has no influence on what gets nominated?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,bs pl was literally top 2 last year.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"and the base game got major reworks before phantom liberty came out, including the 2.0 overhaul. so your implication that cyberpunk is just a good game now because of the excellent expansion makes no sense. you can ofc still personally not like the game in general, thats your right, but you dont have to buy phantom liberty to enjoy it now, sinple as that. pl doesnt fix the game at all, the reworks did that."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,it's also been that way for years. they had a witcher 3 dlc win best rpg in 2016.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"you are part of the problem if you don't understand what 90 of people are saying. it. is. not. a. game. a motorbike has 2 wheels, but if i think it's better than some cars, does that mean it should be able to win car of the year? no. i know fromsoft fanboys are a bit dense, but jesus, you aren't helping their image."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"if your game is something thats locked behind prerequisites that 58 of the player base cant even access? yeah no, youre not a goty candidate i dont care how good your game is. youre setting a horrible precedent for games moving forward."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"if you need to own and load the base game to play it, then it's not a separate game. all they needed to do is create a expansion category and stipulate the minimum amount of content to qualify."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,my point and i believe the start of this thread aren't commenting on the quality but the accessibility of the content the game awards is specifically saying that shadow of the erd tree is among the best games released this year. shadow of the erd tree isn't its own game it's an expansion of an existing game so i don't think it should be up for a game of the year award. there should be a dlc of the year award or something for it instead
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"sometimes. i played gow 2018 and haven't played any previous god of wars, i played prototype 2 without playing much of prototype 1, i played divinity original sin 2 without having played the first. i could probably go on. it's not super common but i wouldn't say it's rare. i know a few people who played only uncharted 4 and not the other 3 since they had a ps4 but not a ps3. that's part of why maybe 1 a series a generation would be fine"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"no, but if i wanted to, i could. you can't with dlc. if i decided to play ffvii rebirth right now, i don't have to play ffvii remake. i should to understand the story, but i don't need to actually boot up and start the game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"sure, but if someone decided they wanted to play rebirth without playing remake they could. there's no prerequisite to playing them."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,"the game has quite a lot of variation at base. lots of jokers, decks and strategies to play around with. i think the game just might not be for you. that being said, even more variation wouldn't hurt. hopefully the gameplay update comes out soon"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"literally, or jagged peak, or finger ruins, or charos hidden grave, or abyssal woods, or shaman village, obviously havent played the dlc"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,my point is this art design was already recoginzed once and hence there is no need to recognize it again.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"and, elden ring art is still unmatched. maybe if you like grey on grey with some washed out pastel colors mixed in. i don't."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,there is a big difference between the 2 awards but i also still disagree with that winning even that award.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"it makes it not worthy being called game of the year. erdtree was a good dlc, but it is just that, a dlc. it cannot stand on its own and therefore is not a game in its own right. elden ring already had its moment when it won goty in 2022, there is no reason its dlc needs to occupy a nominee spot over other deserving titles that were released this year."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,metrics that actually matter? it is the lowest on the metacritic in all it's nominated categories. the game itself is just ok. nice art. but combat loop gets boring. most of the bosses are meh. and the level design so outdated which is why the invisible walls are a symptom of that. sote is a dlc that decimates bmw alone. the only part of the game that gave a wow factor was the intro.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-24,"which is why they win game of the year, year over year, right?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"it just categorically is, it's not a classic turn based anime rpg lol, it is in the most literal sense. also i hope the wink made you realize i was being cheeky lol, not to be taken so seriously"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"no. remakes and don't deserve it either, and remasters deserve nothing but their sales. make new categories. it should only go to games released the same year as the award to earn its place as game of the year even if it's an asset flip, if it's made and released that year, fun and earned it, nominate it. otherwise the whole awards thing is more of a meaningless bs title than it already was. other games deserved that spot."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"space marine could've been nominated, like a dragon could've been nominated, helldivers 2 could've been nominated. are any of those remakes? no. a dlc shouldn't be nominated and i'm saying this as someone with 100 hours into sote alone"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"because the award is game of the year. the dlc is what is nominated, the only way to play dlc is by having elden ring. nobody is questioning how amazing and best in business the team are that developed elden ring. it why it won in 2022. the issue is it nominated a dlc now and taken the spot of another game. they changed rules to allow this and it looks shady and suspect. that just how i seeing it atm."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,you don't get why people believe the game of the year award should go to a game that came out in the year of the award? i don't know how they could make that more clear without making it sound satirical.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,then maybe gasp it should have been released as a separate game and there wouldnt be any discourse
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,there were no rules changed. dlcs just haven't been game of the year worthy...till now.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i didn't lie, i didn't know. it's not exactly common knowledge that expansions can be nominated for goty."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,nobody is hating on the game. but it has flaws.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"for me personally, i've heard of balatro far before ufo 50. i never said balatro was less popular than ufo 50. i said balatro is considerably less popular to other nominees. also, of course you've heard of balatro far before ufo 50. balatro was released at the beginning of february. ufo 50 was released at the end of september, less than 2 months ago."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,your opinion is actually very irrelevant in this context i often hear the ubisoft comparison but there is actually no ubisoft game from the last 1015 years with the same reviews or even 7 nominations for tga by the way all goty contenders are based on past formulas  astrobot is based on super mario games metaphor is based on the personasmt formula  with even worser dungeons  elden ring sote uses mechanics that were already established in demons soul and dark soul and is 100 based on this formula  also its 11 copygame from the basegame er  wukong is a simple boss rusher without any deeper gameplay mechanics balatro is a poker roguelike which has also existed before although not as good

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"man, if you read a little bit of what i said you wouldn't have responded on this tone, or at least that's what i think. metacritic scores mean almost nothing here, but they do have a small relevance i won't deny that"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"a game can command all the anticipation that no other game has ever had and still come out underwhelming. examples starfield, no man's skyalthough it seems it has redeemed itself, swtor, and one has to ask again, is it a good idea? so far i'm hearing oh it's a fun category!, power to you  i'll be waiting for more arguments in support for it. i'm not convinced it's a worthy category."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"so if absolutely nothing changed about sote except for the fact that fromsoft would release it standalone, not requiring you to own the base game, would it be elligible in your opinion? if so, i can agree with that. the paywall that it's hidden by is the worst part of it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,so it was published and got a bunch of advertising funding and networks that indie games dont get. aka its not an indie game
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"if that's the case then no wonder why there are so many wrong things on these days. but if that's not the case, you put your subjective and feelings aside"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"that's fair enough. anything above a simple dlc. if it is a complete game in all the aspects, that's good enough for me. objectively speaking the best games of the year so far are these. 1 black myth wukong 2 stellar blade 3 warhammer 30k 4 astro bot i've played all of these and others, but mainly these 4 or at least the 2 of above are evolving the genres and industry in new and interesting ways if you care about it. from software and miyazaki need to update their game because they have already been surpassed by many other developers they have inspired. heck lies of p alone is better than the majority of their catalog  bloodborne and dark souls are the only ones above it. i'm a huge fan and of their works, bloodborne is top 3 best games of all time objectively speaking and i can't wait to play it on pc once we crack all the codes, but i'm not another blind follower like many people are now just because they have played a single game from them , and it's not even the best game they have on their catalog. elden ring and shadow of the erdtree are really fun and have many good things, but it has way too many flaws but overall it is a well crafted piece of work."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"it won best rpg i think. i feel like its such a grey area personally because some dlcs i think absolutely should be able to win and nominated and others should not, but its totally on a case by case basis so theres no real consistency"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"take it easy. we should not put the blame on others for not sharing your view. i am discussing the point. you say its not a game. for me, it has technically all the attributes of a full game, apart from being based on an already existing world. the gameplay, the story, the details are all, equal if not bigger, than a full game. even bigger than most of the full games of 2024. btw, your example of motorcar is just out of context, if not to say a clearly biased one. if you have a problem with fromsoft or found the game so hard and hated it, you dont need to share your rage here. i dont even want it to win, i said it deserves the nomination, and any dlc that has the same attributes and characteristics of being as big as a full game, should deserve to win a place between the nominees."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"again, how does that disqualify a game from being recognized as the best gaming content released within a year? i didn't realize that there was a difficulty barrier that prevented games from being eligible."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"again. who cares? why does this matter? if you focus simply on the unique content being offered, it is as much a new game as anything."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"my point and i believe the start of this thread aren't commenting on the quality but the accessibility of the content since when has accessibility been a criteria for game of the year? the game awards is specifically saying that shadow of the erd tree is among the best games released this year. shadow of the erd tree isn't its own game it's an expansion of an existing game again, this goes back to the semantics of this argument. it is only an expansion because that is how they decided to distribute shadow of the erdtree. if you are incapable of judging content for what it actually is, then you're going to continuously get tripped up over the semantics of what is or isn't a game. but there really isn't much about sote that doesn't resemble what could be considered a sequel. like, how is astro bot more an actual game compared to astro's playroom? how is spiderman 2 more of an actual game compared to spiderman and miles morales? how is like a dragon pirate yakuza in hawaii more of an actual game compared to infinite wealth?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,well if you want to talk accessibility then how about the fact that i can't even play some of those games because im on pc? its less of a commitment to progress through a crossplatform game than to drop hundreds just to play one thats exclusive time vs money. the point is that there are gates to everything you want to play for the average gamer especially. ain't no way most of us have played everything nominated on that list regardless. therefor the arguments redundant to me.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,you know what? you guys are right. their entire work should be disqualified for a technicality no matter how good it is
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"again, why does this ultimately matter? whether something is goty is based on the quality of the content, not how long it is, how big the budget is, how aaa it is, whether it's actionrpgplatformingfpsetc. you look at the content of the release and judge it solely on that."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,"only like 10 of jokers are good. there's not much strategy to it. whatever gives the most in the two categories of numbers you have, that's it. it just became frustratingly basic and devoid of any strategy after a doing gold stake a few times. just rerolling starts constantly feels mandatory. most gold stake runs are unwinnable from sheer rng, no matter what you do."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,if it still has the best art it will still get nominated. there are no barriers to what gets nominated as long as there is a category for it.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"even if it's an asset flip, if it's made and released that year, fun and earned it, nominate it. yet you don't think that an expansion with 4060 hours of unique open world content isn't worthy of a nominee? this award is purely to celebrate the work that goes into making great gaming content. gaming is much more varied than any other awarded medium. so there needs to be a bit more flexibility when considering what should be nominated. and when you have an expansion that is as substantial as sote, then it has to be evaluated based on the experience, not whether it ticks of a checklist of impossible guidelines that are ever evolving. i mean, final fantasy 7 rebirth is technically a remake, but it's so fundamentally different and new, that it clearly should be nominated. and sote is as much of a stand alone gaming experience as pretty much anything. so why shouldn't it be considered?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"like a dragon is the game i was referencing when talking about a series that largely reuses most of its in game assets from release to release. not saying it isn't deserving if a good game is there. but mentioning that game as potentially more deserving, because you simply view sote as basic dlc isn't a very good argument. as for helldivers 2 and space marine 2, you really have to consider whether these games are actually better than sote. and based on the critical reception for sote, they clearly are not. there needs to be arguments directed towards games that people would actually consider to be better than what fromsoft released with sote. otherwise, it just looks like people who are upset that their favorite games this year weren't nominated."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"yo, people need to stop saying what they changed the rules. they didn't. dlc and expansions have always been eligible. there just haven't been any nominated until now. so maybe this is where your frustration is stemming from? but all that would need to change here is that shadow of the erdtree be distributed differently and people would likely have little to no issue with it being nominated. and if that's the case, then all of this controversy goes out the window."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"why is it impossible for you people to realize that the sote content is massive, unique, and released this year? it's like four times at least the original content than you get from astro bot. and astro bot is really just expanded content from the demo that launched with the console."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"if that's all it would take, then your argument is shit. lol"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"thats my point. if they didnt want this outcome, months ago they needed to make a rule change to stop dlcs from being nominated"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"yes but you could say that for everything. if phantom liberty was released separately from cyberpunk 2077, it could technically be up for nomination for game of the year when it was released. these experiences are intrinsically linked to the base game which is what makes them special experiences. but they aren't games, they are expansions for existing games and should be judged as such."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,go to the indie game wikipedia and scroll to definition. having a publisher aid with advertisement does not make a game notindie. the game was developed by one guy who did everything bar the publishing. the publisher had no input on the direction of the game itself. can't get much more indie than a one man development operation

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"elden ring shadow of the erdtree is a largescale expansion for the game elden ring. downloadable content dlc is additional content created for an already released video game, distributed through the internet by the game's publisher. stop calling it a game, it is not a game, its dlc despite you trying to say it feels more game. theres nothing minor here, its flat out how the game was advertised you know, as a dlc. youre bending over backwards to justify a mickey mouse nomination."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"what does the console exclusivity have to do with the point i'm making? shadow of the erd tree isn't its own game it's additional content to an existing game i'm not sure what your point about stuff not being available on pc has to do with that at all. the game awards aren't platform centric. the difference between content being an original game, a dlc, or a sequel is kind of separate from the platform it's available on i keep reading your comment trying to understand and i'm really not sure what that second paragraph is even trying to say"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"again, why does this ultimately matter? it matters because a dlc isn't a new game. it's additional content to an existing one. the view on game of the year, is a new game  something that can be bought and played at a vanilla level. if you add a new wing to your house, is it a new house? even if it is the same size or bigger than what your house was? or is it considered the same house plus more? do you get a new address for it? dlc is considered an additional piece to a game, not something new. it doesn't matter if the dlc is the greatest thing ever or 500 hours of new content it is still just elden ring with more content. let me put it this, my game of the year is final fantasy vii rebirth. if the game had released as a dlc to final fantasy vii remake rather than a sequel, i would not have it nominated because it is only adding to an existing game, not making a new one."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,"most gold stake runs are unwinnable from sheer rng that's just blatantly false much like the rest of your comment. people say this kind of thing about a lot of roguelikes, despite the amount of people that go on huge winning streaks in these games. again, the game is quite clearly not for you at all."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"brother it doesn't matter if sote is better at any category than the other games, it's a fucking dlc meaning you need to play the game to almost the end just to access the dlc that's the point, it's not an expansion, it's additional content, you need to own the original game to access it, that's why it shouldn't be nominated, elden ring already won goty before, this is like nominating it again for no reason. also saying like a dragon reuses assets as a bad thing doesn't make sense, it's a new standalone game with 100 hours you can pour into it, tears of the kingdom reused assets too and no one complained about it. it's not about the dlc being better or worse it's about the dlc being additional content to an already existing game"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"but mentioning that game as potentially more deserving, because you simply view sote as basic dlc isn't a very good argument. you're doing the same thing but in reverse, saying that just because a game is an asset flip that it is less deserving than an expansion. at the end of the day, one of them is marketed as a full game and one of them as a dlc. that is what matters, a game might be an asset flip, and if that is the case then it won't be nominated or considered good. sote might be incredible, but its still not a new game, nor is it marketed as such."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"yeah but that's my question. if these were to be released standalone and the publisher called them sequels instead of dlcs, do you think there is enough content in them to be actually classified as a sequel? for shadow of erdtree i would argue that there is. for something like assassin's creed freedom cry which actually was released standalone iirc i would say absolutely not. phantom liberty is borderline for me, but i'd probably call it an expansion."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"kind of an unfulfilling category if you ask me and its not every year you have at least 5 games that come out with expansions the size of phantom liberty or sote. inconsistent, insufficient, and therefore impractical."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"something that can be bought and played at a vanilla level. that is simply you creating a make believe barrier. this isn't any sort of official criteria. let me put it this, my game of the year is final fantasy vii rebirth. if the game had released as a dlc to final fantasy vii remake rather than a sequel, i would not have it nominated because it is only adding to an existing game, not making a new one even if the dlc was exactly what rebirth currently is? and where do you draw a line here? are the like a dragon games eligible, even though they are largely built upon the exact same assets as the previous games? what th n constitutes a legitimate new game? astro bot is also very clearly built upon the foundation of astro's playroom. it just has new levels and some new gameplay mechanics. but it pretty much looks exactly the same as playroom and recycles a number of existing gimmicks."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,"lucky streaks will exist. it's really not the same as other roguelikes. in something like slay the spire you can actually reliably win. i don't know if there's been a lot of balance patches since i played balatro but there wasn't anyone reliably beating gold stake every time online at the time. some runs are just not playable, you just don't get a good mult joker early and just lose."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"what other game trumps elden ring's art direction? none of the other nominations come close to the designs of bayle, messmer, dancing dragon, and rellana. or area's like shaman village, shadowe keep, or bayle arena. everywhere you look it is like a painting. sote is just built different. which is why it is getting nominations. it deserves it. would be happy if it wins goty even. it beats out all the other nominations easily. and i played them all."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"cultural effect, popularity and quality of game absolutely matters for goty. every aspect you could require for goty it meets, the only drawback is the invisible walls which is pretty minor and only really noticeable in the early chapters"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"i mean, astro bot is all of the same concepts as the demo that released four years ago. not sure why it's considered more an original concept than a completely new ground up open world map that provides 4060 hours of top quality content, compared to 1520 hours."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"my point in brining up like a dragon was to point out how your are choosing to view sote. you are dismissing it as dlc being additional content to an already existing game as if the content in sote is just reused assets in an existing game map. they aren't. it's an entirely new map that is as large or larger than a lot of open world games. it's huge. it's essentially a sequel. the only reason why i'd view it differently is because where elden ring is about 70120 hours, sote is only around 4060 hours. but all of the other fromsoft soulsborne games fall into the 3040 hours to beat length. sote is larger than any of those games. yet, people like you dismiss it as just some 'additional content."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,who gives a shit?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"personally, i don't see much of a difference between this expansion and spiderman 2, which is essentially an expansion."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,because the expansion is fucking huge
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"i haven't played those games, so i can't say if they deserved to be recognized in this way. but i can say that shadow of the erdtree is more game than every dark souls game and bloodborne. are those not games?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"im not disagreeing. im just say if they didnt, they should have changed the rules months ago. people are just upset because they thought now that there wasnt an elden ring type game involved, one of their pet games should win. and maybe they should. but now they do have to deal with a from game in the category"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,"you're right, your mistake was knowing so much better than them. you are very smart."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,lol....you need to play more games.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i respect your opinion, but i would take the 2024 nominees over the 2021 nominees. therefore, it's subjective! totally fine to have differing opinions, i thought this years nominees were great, and there was a ton that didn't get nominated that i really really enjoyed. i'm looking at the best games of 2021 vs 2024 as well on google and metacritic and there's a few, but this year has many more that i enjoyed. all good!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,also this year has the second highest average average of goty nominees. it would be even more but wukong is the lowest ever. there is 10 games launched this year with higher critic and fan scores. cope
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"let me guess you play 1 genre of gaming and nothing else? weve had multiple enourmous hits this year helldivers, ff7, p3r, sh2, wukong, astro, metaphor, and countless others. youre just objectively wrong this is a strong year lmao youre like a child if i didnt like it its bad"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i was rooting for ragnarok, as i loved that game, but now after playing both, i think elden ring edges it out for me. it might be the most visually stunning and most interestingly crafted open world i've ever seen in a game. it barely has a narrative, to me that's the only con of the game so far."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,well yes it got better there is a slightly visual update announced with better textures. but it's not developed anymore by the people who started it and ea only wants it on life support so they can sell overpriced boxes with stuff.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"yes, professor one has to ask again, is it a good idea? i'll be waiting for more arguments in support for it remind me again, who sounds dickish? furthermore, who clearly has an inflated ego? those are rhetorical, i don't actually want your answer. everyone here knows who already."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"and for me it's how intrinsically linked to the base game they are and not how much content there is. despite shadow of the erdtree having plenty of content, it is so intrinsically linked to the base game it cannot be judged without including judgements of that base game. which, for me, should exclude it from nomination."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"see thats what you're not getting. playstation had big input and say in what the helldivers 2 team could and could not do as part of the publishing deal. bigmode purely advertised animal well. the fact animal well was one guy as well is hugely important. there is no strict defenitiion of indie with games same as there is no strict definition of indie in relation to music or film. its a vibe. again, i'd refer you back to reading the damn wiki definition. just because it doesn't fit your narrow strict way of defining indie does not mean its not indie."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,not an answer to my question wich confirms that you have no idea what objectivity is.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"why not give it to a movie or tv series while we're at it? if the winning entry is gonna be different from the category it's included in, then it shouldn't matter right?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"i mean, the video game awards themselves cared enough about the semantics to make the rule change to allow dlc's to be eligible for goty. so why shouldn't we care about the semantics and not wanting dlc's to be eligible?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,what makes you think so?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,me and my friends were also adults when it came out. and played it a lot for a few years. it was revolutionary at the time and spawned a bunch of copies immediately. you might not have liked it but a ton of others did and it absolutely deserved goty that year.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"are you now saying they're lying? no, but doesn't mean its the truth though. because you guys are angry over nothing i'm not angry, i could care less. i just gave my reason on why. but there is a valid argument about allowing a dlc expansion, remakes and remaster to win goty regardless of how good it is. but sure go off, everything must be a conspiracy. questioning the integrity of something does not make it a conspiracy. you seem to be taking these conversations personally."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"there has been so many good games released this year. prime example that i've seen brought up is silent hill 2, also if remakes and remasters are eligible then what about persona 3 reload? i know metaphor is on there representing atlus but p3r is a remake of a near 20 year old game that easily takes 60 hours even if you rush it. is that not big enough? they may aswell announce the results now, er dlc is going to win because why else would they change a rule to include it otherwise?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"the game award for game of the year is an award presented annually by the game awards. it is given to a video game judged to deliver the best experience across creative and technical fields. video game, not dlc feels like a new game is not a qualifier."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-23,watch balatro university take the worst jokers in the game and scale them to infinity with pretty much zero effort. it actually requires some skill lol.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,bmw and cultural effect? no one talks about bmw outside of china. hardly ever gets mentioned anywhere besides its echo chamber. and nothing about it is quality. it play as an outdated game in a nice coat of paint. the only drawback is the invisible walls which is pretty minor it isn't minor because if you game relies on secret paths as part of the exploration. then invisible walls should not be a thing. especially in a 2024 game. like we aren't talking about invisible wall on a rocky hill type of thing. it is lets make stairs that has open space with no indication of blocked out landmark and put a invisible wall in it. httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vne04inxjd1mhttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vne04inxjd1m httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vzjoidgvelnehttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vzjoidgvelne the game doesn't even have the best combat. stellar blade takes it.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"you just wanna be right don't you? i said i played the dlc for 100 hours or more, i love it, i'm not dismissing it, but the fact is that it is additional content, doesn't matter how big the content is, it is additional content, it's in the word dlc not expansion d l c. they are the game awards not the dlc awards, they should've made an additional category for expansionsdlcs, not nominate it for game of the year. i don't know how you can't understand that."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"they arent countless you have 3 remakes in your list already. some years are weaker than others objectively that is the case with this year. astrobot is good, wukong is good, helldivers was fun multiplayer but those would all be very clear alsorans in a strong year."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"that in some other areas are the reason as to why, i think that ragnarok should have won, even though it still has too many flaws in some areas that must not be ignored. however it is objectively speaking the better game just because it is crafted in a more simple and cohesive way. this alone should be a huge factor whenever you are going to give an award to a game. if the game is very good and leaves you on good feelings but it has so many performances issues as well as very bad designs, then these are things you must look into very carefully if you are planning to give such game a big award."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,can you elaborate? how is sote intrinsically linked to the base elden ring in a way that ragnarok isn't to gow 2018 for example?

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,"i play since 97  apparently not, because of all this dribble you just wrote lmao. not to mention your arguments are structured like a child's.   but wait where are your arguments ?  whats the point in trying to argue with you? even if i wrote point for point why rebirth is mediocre, you'd just go nu uh. but just to prove a point, like lets look at some of what you wrote.  the best combat system in a jrpg lol no  i can list a few jrpgs that came out this year with better combat. notably granblue fantasy relink. hell visions of mana has a very similar system to ff7 but executes it 10 times better. the action combat is incredibly restrictive because they went the way of pseudo turn based but then the turn based side is also incredibly binary. no fun problems to solve. the action gameplay is also mediocre because you as the player have very little agency basic attacks are mildly worthless, dodgingparrying fall apart anytime there is more than 3 enemies on the field, fun moves are limited by atb, etc . most fights require very specific setups which you can't know until you fight and scan said enemy. theres also the fact that the enemy a.i. is programmed to focus on you the player so if really wanted to be super efficienttactical, you need to constantly be shuffling characters. or abuse the parry mechanics which is what i did. either way it was terrible.  probably the best soundtrack in gaming history with over 450 music pieces in an endless variety its not even the best soundtrack in a final fantasy game, but sure it is good.  250 monsterboss types, 9 unique combat movesets for the characters copy pasted enemies, a majority of which are trash mobs, which works in a traditional turn based game. low effort and lazy in an action game. kind of like an ubisoft game.  9 unique combat movesets for the characters i'm not even going to go into this one. a basic attack and a few abilities which have no real unique interactions, barely any utility, barely any depth, hardly qualifies for unique movesets.  massive detail of the open world and cities empty large spaces with no purpose other than set dressing. kind of like an ubisoft game.  minigames with their own lore lol. fort condor? also a bunch of low effort repetitive content hamfisted in spades throughout the game. one of the main complaints of rebirth actually.  queens blood that competes with gwent and triple triad lol no. queens blood is incredibly simplistic. i think i edited my deck once or twice throughout the game and beat the whole qb story.  chocobo racing as a kind of mario kart light chocobo racing that is worse than both the og ff7 and ff14. because in ubisoft fashion, they stripped out all of the depth.  gears and gambit that builds on the gambit mechanics of ff12 oh this minigame built on the fully customizable party ai from ff12? the same system where i could program my teammates to do exactly what i want in battle when i want them to do it with little to no oversight? i've played rebirth lol. you're coping super hard to even bring this up.  12 hours of voice acting yeah with aerith and tifa's terrible voice acting? oh please more generic anime waifu voices i love those s. red's terrible transition?  massive gameplay mechanics what does this even mean? also, there is not a single system in rebirth that has real depth. oh wait, almost like an ubisoft game.  unique movement methods for each open binomial lol  sidequests that deepen character information and relationships and dozens of pointless filler side quests with awful writing. almost like....well you know.  i could go on but even if it wasnt final fantasy it is and remains one of the best and most ambitious video games of the current generation lol its not even an ambitious final fantasy game. all they did was take a cult classic, butcher it, the story, and the gameplay into pieces and sell it to people that don't know any better. so there are your arguments lol."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,hey buddy maybe you should look up what objectively means because you dont know. objectivley this year has more highly rated games than others so seeth and cope. idk what your problem is but you keep thinking your opinion is gospell
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-18,"the two games are close enough in their quality that i don't think you can say objectively one is better than the other we aren't comparing them to something like, assassin's creed for example where you could say that. even then, i think elden ring is better because of vastly better open word design, enemy variety, build variety, branching paths, and artistic beauty. i think ragnarok was an amazing conclusion storywise but it really didn't do much more gameplay wise than the original god of war to warrant winning. as much as i loved the spear lol"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-19,"you have to get to a certain part of the story to access the dlc. therefore, it is impossible for you to judge the dlc without judging the base game mechanics. you also take your existing character build into the dlc meaning the experience your getting is a continuation from the base game and not an all new experience. it is intrinsically linked in this way. and those mechanics, although having some new things added to them, are the same mechanics that were put in 2 years ago. ragnarok, although the experience is improved by playing gow 2018, it can be judged without having touched the previous game."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2019-11-16,it's possible that a game like that can be done. more so that it is relic studios who made company of heroes. now company of heroes was made by some guys who left and weren't around for company of heroes 2 and around that time relic had gone down hill. leading to dawn of war 3 which was extremely tragic. so...yes it is possible that the trailer features some things that involve gameplay. that gameplay is possible. it's more beleivable because relic studios are behind it. it's not beleivable because the guys who made relic studios special aren't around unless they get new talent. it's also not beleivable because the trailer doesn't show any interface or stuff like that. the unit animations and landscapes are probably right. but maybe how the bases look are a complete fabrication. maybe no bases that have walls connecting to forts. might not even have units that can mount walls and run along them. but in 2006 a game called black and white 2 allowed you to do that. it's sad that alot of games today are outdone by games between 20002010 in terms of features.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,"big 1 to desperados and shadow tactics. all the games by mimimi are fantastic! it's very satisfying when you hit go from the pause  planning screen and fire off a multicharacter combo kill. you might also like satellite reign, which has stealth mechanics."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,"tw dlc isn't that bad. not if you've ever played a paradox game. the price going up recently sucks, but they all feel pretty optional. they generally roll out the qol features for everyone when a new dlc drops. unlike paradox where you need to buy every dlc to get the qol features included. and the enemy armies do get the new units  which is nice. it's basically always silly to buy every dlc because unless you're retired, you don't have time to play long campaigns for every faction. unless things have changed in the past couple years at least."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,"thr dlcs add great value, but are not needed at all to get lots of value out of the game. the latest model of dlcs that release 3 indivual lords, that are packaged at a discount i'd pretty good imo. some are definitely better than others. but, the base lords are great. i recommend not to get any dlcs until you have a firm grasp of the playstyle you enjoy most."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,it does have pause and honestly feels a little more polished than zerok. they're both great games but my friends stick to bar due to it feeling a little more polished. i like zerok for the terrain editing midgame and the absolutely bonkers super weapons.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,"1 for beyond all reason, it's a great game!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-24,"supreme commander 2 ran better, had better graphics and was far more optimized, but the game play was definitely a step backwards. it was still okay, but definitely not the quality of the first game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,"eh. i would say you really don't have more control in combat in most rtses than you do in stellaris. granted, the last time i really played an rts was warcraft 2, so maybe things have changed. but, in an rts, you select a unit or units, tell them to move to an area, or attack a target. when their target dies, they often start attacking the next nearest target. oftentimes, you are selecting entire groups of units. ultimately, stellaris does the same thing. you could control ships on an individual basis, but the game makes it easy to group them up. i'm not really seeing a difference, other than scale. neither allow the kind of individual control a tactical game would demand."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,the graphics blew my mind in 1999. i was 20.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,"i really enjoyed supcom2, mainly because you're eventually forced to make a move if you base build"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,"the difference for me is in the degree of control. when the battle starts, you lose control of singular units. let's imagine the scenario, i'm attacking with the mixed army of swarmtype units and heavy longrange artillery vs single heavy unit and some flyswattertype support some kind of aoe somewhere nearby. in typical rts, i could just recall and reposition my swarm if i would encounter flyswatters, allowing my longrange artillery to make a fork for my opponent between chasing my swarm, but being exposed to the artillery, or to surrender a heavy unit. in stellaris you can't really do that, if your swarm fleet decides to fly into the zap cloudwell, only thing you can possibly do is to command a retreat. you can control the behaviour with the ship ai upgrades, but those changes are made before the combat, not during it. only thing that i could micromanage in stellaris is to move my shortranged fleet closer to the direction of arrival of the enemy fleet, so when the fight starts, i could have an advantage in range, but it's still a much smaller degree of control. i might also be wrong, because i never watched highlevel stellaris gameplay, and i'm a decentatbest stellaris player, so if i'm wrong about stellarisplease correct me."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,once you lose control of your units the second they enter combat i consider it less of an rts than most. in warcraft 2 i could move units to gain a tactical advantage or micro to hit targets i want. stellaris is more about grand strategy when it comes to combat.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,"well tomorrow that remaster celebrates its tenth birthday. grin yeah, i wasnt 20, but i wasnt under 15 either in 1999. i thought the remaster was gonna be five years ago when i went to look it up."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"careful. you choose this, then epic will shut down the servers."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,it may seem odd but it's rdr2 for me too even though i haven't played through it again since its release. it's my favorite game of all time and i would love to experience it again but i'm just afraid that the second time won't have the same impact. i would give anything to play it again completely fresh.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,this wasn't even a question for me. easily rdr2.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,infinite spaghetti
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,i could play the originals forever. until i reach snakemen...
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,i'm playing through halo ce for the millionth time currently. it still holds up. i wish there was a way to play on the multiplayer maps against bots though.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"honestly. when i was younger i did a full conpletion playthrough and collected everything i wanted to, and created a dead body pile. kinda ran out of stuff to do so i'd just kick on the pipboy radio and watch the stars and listen to the wind blow while i did other things irl. love that game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,same
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,getting close to finishing out my first playthrough and i'm already thinking about my next character.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"i would argue ck2 would also be fine, with mods, especially ones to improve the ui or change the world setting e.g. elder kings, game of thrones, lotr. ck2 has a ton more mods than ck3, iirc."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,took way too long of scrolling before finding ck
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-02,is this game still going strong?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"the game is less popular now than 10 years ago sadly, but with the custom maps, i'd argue this would be more than palatable."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-02,"was looking for this. the modding scene gives the game a long life span, especially the dlc sized mods."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,hope the servers wont shut down anytime soon

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,i know you're just trying to sound like an intellectual but your answer makes no damn sense. at least with video games you could choose one that plays out differently each time. why would you choose an experience that never changes?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,okay what book? like singular book. even if we include something like the complete works of shakespeare there's only so many times you can read merchant of venice. i guess some religious texts like the bible and koran can be books people only read over and over again but i have to imagine every once in a while most priestsimams pick up a copy of three body problem or some agatha christie mystery.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"it also has an amazing modding community, adding to that endless replayability."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,why is it that addicting?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-02,ive quit every expansion and always come back to see whats new. sometimes for the whole expansion and some just to see the main story.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,add in the various private communities as well. turtle is a great sort of classic thing. ascension is basically its own game at this point. and im sure there are others ive never bothered with.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"kind of yes to all of that. i played runescape when i was young and it's something i return to every so often out of nostalgia. it's kind of jank in the way only an early internet browser mmo could be. so it's sort of unique, it's a fun game to play, because of how basic it is the devs were able to pack it full of content in its original lifetime, and now new content is being added again since the game has such a dedicated player base."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"from my perspective everytime i log onto the game no matter how long it's been, it always feels exactly the same no matter what they change or add it always feels exactly like it did when i first played it. it's actually the only game that does this for me. even my favorite game the legend of dragoon doesn't give me this feeling everytime i replay it, and i've been playing runescape since runescape classic and osrs was just runescape lol. maybe it's just me but the game always feels like home to me. i haven't played in a year and just typing this i miss home. i think i'll make a new character tomorrow."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,major selling point for runescape is that you can play it with 100 attention or halfafk.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"it's fun for people who enjoy some types of grinding. there are new updates typically every week yes which would only extend it further, but the lifetime comment was largely based on the fact that there are a couple of things you can do in game that weren't created with the idea of ever being completed. it's possible to complete, after several years of playtime, but i'm not efficient enough that i ever would."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"completeing it often entails finishing the collection log. which is an in game journal that tracks unique drops you've actually received yourself. this incldes clue scrolls. and if you're any bit familiar with those, that means 3rd age gear. the math wizards have calculated that it'd take like 80100 years of the most efficient playing straight through no breaks to recieve every 3rd age drop on rate. not accounting for being unlucky. ontop of that you have the rest of the collection log, things like combat achievements, 200m every skill with new stuff coming out frequently. there's always something to aim for."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"i mean, do you actually have faith in bethesda to not cock it up like everything they have released post f4? and even then, seems like post disliked f4."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,do you mean halflife 3? left 4 dead 3? counterstrike 3? team fortress 3? portal 3? etc.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,i like your style!

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,that and ever quest last forever.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,can you suggest some good mods?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,yet that is what we do every damn time.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"honestly, yeah. i know people like to give starfield shit but i had a sick day the other day and gave it a few hours and enjoyed it as much as skyrim at least. maybe it doesn't have the staying power, but so far it seems fine."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,multiplayer makes the game a million times more fun imo

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"having played it this year for the first time and then immediately starting a new game and playing through it again, it loses nothing. i felt like the second play through was even better because i truly valued each and every moment i got to spend with my boah"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"i chose it because it can be replayed infinitely. other games you eventually would run out of things to do or just get bored by doing the same quest, missions, checkpoints over and over. granted solitaire isnt that exciting but it can be replayed with different outcomes forever."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"the game is designed as a skinner box. your first couple levels come super easily and hit the reward centers of your brain very quickly. each level after takes more and more time to hit, so that reward comes less often. if your brain is prone to addiction, you crave that hit when you level up and the game flashes and makes celebratory noises. you get the same boost when you get a new weapon or piece of armor that makes your character x stronger. it's never enough though, there's always something more powerful that you need to get better gear or level up to beat. it sounds silly if you've never been on the mmo train, but it's very easy to get addicted to the power level increase treadmill."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"it gives your brain a chemical sense of progression and accomplishment that would otherwise only be possible in the real world. lots of kids feeling like their lives aren't going anywhere, or feel like they're a disappointment, or aren't capable of great things, end up being sucked into a virtual world where they can get that sweet armor or that sweet rare mount that the other kids don't have  making them feel superior to the other players, like how having an expensive bugatti must feel driving through traffic with the plebs. it also has to do with wow being an excellently crafted world, with a great musical score that just feels better than what most people are exposed to in the real world. add to that that it's very social, and being in a guild, working as a team, accomplishing tasks as a group, and having people depend on you, gives a real sense of family. the combination of sense of communityfamily, visualaudio stimulation, and the virtual reward of climbing a hierarchy  everything human beings are driven by irl to be better humans, but in the form of a video game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,people have given you some technical answers but i'll also answer that the game is often just genuinely good. it was obviously way ahead of it's time in a lot of ways and there's a lot of good content. people have great memories raiding or pvping or completing certain sections of the story in certain eras. in addition to it being designed to be addicting it was also a genuinely good game as well and set the standard for mmorpgs that was never really matched elsewhere although some games have arguably surpassed it at least in some ways.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"grab 20 in quarters and go take a seat at the slots at your closest casino. go on a wednesday or tuesday afternoon... look around at the other people that have chosen to spend their time there. take a seat and play through your stash of money. don't go get more money once you're out... but do stand up and look around again. you'll see those same people you saw when you came in, and you'll have a deeper understanding of why they are still there... and... you'll probably have a tingle in the back of your brain. fear that tingle. it's the call of the slots to the atm for another hit."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"i honestly don't understand. i read the comment that explains why, but i still don't get it. there are plenty of games that offer a similar experience of obtaining better loot, progressing to harder levels, xp boosts, etc. in no way i'm i bashing against the game. i have no problems with wow. i think there is just something missing from my brain because i don't get that addiction feeling from it. i tried it and it genuinely was just not interesting to me. but i guess people could say the same thing about the games i like. what makes them addicting to me? and truthfully i have no idea. it makes no sense why i don't like a game like wow but i enjoy games like valheim which are also very grindy."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,because he has poor impulse control. i've played the game off and on for 18 years. i have no issues putting it down when i'm bored.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"that's why it's goated for me. say your main game you enjoy is valorant, these types of games aren't really fun unless you're queued up for comp. which is often unenjoyable if you come home whipped from a long day of work or something, not awake enough to concentrate or what have you. x200b but that same case over on osrs is like, good day and time to relax? plenty of content for you to engage with that keeps focus. tired? plenty of ways to progress while clicking once or twice in 3 min intervals with some netflix booted up on the side."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,is it simple enough to be a good choice for a kids first mmorpg? or a good pick for that generally?

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,that was my case with runescape...
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"i played wow heavily from 2004 to 2009, raided all the top tiers at the times and was heavily driven by this loot treadmill. but idk, something changed after that. i genuinely dont get super excited about new drops when i play an mmo nowadays, and havent for the past 15 years. its no longer a hook for me at all. probably no surprise that i havent played wow since cataclysm then. i had thought it was just an element of growing up and maturing, and assumed everyone changed and cared less about loot. then i played classic wow when that came out and saw how batshit crazy even 35 year old adults were going over the same loot we already had gotten 15 years earlier. it blew my mind. i did not feel like i had a place in wow anymore after that. i was really looking forward to classic through wotlk too!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,my weakness is games with their own economy. especially if players control that economy and can tradesell amongst each other
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,i'm so glad i didn't have a computer like that as a kid. would have definitely gotten addicted to it. i think u need a subscription also and didn't really have an allowance either. i was more of a loner as a kid
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"not necessarily. there have been millions of people addicted to this game, they don't all have poor impulse control. it was literally designed to be addictive af. i don't have poor impulse control and have been on and off pretty much fully off the last 5 years since the graphics and gameplay just haven't kept up to modern games. but even i get urges to go hop back into that world since it was such a fun world to be a part of, especially when there is a new expansion or it's winter time with not much else to do."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"right on, ty."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,simple enough for sure. whether or not it would be the first pick i could not say though. rs is the only branch of mmos that i've tried. and os specifically has a lot more solo stuff going on than most do evidently. i would expect final fantasy xiv or world of warcraft to be the true picks given their wild success. but have never personally played to be able to say. there is a free version for both current branches of runescape though so you could always try it out free of charge.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,because you did not understand what i wrote.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-01,"absolutely, unfortunately it goes so much deeper than this. i was addicted to playstation 2 everquest in highschool and black desert online recently, but i have a cousin that's been consistently addicted since wow's release when we were in highschool. we were really close when we were kids. i still remember being on college break visiting him and seeing the log in screen for his wow with a full screen of max level characters. i think it was when lich king was the current expansion, but at that point i knew it was really bad and really sad. it's gone on for so long since then that it's his existence. essentially he started and never stopped. i'll give him a ton of credit for working at the same grocery store for 20 years, the man had every advantage, but he just loved wow. there is a ton of dignity in holding a job consistently for 20 years. it's admirable and can never be taken from him, but he's disgustingly ungroomed and has never had a girlfriend. this year he moved in with his mom because his long term rental property was condemned. he hasn't had heat or ac in years, it smells from the sidewalk, and no one has been inside. ben i love you man. at easter dinner i asked your dad if i should bring you a plate at work, like you always are, on every holiday, and he looked at me and just exhaled. i'm grateful for the newest dsm revision adding video game addiction years back it is real and ruins lives"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-29,"if you want single and multiplayer and many hours of fun, you should get aoe4. i think it's a great rts game and new civs were recently added for free, no dlc to pay for. multiplayer rounds 3x3 or 4x4 typically lasts 30 min  1 hour, rushes not included there is also 1v1, 2v2, ranked and coop but i rarely play those. a round can be even longer, in the longest round i played neither side could hold the sites nor build a wonder, it lasted awhile."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-29,"i found ck3 a bit disappointing after quaddigit hours on ck2 good foundation but lack of depth and got boring quickly, and it's still gonna get a million dlc so it might be good to wait on that one. don't know f1 manager but it sounds like it might be fairly shallownarrow compared to football managing style games, so i'd say aoe4 although i haven't played it yet either."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-29,"i have over a thousand hours in ck3. it's really good. plus, mod support. it's good."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-29,ive played a lot of ck3 and aoe4 but ill say ck3 because you have way more mods to play longer. even if the base game may be sometimes a bit boring when youre playing for 200 years.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-29,ck3.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-29,"something like hoi4 is this ck3? if so, i'm already doing exactly what you described in victoria 3. i like war with economy more than normal war in grand strategy."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-29,"first of all, thank you, victoria 3 and crusader kings 3 seem very similar to each other except for the period. instead of playing the same two games, i'd say get one grand strategy, one real time strategy and the other mmorpg. d"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-29,"quaddigit hours!? wow tyvm for your comment, it is incredibly valuable."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-29,"hoi and ck are very similar but differ in purpose. while both are strategy games, the purpose of ck isn't just to conquer as much territory as possible, but create the strongest dynasty. in that purpose, the game makes you role play as the head of your house. this can be interesting or unique when your character dies and your hier takes over. in medieval times, if a landed noble dies, their assets are divided up and given to the next in line to inherit. that land may not even be the same country that you were controlling, meaning that the focus of the game is less about making a strong country, but creating a political situation where the members of your house are secure, which often means making a strong country but could also mean marrying into your neighbor's family and making their heir's baby a part of your house, effectively taking over their territory. there is also a stronger focus one roleplaying as an individual  the current head of the house. you don't control your territory, you control the head of the house, and there are many events that occur during the game that are specific to your dude or dudette. so that's what makes ck a bit of an outlier to the other paradox grand strategy games. that and ck3 doesn't have 500 of dlc yet. wow that was really long. managed to write it all during my restroom break tho ."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"i wouldnt pay a single cent for it and would rather play aoe2 or age of mythology. but, i have game pass. so, i love the game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,hmmm graphics looked better on previous videos. long cutscenes are never a good substitute for actual gameplay footage.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"aoe 4 is a modern version of aoe 2, i will continue to play my old game thank you very much"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,doesn't meet aoe expectations and i think fans are to blame too ... aoe2 was my first game and aoe 4 was hence a game i was looking forward to for years.. in between few years ago i played aoe3 and i liked it too but aoe 2 was still my fav.. then i got to know that people apparently for some reason didn't like aoe3 and bashed out about it at some point .. i don't know why people didn't like aoe3 but it tried many new things .. looked way better in terms of graphics and had new game mechanics here and there.. which is why i wanted aoe 4 to be similarly a improvement and different game .. just like previous 3 ..and today here i am complaining about how it is just aoe2 remake with worse water graphics instead of something that apparently took more than a decade to make ..
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"too bad it didn't do a cracking job on anything else. too many missing features like picking a fucking player color or random enemy. optimization is dogshit. i meet the recommended specs by far, and need to have everything on low to get 60 fps. camera movement makes the game a slide show. also i do not like the campaigns. i preferred a story oriented ones from aoe 3. glad i got it for free via game pass."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,game pass it worth it for games like this that you wouldnt want to pay full price for.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,if by modern you mean 2010s rts graphics. age4 is a joke and a cheap money grab by microsoftrelic.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,cant say i have any problems with fps. everything maxed out 1440p and im getting over 200 fps
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,game pass is worth it period . cant even count the amount of money ive saved with game pass and ubisoft
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"the best part is that my old aoe 2 is not working anymore, but my aoe 3 still works  aoe is also not working anymore"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,best game ever.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,"this game is one of my favourites. i was a young man when this came out and i think because of that it will always have a place in my heart, right beside diablo 2 and ultima online."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,wooolooooloooo
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,brooooo yessss. i got my younger brother a laptop for christmas and i created a steam account for him with this game so we can get down.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,"im still mad that they only released the remaster on windows store, nobody i know will but it because if that."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,also r.i.p. to ensemble studios which is the company that not only created this iconic series but also made halo wars. the company got shut down by microsoft after they attempted to make a halo mmo. which also got canceled. the new age of empires 4 is being made by the same company who created company of heroes. so it should have amazing.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,i remember playing this game for the first time when i was around 12 years old and being completely blown away. aoe was like a game from the future.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,"oh the memories, such an amazing game! got a copy of the standard version in a box of nutrigrain cereal and that got more game time than games i pay full price for now haha"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,start the game already
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,i think you spelled age of mythology wrong.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,aoe on zone back in the late 90s was incredible
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,i was a little kid when my dad got it. i got addicted to the game when he let me play it. i still have the gold edition box somewhere. prob in storage.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,i was waiting for someone to do it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,"this game isnt on steam. aoe2hd is on steam, aoe1hd is exclusive to windows store."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,there's actually quite a bit of great classic strategy games on steam. plus it being near christmas means sales. d
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,what? what?! do not leave us hanging here!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,mythology is great but is no where near as iconic as the original age of empires is.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,i came here just to do that and got a little giddy when nobody had
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,oh yeah you right. i got aoe2  all expansions. my b.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,rip my wallet
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-12-20,yeah. while making halo wars they were also planning on making a halo mmo. however microsoft scrapped the idea and had them lay off anybody who wasn't essential to the success of halo wars. before halo wars even came out the company announced it would be closed. afterwards most of the employees of ensemble went and made several independent studios. all of which are pretty unsuccessful except one which really only makes mobile games now.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-22,"good job, ive never played the series but i want to now"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-22,i didn't like that you said it was 16 years since the last game because now i feel old 010 ...on the other hand you gave it a score that i liked 1010
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-22,"thanks a million, you definitely should, they're great fun!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-22,"but on a serious note, you made me interested in the game without making it sound like a sales pitch. the language was fluid and colourful. overall a pleasant experience"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-22,"on your first point i sincerely apologies! seriously though thank you very much for the feedback, and i'm very happy to hear you enjoyed reading it!"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-03,reformed never met my expectations. they were high but damn did they aim low
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-03,"i heard warcraft reforged is bad, people still prefer to play old warcraft which is only accessible by gog launcher."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-03,"ive always been a campaign guy and wc3 reforged is still wc3. i do use the quenching mod to fix a bunch of the shit reforged did and make the graphics better. id say reforged with the quenching mod if youve never played wc3, just do the campaign then age of empires 4 if youre a multiplayer guy"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-03,if reforged is ever an option then you should automatically pick the other option.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,i believe when setting up a skirmish game there is an option to turn off fog of war.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"it seems like its pretty much the only reason he wouldnt want the game, so i want to ask how sure are you? dont want to sound like a dick haha"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2019-02-28,it better be a return to the play style of 2 though...aoe 3 was shit
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2019-02-28,"yes, please!!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2019-02-28,yaaaaaas
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2019-03-01,"i didn't like the character focused story in aoe 3, i hope it goes back into recreations of real battles, and short campaigns about snippets of real wars."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2019-02-28,gamers we want new things! x200b also gamers we hate change!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2019-02-28,"normally, i would agree with everything you just said. the game however, took a very dramatic turn away from it's predecessors in looks, functionality, and play style. it was a completely different game. moral of the story, if it ain't broke don't fix it. they could have literally changed the starting age and ethnic options to select fromlike they did for aoe 2 so in 3 basically less indian tribes than 2 had etc and i'm pretty sure the world would have been fine."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2019-02-28,i completely agree with you. i loved the first two games as well as age of mythology and played them all for many many hours. x200b when aoe3 came out i was initially very excited and i did enjoy the game somewhat. however the game just felt off somehow. to me it almost felt like a cheap imitation of an aoe game instead of the next game in the series.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2019-02-28,"the game's basics were still the same. same resources, same techup, same general approach. the issue stemmed more from the home city dynamic which i frankly thought was brilliant, and helped make the game feel like you were part of an empire, instead of a dinky little town and the fact the game focused more on ranged combat you know, being the age of gunpowder and all. though i'll admit to being biased, as i thought the game was brilliant, and enjoyed it far more than either of the previous games."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2019-02-28,"i also thoroughly enjoyed iii, as 1 and 2 just felt clunky and outdated while iii was modern and had fluid movement"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2019-03-01,"same here, i always thought, if you're expecting the same game as the predecessor, go play that. i liked aoe3 because it felt like an aoe game but different enough from the first few to stand on it's own. i liked the many different things they added and how they streamlined some others. for example the card system was a good new twist to the playstyle of not only each race but diversify how you could approach playing them."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2019-03-01,3 had some good ideas. horrible execution.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2019-03-01,they are just different ages in history. 3 was gunpowder
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-21,was hoping for so long that blizzard will announce warcraft 4 but then wow expansions were coming and coming while no word of w4... now aoe4 is announced at least cause there really aren't much rts games that are played actively outside of sc2 which is basically dead in eu... so there is some hope for rts genre in this sad times for rts fans

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"now that is a great indie bundle. zeno clash, jamestown, and vvvvvv are all really great. first bundle i've felt is a steal at 10. had a ton of fun playing zeno clash. if you like really bizarre, unique games this is an enjoyable 6 hours. people complain about the voice acting but i thought it just made the game even more hilarious. and there is a sequel so you can catch up on the limited story the game provides. i really enjoyed the combat. it is really melee heavy so you spend most of the time kicking bizarre anthropomorphized animals into submission. ragdoll physics make for some hilarious moments with enemies flying around. i thought the art direction was great too. really interesting and varied locations and scenery. enemies are somewhat repetitive but the game is just short enough that it doesn't really drag. for essentially 2 this is awesome. jamestown exceeded my expectations. i generally do not enjoy games like this, but i found jamestown to be a lot of fun considering it's a top down shooter. i never was able to beat it though. at a certain point in the game, the difficulty spikes pretty dramatically and i was never able to progress past the second to last level. the game features coop for up to 4 players and i played a little with my friends. it made the game a little more fun, but the single player experience is just as entertaining. music and interface are all great. game looks good and plays quite well. vvvvvv is awesome as well. game is really tough at points but there is a good checkpoint system. definitely worth a play if you like tough platformers ala smb. the gravity jump mechanic makes it unique and a little different to play as far as platformers go."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,1st!!!!!!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i've hit the 10000 character limit, so i'll just speak briefly about the other two games i wanted to talk about i loved the first fear gamehttpstore.steampowered.comapp21100, but my understanding is that the games have been getting steadily worse since then. with the wealth of great fps titles available today, f3ar is probably skippable. the crysis franchisehttpstore.steampowered.comsub15609 is probably the game to get today, if you're looking for a single player fps experience. i unfortunately haven't had a chance to play these yet, but they come highly recommended from reddit in past sales. if you want a new fps, these will probably serve you well. those are all the games i've played  have comments on for today. unfortunately, i am likely unable to post tomorrow, aside from possibly the indie game write ups i can do ahead of time."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i want to defend civ v. it wasn't released in the most polished state though, incidentally, neither was civ iv. however, various patches and expansions have turned it into one of the strongest 4x games out there today. they made a conscious effort with civ v to iron out some of the flaws that have always plagued the civilization series. all victory conditions domination, cultural, diplomatic, etc. are now viable, so you don't have to just default to a science victory once you've crushed most of your enemies. naval combat is finally amazing. combat between empires is no longer decided by throwing one large stack of units at another large stack of units and seeing which stack comes out on top. due to global happiness and social policies, small empires can now effectively compete with large empires. the gods  kings expansion has added a lot to the game, and as a longtime civ fan i would strongly recommend v over iv. it won't just consume you for a couple of games  i've spent well over 150 hours on the game, and i still keep coming back for more. check out the other reviews on rciv if you want additional feedback."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,jamestown is so fucking cool. the music is incredible.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i've played through and 100percented vvvvvv multiple times. it's a game that i play now to relax myself, though it can initially be really challenging to wrap your mind around. the graphics are charming, the music is amazing, the story is simple but effective, and there's just a lot of content packed in there. if you're up for a platforming challenge, vvvvvv is one of the best you can find. for 2.49, it's an instant buy."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,what is the best metroidvaniacontra game out there? i'm kind of new to steam but that's my favorite kind of game
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i would extremely recommend revenge of the titans and vvvvvv and jamestown. then again out of this pack those are the only ones i own. revenge of the titans gets extremely hard and i love it. it is one of my favorite games in my steam library and there is so much i love about it. like blindsight said, you must use your towers to defend each other and your base. the difference between this tower defense game and others is that the bad guys come from every direction, and not a singular path. the game is difficult enough that you will lose levels until you learn what works against most enemies. vvvvvv is a puzzle platformer game. i guess i would compare it to a mario game that can change gravity and most of the floors can kill you. the whole game is based around solving these puzzles by switching gravity. it is a wonderful game with excellent 8 bit graphics and one i would recommend."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i used to play dungeon defenders but like you said, it gets really repetitive and boring after a while. what really got me to quit was when the developers started adding new equipment only to nerf them the day after... that and the hackers  good game nevertheless. edit if you have friends to play with you i'm sure it'll be a lot of fun. the 4pack deal is pretty good. edit 2 i should also add that i got hooked onto this game for 157.6 hrs on record  without dlcs. now that i have the dlcs, i think i'll continue playing to get 100 achievements currently on 70."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"if you're interested in dungeon defenders, i'd definitely recommend trying to get some friends into it, too. makes the experience a whole lot smoother instead of having to deal with randoms which isn't always a bad experience, but bad communication can ruin your games."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"concerning magicka this game was developed by a small company and is not as well optimized for performance as bigname games are. don't be fooled by the gameplay footage looking like it won't stress your graphics. if you have a laptop with integrated graphics, it's gonna be choppy. game's a lot of fun if you can run it, though."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,might want to add to dungeon defenders is that there is an absurd amount of dlc that a majority of it is required to have the full experience

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"exactly my thoughts. never owned any one of them, but each time i had the chance to play one, i was amazed by how much fun i had."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,i need lego star wars!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"its been constantly patched since release, so most of the bugs are squashed also, a recent patch added more game modes arcade, realistic and a new map thirdly, several mods are in the works, one centered around 'nam and one around the pacific war. i'm on my phone right now so i cat give many details, but i'm sure a google search will provide info if you want, i can update this post in 3 hrs with my thoughts on the player base, maps, mechanics, and gun handling."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"it's a very hardcore game. movement is slower and takes planning. you aren't a bullet sponge. aiming can be quite difficult if you're new though the game does allow you to brace any weapon against walls and windows. it offers a cover system but keeps you in firstperson. overall it is a very immersive game that, if you gain some familiarity, is quite rewarding. until you reach that level, or if you're not into super hardcore think arma mechanics, the game can be very frustrating. for that price, however, it's worth a shot."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"red orchestra is a great game. sure it had a bumpy start, but so do all of tripwire games. kf was a mess when it launched. ro1 wasn't that is because it was a mod for years beforehand. if you enjoy multiplayer fps games then yes buy it! it has a bunch of modes so if you enjoy hardcore gameplay you can play realismclassic mode and if you want more of a cod style game they have firefightaction which have no class limits, quicker movement, less realism. so yeah if you enjoyed the first one don't think twice just buy it. if you didn't enjoy it or have no experience with ro then you will probably find something you like in this game with the new game modes. it is not a perfect game...yet. the tanks are questionable still, and it has some silly bugs that haven't gone away yet, but it's only a matter of time. twi has a long history of support for their games. for example killing floor just received another content update for the summer sale even though it came out in 2009. the game will only get better. the playerbase is medium sized. you will not have an issue finding a game at any given time of the day. it will get bigger as the game ages, and mods more content is added. the custom maps are starting to flow. i think five or six have already been released, and the dev's are hosting a mapping contest which will bring out some good maps. the mods are progressing as well. the pacific mod appears to be in closed beta. i saw a test server in the browser the other day. made me giddy to see it. they haven't exactly said what the plans are for ro but they have mentioned adding new tanks, half tracks, weapons, and co op in the future. the game runs on ue3 and has been optimized a lot since released. tldr get this game!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"it is amazing! the game is absolutely tense, i had a saving private ryan moment. remember when near the end two soldiers faced each other out of the blue and they both shot their rifles and missed then struggled to pull out their sidearms and eventually throwing their helmets and each other. similar, i faced a german soldier and shot first, i missed and thought that i was dead for sure 1 shot kills most of the time in this game. he shot and to my surprise missed also. there was that surprise while my guy loaded the next bullet into the chamber, i took an extra split second to make sure i would hit him, pulled the trigger. and just collapsed back into my chair with the relief and satisfaction that i am still alive."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"ro2 has an incredibly authentic feel to it and has quite a bit of realism to it, but is not near the complexity of war simulators such as arma or naval sims. you hop in a server, pick your class, and fight over an objective or simply tdm if that's your style. the audio is very well done, weapons are authentic and have great feel to them, tanks are modeled farily realistic, the game is very gritty and bloody but in a realistic way it doesn't try and glorify it imo. coming from the original, which started as a mod for ut2k4 before they released it as a retail product, tripwire interactive is a proud supporter of mods and custom maps. they are currently doing map creation competitions and before the game even released they awarded certain teams very early access to the dev kit of the game to make, hopefully, some of the best fps mods to date. they also developed killing floor which is an absolutely fantastic multiplayer horror shooter, which too gets frequent updates and patches. the singleplayer isn't really worth your time besides familiarizing yourself with the controls, don't get this unless you enjoy playing online. the controls can feel a bit different compared to other shooters, but it is much better than the fairly clunky controls the first ro had. that said, you will probably get your ass handed to you when you first play as ro1 developed a pretty big hardcore community which followed into heroes of stalingrad. they recently added different modes, one of which makes the game more paced like call of duty arcade mode, another more like the original ro called classic mode, and of course the standard mode that ro2 released on allowing you to pick one you feel like playing."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,a friend of mine speaks highly of it. i'm considering picking it up myself.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,intrigued also.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,i played in the beta and at launch. at the time it was pretty buggy but i recently reinstalled it and am having a blast. not really noticing any of the bugs that originally irked me. the online community appears to be rather small but definitely there.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"the devs have patched almost all of the bugs out, and they also listen to their community feedback and all dlc or future content  maps are free. tripwire be da shit, give them money. also the online community isnt huge but i've never had trouble finding a good server."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"tripwire recently released a huge patch that overhauled the entire base game. there's a new game mode called classic mode which slowed down the pace of the combat, has more restricted loadouts, and you can't 'zoom in' on bolt action rifles, making the game funner and closer to ro1 gameplay wise. all the bugs are gone and it's much more optimized than before."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,red orchestra 2 is fantastic. best fps of last year in my opinion.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,upvoted for identical interest
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,if you're tired of the codbf3halo scene and would like something slightly more realistic unforgiving then you won't find anything better. the realistic movement and gettingkilledinonehit thing takes some getting used to though  this combined with the excellent atmosphere and music actually makes the game a bit unnerving i can't play more than a few rounds without feeling like i'm developing ptsd.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"one if great, but you want to have some full servers out there. the combat is great and feels real. but it can also be slow and unforgiving. you are either camping a lot or running and dying a lot, but i loved doing both in this game. avoid 2 like the plague."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,i can't find the goty edition on steam!!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i'll add my opinion far cry 2 isn't a great game. its open world, although very beautiful, feels very empty as there isn't much to do. you'll spend most of your time travelling from point a to point b. be prepared to do a lot of travelling! the ai isn't as good as the developers promised before releasing the game. however, it's still a nice game that tries to be more realistic than the average shooter, while encouraging you to get creative on how to approach your enemies. for the price, i'd say grab it if you like the setting and open world fpses. i personally played it for about 8 hours before getting bored, but i really did enjoy these 8 hours."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"for 2.50... get it, you can get at least a few hours of enjoyment out of it. but don't get your hopes up just because you enjoyed far cry 1. this game had amazing potential but comes up very very short. here's some bad points about the game  the story does not matter. you won't play this game for the story. without spoiling anything for you fuck i don't even remember enough of the spoil anyway, you won't care about the story by the end. it's more of an inthemoment type of game.  getting malaria medicine becomes a total chore. the game constant forces you to drop what you are doing to get malaria medication. and it's always the same old thing when you get the medication. you drive for five minutes, kill a few guys, and get the medicine, then drive five minutes back to where you were. by the time you get back, you're half way through your medication supply and the cycle just continues.  as has been mentioned, there is a lot of traveling in this game. there's also check points everywhere. the checkpoint battles are all the same, and it becomes another chore you have to do. imagine playing gta4, and having police checkpoints every other block. you can't just drive past because you'll get shot to death on hard difficulty, so you have to stop, get out, and kill them one by one. it's fun the first 3 times and with different weapons, but every battle is always the same and it just becomes a total pain the ass. they also respawn super fast so as soon as you drive past their corpses, they've probably respawned already."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,do you think the first one is worth it? it's half the price of the second.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i was debating on whether to get this, but after reading your comments i think i will thanks."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i second everything this guy says but will add that it is too long and too repetitive. for 2.50, that shouldn't really matter though becuase if you're a shooter fan you will get at least 510 hours of fun out of it before it gets repetitive and you feel like moving on."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i saw it for 2.50, and thought it was a good deal considering i remember enjoying the first one. turns out i already have it. that's what these sales do to you!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"you're safe enough sticking with the base game. the franchise pack includes the first game as well, which is quite good, but the gameplay is similar. the only benefit to owning ostfront original that i can see is the existing mods. you can save yourself a bit of cash by getting the original instead of hos if you're not sure you'll like it, but the price difference is almost nothing. the digital deluxe includes vanity items for other games, so decide for yourself if a couple of hats are worth it. part of the dd pack's appeal was the early access beta, but that's over. as for the weapons, those are just dayone unlocks, which you'll unlock eventually over time anyway. buy hos, play it for a bit, if you really enjoy it then you can grab the dd upgrade for the weapon unlocks or see for yourself if you find them necessary. bear in mind, automatic weapons are harder to use and some servers most i think restrict sniper weapons."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,my wife has been addicted to crusader kings ii since it was first on sale. picking it up now to join in on multiplayer. very cool unique game.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-21,"crusader kings 2 is great. if you're into game of thrones you will really like it even without the mod. it is all about maintaining a family dynasty over a period of about 300 years. you have to keep your vassals pleased with you or risk them conspiring against you, you have to marry your children very carefully, and you have to keep careful tabs on all claimants to the throne. i'm still playing the first game i started 57 hours in so far, and have so far united ireland through war, subterfuge, and marriage. i even managed to inherit the throne of norway and sweden by assassinating my grandson and his entire family. which it turns out wasn't the best idea..."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"post shamelessly stolen from theirfourhttpwww.reddit.comrgamescommentswvq7csteamsummersaleday0920120720c5gv7vc from the rgames thread shout out to driver san francisco.  here's what you need to know it's an openworld drivingracing game set in simplified san francisco. it also has the most ridiculous and strangely compelling story i've ever encountered in a game. not just in a racing game, but in all the games i've played.  it's great in a very pseudoserious scifi special kind of way. the main plot revolves around your character being injured and discovering that he can shift to other drivers in other cars and control them. this means that, for most of the game, you can press a button and the game will go into a bird'seye view where you can float around and pick another car to begin driving. you can use it to get around, but the game will also have you doing missions where the mechanic is used in more novel ways taking down a car by shifting into traffic on the other side of the street and forcing a headon collision, for example.  what i really appreciated about the game was how the developers stuck to their guns. the plot isn't secondary as it is in most racing games, and it entirely revolves around and utilizes the shift mechanic that they developed. i plowed through the campaign, eager to see what other tricks the developers had up their sleeves and how the hokey, overblown storyline would end up resolving itself which it does decently well.  anyway, the long and short of it is that it's well worth 7.50. you can find games with better pure racing experiences e.g. burnout paradise, but you won't find another narrativedriven magical realism driving experience outside of this game. i'll add that it has some great incidental dialogue from the passengers you'll sometimes find sitting beside you. some examples of the characters you'll meet are facebook girl being driven around by one of her gurlfrienz like, ohemgee, a woman with her senile mother, a guy driving around with his divorce lawyer crash eh, the car's going to your wife anyway, two brothers from india looking for some excitement, and my favourite so far, a grandfather that let his little granddaughter drive his towtruck on bring your granddaughter to work day, with dialogue like this upon drifting around a corner have you been practicing, buttercup? while being chased by the police poppop didn't bring any doughnuts to use as a bribe, do you have any candy, sweetheart? and this is how my day usually ends. if you can evade the police, poppop will buy you an icecream! drifting again it's like watching your babysteps all over again bumping into someone oh, i do it all the time if i don't feel like braking full on crash now see, this is why you want a company car. more drifting you always were my favourite grandchild. just don't tell your cousins. and a good quote from tanner player character i'm trying to lose the cops here, so you think you could stop pinching my cheeks!? oh, and it has a delorean. with related easter egg."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"driver is a fantastic game, really reminds me of the original plus if you like realistic games, it's a copy of san francisco and you get real cars..really nice. also to add the multiplayer is bloody awesome."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"people have diametrically opposed opinions on far cry 2. at first, i hated the game for the same reasons as everybody usually does and i found it frustrating as hell. a year or so later, i read this article how to have fun playing far cry 2httpmajorslack.comgamestipstrickshavingfunplayingfarcry2. it was a revelation, i restarted the game from the beginning. in my opinion far cry 2 is outright one the very best game ever made, possibly the best in the genre. it is not about the story or the gameplay, it is about how the game make you feel playing it. far cry 2 is not a shooter in the classic sense, it is an experience in desperation, futility and death. i highly recommend it, but read that article first."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"far cry 2 and just cause 2 aren't very similar games at all. i haven't played jc2 extensively, but i can say that far cry 2 is a wonderful game and completely worth 2.50. the actual gameplay, which is the shooting and driving, is pretty average, but fc2 is one of the most atmospheric and immersive games i've ever played. even though there's not a whole lot to do in it, fc2 has a great open world. it really is more than the sum of its parts."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,i'd say they're only similar in that they're open world. far cry 2 isn't nearly as ridiculous as just cause 2  there is 100 less grappling hook shenanigans.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"they're not similar at all, the only common thing they have is they're both open world games and involve guns. i'd say far cry 2 is kinda similar to s.t.a.l.k.e.r. far cry 2 is an openworld fps that tries to be relatively realistic and hard it isn't really. there are no fighter jets, helicopters, fast cars or great guns. this isn't gta or just cause, here you have to plan your attacks carefully. also, you'll spend most of your time travelling around the map instead of blowing stuff up. personally, i enjoyed far cry 2 and played it for like 8 hours before getting bored. for this price, i'd say grab it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"it's 2.50. at that price, it's worth it just to check it out. i personally think it's great, but can understand why others don't like it. i enjoy the huge, open world, the variety of weapons, the excellent graphics, the upgrade system, the stealth system, and especially the healing systemhttpwww.youtube.comwatch?venswns3qfg. of course, it has it's downsides too. it's extremely repetitive although for only 2.50 at least you didn't waste full price, the buddy system had potential but is extremely shallow, the story makes no sense, enemies respawn at guard posts every single time, among other things."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"better yet, the pack is only 14.99, which includes both the dlc packs and the originals."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"this is the main argument about either game civ iv some say that it has more depth, as it has had espionage and religion well before v did, but it also contains slightly more nuanced things to micromanage such as the health of your cities and creating corporations. diplomacy also makes slightly more sense. civ v it's prettier and easier to understand. it uses hexes instead of squares, which is a huge improvement in my opinion, plus you cannot stack 50 units onto one tile like in iv, lovingly called the stack of doom. v features more strategy when it comes to military conflict as a result. it just works better, makes more sense, and you don't have a huge stack of doom assaulting your cities. health and corporations are absent from the game however, so there is slightly less depth. not enough to hurt it in my opinion. if you're a real nut about these kinds of games, i would tell you to get both. if you're not, or are just interested and want to try the civ experience, get v. as far as expansions go, you really need to have them all for iv. for v, gods and kings is also really needed as it adds a lot to the game that was previously missing. the extra civilization dlcs are also nice, and the wonders one as well, but i would recommend getting them while they're cheap. i hope it helps!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,get civ v. here are a few differences i remember  tiles are now hexagons instead of squares.  new 3d engine.  the combat system has changed a lot.  no espionage or religion.  city states introduced.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"civ v. i've played civ iii, iv and v with all expansions and if you have not played any of these i would recommend civ v. many in rciv seem to have a similar opinion."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"it depends on what level of depth you want to play. civ 5's is very flawed and shortsighted if you go deep enough, but straightforward and novel otherwise. civ 4 sometimes is very obtuse and not exactly intuitive, but is much more balanced and has core mechanics that work much better in the end. basically, get civ 5 if you just want a casual but still strategical empirebuilding experience, and civ 4 if you want a serious and deep competitive strategy game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"it's a good game. worth that price. basically you fly around in a spaceship picking up weapon upgrades to advance through a huge maze. you have enemies, bosses, little puzzles. fun."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,its a really fun game. about 56 hours long. its like a metroidvania type of game but in a twin stick shooter way. definitely worth it for the price.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"to anyone wondering this game is fun, and worth the 1.49 in my opinion just make sure you know going in that it's a very short game. as a speed runner of a different game, i'm probably more skilled than the average gamer, so it may take you longer than it took me. i finished it in just under an hour, so it may take some people up to two hours, but i can't see it lasting much longer than that. after you beat the game, you have the option of playing again in a harder mode, but if you're like me, you probably won't be interested in doing so. again, it's a fun little game for 1.49, but just don't expect to get much time out of it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,bought it the other day when it was on sale. i would have been happy to pay full price for it. keep up the good work.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"crysis has an amazing first 34 hrs, a frustrating but beautiful anti gravity sequence, and a repetitive final few hours. its easily worth it for the graphics and the fun game play until the aliens come into play. warhead crams the same idea minus the anti grav into about 45 hrs total play time."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i've played both of those and i'd say they're both at least moderately entertaining. the prices those two are at are definitely fair imo for the few hours or so you get out of the story mode. i played the crysis 2 multiplayer demo when it came out and it seemed kind of like a ripoff from cod what fps multiplayer isn't now a days?, but it still was pretty fun. i really want to get crysis 2 actually, but i'm pretty worried that no one plays online anymore. edit also bear in mind that a pretty huge aspect of these games is the graphic detail and physics"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"honestly, crysis 1 and warhead are both fantastic, but so is human revolution. they're all in my absolute favorites category, so if you can squeeze in getting them all i'd recommend it. crysis games are a bit more taxing on your graphics card iirc though so keep that in mind. they're all good for variety on multiple playthroughs, but i think crysis would have more variety in terms of the stuff you can do between playthroughs because it's very sandboxy. dxhr has a longer campaign though. it's a really rough choice. dxhr has a lot more resource management, crysis is more about having all your awesome abilities accessible at any given time that is, your suit battery recharges rather than getting stuck at a percentage of its possible ability like in dxhr. both have health regeneration to counteract the fact that if you are seen and shot you will die really fast. i should note that crysis is much more fun on a harder difficulty so you're forced to be properly stealthy. dxhr has the better story and the whole branched decision element, crysis is the sandbox style of branched explosion styles for how you choose to complete objectives. goddammit just get both. crysis 2 is skippable for now if you're on a tight budget, regarded as too linear compared to the first games."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,i actually enjoyed f3ar but i must strongly recommend playing the campaign coop with a friend. playing as fettel is extremely fun and makes up for the cut corners and horribly reused art assets that ruin most of the game. i thought the campaign story was decent enough. haven't tried multiplayer. there's a lot to complain about but 5 is worth it for the fettel bodyswapping combat.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"civ 5 got rid of backstabbing ais with their oh, i've been your friend for millenia, but here's an outoftheblue declaration of war and an unbeatable stack of 40 military units at your doorstep wars are more fun, the tiresome rushing for being the founder of as many religions as possible is gone, and as daravon said, it's valid to have an empire with smaller but more developed cities that's pretty much what ghandi's racial dictates also, cities now have their very own health bar and ranged attack, so you'll no longer have to garrison one silly warrior in each city just so it won't be captured by some random roaming barbarian."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i love me some civ v, and i've played the civ series since it started. i always hated stacks of doom and the oneunitpertile rule makes war actually fun for me since it's not just using brute force. gk really fleshes it out and adds enough complexity that i can safely say it's as good as iv, just a bit different. i'm about 210 hours into it, and 300 into iv, and while they are both great games i find myself playing v all the time now."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"question for you i haven't played any civ game since civ 2. is it better playing civ 5 for the first time with all of the expansions, or should i just try the base game first?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i agree, civ v has a bad reputation, but it is a solid game at this point. yes, it had problems when it came out, and it still has some problems, but overall it's a pretty damn good game. for people who haven't played either game, then here is a quick comparison of the strongest points on each one ways civ iv is better than v the ai is more competent, both diplomatically and in terms of military. there are lots of little buttons and levers to press and pull, it's a micromanager's dream. amazing modding community, including several total conversion mods which are just great. better optimization, less lag.  ways civ v is in my opinion better than iv one unit per tile. the game is much more rich tactically. civ iv wars are basically i have 70 units in a stack and you have 50 units in a stack, i win! while war in v actually has unit placement, defending ranged units, etc as main concerns. note this is why the ai in iv is better at the military game. the ai was great at understanding i need to stick 50 units in a tile, it is lessthangreat at actual tactics. cities now defend themselves, in a manner far more realistic and rewarding. in civ iv, a city defended almost exactly as well as the units stationed inside of it. did you forget to put a warrior in your capital? oops, a single scout just conquered your civilization! each individual civilization has strong racial benefits. civ iv had this to an extent, but it's much deeper and more pronounced in v. while civ iv had many civilizations and a few bonuses spread between them, each civ in v has a strong set of unique benefits that cannot otherwise be replicated. better graphics. a better religion system. in civ iv religion was basically just a reason for the ai to hate you i follow x, you follow y, prepare to die now, religion in civ v gk is a really neat system where you build and customize a religion around a set of bonuses that you select. better domination win mechanics. to win a military victory in v, all you need to do is take out the capital of every other civ. this is much less tedioustime consuming than the win condition in iv, which was to wipe out every city from every civ. anyway, i could go on about the virtues of each game for a while, but tldr i agree, civ v is worth more credit than it currently gets. a lot more. now, i'm not saying it's clearly bettereach of those reasons i listed where iv is better is a really big deal. still, it's not fair to say iv is clearly better than v. ps, for those planning to buy civ vall dlc, but not the megabundle, be sure to pick up this dlchttpstore.steampowered.comsub11092?snr159403 which is not included in goty."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i started playing civ with civlization 3, which is one of my all time favorite games. going straight from 3 to 5, 5 is amazing. the new warfare is amazing, cultural victories are viable, gods and kings adds religion and espionage, marathon mode is the perfect length. everything about 5, i love."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,i've been wanting to pick up civ v. i've never played a civ game. but i'll admit it seems very boring in videos. the concept sounds great. but i'd feel it was more fun if it were multiplayer. edit broke down and bought the goty. we'll see how it goes. possibly a year from now.  still haven't given human revolution a whirl yet and i bought it last summer sale. oo
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-21,"yes, but moving the units in civ v is a pain in the ass. the chess mechanics are nice, but i would like formations so i can mass move units. besides, stacks of doom are satisfying. and you can't exactly stack of doom in extended sieges of a city  you have to spread the army out around the city to deprave it of resources. still, good points."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,these are absolutely problems with the game and i agree with you on all of them. mostly what i like about the game is that it looked at a number of shooter conventions and tried to do something different and to me that is what makes it great.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,i can't think about civ 5 without adding in gods and kings features. i highly recommend it.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"get it. it adds religion and espionage, and changes quite a few features from the base game. religion is different to how it's been done before. you gather faith, and once you have a certain amount you found a pantheon, and then later on you get a great prophet, who allows you to found a religion. this is when it gets interesting. you choose a symbol from 10 realworld religions, and can name the religion anything you want. you then choose 3 beliefs, and can add 2 more later. there are a lot to choose from. espionage is again very different. from the renaissance era onwards, you gain a spy per tech era. these spies can be sent to other civs cities to steal tech, or sent to citystates to rig elections to gain you favour, or placed within your own cities to attempt to stop other civs spies stealing your techs. other changes include adding in a few units, great war infantryairplanebomber and gatlingmachine gun come to mind first splitting naval combat into ranged and melee, and adding another bucketload of civs to play as."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,most the dlc is just additional civilizations to play... but the newest expansion gods  kings adds quite a bit of new features. i'd say load of any dlc and play that way if you got them.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i've just started playing civ and with 5 a lot of people recommend get the expansion so you don't have to learn to replay the game later with the changes. others recommend getting it when it's cheaper and then appreciating the changes. i'm doing the last, the choice is up to you."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,i'd second the other comments and say that the gods and kings expansion really adds a lot to the game  i'd strongly recommend it. you can live without the dlc.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"i'd get goty. you can turn the dlc off if you want to experience the base game first, whereas if you wait to buy it then you won't be able to pick it all up at 75 off. honestly, none of the individual dlc adds very much to the game, but at their current price point they are very much worth buying. it's kind of like extra toppings on a pizza a single extra topping isn't going to make or break a pizza, but if you're going to eat the same magic pizza for 200 hours then you probably want to pay an extra couple bucks for extra toppings. having said that, the expansion gods  kings is not 75 off, but it is absolutely worth buying. not only does it add 9 new civs more than all the dlc put together but it is just an excellent expansion in general. note that goty edition is missing this particular dlc packhttpstore.steampowered.comsub11092?snr159403."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"there is only one expansion, there is a lot of additional dlc. you can live without dlc. however, not only does gods  kings provide 9 new civs, it introduces an extra mechanic religion, and does a little bug fixing notably that ai turns take too long in late game before expansion. you will want gods  kings if you buy civ 5. it is only 25 off now, though, so maybe wait on the expansion purchase."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"to be honest with you, i did not buy any of the dlcs until today because it was so expensive before especially for an indie game. i got the dungeon defenders lost eternia shards complete dlc today since it is only 3.24  totally worth it. there are some other dlcs for costumes and heroes too. i can tell you now that you can still unlock some of the costumes even without the dlcs e.g. halloween costumes by joining a lobby that is playing the dlc's map. i'm not sure if it is still the case now but it was when i was playing. if you are referring to the dungeon defenders collection, then yes. i recommend you get that. for 12.49 it is a pretty good deal."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"yes, you can drop out, and it passes to the next player, and an ai takes over for you. the important difference is everything is done in real time, which kind of breaks multiplayer vs, as whoever has the fastest connection time can kill your entire army before you can click. however, when you have ais added, they go after you, so that is turned based still. i've found multiplayer co op to be fun and works rather well. you and your friends go all at once, then all the ai. we have come up with a way to get around the broken battle in multiplayer vs. go as usual most of the time, but then then if someone wants to attack, they get one surprise round, where they can attack whenever they want. then after that, everyone currently at war enters a voluntary turned based order that was decided before the game started. anyone not in war can still go whenever they want. we haven't tried it yet, but we think this will fix the current multiplayer problems."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,i've been playing nonlethal and it definitely adds an exciting urgency to the game that's funny because i found just the opposite. meticulously sneaking around and doing everything nonleathally makes the game super easy and repetitive. the game becomes much more challenging if you go in with guns blazing in lieu of stealth.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-21,"nfshp so far is more satisfying as a game. it comes with everything you'd expect from the nfs pedigree great simulation, licensed cars from a mazda rx8 to a lambo reventon also bugatti, anyone?, challenging races and modes. also since ea bought criterion, they put nfs on their plate. with criterion's background burnout and the renderware engine, obviously and collaboration with dice to create the maps, nfshp is definitely a buy. the chameleon engine that's in this game makes for some sexy sexy graphics. bp is also by criterion, of course. but the vision for bp was taking the previous titles' game modes minus crash mode and making them events in a gta freeroam world. there's an included dlc that adds motorcycles, which are a blast to run around on. apart from the events, each road in the game has a high score and it shows on your hud who the fastest racer is on the road timewise. this is a pretty fun game mechanic in itself, as i've spent a good amount of time defending my high scores. there are lots of objectives to do crash through billboards, crash through gates, etc and there's more events as you move up in levels. in terms of challenge, nfs is definitely it. the races i've done in bp i've won by 1020 seconds on the first try. in nfs, you can pass events by meeting the minimum requirements bronze, but getting gold in the events can be super hard especially the ones where you have to respond to a call in a given time and you're punished for damaging your car. if you want to jump in a car or motorcycle and have fun just screwing around, go for bp. if you want challenging races with beautiful graphics and cars you only see on top gear, nfs is the way to go. and for the record, i use a logitech f310 gamepad and it's spectacular for either game"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-21,"nfs is more traditional, point a point b on a set track, no straying from it but it does have free mode. burnout paradise, it's free mode, you roll up to a stop light, start a race, can take any road to get to the end. that's the main difference. of course, nfs has the cop angle, and burnout has the takedown while racing. burnout also took out that mode where you crash to see how much damage you can cause. i prefer old school racing, so it would be nfs for me, even though i have both."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-21,"because the prices are set by the publishers not steamvalve, i doubt pricing decisions are made on the fly during the sale except perhaps for valve's own games or maybe indie games where valve probably has more latitude. valve has claimedhttpwww.escapistmagazine.comnewsview118547valveifsteamsalesdidntworkwewouldntrunthem?utmsourcerssutmmediumrssutmcampaignnews that dropping the price increases sales during and also after the sale, so even if a game is selling well at a given price, they might still be motivated to reduce it temporarily."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,can you play through 12 without feeling incomplete about not playing 3?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-21,"the expansion really is more than the sum of its parts, it reworks much of the game almost entirely for the better. the biggest unsung change is the revamped combat system, units are harder to kill so there's less randomness in battles, making things more tactical. naval combat is the best it has ever been in a civ game, neglecting your navy is now a dangerous proposition. the ai is also much improved, though still not great."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"thank you so much, this worked great for me. received the cd key within 5 minutes. 10.99, which is 57 off."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,that fix has apparently been integrated into the main game now.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"nope! i actually just went back and checked because it's been a while for me too, but you can go to the pause menu and do a quicksave at any time. the game saves itself whenever you're on a screen with a teleporter, but if you quicksave you can quit and you'll just start right back at your latest checkpoint, which are all over the place. in fact, there's a particularly interesting platforming puzzle later on in the game that plays directly off of the huge number of checkpoints all over the world, but i digress. jump back in, man, it's great, and its challenge is diametrically opposed to the it's hard because save points are scarce type of hard. it's more like super meat boy had a baby with super metroid."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"the steam version works as it's had the drm removed. or at least, i assume so, since it runs fine on my pc."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"short answer yes. me2's ending is very satisfying. a lot of people say me3 was a great game up until the end but i don't fully agree. it was a great game only because the mass effect universe is great, but i feel like the game itself was a bit halfassed overall. so my point is the only reason to play 3 is to finish out the story. me1 and 2 should give you a sufficient dosage of rpg greatness, and leave you feeling satisfied."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-21,haha ok fine but seriously you'll be fine
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,which doesn't make any sense. preorder torchlight 2 and get your free copy of torchlight 1. and because of that deal i'm betting many of you have friends with an extra torchlight copy just lying around.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-21,"no problem. i'm pretty passionate about these two racing franchises in particular. i own all the burnout games and have played nfs since the original, which i can't say about any other game franchise. also, while you're downloading 8gb of files, go herehttpwww.nfscars.netfileviewhotpursuit201014726.aspx and download the file on the page and follow the instructions. it will add the preorder dlc cars and other cars to your garage. it's not a hack or anything that will fuck up your game."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"the chances of arma going up for sale are very good, kotor as an example sold well as a flash deal and then went up as a daily deal the next day. i'm assuming that valve is planning on putting up the larger demanded titles on the last day of the sale just to get some extra funds out to those developers however this very well could not happen."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"having played all 3, i would recommend v"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"honestly, civ 5 is much more forgiving than civ 4 when it comes to tech rushes, etc. so i'd suggest go with 5. however if you like 5 but want even more customization and depth in exchange for less refined military playfor example a big stack of warriors beating a tank."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,i wish there was a 'hide units option' so only the little icons show up.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"ah, didn't realize this. i very much agree that it was a great game, i got through most of it. i didn't mean to say that i didn't like it because of the save system, just that i quit because i lost a massive amount of progress because i didn't save"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-20,"oh ok, phew, thanks for clearing that up."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2012-07-21,probably just updated. ubisoft loves their drm. yet they refuse to patch the original game from the disc. probably figure it's another sale if the guy ever wants to play it again.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,i'd recommend l4d2 but i'm sure pretty much everyone has it already.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"here's commentary for day 11, as usual, feel free to leave comments on any of my commentary or any of the mentioned games. the binding of isaachttpstore.steampowered.comapp113200 is a very weird game. to put it not so simply it's a roguelike rpg shooter where you play as isaac, whose mom has been told by god to slaughter thee. this is a truly bizarre game, i'm not going to lie about that. but, the core gameplay is very enjoyable although challenging, and the artistic direction is so grotesque that i'd like to know what they were smoking when they made this game. the big question, is it worth 1.25? yes, yes, a thousand times yes. it's an excellent game, and it'll last you a while. i do have 2 major complaints. first of all, there is no native gamepad support, you'll have to use a program like xpadder to use one. secondly, it doesn't give you item descriptions, so you'll have to look on the wiki page. swords of the stars ii lords of winterhttpstore.steampowered.comapp42990. in short, no. in long, nooooooooooooooooo. i'm surprised that kerberos released a 4x game in this poor of shape. it's buggy to the point of unplayability, and despite numerous patches, it's still a bug ridden mess although it's much better than at launch by a significant factor. what is a 4x game? a 4x game is short for explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate, as you increase your empire, conquer foes, and travel beyond the stars. however, due to the insane amount of bugs, i still wouldn't pick it up. if you want a good large spacethemed 4x game, check out sins of a solar empire or the original sword of the stars. as of now, stay away from this mess. amissingglasseye said speaking as a big fan of the first one, this game is unfinished. i perordered it and have been watching its progress and while kerberos' work has been admirable, it's still not complete. that said, don't write it off entirely. it may take another six months, but odds are a very good 4x game is going to come out of it. the potential is all there and is 90 complete, it's just the last 10 is simply not done. the men of war serieshttpstore.steampowered.comsalemenofwar is not for the light hearted. they are a set of brutal real time tactics games that will test any commander's chops. they are very historically accurate, and the direct control mode offers a new spin on rts tactics. however, the learning curve is very deep, battles are very challenging, and the game can look somewhat outdated. for single player, pick up the original game and red tide. for an excellent multiplayer game, pick up assault squad. however, vietnam was not a very good game, to say the least, so stay away from that. again, they're very brutal, so be sure to check out the demos, as these games aren't for everyone. moving on, we have the mafia serieshttpstore.steampowered.comsalemafia. they tell the chilling tales of mafioso and their struggles and personal tales. the first mafia was an excellent game, with incredible action sequences and a masterful tale. mafia ii wasn't quite so good, and it has some sort of driving fetish, because you need to drive to all of your missions, repeatedly. a disclaimer, while technically being an open world game, the mafia series uses that city to tell a linear tale, rather than let you go wild like in saints row. if you've been looking for a great blockbuster experience or a great tale, check out the first mafia. while not being quite as good, mafia ii was still enjoyable. there is a demo for mafia ii, so try it out before you pass judgment. next on our safari we have dungeon siege 3httpstore.steampowered.comsaledungeonsiegeiii. eh. it wasn't a bad game, but it wasn't that great. it felt like a stale version of the original baldur's gate dark alliance games. the core combat is pretty mindless, and the story and characterization isn't that great. so if you're looking for single player, this isn't a very good choice. coop is a little bit better, but it has some ridiculous restrictions placed upon it that make it difficult to enjoy why does everyone have to share the same camera? it does have 2 player local coop, which is the best way to play it, as the restrictions aren't nearly as bad when you're playing with a friend. overall, i'd pass this game up, it's still too expensive, and i've seen it for 5 dollars on amazon. you could do a lot worse, but you could do better as well. our next stop is at the classic quake serieshttpstore.steampowered.comsaleholidaysale2011quake by legendary fps developers id software. at their core, these games are very excellent fast paced multiplayer fps deathmatches, with quake iii arena being the pinnacle of the deathmatch fps in the series. to some, these games might be outdated, to others, they provide a deathmatch experience unlike any other on the market. there are demos, so check them out. i'd highly recommend it to veterans of the fps genre, or people interested in old school deathmatches. righto, now all eyes onto lord of the rings war in the northhttpstore.steampowered.comapp32800 another effort by legendary developers snowblind studios. to be honest, this game really isn't that good. it has poor checkpointing, the revival mechanic as ripped off from gears of war is very, very frustrating at times, the enemies aren't very sharp, multiplayer has various issues, and the combat feels stale and bland. if you're dying for a coop hack and slash game, you might be sort of interested in this game, if you're willing to take the faults, but it's still not very good. combine that with a lazy pc port and the inability to turn off your microphone, and you have frustrations ahead. at this price, i'd pass it up even if you're a diehard fan of the genre. next up we have the stellar total war serieshttpstore.steampowered.comsaletotalwar by rts legends the creative assembly. to describe total war to a newcomer of the series is a challenge, as they're essentially their own genre. in total war, you build up an empire and raise an army to crush your opponents who stand before you. on the campaign grid, it takes place as a turn based strategy game where you manage settlements, train soldiers, and enact new policies and maintain diplomatic relations. in combat, the entire perspective switches to a massive real time battle, as you try to kill off your opponents. the single player is quite engaging and will suck hours of your life to its charms. for newcomers of the series and veterans of the older total war games, i'd recommend shogun 2, as it's the most polished, streamlined, and accessible game in the series yet. there is a demo, so if you still have reservations, check it out. medieval ii total war has some excellent mods, and rome total war is also an excellent game in the series. total war too in depth for you? do you want a simple shooter where you slay hordes upon hordes of the undead? well, look no further than the left 4 dead serieshttpstore.steampowered.comsaleleft4deadholiday2011, a set of remarkably polished and fun cooperative shooters. in the left 4 dead series, you play as one of four survivors who are on a mad sprint to the nearest safe house to survive the zombie apocalypse. along the way you'll meet special infected, who pose a particularly large threat to your progress and will test your teamwork skills. if you're looking for a fun shooter to play with friends, this is an excellent choice, as it's simple but engaging. valve is in the process of porting all of the maps from left 4 dead 1 into left 4 dead 2, so i'd only pick up the sequel if i were you. wasteland angelhttpstore.steampowered.comapp46520 is a remarkably dull arcade shooter set in the post apocalypse. to be honest, this is an incredibly generic game. there's really nothing that sets it apart from other games, it has no charm or any sort of redeeming features that makes it good. in fact, there's no multiplayer of any sort. so overall, i'd pass this one up, despite it being so cheap, and there being a demo as well. your mileage may vary, but this isn't a very good game. xotichttpstore.steampowered.comapp92600 is a score attack focused fps that lives up to its name. nearly everything about it is unique, be it the weapons, enemies, graphics, even the story. in fact, it far extends beyond the point of becoming surreal, and then still goes on. visually, the game is packed to the brim, to the point where you might distracted by everything on the screen. there are a few issues with jumping, but overall, it's an excellent choice for score fiends wanting to test their chops. check out the demo, and if you like it, pick it up, as it's very cheap. finally, we have the two tribes packhttpstore.steampowered.comsaletwotribes to round off our daily deals. the two tribes games are simple, charming, and unoffensive puzzler and platformer games that will cater to all gamers of any age. despite their simplicity, they are all quite fun, and are good for a coffee break or a quick way to burn off some time. every game is very cheap and has a demo, so be sure to check them out. definitely worth a look if you want to have a quick fun game."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"i think i must be the only person who didn't enjoy the binding of isaac. the game, if you're unfamiliar, is essentially a roguelike randomlygenerated dungeon spin on zelda 1, with shump combat. in a nutshell, imagine playing zelda with only a bowboomerang, and bombs. the shump combat itself is boring and lacks depth, despite the enormous quantity of powerups, because it never stopped playing like zelda with a bow, or at best a really strippeddown shump. you have a ton of items, as well, which allow for many new strategies and challenges and mystery, but ultimately that falls back to the core shooting, which i didn't find fun. it has a ton of replayvalue due to randomness, and it's especially good if you like to set personal goals for runthroughs. it's an bizarre amalgamation it's not quite a pure dungeon crawler and not quite a pure shump. the level design is pretty meh as a result of mixing shooting with zelda. i didn't enjoy it very much, and i just wanted to voice some contrasting thoughts. there's a demo on newgrounds for the curious. the game also has bad slowdowns from time to time, which often render it barely playable on my computer."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"i bought the binding of isaac the same day it was released. in total i've spent days playing this game. i've actually played this game far more than skyrim or any other game which has been released this year. it's a really, really great and fun game and especially for that price. there are only two problems with this game. it's created in flash, but it's not optimized with the latest flash 10 hardware accelerator. the achievement system may also not work or that the achievements won't show up at all. a guy on the steam forums ported the game over to flash 10 in under a day to run with hardware accelerator. he said that this helps a lot on the framerate. there are also someone on the steam forums who've made a fix for the achievement problems. the thing is that it's illegal to mess around with these files, so you can supposedly be banned on steam if you do that. i'm not sure though if that's true or not, so i won't touch those fixes. i highly recommend checking out the game on the steam forums if you want to know more about this. there have been a lot of people who've mailed edmund mcmillen the developer about the problems and also told him that they would love would help him optimize and fix the game for free. so far he doesn't seem to care about it though, which is kinda sad. on the other hand, mcmillen has written on twitter that he'll release a huge update for the binding of isaac sometimes next year. this will be a dlc which will contain more than two times the amount of stuff which is already in the game. the game will become huge! i'm really looking forward to it. in short buy the game, it's totally worth it!"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"the best way to describe it is a cinematic, linear, third person shooter set in an open world. there's not much impetus to explore other than for the purpose of sightseeing, but the main storyline should take you to all the places that are worth seeing anyway. the most apt way to think of the world in the game is as a stage for the story to take place on. it is a grand story however, and most criticism was due to the fact that people expected an open world experience as in the first game, but when you look at the game based on its merits it becomes apparent that it is an intricately woven 3rd person action game with a surprisingly encompassing story that spans decades. also, it has an excellent prison sequence."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"yes, the sizable city makes it easy for people to mistake this game as another gta clone but its used less as an open world and more as a very large set piece for the game to play out in. it is very linear and although the game can be uneven there are a couple greatly executed missions in the game. that said the story and atmosphere starts off quite strong and really sucks you into the world but about halfway through it starts to unravel and lose focus and lasts about 1215 hours which may leave you wanting. i get the impression that they just didnt have enough of a budget or maybe time to flesh it out as much as it should have been which is a shame because there is a lot of potential here, but for 7.50 its still worth it for those who are interested"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"it feels a lot like l.a. noire, in that you have one mission at a time and a very linear storyline. it's a shame, since the world is beautifully realized but there isn't any incentive to explore. still, the story is interesting, and the ending is memorable. i bought mafia ii for 20 and it was worth it for me."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"it's waaay more hardcore than company of heroes. there is a lot more micromanagement. each soldier has his own inventory, and if for instance he runs out of ammo you'll have to scavenge dead bodies for more, and transfer the weaponsammo to your guy, of course that takes precious time during which you are vulnerable, it can also be very tedious sometimes. also the single player campaign is very unforgiving, as in, if you don't pay attention at your units for 1 minute you can lose them all from a tank that showed up from nowhere so you'll have to quicksave a lot. assault squad is the most accessible of them all so i'd say get that one if you can, there is a demo if you want to try it. i haven't tried vietnam but i heard it's the worst of them."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"most likely yes. same overall gameplay, but with some important differences no bases, every soldier has their own inventory limited ammo, can pick up grenades and stuff, and you can take direct control of any unit, from a rifleman to a tank. it's takes some getting used to but is every bit as fun and challenging as coh, just in a different way."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"do yourself a favor and pick up assault squad. probably the best rts of the last 5 years. do not get vietnam or red tide, they were made by a different dev and are not very good. red tide isn't horrible but it is extremely hard and only singleplayer."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"i have finished it over 10 times and it remains my alltime favorite game till this day. the driving around the city is the greatest driving experience you can get in a nonracer game besides that it feels like being inside a mafia movie, a great one that is. i've tried the godfather game, it seemed boring, i've tried mafia ii, it was extremely disappointing, but i can't find anything to reproach the first mafia for. if you like sandbox games, mafia i offers a free play mode, where you can do whatever the hell you want it's available from start iirc, you unlock vehicles and parts of the city by playing through the story though. the story really feels like a great mobster movie think the godfather or goodfellas and after finishing the story there's this incredibly challenging thing called extreme ride, where you get crazy tasks to perform around the city. for 2.50 mafia is a steal and the gameplay really makes up for the dated graphics. one more thing though mafia and mafia ii are very different games, they are both sandboxes set in a mobster environment, though with different approach, and although i love the first one, i truly hated the sequel the driving mechanics are utter shit compared to the first one and more importantly, the story was to the first one what uwe boll's fantasy movies are to the lotr film trilogy. also, in mafia i you can do whatever you want before, midst and after each assignment, so it does feels sandboxy, the second one reminded me of the modern fps games, where despite rich environment you feel like in a corridor. and you can feel it's a consoletopc port, not a standalone pc game. yup, i do hate mafia ii."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"i have so much nostalgia for quake 1, 2, and 3 that it would be hard for me to objectively tell you how good they are. if you don't mind playing a game bearing in mind the time in which it came out, they're awesome. how's that?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"shogun 2 is much more similar to rome  medieval 2 than it is to empire, i'd say, although it keeps the fairly simple character traits present in empire. something new it has, on the subject of characters, is an experience tree. every time a general, ninja, daimyo, priest, or others gain a star, they get two or more, at the higher star levels points to be allocated into a tree of stats that give them bonuses. so, it's like all the bonuses that were around in rome 5 movement speed, 1 to field defense, etc, except that you can pick what stats you get. it's an interesting system. the battles are still total war battles, although i feel like siege assaults are more interesting, because the fortresses are arranged in a way where its size in comparison with your army is much more believable and, beyond the first two fortress levels, they have multiple tiers that the attackers need to scale to get through. makes for some very entertaining defensive battles, i think. rome was my favorite total war game before, but shogun 2 is now."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"it's not like traditional rts's. think of the campaign as one big turn based strategy. here's the country or continent and here's what your little faction controls, now go conquer the rest. much of your game time is spent managing cities and territory in tbs mode. once you are engaged in conflict the game goes to a battle map which plays out in real time where you experience and control the best simulation of large scale combat currently created. there's no peasant running to and from a mine gathering gold for you to upgrade some faggot's shields. you aren't waiting on your mage's mana to regen so you can summon meteors on your enemies building. you recruit and move armies on the world map and then those armies are represented man for man on the battle map hundreds of individual models formed into group units. it's all about formations and flanking, breaking the enemies morale and causing their ranks to flee! good stuff. now, if strategy and tactics is what you enjoy there really isn't a more satisfying game to play and succeed at. if you're a gogogokillkillkill kind of person than this is going to be too intricate for your mind to handle and honestly you shouldn't be off your adhd meds to begin with. there's a lot of people who are going to suggest rome total war. know this the total war series has a very dedicated fan base and most of them got into it with rome total war. you know how fan boys get with their old nostalgic games? if you're interested get the demo for shogun 2, play what it gives you and if you like it get it. shogun2 is very pretty and, though some would disagree, a refinement of the genre although it is simplified, some might say it's streamlined. looking at rtw it is 2.50. if you like strategy then there will not be a better way to spend 2.50. if you're okay with outdated graphics rtw is still an awesome game with the most variety out of any of the tw games and honestly the graphics aren't that bad."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"total war series is all about what you are interested in. if you are interested in classical history  rtw if you are interested in the middle ages  medieval 2 if you are interested in japansamurai  shogun 2 if you are interested in musketsguns  napoleon i just got shogun 2 when it was 10 earlier this month and haven't been able to play much yet so i will not have a valid opinion of this game yet. i love roman history and therefore i love rtw it's a fantastic game with plenty of mods. i also love medieval 2 as it has improved game play feature not included in rome, i think i enjoy rome a little more just because of the time frame."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,it doesn't exactly fit neatly into the rts category. i personally dislike most rts games but love the total war series. shogun 2 is the newest and most polished so i would recommend that over empire unless you particularly enjoy the whole early gun era. medieval 2 and rome are both great even though they can't compete graphically with shogun 2. i mostly play medieval 2 because it has far more mod support the empire or shogun 2. third age is a lord of the rings mod for medieval 2 that is especially good. so for the vanilla game i would buy shogun 2 unless you really like the empire era. for mod support i would buy medieval 2. i think there are demos for both shogun 2 and empire that you might want to try out first.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"i've played total war for nearly a decade probably a decade and i would without a shadow of a doubt suggest you start with rome. its the first in which at these times the graphics are bearable, but it also has imo the best stylefeel of the total war genre. the new style brought in by empire and then simplified drastically in shogun imo ruined the game. i would suggest that medieval 2 is one of the best because of the epic scale of the map without going too far as they did in empire however rome just has something about building up your legionaries to conquer the barbarians. also in shogun the units are rather unimaginative."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,i'm peeing poisonous spiderwebs and being followed by a lasershooting mechafetus sold.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"this would be true if the game had more heuristic design elements to it. as is, much of the loot system is entirely opaque, and the player often can only discover what item they have by using wasting the item itself, which can often be a gamelosing scenario. sometimes, using the item doesn't even teach the player what it does. the loot system is really a notaloot system for the most part, being entirely luckbased from start to finish. wildass guessing is not discovery, it's simply gambling, and it is not a painful decision when it is entirely uninformed. that's merely arbitrary. i might as well flip a coin upon entering a room, and unplug my keyboard when it comes up tails. it would be more appropriate if there were fewer loot objects, or if one loot object taught the player about subsequent loot thereby attenuating the learning curve. as is, there is no learning curve. it is simply, learning steps  game information that you either know, or do not know  or running to the wiki in order to not lose the game again. that said, it was still a pretty good game. i find nothing creative or fun about opaque game design. that was a crutch designers relied upon 25 years ago when resources and technology limited design in ways it no longer does i.e. low res screens, limited controls, and limited rom capacity meant including explanatory text ingame was difficult. as such, it isn't appealing when i run into it today."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"yep, i would totally agree."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"i also second this. it's set in an openworld style map just to give the characters a chance to develop and talk as you drive from mission to mission. it's otherwise a strictly but really great linear 3rd person shooter. edit also, you can drive around whenever you want even though there's little to do. i for one enjoyed finding all the collectables. gave me a chance to see all the gorgeous architecture and scenery up close."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"l4d2 frustrated me. part of me says don't play 1, 2 is out and it's a bit more polished featurewise and it's a bit cleaner and the zombies look cooler and stuff, while the other says you clearly enjoy 1 better. half can only play what's latest and greatest, the other half wants to play what's more fun. i never really liked l4d2. i don't think the music is as good though it has a cool creepy vibe and i think the additional infected types are kinda dumb and not as perfectly balanced as the originals."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-30,"i totally agree. i never got into l4d2, partially because many of the new special infected spitter and jockey, charger was good didn't add much, and quad caps are pretty much impossible. i feel that l4d1 was more strategic and better for competitive play than l4d2."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"fun fact! as long as you can access store.steampowered.comstore.steampowered.com, you can buy things from steam where ever you wish! just add items to your cart, then log in when it prompts you to, and they will be added to your account when you get home! give them more money right now!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"i'd like to know this too. i've attempted and died about a dozen times, and only once did i even get to the fifth level. if anything, the items i was getting with each subsequent playthrough were getting worse."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"the more you play, the more extra items and characters you unlock. these are generally pretty powerful, so they'll help your future runs. of course, extra bosses and levels are added as you play, too, so you'll have those to contend with, as well...."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-30,"no. the worst item in the game is a 1 hp pill, and pill coloration is randomly shuffled each game to make it more of a roguelike. want to avoid the statdown pills? go ahead, but that also means ignoring pills that could be statups. it's possible that picking up an unfamiliar item might work against whatever build you currently have shit, i had all these powerups for rapidfire shooting, and this one makes my shots stronger but slower!, but it's meant to be difficult to mixmax in a roguelike."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-30,how is the multiplayer i.e. is the battle portion by itself enjoyable? i there an active community?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-30,"yeah, i see your point there. an example of good integration i play a lot of paradox games and follow them on facebook. they do a great job of posting only interesting content, polls, news, etc. directly related to the games and not just random crap or stupid offers. i also enjoy the discussions with people from all over the world in the comments. putting a real name and face with fellow fans is cool."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-30,i like this idea.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2011-12-29,"this is correct. plus, i like that i can immediately share my screenshots to facebook when i upload them to steam."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,this is amazing. my only question is that its quite wide what games in which you play a character interacting with others is not suitable for this list? just as an example? even call of duty has some nuances of relationship building. legend of zelda has it. super mario has it. maybe mmorpgs like wow is the ones that dont make sense putting up here.. just thinking out loud.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"looking at this list, id strongly recommend anyone wanting better romance games to look into japanese visual novels. the overwhelming majority of these games are not romance games at all, but rather games with romance subplots. hell, even most japanese eroge have more romance in them than most of the games on this list."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,you have harvest moon on your list so gonna shoot off a recommendation for the rune factory series. it's a fantasy harvest moon with monsters and combat included with some story and a fun cast of characters in each entry.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-12,my time at portia is a really good game for light dating sim aspects. it's not a super deep relationship mechanic but it's a big part of what you will do through in terms of gaining affinity with the town. you can get married and have them move in. you also unlock more about each person in town as you advance the mechanic. but there is also a ton of building crafting mob fighting and exploring. it's a very polished indie game that i really enjoyed. and also has a sequel planned.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,"indeed! conflict and emotional friction leads to good stories, romantic and otherwise. does this mean i crave conflict?? hmm."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"you know what, you're right. i'll move it off the secondary list and put it on the main one. thanks for the feedback!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,xenogears i'd love to play it! but it's only for the original playstation. hopefully they'll remasterremake it or port it to the pc.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,de nada!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,thank you!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,i'm looking around trying to find any romance for the games and can't find any. would you be able to elaborate on which of the danganronpa games have romance and what kind? thanks for the suggestion!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,"what, no mention of doomguy and isabelle from animal crossing? worst list ever."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,and doom slayer and bfg 10k
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,great stuff! in fact so great they are already on there!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,its partially porn but acting lessons is really well reviewed for having a gripping and emotional story. i bought it but havent had a chance to play it yet so cant speak from experience.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,"oh it's for sure on there, thanks! number 10!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,holy heck nvm
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"whoops! fixed, thanks for pointing it out! having played through the trilogy at least twice now i feel bad, lol."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,thank you for pointing it out! i've added it to the list.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,"i agree! vilja is one of the very, very few mods as an npc to feel like she's an actual person. she has wants, dreams, and concerns of her own and is very reactive to what you do, say and how you feel about her. it's very well written."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,...beg your pardon?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,yesss it's a great game i suggest this one too.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"i'd love to add tales of the abyss wanted to play that for years and tales of legendia, but they're only for the ps2! playstation really needs to put them on playstation now so we can play them on today's consoles. sadly the unwound future is the same tale, last seen on the ds aside from phones. thank you for your comment though! they really are great games."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,generally the ones toward the top of the list are my favorites or have the highest reviewsmost people waxing eloquently about them. but i'm always a sucker for baldur's gate 12. and mods are a must.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,a great suggestion! i'll add it to the list. thank you!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"ho now! let's make sure everyone keeps such endings in spoilers. i still haven't finished the game i'm near the end, i think. and don't want to kill the story just yet!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"thank you! to answer your question, i've put a few systems in place to help with that. the games nearer to the top will have better portrayals of relationships and interactivity. additionally, there is a shallow tag that helps to point out games that do very little in the way of romance or relationships. finally, anything that isn't a relationship or romance such as one night stands, etc. doesn't make it to the list."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,i do indeed have rune factory 4 on the list! do you happen to know if tides of destiny has any romance? i'm looking at the wiki and only seeing things like relationship levels. thanks for your suggestion!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"after researching and looking around a bunch it looks like they may be for sale on the ps3 store, but other than thatnada. i'll add it to the list, and hopefully we'll get ports or remasters of that fantastic series soon! thank you for your suggestion!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,thanks! added to the list.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,pretty sure that counts as fullblown romance with how many times isaac gets penetrated by necromorphs.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,oh it's in there! 6th from the end. thanks for the suggestion.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,you're welcome! i hope you're able to find a great many good games to play.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"perhaps i just didn't get far enough into the game, but it didn't seem to strike me with its relationships? the mental commentary was amazing though."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,i can't believe i forgot about that oneit would absolutely make the secondary list. i'll pop it in asap. thank you for commenting about it!

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,"there's an excellent ds remake. i think it's also on mobile, but double check me there"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,mobile port yo
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"its in psn for a few platforms, and its a permanent fixture in my vita. granted, that means very little at this point."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,you got me!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,i don't think the list should be restricted to current consoles since you can use emulators in pc to play these games. restricting games because of console doesn't seem to be a good idea.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-13,"yeah i mean the whole thing is about him recovering memories of his family, but opinions and assholes..."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"def, it's a bit of a shame because i've already played so many on the list lol. how did you do advancing the romance in rune factory 4? apparently the later heart events occur randomly but after tons and tons of days playing it still hasn't happened."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,ye bro i meant in general hehe
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,i've been looking at playing baldur's gate 2. what mods would you recommend?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,i wasnt trying to spoil any endings. i just didnt remember any romance in that game and i was wondering if i missed something.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,i think nier automata has no romance. the relationship between 2b and 9s is one of friendship and battle partners.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"sadly, i haven't played that one so i couldn't tell you. sorry"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,you are welcome.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,yeah they really bend him over and split him in half countless times!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"definitely dont think you got far enough into the game and it also depends on your choices like with kim kitsuragi your detective partner in the game minor spoilers !he goes from someone who is skeptical of your abilities to someone who sees all of your flaws and strengths. he turns around and sometimes even joins in on your antics! then the main plot follows !questioning everyone and anyone who mightve been in a relationship with the person whos corpse is now hanging from the tree!. hell now that im thinking about it theres actually a pretty important subplot revolving your character and his previous relationship. it starts off slowly drip feeding you what the relationship was before finally hitting you with the resolution to the subplot in the final act. so it actually might qualify for the initial list. i highly recommend finishing the game. it has such great commentaries on society, relationships, how people relate and live in the world, politics, and more! i want to reiterate how genuinely good the writing for the game is. sometime this month the game is receiving its final cut update where there will be more quests and every line will now be voiced. the date is currently unknown because they want the update to hit at the same time for every store"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-10,"i'll never forget that combination smell of plastic, industrial carpet, and popcorn. arguing over who had to wear the red apron and walk around being the entertainment specialist for the evening. i recommended jumanji to everyone no matter their demographic and no matter that it wasn't at all a new release... blowing up blue and yellow balloons slowly and painfully even though i'd just had my teenage wisdom teeth removed. my manager who could juggle any collection of three objects just to wile away the time between customers. memorizing the trailers that played on repeat. hiding coupons under my keyboard and saving them for my fave customers. it was the best of times, it was the worst of times."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"for emulators such as playstation now that are widely available to everyone on currentlastlastlast gen systems i'll absolutely be including those! too many great games are forgotten that people dismiss just because it's too old. sadly for emulators to be legal, most of the time they require one to have the data from original game for the original system. otherwise aside from many being in the grey area of abandonware, it's not something that is easily accessible to those looking for such lists. thanks for your feedback! it's great to have discussions such as these."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,sadly that's not one that i've played yet. i'm hearing a lot of good things about it though.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"oh boy that's a question. thankfully in this modern age we live in we have the extended edition mod setup toolhttpswww.gibberlings3.netforumstopic29337eeeetmodsetuptool that allows us to pick what mods we want and it'll tell us if they're compatible or not as well as gives us the ability to take out features that are conflicting between mods to a certain extent. it downloads mods automatically and installs them appropriately all automatically so we don't have to do any of that ourselves. just be sure to have your baldur's gate 2 folder separate from the steam installation folder i'd just duplicate its contents so that if steam decides to update your game it won't brick your playthrough. that's a hard learned lesson i learned a while back. lost many, many hours of a character that went through the first game and most of the second. as for which mods, i'd have to say get a couple good banter packs. romance mods are hitandmiss but despite the very old controversy i enjoyed the imoen romance mod. i'll get into why that's not worth the flak it gets these days if you want, but for now i loved the story. there are others but i really enjoyed the builtin romances along with the banter mods as the mods added so much more depth to the characters and conversations that could be had between you and npcs. edit formatting, rewording, and linkage."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"sweet, thanks for your detailed response! i'll add it to the list."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,memorizing the trailers that played on repeat. and i thought i had it bad working at gamestop to the adsgstv we had playing. yikes.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"i think the responsibility lies on the player not you, since this list is just game recommendations. and i appreciate this discussion as well."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"forgot to add a game. is odin sphere in the list? there's remake of it. it has a love story. also, there are people who would even buy a 3ds or ps2 to play games. keeping games off because of your reasoning keeps people away from really good games, and that seems not the intent of your list."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,thanks!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,of course its my favorite game. for the most part you dont romance any characters well there is this one quest that you can do but i never did it im waiting on the update so i can maximize how much content i get to explore with it but it does talk about peoples relationships at times especially during side quests. the end of one of lenas side quest has one of my favorite conversations about relationships in it
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,i had done a fair amount of research on odin sphere but was not able to find a lot of info on the romance itself. would you be able to tell me which tags it could use so i can pop in into the list?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,whoops. forgot to link the tool.httpswww.gibberlings3.netforumstopic29337eeeetmodsetuptool

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-03-11,"yeah, i tried to put a decent amount of time looking for results for the game, as i do with all of the suggestions that are being made before i add them to the list. i've already vetoed porn, incest, and otherwise suggestions so i try to do my due diligence. thanks for your help. i'll add odin sphere."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-24,"isn't that the american revolution, vietnam and the future?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-24,i got the feeling from the trailer that it will play in epochs similar to rise of nations or a civ game.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-24,that's more of a cold war era
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-25,man if only we had a aoe in future setting.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-24,and by the way it is
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-24,that's pretty neat!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,"age of empires 2 is by far the best of the aoe series. been playing it for close to 15 years, and still play it every now and then. it's an absolutely fantastic game. i didn't really get into the later aoe games though. if you have an xbox, maybe try halo wars. it gets bagged a lot for its simplicity by seasoned rts players, but i had a hell of a lot of fun with it. its made by the same people who make aoe, and is a really well made, fun game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,"age of empires iii was the weakest. at that point, a lot of the innovation in the series was dead and there were other rts that did it better. i really liked age of mythology though."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,i was having fun with company of heroes. i need to get back to those games.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,how do you turn this on!
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,"if you like star wars, i can't recommend empire at war enough. 20 for the deluxe edition. for other rts games, my favorite are rise of nations and empires dawn of the modern world. the last one may be a bit unknown, but they're both incredibly solid. also, warcraft iii. solid game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,i thoroughly enjoy the total war series there are free demos on steam. the civilization series though that is turnbased. and company of heroes. should also have a demo i believe each of these are profoundly different but all enjoyable.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,"i haven't played aoe in a long long time, so i am not sure if it was good or if i was just young. i would recommend starcraft 2  there is a free to play version of it that you can try before you buy."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,homeworld was always my favorite. the command  conquer series ain't too shabby either. if you're willing to dive into more turn based strategy the total war series is amazing.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,i really enjoyed age of empires online... it is seriously addicting and awesome.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,httpwww.stuffwelike.comstuffwelikewpcontentuploads2008095567751825f950ab1a.jpg if only there was a iv
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,age of mythology looks really cool. or it might just be the fact that odin and thor are on the cover.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,"empire at war, and empires both look like they have a lot to offer. i think once i get some cashola in my steam wallet, i'll be getting empire at war."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,"see, a lot of people recommended starcraft 2 when i asked around. i may just have to give that a shot."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,"i always see it on steam, but it looks like a kiddie version. that may just be my perception, but it turns me away a little bit."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,"i feel like a total asshat now. i thought that there had been a iv. i'm sorry to have struck a sad chord, melancholyfetus. what do you think of aoe iii?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,"yea the emperors new groove graphics are a bit weird at first, but the civilizations you can play as are absolutely great! i actually made a video breaking it down and why it was done so well, but never uploaded it. the game is free so you should at least try it out. no harm done imho. i strongly suggest this game"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,while not quite up to the standards set by its predecessor the changes it made were great especially for the forwarded timeline of the game. the story was not quite up to par with the other aoe campaigns being fictional rather than past historical missions. but other then those my only quirk with the game was the lack of a random map generator. i had memorized all of the skirmish maps long before any of the expansions had come out.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,"thank you, sir. i may just have to do that."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-07,"no random map? that's one of my favorite features. i'd say that's something big missing, if i was to buy the game."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-02-11,let me know how it goes
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-02-20,judging by the manager's response it seems like it might just be a disgruntled employee because the manager did seem to really care about what he had to say then again it could just be a facade
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-02-20,they will get it removed. my company had an influx of very blunt reviews and i believe paid glassdoor to remove them. i asked the guy who wrote the worst one if he took it down and he didn't.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-02-20,"i totally get where the employee is coming from though. even though i don't have any background in game development, too many places i have worked at where you have a passionate team and some check in the box routine the company goes through. sometimes you have a manager that shares that passion, but theres usually some clog in the neck blocking the flow of communication from the heart to the brain. the big boss can ask if anything is wrong, and you can have a whole entire team full of people that may say no, but they have the answers to fix it, as it seemed to suggest from the employees wordy post. but that clog up top is going to tell the boss, nah we're all good, nothing to worry about. this happens a lot. all it takes is that one asshole unwilling to communicate and the employees voice will be unheard up top. one of the such places i worked at ended up discovering their clog though and started cleaning house. too bad i'm not working there now. it was a good job except for the circle jerk going on that wanted to hide the issues from higher and not work to try to fix them."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-02-20,true. they probably are downvoting this too atm
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-02-20,"i completely understand this, currently things are a mess where i work due to one person, everyone knows it and everyone knows why things are bad and no one is doing anything about it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-02-20,"reason it was so bad where i was, was that you had the big head in california, us all the way in the midwest. the guy talking to california tried to remain inaccessible, and used a really oppressive supervisor to keep us quiet and in the main part of the building. somehow word got out though and california sent someone to check it out and both of those guys were booted. the shit that was going on in that place was quite honestly probably illegal."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-02-20,"oh i know exactly how that feels, i've gotten tired of complaining it all falls on deaf ears at this point. question is do i stick around and hope things get better, or get out there and find something else, hardest part for me is figuring out what i want to do with myself."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-02-20,"personally, i left. i started working a second job, which sucked, but i had to have stable income before leaving there. once i was ready to leave, i gave my two weeks notice and had to sit and listen to him try to guilt me saying i was screwing over the whole team and that it was selfish for me to leave. before, we would have meetings in which the supervisor would tell us that we only worked there because we screwed up our lives and didn't amount to anything else. this is not an exaggeration...this is exactly what he said. he called out another manager and said they'd be stuck there the rest of their life because they were too dumb for college, and pointed out another guy not having custody of his kids. not sure what that had to do with anything. he knew he was a prick. he also knew he was untouchable. he would tell everyone they were worthless and couldn't make it anywhere outside that job. now....this place hires a lot of people with felonies. i however, had a clean record, no arrests, no drug use, a good work background, no felonies. when i put in my two weeks notice and he tried to give me the talk on how i won't make it, i was more than happy to tell him that i had a steady job elsewhere but i remained professional about it. my only mistake apparently was applying there. after discovering how much money i've left on the table over the years by not having a degree, i enrolled in college. i'm a year into my associates degree right now and have every intention of rolling right into my bachelors right after that. now that dickhead is without a job and i'm doing pretty good for myself. he probably won't ever see how well i'm doing, but it doesn't matter. what matters to me is that i know what i'm capable of. with a degree, i can eventually move into higher positions and hopefully help keep a company efficient without feeling any need to oppress my employees and be a lapdog for a guy that sits in an office and wants no interaction with the people who work for him. if anyone takes anything from what i'm posting....go to college. even if its expensive.....do it."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-02-20,"i dig it man, good on you, i hope you succeed."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-11-08,wow i hadn't heard hope they don't fuck it up
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-11-08,"well the remake of the original aoe didn't go down well with far worse ai than the original game, and most of the campaign maps replaced. they may have cancelled or delayed it due to poor performance of that."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-11-08,well maybe it will be shown at the x018 this weekend
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2018-11-08,it's still tbd.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2017-08-24,i hope not. i hate modernfuture era games... it's one of the reasons i loathe anno since they moved on from historical settings...

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-07-17,i don't know about civ but i enjoyed age of empires when i was younger. they made a new hd version of the old age of the empires game but the price is a little steep.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-03-07,"extremely unlikely. if the hd yeah right rerelease does well, we could potentially see another game, but i don't think so, especially since the studio that had the resources and knowhow to make a good age of empires game, ensemble studios, went under shortly after halo wars maybe shortly before? released."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2013-03-07,it would make sense that they would remake aoe 2 to build hype for an upcoming game.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-04,"you can also get ut goty off archive, we just did that for lan party this past weekend also putting in a mention for fistful of frags."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,steam summer sale this year is pretty lacking in quality sales.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"ftl is amazingly good hand of fate is really fun, difficult but fun."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,it's times like these i'm glad i have a potato.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,play undertale
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,"spore will run decently on a toaster, has nice ambient tracks made by brian eno and cliff martinez wouldn't ya know, is an interesting concept and has a really fun avatar creation engine. however, spore is really shallow in terms of its mechanics, gets repetitive quickly see shallow mechanics, you can experience practically everything in two playthroughs due to what amounts to a binary moral choice system and the ai is a crapshoot. i would recommend that you buy it while its on sale. also the cell, creature and space stages are probably the best ones for being actually fun and making good use of the mechanics, while tribal and civ are just bribe the ai until you decide you want to zerg rush them."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"picked up brave new world for civ 5 for like 4 bucks because i already had the game and gods and kings, totally worth it. don't know if i'm going to grab anything else though."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"for once, i was glad my library was relatively small. i got a 20 gift card for the sale, and stretched it a lot. why? because i didn't have that many games, so getting the biggest bang for my buck was important. for 21.50 or soi had 1.60 in my account, i managed to get the following  killing floor. great, a coop zombie experience! cost 5.  left 4 dead bundle. more coop zombies, but with an enjoyable campaign with a story and objective and less people as opposed to only fighting zombies on a map without an objective. it cost 6 for both via the bundle.  batman arkham asylum. a batman action game that is pretty good and feels really 'batman' style instead of another game reskinned as batman. goty edition was 5.  postal 2. beating the shit out of random people, accomplishing errands, kicking severed heads around like soccer balls, and urinating on people in the arcade. awesome. the base game is all of 1.  the witcher games 1 and 2. i couldn't buy the bundle, as i had no additional funds for the witcher 3, and i can not run the witcher 3 on my pc. i dipped my toes in the water with witcher 2's tutorial testing the games out on my pc. i was so blown away with the tutorial, i bought witcher 1enhanced edition with my last 1.50. witcher 2enhanced edition is 3. total 4.50. sometimes it pays to not have a huge librarymy library before was fallout games, portal games, skyrim, bioshock, binding of isaac, amnesia the dark descent, and some ftp games. tldr when you have a small library or limited fundsor both , try to find the games that give you the most bang for your buck."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,"black flag is pretty good, as is fable anniversary, hand of fate, and rise of nations. ive heard good things about ftl, long dark, and undertale. basically, just buy everything on there besides left 4 dead and spore"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,i was just thinking about this issue this morning. should there be a toggle option that is at the top that allows you to hide games already in your library?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,"spore, fable and the long dark are all great  especially those last 2"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,"i just keep an extensive wishlist and take a look every now and then. works great for the current sale structure that doesn't change every five minutes. plus, since i'll only buy something if it's on sale and i'm in the mood to play it right then, i save money by not buying things very often. also, i'm not the only person who doesn't have undertale, yay!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,definitely rise of nations in that group.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,"if you ever played fable the lost chapters, anniversary is a nice remake for memories sake. doesn't quite have the typical british humor that 2 and 3 had though."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,why not just go ahead and catch 'em all? p
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,you should buy black flag.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,"it's not even that you bought everything already, prices are significantly higher this summer sale than in the past. i bought a dlc pack for a game i'm already playing and that's the extent of my summer sale shopping. was really hoping to pickup state of decay but the 15 off sale price is a joke and frankly an insult. i can pick it up in physical retail packaging for xbox one for 18 bucks. so needless to say, my wallet thanks steam for the console premium pricing strategy."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,i just wish they had the rise of nations rise of legends expansion in there. i loved playing the steampunk faction so much when i was younger... and now i'm gonna have to see if i can find that old cd again.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,yeah. i am not interested in the sale anymore...i knew there was a time where i always logged in once a day to check the new stuff out...now i just watched the shop once and that might even be it for this sale.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"that's how steam sales are for me now. i check my wishlist on day 1, decide what i'm going to get..... and then i'm done. no more checking every day for hidden gems at a good price. i couldn't care less about the featured deals because if i wanted that game i would have checked it already myself. small game devs lose out big time on this new format because there is no reason to impulse buy a good deal anymore."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"it's quite simple why they stopped doing them. the refund system. if there was still flash sale people would buy the games and refund them and get more money than what they paid for i did it with shadow of mordor, i paid 12 for it and got 18 back because the sale had ended when the refund went through"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"even with those i wasn't excited anymore, because i noted i barely play anything and i usually buy games i know i will enjoy early on. that said, this year i got myself doom 2016, subnautica, darkest dungeon and warhammer 40k space marine. more games than last year, because i feel like i won't have to wait for a bargain anymore."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,is anniversary like a remake of 1? because that would be amazing.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,i actually bought fable during a sale shortly before anniversary came out and it was way more boring than i remembered it  i don't think new graphics will fix that. some games should remain in your memory.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"undertale is a definite yes, provided you haven't run into any of the unsavory parts of the community, and haven't gotten it spoiled for yourself. even then, it's still a pretty good game, but it's an absolutely masterpiece when played completely and totally blind with no outside influences."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,"that's a little bit of the customer base's fault. due to all the complaining about flash and daily sales from their users, valve made it so prices have to be at that price point for the entire length of the sale. as such, you're not going to get lots of developers and publishers to buy in to putting a superlow price during the whole sale. but 8 hours? they could do that... and they'd expect the resulting buzz for their game being at that price for as few as 8 and possibly 4872 hours at most? that'll carrry over. the buzz that they'd generate as people are talking about the new games they gotwere playing would also lead them make a fair number of full price sales over the next few weeks. now to put something at a bargain basement price for the full duration of the steam sale? that's not going to happen. it's why all the sales are blah, the steam sales are meaningless because you'll find the same games for a better price or bundled somewhere down the road in a few months, and maybe you manage to scoop up a few hidden gems or a price a aaa game that's reasonably competitive. there's no excitement, no buzz, and no great deals... because the primary avenue to get those out there was killed because people cried that they weren't able to sit and watch steam all day, every day to get good sales. so their answer was noone does."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"the long dark is well worth the cheap ass price its going for now, let alone its normal early access price. i love open world survival, especially with heavy realism. this game definitely has that, and without zombies or other tropes. i feel so immersed in that world that i feel like i had some of the experiences in real life. the developers have definitely not abandoned the game. they are really taking care to make sure the final product they release is a great game, and its not far off at this point. there is a lot of terrain to explore in sandbox, there are challenges, and there will be episodic story mode. this posthttphinterlandgames.comcommunityupdatestorymode from the developer will help give insight on where its been and where its headed. i just think for the price it is now, its a great investment at the very least."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,"i've only ever had one easy fight against it, and that was thanks to hacking, mind control, a slug crew member, the weapon preignighter, drones, a fire beam, and the glaive beam. it was the most ridiculously op i've been in the game, and i still had to bail for repairs before the 3rd round."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"the boss fight is easy as fuck as long as you use the raiders that tp to the enemy's ship. kill all but one enemy and one enemy will have to control the entirety of the ship running room to room. the ship goes on autopilot if you kill them all, though. plus, going invis to dodge attacks is a must."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"this is what drives me nuts about and away from roguelikes. for a genre that is about skill on the surface, there's just too much punishing and completely unfun rng in them."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,"not if you play it right. ftl is all about getting set up for the boss fight, making sure you are ready when the biggin' arrives. if you get the right gear at the right time, you don't need luck, you make your own."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"i think the fun of maximizing your odds of success add to it, unless it's on normal or hard you can pretty much always beat the final boss unless you get really bad luck. i'd say less than 5 of the time i can truly blame luck for losing in ftl."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,"you can't really plan your build that well. the weapons, crew, upgrades you get are not consistent and you could very well make it to the end totally unprepared due to no fault of your own."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"i dunno if you've tried crypt of the necrodancer or rogue legacy, but they take the building blocks of a roguelike and turn them into more twitchy, skill based games. there are still random items and stuff, but in my experience there's never really anything stopping you from succeeding except your own abilities."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-28,but the game giving you the right gear is still weighted by luck

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"haven't played crypt of the necrodancer yet, i'll have to pick it up. i have played both rogue legacy and risk of rain, they're a couple of my favorite games!"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"granted i've never played hard that well. but after a bit you can consistently win on easy and normal. the point is to build up as much scrap as possible. stores will always have ok to pretty good gear, meaning that as long as you have a reserve of scrap you can buy your weapons up. as well, getting drones, shields up to 34, and invisibility can insure that enemies cannot hit you if you can time your cooldowns. there is rng of course, but certain things are guarantees, which can give you a leg up."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2016-06-29,"sure it does. there is some chance, but there are quite a few consistent things in the game. most 1st2nd system enemies have 1 shield and guns that usually cannot pierce 2 shields. there are always stores, so finding weapons, addons, etc is something you can always do. defense drones are almost 100 success rate in shooting down single missiles, invisibility can temporarily raise your evade above 100, beams always hit their target. ftl has some rng involved, sure, but being able to manipulate the rng can almost always guarantee a win. its a hard game, mind you, but reasonable and possible."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-05,you are an amazing awesome person who does nice things for people when you have the time
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-17,"the amount of strategy games you have tells me that you enjoy strategic situations where you use logic and planning to gain an advantage. a lot of the games are also based on fantasy, usually a medieval kind of time period. you are probably someone who loves reading and experiencing rich stories and lore. this means you are also a person with a good amount of patience and discipline. to balance out your methodical and strategic approach, you also enjoy some action packed games where you cannot always plan everything. this tells me that even though you are meticulous in planning, you are not afraid to take risks from time to time. the ghost recon game tells me that even though you enjoy action games, the strategic part of your mind still overflows from time to time into these types of games, and so you have this urge to still make plans even in action games to ensure victory. finally, you have fc24, which is a soccer or football game. based on this, there's a good chance that you are a fan of the sport and that you are living somewhere in europe. to summarize, you are a disciplined person who enjoys using the mind to plan your success and the downfall of your opponents. you have the patience and discipline to not just go rushing in even in action games and you would still try to make plans even in potentially chaotic situations. your love for medieval fantasy games, and the existence of a soccer game in your current playlist suggests that you are someone who lives in europe. that's my guess!"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-29,"this is just straight up false information. there are some discs out there which contain only a small fraction of data, essentially acting as only a physical license. though this is not true for 95 of games. most games have a full 1.0 master of the game on the disc, unless specified on the box that it requires internet. microsoft and activision published physical games are notorious for not including the actual games on the disc. avoid these discs at all costs. hence why physical media still has some popularity on sonys machines, they always come with a polished 1.0 build printed on their discs. and no it isnt true for all consoles. its technically only on xbox that microsoft got deny you the use of a physical disc, since each disc has a unique id on it. playstation and nintendo does not print their discscarts with unique identifiers on them, so theres no way for sony and nintendo to deny you the use of a physical disc. regardless, physical games on xbox does have some value over a digital version. like mentioned, most games does have a fully playable master on it, making it gold for preservationists. youll have something to pass down to your kids to enjoy when the servers are long gone. you also have full ownership of the physical structure which the game is on, meaning you can sell it as you wish. stop spreading misinformation. you can visit doesitplay.org and see for yourself which games has the games on the disc. hint its the vast majority."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-26,"while i'm sure that is true for some games, manymost still contain a runnable version of the game and can be used without internet connection. how exactly are they going to stop that booting?"

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-26,"yeah, but im not going to stay subscribed to gamepass for one game"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-26,it won't because bethesda is a microsoft property
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-26,im not worried about it going away. its just cheaper to pay for it then to continue to pay for game pass month after month. i only subscribe to game pass like a month at a time when a short game i want is newly released and this year that was only 2 months
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-26,so why are playstation and nintendo so much more successful then xbox?
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-26,"true but that's actually a bad thing for gamepass users. playstation can't compete because gamepass runs at a loss and sony just doesn't have the cash microsoft has to eat a loss like that up. problem is microsoft isn't going to accept a loss forever, they're expecting long term profit from gamepass."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-27,exactly. if i want to play i dont want to have to subscribe again or just keep it on permanently. i dont mind it so much for one and some sort of games. but for a big rpg like this with a whole bunch of replayability. i want to own it so i can play whenever.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-26,"yeah, i have big game collection so most of the games on gamepass i would want to play i own already, or have played. however if microsoft starts putting out starfield level games on a regular basis i would definitely stay subscribed. however, i understand that is probably realistic. im sure starfield costs like hundreds of millions to make."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-26,it's because sony playstation and nintendo were household names before the first xbox ever released quit being stupid. no one cared about console wars in 2003 and they definitely do not in 2023. microsoft isn't going to stop producing xboxes. buy what you like.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-07-09,"maybe look for something in the arpg genre? that's like diablo, divinity original sin, path of exile, etc. etc. gameplay is a bit hackandslash, with lots of enemies to kill so should feed his need for things like wolfenstein....and then the build trees are exactly like you'd get in a traditional rpg like oblivionskyrim. it'll be a compromise for both of you of course....the pace is going to be fastermore mindless than you're used to from traditional rpgs, and needing to manage inventorythink about a skill tree will be more than he's used to from the games you listed. but it might work. one oddball suggestion  deathtrap. it's a coop tower defensearpg hybrid. it looksplays a lot like diablo pick a class. build a skill tree. kill hordes of enemies. but each class comes with their own kinds of buildable traps in addition to the arpg autoattacks  magic attacks. you need to build your traps towers, and defeat each level of x waves of enemies coming through a small mappath. so there's the mindless killing elements, but also a strategy element as the levels get harder and you need to actually plan what trapsskills need to be used for each level. edit holy shit how could i forget. orcs must die 2. it's also a tower defense game....but it's a fantasythemed 3rdperson shooter. that would probably be a lot more up his alley than the diablostyle of deathtrap. this is, hands down, one of my favourite coop games ever. it's so much fun. and again, for you, it has good strategyplanning elements. if you try to just shootmagic everything to death, you're 100 guaranteed to lose. you need to have the right traps in the right order, and in coop they limit your trap inventory to like 4 or something, so you can't just bring every trap to make a level easy. so good."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-07-09,6 months plus for the mp update. ive now stopped reading the weekly updates. i purchased this game in 2014 and would have thought they could have released the full finished game by now but nope. love the game and have many hours in it but the progress made has been at a snails pace. i wouldnt recommend anyone purchase it until they can put out a finished product. its been almost 8 years since the launch into ea

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-07-09,dude knock it off. the pc vs console vs whatever the crap you're playing on debate is not funny in this context. go bother someone else.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-07-09,"cool...if you do try the orcs must die series, a couple important notes  orcs must die 1 is singleplayer only. the sequel the one i recommended includes all the original levels anyway, so there's no point in buying it really.  orcs must die unchained is the freetoplay 3rd installment in the series. it's awful. avoid at all costs. it's essentially a paytowin freemium game and they removed the traditional campaign."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-07-09,i didnt even mention a console at all my point was that there are a plethora of games on steam alone theres literally so many games that making a reddit post about it wasnt even worth the inquiry there are even flash games that can be downloaded and played for hours has nothing to do with the imaginary console wars thats all ego to make people feel better about spending money on technology
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-07-09,you must be the friend but whether you are or not you could see for yourself that there are billions of games on steam and for great prices too
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-07-09,"hey, i have a question. there's an orcs must die 3 on steam and it's not free. do you know anything about it?"
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-07-09,"then i'm sorry. i just thought this was another trash lame comment, but now it's obvious that it wasn't. steam store has shit filters though. it's almost impossible to find anything decent there if you don't know the exact game you're looking for."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-07-09,"it's not released yet as far as i know. supposedly the game company got the message that people like 2, but hated the unchainedf2p one, so 3 is supposed to be back in the style of 2. since it's not out yet though i can't tell you whether they succeeded or not."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-07-09,"what do you really want to play? like right now? do you get bored easily? i feel like the best games are the ones few people know about, thats the beauty of all those steam games its really like a goldmine."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-07-09,1 i'd love to try daggerfall unity. maybe i'll actually do it today or tomorrow. 2 no i don't get bored easily. i spent 120 hours in aoe2 playing the same game mode and on the same map against the ai lol. 3 i totally agree about the games you don't hear much about.

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-08-12,"you can cross off warhammer 40k inquisitor martyr from your list. unfortunately it's not a very good game and feels extremely clunky during gameplay. visually and audibly? it looks and sounds really nice, but the controls will get you frustrated to the point you don't want to play. i also recommend against path of exile. that game is free and getting old, so if you haven't been enticed to even try it by now, odds are there is nothing in it that will keep you interested in playing it long term. storyline isn't even that great so you're not missing out on anything except a grind. good luck though, you do have some fun choices in there."
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-08-12,that one looks quite time consuming. even the art book for it is the biggest computer game art book that i have.
Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-08-12,i know it's very well received. and that there's a sequel on the way as well... i'm just not sure about the time it takes to do the whole game properly... what do you think?

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-08-12,"i remember prey. i played a little bit of it a while ago. i've never heard anyone talk about it so i had forgotten it tbh. the bioshock series is all great, but i haven't played since before the free remastergraphics upgrades. i was a few hours into dishonored before something more important took me away from it and i never finished it. i've only played factorio a little bit. dyson sphere program not at all. i've heard satisfactory is good too. thanks. i've seen people talking about stardew valley but don't see the appeal yet. i've played some of hades and it looks good but gets difficult quickly. i suppose that's the point. i got enter the gungeon for free but not played much yet."

Reddit,Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2020-07-07,"since you really like nfs hot pursuit, you could try out nfs most wanted and nfs underground 2. nfs high stakes and porsche unleashed could be pretty fun too, but porsche unleashed is limited exclusively to porsche cars and their legacy, and its not as over the top as hot pursuit. underground 2 doesn't have any police. it has a lot of car customisation, but you should probably skip it if that isn't your thing. one general racing game i'd recommend  i really like racing games lol  would be sega rally 2. daytona usa could be fun too, but there isn't that much content in the console releases of the games, even though the games are fun. the xbla version, for example, is just the beginner, advanced, and expert stages and the ability to play online with your friends. i guess daytona usa 2001 could be fun. because you played spiderman and liked it, i really think you should play spiderman 2. there's also spiderman for the ps4, but i've never played it so i can't vouch for it. you could also try out the original star wars battlefront 2. one series i'd recommend is tony hawk. more specifically, from pro skater 14 up to underground 1. some of the other ones are alright, but those are objectively the best ones. other than that, i can't really think of anything, but i think i'm going to list my favourite games in a document or something somewhere from now on."
