Age of Empires IV Announce Trailer,56541,"This is about as big as it gets in gaming announcements short of Half-Life 3. The HD version of AoEII has sold 4.5 million in 4 years just on Steam, making it one of the 20 best selling PC games of all time, and that's just the remastered version, not the original that's been out since 1999. When the topic of what game do you have the fondest memories of or what game franchise do you most wish would make a comeback comes up on popular subreddits like askreddit and others, Age of Empires always dominates the conversation.

Which is a semi-long winded way of saying this is huge, regardless of whether you like the games or not. I'm incredibly excited, personally.",424

I remember finishing the campaign in *AoE III* and thinking, ""Well, that was corny and terrible, but hopefully the rest of the campaigns will be decent and historical!"" only to find that there *were no* other campaigns.

Unless perhaps this is an English Learners issue, and the trailer production company just didn't know the correct word to use. In that case, it's quite understandable, though I don't know why they wouldn't hire a native-speaking English major to proofread.

Age of Empires IV Announce Trailer,56541,"Now i just need a new C&C (based on Red Alert 2 or C&C 3 Tiberium Wars), Age of Mythology, Evil Genius (already announced) and Impossible Creatures.

That's my ""small"" request to be in peace with the RTS genre :)",2

I hate it when games try to balance gameplay by making units count for 2 or 3 population points.

AoE III was one of the biggest disappointments in PC gaming to me.  They put in a dumb card system, the campaigns centered around *The Fountain of motherfucking Youth* (and the story sucked), the map editor (that was a sandbox paradise in AoE I and II) was difficult to understand and not fun to use, the animations looked slow, and the maps looked dull and unrealistic.

Age of Empires IV Announce Trailer,56541,"I'm sorry to say but after AoE 3, I don't have high hopes for this. It looked great, the actual system of playing was great but the AI was probably the worst I've ever seen in a RTS, the maps were absolutely tiny and it seemed like the devs simply gave up on single player altogether which, while people enjoy multiplayer, is just fucking lazy when they can't be bothered to give the CPU a decent AI and to at least try to cater to the people who have been playing this franchise since day one. We went from AoK, which is an absolute cult classic, still getting new content to this day, great AI, awesome maps, millions of configuration options to AoE 3 which it seemed like they stopped developing the moment it could connect to the internet and find opponents online.

I'm expecting a great looking game with even less actual history and more bullshit, zero replay value for single player and all the focus on multiplayer, which becomes dead after six months because they never bothered to give people a reason to like the game.",2
Age of Empires IV Announce Trailer,56541,Looks kind of disappointing... the whole point of advancing the series in the past has been advancing the civilization levels another generation. AOE had up to the colonial level so I was hoping it would take us to at least WW1 this time around if not ending at WW2 possibly.

Seven months later Bill Gates did another AMA and another user asked for a status update on the AoE game. Bill waited three months to reply but finally did:

Age of Empires IV Announce Trailer,56541,"IMO, if they're continuing it in the tradition of the older games, it should begin in the Napoleonic Wars and end in World War 1. AoE3 seemed to end in some weird limbo between the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War. Keeping a broad but still limited time period would allow them to put some extra love into the units, buildings, and systems I feel, and having WW1 techs like tanks, airplanes, chlorine gas, etc slaughtering armies and burning empires would be a poetic end to every match. If they went beyond that into World War 2 (or beyond), they'd risk becoming just another bland WW2 RTS game which are a dime a dozen.

&nbsp;

Edit: Thinking more about it actually, that's probably unlikely. They'd risk being called out for having it be too similar to AoE3. A more likely scenario is probably WW1 to Cold War, either the beginning or the end of it. There'd be a visible, tangible feeling of progression and change through the various ages, but it'd all be fairly similar (tanks, infantry, airplanes, etc, just getting upgraded) and they have plenty of units they could introduce in later ages (missiles, helicopters, etc); maybe you'd get a chance to adopt an ""ideology"" like in Civ 5 that helps fuel conflict, create temporary alliances, and give you certain bonuses?",153
Age of Empires IV Announce Trailer,56541,"Microsoft owns Rise of Nations, which spans multiple ages. Honestly I prefer RON to AOE, but I don't really play rts games so it might just be more fun due to its accessibility. Maybe if this game goes down well we could see a Rise of Nations 2 (although there was a fantasy spin off that didnt sell that well)",27

Age of Empires IV Announce Trailer,56541,"As someone who gets demolished in multiplayer RTS, I really hope there's decent single player content. Or failing that, how about a campaign creator and sharing support?",10
Age of Empires IV Announce Trailer,56541,"There are no microtransactions in the remakes of AoK and AoM. Instead, both titles received DLC adding more factions, units and campaigns. Considering the fan base of the series, the failure of the F2P Age of Empires Online and the success of these remakes and their DLC, microtransactions are unlikely.",6

Age of Empires IV Announce Trailer,56541,"AoE 3 would have been a good game on his own, if it had not carried all those expactations from AoE 2.

Age of Empires IV Announce Trailer,56541,I expect a good but not a great game with disappointed people due to too high expectations.,7
Age of Empires IV Announce Trailer,56541,"That's certainly an opinion. Age of Empires 3 and its expansions were quite well received. They obviously didn't live up to its predecessor, but it's pretty hard to beat the nostalgia and well-roundedness of of AoE 2 and The Conquerors.

Visually, AoE was quite a beautiful game. The sound effects were great and the card system and whatnot added a lot of depth to it. Plus, the online multiplayer system was way better than the garbage that Age of Empires 2 was (back in the day, at least). I thought it was a great game.",6

There has been a picture showing AoE 1-4 (belive it was in an artbook) since the release of 3, but with 3 not meeting the expactations of many. I gave up hope on ever seeing AoE 4.

This game is a huge gamble. There will be really high expactations for it, but if they deliver it will most likely be one of the best selling games you can imagine.",295

The problem with RTS games now is that for a long time now, they have all been chasing the success of StarCraft in trying to be the next big ""esport"".

Compare it to AoE2, even Age of Mythology is better.
Color palette was  weird, and general game flow was off and not straightforward.
So many times i wasn't sure if i win battle or not, and it was too  fast paced, so not much time for strategy...

Maybe without that stupid rockets and canons it would be better game, lack of Europeans factions and  longer interesting campaigns like original aoe2/AoM have. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either.

UI was utter  trash (i hate 2d 2colored  icons wit all looks same) They should make Ui like in Age of Empires 2/AoM , full hand-drawn colored icons and all easily distinguishable from each other!!!

Units looked weird designed, with weird looking weapons (too big), like bowmen and spear-men looked superweird.

Pricing was off, it should start at 20$ and gradually go to 10-5$ and sell DLC for 3-7$ with proper 3x6missions campaigns per DLC, it will be successful.

"I averaged 14 ""Best Games of All Time"" lists from the last five years together, and these are the results",28313,"Good work and an interesting list.

The big problem with it is the sourcing. 

During the period from 1989 to 2000, there were dozens of PC game magazines that comprehensively reviewed computer games. They were far more in-depth and they were contemporaneous to the games being released, not a list put together after years of hindsight.

Consequently, the modern list providers are going back thirty or more years, looking at hindsight memory and sales. 

Games that definitely SHOULD be on this list are left out largely because their genres didn't grow into industry leaders, even though sports and flight sims, and puzzle games, were much, much bigger back then.

Games I would've expected based on their rep at the time would've included Earl Weaver Baseball from circa 1986-87; Wolfenstein 3-D from 1993; The Secret of Monkey Island from 1991 (ish); Falcon 3.0 from 1990 or thereabouts; Wing Commander from 1993,  FIFA International Soccer from 1994; Descent: Freepspace from 1998-ish. 

That's just off the top of my head. But all of those were considered genre-defining at one point, and certainly were among the best reviewed games ever. Reviewing also used to be MUCH tougher. Modern games that get an ""80"" would often have been a ""50"" or a ""60"" in equivalents of the time.

So operating from hindsight sort of robs this of accuracy, to me. But it's a good list, nonetheless.",216

The amount differed based on whether the list was a top 50, top 100, top 200, and so on. Making it onto more exclusive lists obviously granted more points.

1 ""maybe more of a comment than a question"" (sorry)

Did you control for date of release? As you've written it, any game released later than 2018 is disadvantaged by being excluded from evefifry previous list. What I mean is, Hades or Elden Ring are excluded from lists before 2020 or 2022, respectively. I can see the justification here being that newer games *should* be disadvantaged in a ""best games of all time"" list to counteract the cult-of-the-new aspect, but I'd be intersted in how that was actually approached / dealt with, if at all.

reasons:

1. each list is bound to a have a 1st place, so each publication is normalized on that, as opposed to providing more points if the list is longer. For example, a t50 list has only 1/4 the number of points a t100 list has

2. with the harmonic pricing system, different positions have different differential values. E.g., the difference between a 50th position and 51st position has a smaller difference than between a 2nd vs 3rd, for example, as it should be. I can't believe the editors of a publication would put much effort into whether crash bandicoot is 30th or 31st. However, I think a lot of effort would have been put into 1st vs 2nd.

"I averaged 14 ""Best Games of All Time"" lists from the last five years together, and these are the results",28313,"> Number of games with female protagonist: 17

It would be interesting to see this explained/broken down more. Several games on the list have no ""protagonist"" (sports games, strategy games, etc.) a customisable protagonist which can be female or male (mostly RPGs) or a selection of player characters with no single ""primary"" protagonist (fighting games, etc.). I fear by simply including this number without further breakdown, some will read it as the other 183 games have a male protagonist, which clearly isn't the case.

EDIT: I did my own count and came up with:

Ambiguous/unidentified/no protagonist: 14

Customisable protagonist: 33

Female protagonist: 13 (so I'm clearly not counting the same way the OP did...)

Male protagonist: 115

Multiple selectable characters: 25

Note that there's a bit of subjective judgement involved in choosing ""Customisable protagonist"" vs. ""Multiple selectable characters"". In my judgement; if the character chosen/created by the player is the only one that logically ""exists"" within the game, then it's a ""customisable protagonist"", but if the non-chosen selections can appear within the game (e.g. secondary characters, opponents, etc.) it's ""multiple selectable characters"".",2

It competes with Destiny, Mario Kart 8, Dark Souls II, Hearthstone, Bayonetta 2, Titanfall and it wins?

I need to look into the data because something's off.

EDIT: ok, I am now even more interested in the raw data and calculations that were done by OP. I've done some ""at a glance"" of 2014 and there's no way that Alien Isolation is higher than Dark Souls 2. We're talking 78 on metacritic vs 92. Out of half a dozen publications that I've reviewed, DS2 is higher by 10-15% in scores. What am I missing?

EDIT2: Alien Isolation is not even listed on almost half of the lists that OP mentioned that they used. It leads me to believe that their calculation method is not weighted (i.e. being on 1 out 12 lists with high score, skewes the outcome). It would explain why it's so high.

Morrowind not being on there when Oblivion is is objectively mad, but makes sense given how Oblivion benefited from solid console presence.  

Tomb Raider is shockingly low on the list given how massive it was. I'm surprised that Bioshock is higher than Halo.  

One other observation - an awful lot of massive franchises are woefully represented - almost all sports and racing games, but also major series like Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Battlefield.

Things Halo 2 disappointed at upon release:

1. A lot of people were very upset at what they thought were ""false promises"" about fighting on Earth. Previews promised a whole campaign when it turned out to just be two missions.

2. The fact that you don't play as Master Chief the whole game upset fans who were not expecting the Arbiter gameplay

3. Story that became a little to complex for its own good only made worse by a frustrating cliffhanger that left a lot of people confused.

4. Difficulty that was perceived as punishing at best and unfair at worst (does anyone like sniper alley?) combined with some really atrocious level design even considering this is a series that has struggled with level design in most of the titles.

5. New features that weren't very revolutionary and sometimes just bad, dual wielding, damagable vehicles, no health, etc...

Halo 2 should get praise for what it did, and xbox live was clearly a killer app. But at the time it was widely seen as a disapointment based on Halo CE's promise.

Ocarina is probably the most nostalgic out of all of them. It introduced many musical motifs that have since become a mainstay in the franchise, and it has so many memorable characters and moments.

Stopping devs from taking any risks.

A game like BG3 isn't perfect, but it shows what's possible if you don't have to stop development when market research tells your return on investment will only decrease by allocating more dev time.

FNV takes you all OVER the place.  And sidequests are often triggered in places where the main plot takes you.

So Fallout 3 rewarded exploration more. All sorts of side quests hidden where you actually had to go and search them out.

Plus the encounters in the wasteland were completely different.  In FNV, you could say ""now a gecko will run in from the left"", whereas in FO3, the best you could say is ""SOMETHING will happen in this place, when I come up to it for the first time"".

I think that game was mind-blowing at the time of release, now it feels rather dated.

My problem is that Zelda fans absolutely **rave** about BotW and I personally found it a very middling game. So I'm just very skeptical about what those same people have to say about games in general. Simply based on how a lot of people go crazy for BotW, I've always just assumed that there are a lot of Zelda fans who are dedicated Nintendo gamers and who have not played open-world games with actual qualitative content like RDR2 or The Witcher 3.

"I averaged 14 ""Best Games of All Time"" lists from the last five years together, and these are the results",28313,"Yes, but collectors aren't ranking their collection based on ""best of all time"". ""Most influential"", maybe, but not ""best"". It's an entirely different metric. Because the ""best cars of all time"" list if aging is removed from the equation would be dominated by modern cars, which have infinitely better safety, faster speeds, better suspension, softer seats, etc, etc.

Video games aren't quite as bad as cars for that, but both graphics and gameplay are features that age extremely poorly. Every generation gives much better graphics, so every game aiming for top tier graphical fidelity is going to look bad in hindsight. Gameplay of popular games also gets ripped off and refined, so what was once revolutionary gameplay becomes modern day cliche gameplay.

It's impossible to separate such things when talking about best. Each person has their own metrics for determining how much gameplay and graphics aging affects them. For some people, what might matter is just how they felt when it first released; for others, it might matter how well it holds up if it were first played today.

No matter how good Elden Ringâs dlc is, it ainât goty in my opinion. 

Remakes, dlcâs and passes should have their own categories. 

Isnât the point of Game of the Year to push forward to making new experiences rather than relying on old stuff. Old stuff is fun, but in this day and age where consumers beg for originality  we should be celebrating new amazing stuff and not staying with the same stuff just because weâre scared to try new things.

I know at the end of the day, award shows are stupid and donât mean anything in the grand scheme of things.

Play what you want, like what you play, if you love a game and think itâs the best game of the year, thatâs awesome, but we shouldnât let a over glorified paper weight determine what is good when itâs COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE.",36

The Game Awards 2024 - Nominations Thread,471,"Isn't there is a ""Best Ongoing Game"" category specifically for games that, you know, still get content years after it was released. So I think a DLC should fall under that criteria, no? Last year Cyberpunk won it, mainly because of their solid DLC (and rightfully so!).

I mean, they could have released the game and called it a day, but the devs decided to put extra time and effort into the game post launch and add new content (albeit content that you had to pay for). That's what an ongoing game means in my book.

You just can't compare the effort of making a game from scratch to making a DLC. It's just much less work, as 80% of the work is already done, so it should not be up against games that actually had to do all the work.

If Elden Ring was up for ""Best Ongoing"" I would say, yes, the deserve that statue. But Being nominated for the actual GOTY? That's pushing it.

However, I can see a DLC getting best narrative or art direction if the narrative or art of the DLC is so drastically different from what the base game offers and is really good (which I would also not say Elden Ring DLC has). But best Game Direction is also pushing it a bit. The game and the art were already directed  ð¤·ââï¸",17

It's a joke of an award show that celebrates gaming by not including one of the best narrative games this year.

They occupy slots that should be given to standalone and new titles and games like 1000xResist just float under the radar until years later when you see people going ''why didn't anyone recommend this sooner'' because this is precisely why.

The Game Awards 2024 - Nominations Thread,471,"honestly, even if I was ok with SOTE being nominated for GOTY (I'm not, it's stupid as) it doesn't even deserve it.

Let's be real, it's an expansion, and as far as expansions go, especially for FROM standards, it wasn't even that great.

\- Huge stretches of map locations completely empty  
\- Reused bosses, AGAIN, and reused bosses WITHIN THE DLC, like I can at least forgive reusing bosses from the base game, but reusing bosses within the same DLC is insane  
\- Bosses are wildly incoherent, you go from insanely boring, to nice fights, to great fights, to frustating and broken, to straight up almost impossible  
\- There is even less coherent story than the usual FROM standard and it's obvious a lot of the story was cut, literally all of the trailers make absolutely no sense when you play the DLC; All of that bit with Marika and the gate? the betrayal?  
\- Cookbooks, enough said

IMO. Black Myth Wukong deserves the win, it's pioneering the chinese gaming scene and while it has its problems, it is a quality game with tight and fun gameplay, at times way better than ER/FROM for presentation and feel.

Whereas Elden Ring obviously hasnât been doing that. Few patches here and there but generally not an ongoing process to continually update and improve the game. Itâs just a game that came out, and then later pumped out an expansion.

Well, thatâs my stance on it. Itâs a marketing win if your game wins. Personally, I wouldnt have the courage to try Elden Ring if it didnt win GOTY years before, I tried it as my first Soulsgame and now itâs my favorite and tried other Soulslike games too.

Another example is It Takes Two. It was outside my radar, and only knew about it because it won GOTY. One day my wife wants a new game to play, and suggested her It Takes Two. So I bought it and played it with her. I wouldnt have suggested It Takes Two if it didnt won GOTY.

As far as Remasters go, itâs on the higher end. Wholly new model replacements, fresh voice acting including previously unvoiced dialogue or entirely new dialogue. Animation upgrades. Small but entirely new mechanics being added, etc.

Butâ¦ there was also no getting around the fact that at itâs core, itâs built and feels like a 2007 PSP game, because thatâs what it is. Youâd need to do an actual ground up Remake to get rid of that.

And things like that donât tend to hold up under scrutiny now as they did back at the original release. Consequently those old legacy issues tend to get hauled up on reviews and detract from scores. Which would naturally filter them out from consideration for awards season.

Remasters of more recent-ish games (TLoU, Horizon, etc) donât necessarily have that issue, but they do run afoul of often feeling unnecessary or tampering with something that didnât actually need tampering with. So they too will select themselves out in most cases.",3

In fact earlier this year I said that if FF7 Rebirth won game of the year, it would help boost it's poor sales by showing people that it's some special worth playing. II likened it to The Witcher 3 which wasn't some massive hit when it first came out and it became more popular over time and Rebirth has that same thing going for it where it'll keep selling at a steady pace and do well in the long run, especially when Part 3 comes out to get people more invested in the trilogy. I know Baldurs Gate 3 winning got me to check the game out when I originally had no interest because I had a hunch I wouldn't like it. Unfortunately I was right and I couldnt play more than an hour before refunding it because it just wasnt for me. But that doesnt lessen other peoples enjoyment of the game.

That's what gets me are the people that play the games who get all bent out of shape when THEIR favorite game isn't nominated or doesn't win.

From software and miyazaki need to update their game because they have already been surpassed by many other developers they have inspired. Heck lies of p alone is better than the majority of their catalog ; bloodborne and dark souls are the only ones above it.


I'm a huge fan and of their works, bloodborne is top 3 best games of all time objectively speaking and I can't wait to play it on pc once we Crack all the codes, but I'm not another blind follower like many people are now just because they have played a single game from them , and it's not even the best game they have on their catalog.

The Game Awards 2024 - Nominations Thread,471,"Just to be clear with you. While I'm a huge from software and miyazaki fan and love elden ring and shadow of the erdtree, both are very flawed and it's not close to be their best game. That's bloodborne. When elden ring won in 2022 many ""newbies"" to the souls games call me crazy, when I said that God of War ragnarok should have won game of the year above elden ring just because it is a better crafted game. Heck everyone was going for my head.


Elden ring and shadow of the erdtree do so many good things in different ways that I understand the bias towards it, specifically from people who are getting into this genre because this is the first main stream game of from's catalog, but as you may know by now.

As if the content in SotE is just reused assets in an existing game map. They aren't. It's an entirely new map that is as large or larger than a lot of open world games. It's huge. It's essentially a sequel. The only reason why I'd view it differently is because where Elden Ring is about 70-120+ hours, SotE is only around 40-60+ hours. But all of the other FromSoft Soulsborne games fall into the 30-40 hours to beat length. SotE is larger than any of those games. Yet, people like you dismiss it as just some 'additional content"".",0

Age of Empires IV,546,[deleted],85
Age of Empires IV,546,Oooh. If they could just redo Age of Mythology I'd need to constantly change my underwear.,58
Age of Empires IV,546,AoE2 definitive edition came out yesterday I believe. Fairly significant graphics update though nothing like this of course,20
Age of Empires IV,546,Gotta admit I thought they threw that IP down the crapper after the miserable failure that was Age of Empires Online,8
Age of Empires IV,546,Thanks for the share! I hope I can have infants on trikes with guns in this one.,7
Age of Empires IV,546,[You can see Gameplay Reveal here](https://youtu.be/rAbI0fewc7w),16
Age of Empires IV,546,Wululu your horses are mine now,10
Age of Empires IV,546,"It's ironic. The game is about moving through the ages. And yet it's players are stuck in the past, trying to relive nostalgia from the 2nd game over and over again trying to recapture that feeling they got when they were a kid. But they will never quite get that feeling again.

This game does look good tho.",5
Age of Empires IV,546,Super excited about this!!  Wonder how they are going to advance from 3.,2

Age of Empires IV,546,I started my gaming with age of empires 1 demo which came with windows xp i think. I am not sure but holy shit that game changed everything. My love for mediaeval started with aoe2 though. Those were the days. I don't get that kind of satisfaction with current games. I have been trying to find age of empires like rts game since last 20 years without success. I loved battle for middle Earth 2 which was surprisingly good. Other than that nada.,2
Age of Empires IV,546,"I just want something like a new Empire Earth. I like the idea of progressing all the way from stone-age to space-age. And I'm not even that much into RTS xD

Theres Civ I guess, which is okay to play at times, but has its own issues too.",2

Age of Empires IV,546,"It's a real-time strategy game, so mostly geared towards PvP, however there's a number of single-player campaigns and you can always play against AI.",0
Age of Empires IV,546,i second this,7
Age of Empires IV,546,The movie is great for entertainment but very historically inaccurate.,6
Age of Empires IV,546,I want a sequel with proper graphics and updates!,12
Age of Empires IV,546,heard the china expansion was kind of trash.,7
Age of Empires IV,546,I own it on steam but when I try to play it crashes like 2 seconds after I click it. :( I can't figure it out. Just spent another hour today trying to fix it.,1
Age of Empires IV,546,"AoE III was phenomenal, holy crap it was beautiful when it came out.

Rubble from stone walls killing people etc...",9
Age of Empires IV,546,"Agreed.

Looks like one of those ""made in-engine"" cutscenes, rather than gameplay. Imagine issuing a command to have a single horse patrol the outside of your castle walls, while also issuing an order for a single guard to patrol on top of them? Yeesh!",28
Age of Empires IV,546,"It's possible that a game like that can be done. More so that it is Relic Studios who made Company of Heroes. Now Company of Heroes was made by some guys who left and weren't around for Company of Heroes 2 and around that time Relic had gone down hill. Leading to Dawn of War 3 which was extremely tragic.


So...Yes it is possible that the trailer features some things that involve gameplay. That gameplay is possible. It's more beleivable because Relic Studios are behind it. It's not beleivable because the guys who made Relic Studios special aren't around unless they get new talent. It's also not beleivable because the trailer doesn't show any interface or stuff like that. 


The unit animations and landscapes are probably right. But maybe how the bases look are a complete fabrication. Maybe no bases that have walls connecting to forts. Might not even have units that can mount walls and run along them. But in 2006 a game called Black and White 2 allowed you to do that.


It's sad that alot of games today are outdone by games between 2000-2010 in terms of features.",2
Age of Empires IV,546,"XBOX is how Microsoft brands their game store, both XBOX and windows",3
Age of Empires IV,546,"Yea I loved the games, and battle for middle earth was a masterpiece I think. I get angry when I think of how forgotten RTS games are now and how much of the community has hurt the genre by not accepting anything brand new or certain titles. 

Maybe if and when people get tired of shooters and battle royales or when they get older and lose the reflexes they will want more RTS's again.",1
Age of Empires IV,546,"Only problem is i'm a university student now, and i don't even have time to play other games. Plus i'm not that good at the game and used cheats a bunch ð (in single player of course)",1

Age of Empires IV,546,It absolutely was,9
Age of Empires IV,546,"> Rubble from stone walls killing people etc...

uuhhh I don't remember that, really?

It was really beatiful though, with all options on high, using artillery on the enemy was just amazing to watch.",3
Age of Empires IV,546,"Isn't AoE III the one where you had to grind every single civ in order to be viable to play competitively?  


Edit: Yes it was... I didn't like it.",2
Age of Empires IV,546,Anno games look better than that so there's no reason to think it can't look like that.,5
Age of Empires IV,546,"On the stream it clearly showed ""Pre-Alpha footage"" so it will probably look like this or even better as it is polished. It does have a cinematic feel to it though which might not be on the game, but the gameplay itself should be there. It doesn't look like it is taxing on a console or PC at this level so no reason to cut back.",-2
Age of Empires IV,546,What?  It looks exactly like what you can expect from game play of the game.,-5
Age of Empires IV,546,"Huh, TIL.",3
Age of Empires IV,546,"Oh I don't play either (fellow trash-tier here), I just tune in to the occasional stream or youtube video to see how the pros do it! :)",1

Age of Empires IV,546,"Yeah, I remember it because I had a potato PC at first but when I upgraded it I could see boulders falling off, squashing enemies. 

Of course it could have been a coincidence, and happened plenty of times.",1
Age of Empires IV,546,"god yes, that was annoying. I still did it, took all my main civs to level 50+, felt p good. Would not do it again.",1
Age of Empires IV,546,"It's not really the graphics, but the gameplay that makes it seem like it isn't gameplay.",1

Age of Empires IV,546,"I don't cuz my internet doesn't even allow for live streams in the first place ð

Age of Empires IV,546,Tell that to Kratos.,1
Age of Empires IV,546,"Not to mention the embarrassing Warcraft 3 ripoff of having a single powerful ""hero"" character with abilities, etc rather than just a scout",1
Age of Empires IV,546,"It is gameplay, just on a very early build. Not sure why people downvoted me. It was on the live stream on mixer.",2
Age of Empires IV,546,"Check out T90Official on youtube for some pretty good commentary, pro games are usually 20-30min per match",1
Age of Empires IV,546,I'm so sorry to hear that.,2
Age of Empires IV,546,"I really don't think we will see a fight ingame like they presented it, I think that's peoples issue with calling it gameplay.",9
Age of Empires IV,546,"Oh wow that's pretty short actually.

I remember back in the day i'd play Vs bots on easy difficulty and would just make farms that span the entire map (well until i reach population limit at least). Each game would take like 2 hours ð",1
Age of Empires IV,546,"Agreed. It had too much cinematic flair to it. The assets might be in-game and everything and the battles might be like that, or not, it was pre-alpha footage in-game. So it could go both ways. A more traditional camera angle would probably represent what the battles will be like. Still gorgeous and can't wait for it. Currently enjoying AoE 2 all over again",2
Age of Empires IV,546,"Yeah me too. And games definitely get to that stage with pros too, it's just that it takes them about 40 minutes. Then after all the gold has been scraped off the map and all the paladin armies have killed each other, it's just a matter of who can spam more pikemen faster, lol",1
Age of Empires IV,546,Loool yeah i remember they're so cheap to make you just have to build tons of barracks and spam train pikemen and send them to the battlefield until one of the players runs out of wood (and i think the other resource was stone?

"If you could only play one video game for the rest of your life, which game would you choose?",169,"If I had to settle into the vast expanse of a single game for eternity, I'd find solace in the gritty, unpredictable world of DayZ. It's not just a game; it's a testament to survival, community, and the unpredictability of human nature. In a realm where every encounter is a story waiting to unfold, and every decision holds weight, DayZ offers a unique blend of tension, camaraderie, and adventure.

And in the realm of community servers, like our humble abode at Sweet Home Kamyshovo, the experience is elevated even further. It's a place where newcomers are welcomed with open arms, where seasoned survivors impart their wisdom, and where the line between friend and family blurs into insignificance. I think Minecraft, DayZ, those 'sandbox' servers, are infinite. That's my opinion.",2

It's an open world game with a decent enough single-player story. Outside of that, the multiplayer has tons to do. You have tons of jobs and heists. You have both rockstar and user created races. Other game modes like team death matches and what is essentially capture the flag. Plus, there are a ton of other weird ""adversary"" modes that you can have fun with friends playing.

I'd pick Guild Wars 2. It has enough classes and builds to rotate through so that by the time you get bored of your last class, you would have forgotten how to play first.

The math wizards have calculated that it'd take like 80-100 years of the most efficient playing (straight through no breaks) to recieve every 3rd age drop on rate. Not accounting for being unlucky.

"If you could only play one video game for the rest of your life, which game would you choose?",169,"The game is designed as a Skinner box. Your first couple levels come super easily and hit the reward centers of your brain very quickly. Each level after takes more and more time to hit, so that reward comes less often. If your brain is prone to addiction, you crave that hit when you level up and the game flashes and makes celebratory noises. 

You get the same boost when you get a new weapon or piece of armor that makes your character x% stronger. It's never enough though, there's always something more powerful that you need to get better gear or level up to beat. 

It sounds silly if you've never been on the MMO train, but it's very easy to get addicted to the power level increase treadmill.",32
"If you could only play one video game for the rest of your life, which game would you choose?",169,"It gives your brain a chemical sense of progression and accomplishment that would otherwise only be possible in the real world. Lots of kids feeling like their lives aren't going anywhere, or feel like they're a disappointment, or aren't capable of great things, end up being sucked into a virtual world where they can get that sweet armor or that sweet rare mount that the other kids don't have - Making them feel superior to the other players, like how having an expensive Bugatti must feel driving through traffic with the plebs.

It also has to do with WoW being an excellently crafted world, with a great musical score that just feels better than what most people are exposed to in the real world.

Add to that that it's very social, and being in a guild, working as a team, accomplishing tasks as a group, and having people depend on you, gives a real sense of family.

The combination of sense of community/family, visual/audio stimulation, and the virtual reward of climbing a hierarchy = everything human beings are driven by IRL to be better humans, but in the form of a video game.",1
"If you could only play one video game for the rest of your life, which game would you choose?",169,People have given you some technical answers but I'll also answer that the game is often just genuinely good. It was obviously way ahead of it's time in a lot of ways and there's a lot of good content. People have great memories raiding or pvping or completing certain sections of the story in certain eras. In addition to it being designed to be addicting it was also a genuinely good game as well and set the standard for MMORPGs that was never really matched elsewhere although some games have arguably surpassed it at least in some ways.,1

Take a seat and play through your stash of money. Don't go get more money once you're out... But do stand up and look around again.

You'll see those same people you saw when you came in, and you'll have a deeper understanding of why they are still there... And... You'll probably have a tingle in the back of your brain. Fear that tingle. It's the call of the slots to the ATM for another hit.",1

In no way I'm I bashing against the game. I have no problems with WOW. I think there is just something missing from my brain because I don't get that addiction feeling from it. I tried it and it genuinely was just not interesting to me. But I guess people could say the same thing about the games I like. What makes them addicting to me? And truthfully I have no idea. It makes no sense why I don't like a game like WOW but I enjoy games like Valheim which are also very grindy.",1

Probably no surprise that I havenât played WoW since cataclysm then. 

I had thought it was just an element of growing up and maturing, and assumed everyone changed and cared less about loot. Then I played Classic wow when that came out and saw how batshit crazy even 35 year old adults were going over the same loot we already had gotten 15 years earlier. It blew my mind. 

I did not feel like I had a place in WoW anymore after that. I was REALLY looking forward to Classic through wotlk too!",1

"If you could only play one video game for the rest of your life, which game would you choose?",169,"Absolutely, unfortunately It goes so much deeper than this. I was addicted to playstation 2 everquest in highschool and black desert online recently, but I have a cousin that's been consistently addicted since WOW's release when we were in highschool. We were really close when we were kids. I still remember being on college break visiting him and seeing the log in screen for his wow with a full screen of max level characters. IÂ  think it was whenÂ  lich king was the current expansion, but at that point I knew it wasÂ  really bad and really sad. It's gone on for so long since then that it's his existence. Â Essentially he started and never stopped.Â 


Â I'll give him a ton of credit for working at the same grocery store for 20 years, the man had every advantage, butÂ he just loved WOW.Â  There is a ton of dignity in holding a job consistently for 20 years.Â it's admirable and can never be taken from him, but he's disgustingly ungroomed and has never had a girlfriend.Â  this year he moved in with his mom becauseÂ  his long term rental propertyÂ  was condemned. He hasn't had heat or AC in years,Â  it smells from the sidewalk, and no one has been inside.Â 


Â Ben I love you man. At Easter dinner I asked your dad if i should bring you a plate at work, like you always are, on every holiday, and he looked at me and just exhaled.Â Â Â

"Crusader Kings III, Age of Empires IV or F1Â® Manager 2022 which one should i get?",1,"HoI and CK are very similar but differ in purpose. While both are strategy games, the purpose of CK isn't just to conquer as much territory as possible, but create the strongest dynasty. In that purpose, the game makes you role play as the head of your house. This can be interesting or unique when your character dies and your hier takes over. 

In medieval times, if a landed noble dies, their assets are divided up and given to the next in line to inherit. That land may not even be the same country that you were controlling, meaning that the focus of the game is less about making a strong country, but creating a political situation where the members of your house are secure, which often means making a strong country but could also mean marrying into your neighbor's family and making their heir's baby a part of your house, effectively taking over their territory. 

There is also a stronger focus one roleplaying as an individual -- the current head of the house. You don't control your territory, you control the head of the house, and there are many events that occur during the game that are specific to your dude or dudette.

So that's what makes CK a bit of an outlier to the other Paradox grand strategy games. That and CK3 doesn't have $500 of DLC yet.

Wow that was really long. Managed to write it all during my restroom break tho ð.",5

Throwback to one of the most iconic RTS games in videogame history. (In celebration of Age of Empires IV coming sometime in 2019),45,"Yeah. While making halo wars they were also planning on making a Halo MMO. However Microsoft scrapped the idea and had them lay off anybody who wasn't essential to the success of halo wars. Before Halo Wars even came out the company announced it would be closed.

Afterwards most of the employees of Ensemble went and made several independent studios. All of which are pretty unsuccessful except one which really only makes mobile games now.",1

"Age Of Empires IV, soon?",26,"Normally, I would agree with everything you just said. The game however, took a very dramatic turn away from it's predecessors in  looks, functionality, and play style. It was a completely different game. moral of the story, if it ain't broke don't fix it. They could have literally changed the starting age and ethnic options to select from(like they did for AoE 2 so in 3 basically less Indian tribes than 2 had etc) and I'm pretty sure the world would have been fine.

"Age Of Empires IV, soon?",26,"The game's basics were still the same. Same resources, same tech-up, same general approach. The issue stemmed more from the Home City dynamic (which i frankly thought was brilliant, and helped make the game feel like you were part of an Empire, instead of a dinky little town) and the fact the game focused more on ranged combat (you know, being the age of gunpowder and all).   


Though i'll admit to being biased, as i thought the game was brilliant, and enjoyed it far more than either of the previous games. ",3

I liked aoe3 because it felt like an aoe game but different enough from the first few to stand on it's own. I liked the many different things they added and how they streamlined some others. For example the card system was a good new twist to the playstyle of not only each race but diversify how you could approach playing them.",3

I have been playing games for nearly two decades and this game is probably in my top 20 of all time. I know not everyone is like me, but I loved it.

The unforgiving open world truly does allow you to approach a situation in any way you please (something developers often promise, but fail to live up to). Add to that a number of immersive systems including ingenious/gruesome health management, an in game mapping style, and a well implemented buddy system, and you have one of the most unique shooters around.

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"**[Driver: San Francisco](http://store.steampowered.com/app/33440/)** - this is a great open-world driving game with an interesting mechanic that allows you to switch from car to car without having to get out and try to chase down a car you want a la GTA. There's a variety of missions, checkpoints, straight up races, escorts, etc. even one where you have to drive a semi truck while being chased. All of the cars (except the heavy trucks) are real-world and modeled very nicely. Need speed? Corvettes, Chargers, GT-Rs, Lamborghinis, Zondas, etc. Need to plow somebody off the road? Find a GMC C5500 or a Dodge Ram 3500. I would recommend it to anybody that's a fan of arcadey driving games.

The Deluxe edition includes a few extra cars and a few other single player challenges (from Ubisoft website):

> 4 new challenges in Single Player: Mass Chase, Russian Hills, Relay Race and Taxi
> 3 legendary cars in Multiplayer: Aston Martin D85 - 1963, Lamborghini Miura - 1972 and Shelby Cobra 427 - 1966

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Hidden Gem On Sale(50% off): Defy Gravity Extended $1.49/Â£0.92

I am the lead developer and it is currently marked way down for the Summer sale.

Defy Gravity is a unique action/puzzle platformer. Our focus is 100% on great gameplay and it has that in spades. I have never heard of a game quite like it(and as a game developer, I play a lot of games)

I'd love to answer any questions you guys have about Defy Gravity.

http://store.steampowered.com/app/96100/

TotalBiscuit covered Defy Gravity Extended here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H28lW5WE6dk

It got pretty good reviews in the 8-9 range, which is pretty impressive since the graphics are so plain.  Like I said though, it is all about the gameplay(But the music is pretty good as well).",66
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Now THAT is a great Indie bundle.  Zeno Clash, Jamestown, and VVVVVV are all really great.  First bundle I've felt is a steal at $10.  

Had a ton of fun playing Zeno Clash.  If you like really bizarre, unique games this is an enjoyable ~6 hours.  People complain about the voice acting but I thought it just made the game even more hilarious.  And there is a sequel so you can catch up on the limited story the game provides.  I really enjoyed the combat. It is really melee heavy so you spend most of the time kicking bizarre anthropomorphized animals into submission.  Ragdoll physics make for some hilarious moments with enemies flying around.  I thought the art direction was great too.  Really interesting and varied locations and scenery.  Enemies are somewhat repetitive but the game is just short enough that it doesn't really drag.  For essentially $2 this is awesome.

Jamestown exceeded my expectations.  I generally do not enjoy games like this, but I found Jamestown to be a lot of fun considering it's a top down shooter.  I never was able to beat it though.  At a certain point in the game, the difficulty spikes pretty dramatically and I was never able to progress past the second to last level.  The game features co-op for up to 4 players and I played a little with my friends.  It made the game a little more fun, but the single player experience is just as entertaining.  Music and interface are all great.  Game looks good and plays quite well.  

VVVVVV is awesome as well.  Game is REALLY tough at points but there is a good checkpoint system.  Definitely worth a play if you like tough platformers ala SMB.  The gravity ""jump"" mechanic makes it unique and a little different to play as far as platformers go.  ",9

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Red Orchestra 2. My friend says it bad. Should I buy it?,3

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Hang on, I just realized Crysis and Dragon Age are back on Steam. I thought EA said they were the first games to be Origin exclusives and from then on none of their games would be on Steam?

Are they back a limited time just for the sale, or permently?",3

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,I'd like to thank you again for all your work! It really helped me make smart decisions in this sale!,9
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"They need to stop putting games like Dungeon Defenders and Magicka on the Daily Deal. We get it. They're great games. However, we've had them on 75% off at least 2-3 times already. Give some other games a chance.",8
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I can not recommend Red Orchestra 2 enough now. It has massively improved since the rather disastrous release it had.

Also for version if you play Action or Realism the Deluxe version is the best, Same if you play Killing Floor or TF2 as some free goodies as well. ",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Please please pleaseeeeee give VVVVVV a shot if you haven't already. It's charming, difficult, and has the best indie game soundtrack this side of Bastion. Probably the best game I bought from last year's summer sale. ",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I'm a huge fan of the first 2 Splinter Cell games. Should I get Conviction?

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I want a good FPS game and currently Crysis and Deus Ex: Human Revolution are both on sale. Crysis is alittle bit cheaper but a few years older and i cannot decide which one i want, any suggestions about which game to buy would be a big help! I also do not know much about each of the campaigns but i like long, nicely designed campaigns that take more than a few days to beat.

P.S- total noob question but i currently have a i5 dual core processor and for Deus Ex: Human Revolution it recommends a intel core 2 quad or better processor. Is the i5 better or worse? and by how much?",2

It had a very buggy launch, but it's been patched up now and runs fine, in addition to getting some free DLC a month or two ago. It has some of the most intense action I can think of. Do yourself a favor a pick it up.",1

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Dungeon Defenders weaves (admittedly watered-down) World Of Warcraft-like gameplay with varied tower defense elements.  If you won't be playing online, you may as well stop here.  It's infinitely more fun than single-player.  If you will be playing online, know that all classes bring different kinds of towers to the table, and you can use many heroes in the same game, just not at the same time.  Great online co-op fun, if you ever thought that WoW should have tower defense.  And it's cheap too, for a lot of content.",1

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Is Crysis 2 worth is if I wanted a mindless COD variant to play online? I'm thinking probably not, but how populated is the MP and are they still dealing with hackers and such? ",1

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Aw man... I'm so tempted on Dungeon Defenders. Especially the 4-pack for my friends and husband. But I don't get paid until next Monday so I'm done buying games for now. Bummer.,2

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Are the Flash Deals/Community Deals new features for this year's sale? I feel like the sale is a little over-saturated with deals for the amount of time it's intended to run. Yesterday's and today's daily deals both had a lot of repeat sales and I think Limbo is on sale for the 3rd time now. Not that repeats are a bad thing necessarily since sometimes people miss the first discount, but with this many of them it kind of feels like they're wasting opportunities to put new games on sale.",1

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"First they started not bothering to mention the Badges. Now they aren't even bothering with the backstory to each picture. Have to say, the whole reason these sales were enjoyable, was that they actually involved the comsumer beyond just ""Oh, they put this game up for cheap, I think I will buy that"". This is just a sale, and a rather boring one at that, compared to the spectacle that we are used to being given by Valve when it comes to things like this.

Gotta say. Very disappointed.",-3

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I've hit the 10000 character limit, so I'll just speak briefly about the other two games I wanted to talk about:

I loved the *first* **[Fear game](http://store.steampowered.com/app/21100/)**, but my understanding is that the games have been getting steadily worse since then. With the wealth of great FPS titles available today, F3AR is probably skippable.

**[The Crysis Franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/15609/)** is probably the game to get today, if you're looking for a single player FPS experience. I unfortunately haven't had a chance to play these yet, but they come highly recommended from Reddit in past sales. If you want a new FPS, these will probably serve you well.

Those are all the games I've played / have comments on for today. Unfortunately, I am likely unable to post tomorrow, aside from possibly the Indie Game write ups I can do ahead of time.",37
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I want to defend Civ V. It wasn't released in the most polished state (though, incidentally, neither was Civ IV). However, various patches and expansions have turned it into one of the strongest 4X games out there today.

They made a conscious effort with Civ V to iron out some of the flaws that have always plagued the Civilization series. ALL victory conditions (domination, cultural, diplomatic, etc.) are now viable, so you don't have to just default to a science victory once you've crushed most of your enemies. Naval combat is (finally) amazing. Combat between empires is no longer decided by throwing one large stack of units at another large stack of units and seeing which stack comes out on top. Due to global happiness and social policies, small empires can now effectively compete with large empires. The Gods & Kings expansion has added a lot to the game, and as a longtime Civ fan I would strongly recommend V over IV. It won't just consume you for a couple of games - I've spent well over 150 hours on the game, and I still keep coming back for more.

Check out the other reviews on /r/civ if you want additional feedback.",87
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Jamestown is so fucking cool. The music is incredible.,15
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I've played through and 100-percented VVVVVV multiple times. It's a game that I play now to relax myself, though it can initially be really challenging to wrap your mind around. The graphics are charming, the music is amazing, the story is simple but effective, and there's just a lot of content packed in there. If you're up for a platforming challenge, VVVVVV is one of the best you can find. For $2.49, it's an instant buy.",8
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"What is the best ""Metroidvania/Contra"" game out there?  I'm kind of new to steam but that's my favorite kind of game",7
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I would extremely recommend Revenge of the Titans and VVVVVV and Jamestown. Then again out of this pack those are the only ones I own.

Revenge of the Titans gets extremely hard and I love it. It is one of my favorite games in my Steam library and there is so much I love about it. Like blindsight said, you must use your towers to defend each other and your base. The difference between this tower defense game and others is that the bad guys come from every direction, and not a singular path. The game is difficult enough that you will lose levels until you learn what works against most enemies.

VVVVVV is a puzzle platformer game. I guess I would compare it to a Mario game that can change gravity and most of the floors can kill you. The whole game is based around solving these puzzles by switching gravity. It is a wonderful game with excellent 8 bit graphics and one I would recommend.",7

EDIT: If you have friends to play with you I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun. The 4-pack deal is pretty good.

EDIT 2: I should also add that I got hooked onto this game for ""157.6 hrs on record"" - without DLCs. Now that I have the DLCs, I think I'll continue playing to get 100% achievements (currently on 70%).",4

Overall it is a VERY immersive game that, if you gain some familiarity, is quite rewarding. Until you reach that level, or if you're not into super hardcore (think ARMA) mechanics, the game can be very frustrating. For that price, however, it's worth a shot.",7
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Red Orchestra is a great game. Sure it had a bumpy start, but so do all of Tripwire games. KF was a mess when it launched. RO1 wasn't that is because it was a mod for years beforehand. 

If you enjoy multiplayer FPS games then YES BUY IT! It has a bunch of modes so if you enjoy hardcore gameplay you can play Realism/Classic mode and if you want more of a COD style game they have Firefight/Action which have no class limits, quicker movement, less realism. So yeah if you enjoyed the first one don't think twice just buy it. If you didn't enjoy it or have no experience with RO then you will probably find something you like in this game with the new game modes.

It is not a perfect game...yet. The tanks are questionable still, and it has some silly bugs that haven't gone away yet, but it's only a matter of time. TWI has a long history of support for their games. For example Killing Floor just received another content update for the summer sale even though it came out in 2009. The game will only get better.

The playerbase is medium sized. You will not have an issue finding a game at any given time of the day. It will get bigger as the game ages, and mods more content is added.

The custom maps are starting to flow. I think five or six have already been released, and the dev's are hosting a mapping contest which will bring out some good maps. The mods are progressing as well. The Pacific mod appears to be in closed beta. I saw a test server in the browser the other day. Made me giddy to see it. 

They haven't exactly said what the plans are for RO but they have mentioned adding new tanks, half tracks, weapons, and co op in the future. 

The game runs on UE3 and has been optimized a lot since released. 



tl:dr GET THIS GAME!",13
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"It is amazing! The game is absolutely tense, I had a saving private ryan moment. Remember when near the end two soldiers faced each other out of the blue and they both shot their rifles and missed then struggled to pull out their sidearms and eventually throwing their helmets and each other. Similar, I faced a german soldier and shot first, I missed and thought that I was dead for sure (1 shot kills most of the time in this game). He shot and to my surprise missed also. There was that surprise while my guy loaded the next bullet into the chamber, I took an extra split second to make sure I would hit him, pulled the trigger. And just collapsed back into my chair with the relief and satisfaction that I am still alive.",7
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"RO2 has an incredibly authentic feel to it and has quite a bit of realism to it, but is NOT near the complexity of war simulators such as ArmA or naval sims. You hop in a server, pick your class, and fight over an objective or simply TDM if that's your style. The audio is very well done, weapons are authentic and have great feel to them, tanks are modeled farily realistic, the game is very gritty and bloody but in a realistic way (it doesn't try and glorify it IMO).

Coming from the original, which started as a mod for UT2k4 before they released it as a retail product, Tripwire Interactive is a proud supporter of mods and custom maps. They are currently doing map creation competitions and before the game even released they awarded certain teams very early access to the dev kit of the game to make, hopefully, some of the best FPS mods to date. They also developed Killing Floor which is an absolutely fantastic multiplayer horror shooter, which too gets frequent updates and patches.

The singleplayer isn't really worth your time besides familiarizing yourself with the controls, don't get this unless you enjoy playing online. The controls can feel a bit different compared to other shooters, but it is much better than the fairly clunky controls the first RO had. That said, you will probably get your ass handed to you when you first play as RO1 developed a pretty big hardcore community which followed into Heroes of Stalingrad. They recently added different modes, one of which makes the game more paced like Call of Duty (arcade mode), another more like the original RO (called Classic mode), and of course the standard mode that RO2 released on allowing you to pick one you feel like playing.",5

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I'll add my opinion:

Far Cry 2 isn't a great game. Its open world, although very beautiful, feels very empty as there isn't much to do. You'll spend most of your time travelling from point A to point B. Be prepared to do a lot of travelling! The AI isn't as good as the developers promised before releasing the game.

However, it's still a nice game that tries to be more realistic than the average shooter, while encouraging you to get creative on how to approach your enemies. For the price, I'd say grab it if you like the setting and open world FPSes. I personally played it for about 8 hours before getting bored, but I really did enjoy these 8 hours.

",37
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"For $2.50... Get it, you can get at least a few hours of enjoyment out of it. But don't get your hopes up just because you enjoyed Far Cry 1. This game had amazing potential but comes up very very short. Here's some bad points about the game:

* The story DOES NOT MATTER. You won't play this game for the story. Without spoiling anything for you (fuck I don't even remember enough of the spoil anyway), you won't care about the story by the end. It's more of an in-the-moment type of game. 

* Getting Malaria medicine becomes a total chore. The game constant forces you to drop what you are doing to get malaria medication. And it's always the same old thing when you get the medication. You drive for five minutes, kill a few guys, and get the medicine, then drive five minutes back to where you were. By the time you get back, you're half way through your medication supply and the cycle just continues.

* As has been mentioned, there is a lot of traveling in this game. There's also check points EVERYWHERE. The checkpoint battles are all the same, and it becomes another chore you have to do. Imagine playing GTA4, and having police checkpoints every other block. You can't just drive past because you'll get shot to death (on hard difficulty), so you have to stop, get out, and kill them one by one. It's fun the first 3 times and with different weapons, but every battle is always the same and it just becomes a total pain the ass. They also respawn super fast so as soon as you drive past their corpses, they've probably respawned already.",9

The only benefit to owning ""Ostfront"" (original) that I can see is the existing mods. You can save yourself a bit of cash by getting the original instead of HoS if you're not sure you'll like it, but the price difference is almost nothing.

The digital deluxe includes vanity items for OTHER games, so decide for yourself if a couple of hats are worth it. Part of the DD pack's appeal was the early access beta, but that's over. As for the weapons, those are just day-one unlocks, which you'll unlock eventually over time anyway. Buy HoS, play it for a bit, if you really enjoy it then you can grab the DD upgrade for the weapon unlocks (or see for yourself if you find them necessary).

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Post shamelessly stolen from [theirfour](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/wvq7c/steam_summer_sale_day_09_20120720/c5gv7vc) from the /r/games thread:

>Shout out to **Driver: San Francisco**.
>
>Here's what you need to know: it's an open-world driving/racing game set in (simplified) San Francisco. It also has the most ridiculous and strangely compelling story I've ever encountered in a game. Not just in a racing game, but in all the games I've played.
>
>It's great in a very pseudo-serious sci-fi special kind of way. The main plot revolves around your character being injured and discovering that he can ""shift"" to other drivers in other cars and control them. This means that, for most of the game, you can press a button and the game will go into a bird's-eye view where you can float around and pick another car to begin driving. You can use it to get around, but the game will also have you doing missions where the mechanic is used in more novel ways (taking down a car by shifting into traffic on the other side of the street and forcing a head-on collision, for example).
>
>What I really appreciated about the game was how the developers stuck to their guns. The plot isn't secondary (as it is in most racing games), and it entirely revolves around and utilizes the shift mechanic that they developed. I plowed through the campaign, eager to see what other tricks the developers had up their sleeves and how the hokey, overblown storyline would end up resolving itself (which it does decently well).
>
>Anyway, the long and short of it is that it's well worth $7.50. You can find games with better pure racing experiences (e.g. Burnout Paradise), but you won't find another narrative-driven magical realism driving experience outside of this game.

I'll add that it has some *great* incidental dialogue from the passengers you'll sometimes find sitting beside you. Some examples of the characters you'll meet are Facebook Girl being driven around by one of her gurlfrienz (""Like, OH-EM-GEE""), a woman with her senile mother, a guy driving around with his divorce lawyer (*crash* ""Eh, the car's going to your wife anyway""), two brothers from India looking for some excitement, and my favourite so far, a grandfather that let his little granddaughter drive his tow-truck on ""Bring Your Granddaughter to Work Day"", with dialogue like this:  

>*Upon drifting around a corner* ""Have you been practicing, buttercup?"" 

>*While being chased by the police* ""Pop-pop didn't bring any doughnuts to use as a bribe, do you have any candy, sweetheart?"" and ""This is how my day usually *ends*. If you can evade the police, pop-pop will buy you an icecream!""  

>*Drifting again* ""It's like watching your babysteps all over again"" 

>*Bumping into someone* ""Oh, I do it all the time if I don't feel like braking"" 

>*Full on crash* ""Now see, this is why you want a company car."" 

>*more drifting* ""You always were my favourite grandchild. Just don't tell your cousins"". 

>And a good quote from Tanner (player character): ""I'm trying to lose the cops here, so you think you could stop pinching my cheeks!?""

A year or so later, I read [this article: How to Have Fun Playing Far Cry 2](http://majorslack.com/games-tips-tricks/having-fun-playing-far-cry-2/). It was a revelation, I restarted the game from the beginning.


In my opinion Far Cry 2 is outright one the very best game ever made, possibly the best in the genre. It is not about the story or the gameplay, it is about how the game make you feel playing it.  Far Cry 2 is not a shooter in the classic sense, it is an experience in desperation, futility and death.

The actual gameplay, which is the shooting and driving, is pretty average, but FC2 is one of the most atmospheric and immersive games I've ever played. Even though there's not a whole lot to do in it, FC2 has a great open world. It really is more than the sum of its parts.",13

Far Cry 2 is an open-world FPS that tries to be relatively realistic and hard (it isn't really). There are no fighter jets, helicopters, fast cars or great guns. This isn't GTA or Just Cause, here you have to plan your attacks carefully. Also, you'll spend most of your time travelling around the map instead of blowing stuff up. Personally, I enjoyed Far Cry 2 and played it for like 8 hours before getting bored. For this price, I'd say grab it.

Of course, it has it's downsides too. It's *extremely* repetitive (although for only $2.50 at least you didn't waste full price), the buddy system had potential but is extremely shallow, the story makes no sense, enemies respawn at guard posts every single time, among other things.",2

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"This is the main argument about either game:

CIV IV: Some say that it has more depth, as it has had espionage and religion well before V did, but it also contains slightly more nuanced things to micro-manage such as the health of your cities and creating corporations. Diplomacy also makes slightly more sense.

CIV V: It's prettier and easier to understand. It uses hexes instead of squares, which is a huge improvement in my opinion, plus you cannot stack 50 units onto one tile like in IV, lovingly called the ""stack of doom"". V features more strategy when it comes to military conflict as a result. It just works better, makes more sense, and you don't have a huge stack of doom assaulting your cities. Health and corporations are absent from the game however, so there is slightly less depth. Not enough to hurt it in my opinion. 

If you're a real nut about these kinds of games, I would tell you to get both. If you're not, or are just interested and want to try the CIV experience, get V.

As far as expansions go, you really need to have them all for IV. For V, Gods and Kings is also really needed as it adds a lot to the game that was previously missing. The extra civilization DLCs are also nice, and the wonders one as well, but I would recommend getting them while they're cheap.

I hope it helps!",5
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Get Civ V. Here are a few differences I remember:

* Tiles are now hexagons instead of squares.
* New 3D engine.
* The combat system has changed a lot.
* No espionage or religion.
* City states introduced.",6
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Civ V. I've played Civ III, IV and V (with all expansions) and if you have not played any of these I would recommend Civ V. Many in /r/civ seem to have a similar opinion.",7
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"It depends on what level of depth you want to play. Civ 5's is very flawed and short-sighted if you go deep enough, but straightforward and novel otherwise. Civ 4 sometimes is very obtuse and not exactly intuitive, but is much more balanced and has core mechanics that work much better in the end.

Basically, get Civ 5 if you just want a casual but still strategical empire-building experience, and Civ 4 if you want a ""serious"" and deep competitive strategy game.",3
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"It's a good game.  Worth that price.

Basically you fly around in a spaceship picking up weapon upgrades to advance through a huge maze.  You have enemies, bosses, little puzzles.  Fun.",7
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Its a really fun game. about 5-6 hours long. Its like a metroidvania type of game but in a twin stick shooter way. Definitely worth it for the price.,5
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I would have been interested in opinions also, but I went ahead and clicked buy... couldn't help it.  Damn Steam.   The music tracks sound pretty awesome, and it looks like it could be epic.

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I almost instantly bought it simply because of Dimmu Borgir in the trailer, but I'm too wondering if the game is any good.",2

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"To anyone wondering: this game is fun, and worth the $1.49 in my opinion; just make sure you know going in that it's a very short game. As a speed runner (of a different game), I'm probably more skilled than the average gamer, so it may take you longer than it took me. I finished it in just under an hour, so it may take some people up to two hours, but I can't see it lasting much longer than that. After you beat the game, you have the option of playing again in a harder mode, but if you're like me, you probably won't be interested in doing so. Again, it's a fun little game for $1.49, but just don't expect to get much time out of it.",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Bought it the other day when it was on sale. I would have been happy to pay full price for it. Keep up the good work. ,1

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Crysis has an amazing first 3-4 hrs, a frustrating but beautiful anti gravity sequence, and a repetitive final few hours. Its easily worth it for the graphics and the fun game play until the aliens come into play. Warhead crams the same idea minus the anti grav into about 4-5 hrs total play time.",5
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I've played both of those and I'd say they're both at least moderately entertaining. The prices those two are at are definitely fair imo for the few hours or so you get out of the story mode. I played the crysis 2 multiplayer demo when it came out and it seemed kind of like a ripoff from cod (what fps multiplayer isn't now a days?), but it still was pretty fun. I really want to get Crysis 2 actually, but I'm pretty worried that no one plays online anymore.

Edit: Also bear in mind that a pretty huge aspect of these games is the graphic detail and physics",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I loved both. Plus, if you get both, you will be able to take a look at:

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Warhead runs better imo. Just in case you're afraid your computer can't handle it. I'd honestly get both games. The campaigns are short and the gameplay is awesome. I've played through some of Crysis 2 and I didn't enjoy it nearly as much. ,1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Both honestly. But if you had to pick one, get the original.",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Permanently (probably). There was a mix up with the DLC.  I think Crysis 2 had dlc that could not be purchased though steam, so they are selling it as maximum edition now so u get the dlc.",2

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Deus Ex: HR is a great title.  By far one of my favorite stealth games next to the Metal Gear series.  Can't say much on Splinter Cell, however.",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"You will get a lot more out of splinter cell, all of the games in the pack are amazing",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Honestly, Crysis 1 and Warhead are both fantastic, but so is Human Revolution.  They're all in my absolute favorites category, so if you can squeeze in getting them all I'd recommend it.  Crysis games are a bit more taxing on your graphics card IIRC though so keep that in mind.  They're all good for variety on multiple playthroughs, but I think Crysis would have more variety in terms of the stuff you can do between playthroughs because it's very sandboxy.  DXHR has a longer campaign though.  It's a really rough choice.  DXHR has a lot more resource management, Crysis is more about having all your awesome abilities accessible at any given time (that is, your suit battery recharges rather than getting stuck at a percentage of its possible ability like in DXHR).  Both have health regeneration to counteract the fact that if you are seen and shot you will die really fast.  I should note that Crysis is much more fun on a harder difficulty so you're forced to be properly stealthy.  DXHR has the better story and the whole branched decision element, Crysis is the sandbox style of branched explosion styles for how you choose to complete objectives.

goddammit just get both.  Crysis 2 is skippable for now if you're on a tight budget, regarded as too linear compared to the first games.",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,i5 will be just fine.,1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Not sure. I just got NFS:HP the other night and am working through the career mode right now. Super fun, super sexy graphics. And it's Criterion so it's definitely worth it. If you buy it, I'm looking for friends. sentry07 ingame.  
Edit: I also bought B:P recently. There seems to still be online activity, I've raced a few races with some people and they're never the same people. I've had some battles over the street times. The motorcycle add-on has definitely made this a game I'll keep playing.",2

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Crysis 1 and Warhead are absolute musts in my book.  People talk about the Crysis games for their looks, but their real draw is the open-world gameplay.  It should be played on the hardest difficulty with an emphasis on avoiding being seen.  Look up NanoSuitNinja on youtube to see it played properly.  Those two games are gloriously fun.

Crysis 2 was more linear.  I was never able to play it properly because I had a bug that stopped me from being able to save, but from what I understand it is fun, just not as good as the first two games.  At the price for the full pack though, I'd say go with it.",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"My friend hated on Crysis 2 for some reason, left chat before I could hear why. Some reviewers on metacritic say it was dumbed down from the original in terms of A.I. and level design. I went with Crysis 1 with DLC for 9 bucks.",1

Intel isn't listed anywhere, and typically Intel graphics tend to be integrated onto the motherboard and don't have their own dedicated memory, which can end in mixed results gaming-wise.

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,I actually enjoyed F3AR but I *must* strongly recommend playing the campaign co-op with a friend. Playing as Fettel is *extremely fun* and makes up for the cut corners and horribly re-used art assets that ruin most of the game. I thought the campaign story was decent enough. Haven't tried multiplayer. There's a lot to complain about but $5 is worth it for the Fettel body-swapping combat.  ,2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"FEAR was an absolutely amazing game, but short. FEAR2 was good as well, not scary at all, but the controls and graphics were much better, along with the addition of new weapons and the same amazing AI still makes it a good game, although it only took me 4 hours to beat it. Haven't played 3 yet",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Civ 5 got rid of backstabbing AIs with their ""oh, i've been your friend for millenia, but here's an out-of-the-blue declaration of war and an UNBEATABLE stack of 40 military units at your doorstep""

wars are more fun, the tiresome rushing for being the founder of as many religions as possible is gone, and as Daravon said, it's valid to have an empire with smaller but more developed cities (that's pretty much what Ghandi's racial dictates)

Also, cities now have their very own health bar and ranged attack, so you'll no longer HAVE to garrison one silly warrior in each city just so it won't be captured by some random roaming barbarian.",44
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I love me some Civ V, and I've played the Civ series since it started.

I always hated ""stacks of doom"" and the one-unit-per-tile rule makes war actually fun for me since it's not just using brute force.  G&K really fleshes it out and adds enough complexity that I can safely say it's as good as IV, just a bit different.

I'm about 210 hours into it, and 300 into IV, and while they are both great games I find myself playing V all the time now.",14
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Question for you: I haven't played any Civ game since Civ 2. Is it better playing Civ 5 for the first time with all of the expansions, or should I just try the base game first?",5
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I agree, Civ V has a bad reputation, but it is a solid game at this point. Yes, it had problems when it came out, and it still has some problems, but overall it's a pretty damn good game.

For people who haven't played either game, then here is a quick comparison of the strongest points on each one:

Ways Civ IV is better than V:

--The AI is more competent, both diplomatically and in terms of military.

--There are lots of little buttons and levers to press and pull, it's a micromanager's dream.

--Amazing modding community, including several total conversion mods which are just great.

--Better optimization, less lag.

----

Ways Civ V is (in my opinion) better than IV:

--One unit per tile. The game is much more rich tactically. Civ IV wars are basically ""I have 70 units in a stack and you have 50 units in a stack, I win!"" while war in V actually has unit placement, defending ranged units, etc as main concerns.  
(Note: This is why the AI in IV is better at the military game. The AI was great at understanding ""I need to stick 50 units in a tile,"" it is less-than-great at actual tactics.)

--Cities now defend themselves, in a manner far more realistic (and rewarding). In Civ IV, a city defended almost exactly as well as the units stationed inside of it. Did you forget to put a warrior in your capital? Oops, a single scout just conquered your civilization!

--Each individual Civilization has strong ""racial"" benefits. Civ IV had this to an extent, but it's **much** deeper and more pronounced in V. While Civ IV had *many* civilizations and a few bonuses spread between them, each Civ in V has a strong set of unique benefits that cannot otherwise be replicated.

--Better graphics.

--A better religion system. In Civ IV religion was basically just a reason for the AI to hate you (""I follow X, you follow Y, prepare to die now,"") religion in Civ V (G&K) is a really neat system where you build and customize a religion around a set of bonuses that you select.

--Better domination win mechanics. To win a military victory in V, all you need to do is take out the capital of every other civ. This is much less tedious/time consuming than the win condition in IV, which was to wipe out every city from every civ.

Anyway, I could go on about the virtues of each game for a while, but **tl;dr** I agree, Civ V is worth more credit than it currently gets. A lot more. Now, I'm not saying it's *clearly* better--each of those reasons I listed where IV is better is a *really big deal*. Still, it's not fair to say IV is clearly better than V.

ps, for those planning to buy Civ V+all DLC, but not the mega-bundle, be sure to pick up [this DLC](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/11092/?snr=1_5_9__403) which is not included in GotY.",4
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I started playing Civ with Civlization 3, which is one of my all time favorite games. Going straight from 3 to 5, 5 is amazing. The new warfare is amazing, cultural victories are viable, Gods and Kings adds religion and espionage, marathon mode is the perfect length. Everything about 5, I love.",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I've been wanting to pick up Civ V. I've never played a Civ game. But I'll admit it seems very boring in videos. The concept sounds great. But I'd feel it was more fun if it were multiplayer.

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Yes, but moving the units in Civ V is a pain in the ass. The Chess mechanics are nice, but I would like formations so I can mass move units.

Besides, stacks of doom are satisfying. And you can't exactly stack of doom in extended sieges of a city - you have to spread the army out around the city to deprave it of resources. Still, good points.",1

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Let's see if [this link](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/4158?snr=1_8_4__501) works. The pack is called ""Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Elite Echelon Edition""",3
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I disagree.  I thought the game was entertaining enough and the controls were fine for me.  It certainly wasn't the best Splinter Cell, but entertaining enough for me to play it twice.

BTW, I didn't downvote you for expressing your honest opinion. ",3
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Unless you unplug your ethernet cable it doesn't work (well) here, it freezes every minute for up to ten seconds and after pulling the cable the game runs smoothly.


I am waiting till tomorrow to see if the situation is better, otherwise I will ask for a refund. I am not planning to pull the ethernet cable every time I play.",3
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Ubisoft's UPlay has really improved in recent times, it's now basically the same as Steam or Origin: just add the game to your account (assuming the servers are working, which thanks to the Steam Sale, they probably currently aren't), and from then on, as long as you don't click ""Log out"", you're free to never go online again. Also comes with cloud saves.",4
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,I would turn off the cloud saves! They lost me about 4 hours of assassins creed 2 progress!,2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Anddd.....purchased.,1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I always like the dialogue with the police officer that starts: ""I was born a man,"" (this is said by a woman).",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"It's not a terribly accurate version of SF, but it certainly evokes the spirit of it. The 140 licensed cars are definitely nice, though.",3
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Is it worth getting the ""Deluxe"" version for the extra game modes and cars?",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Yeah, really just reiterating what sircannon said. The map is not very accurate at all. Don't buy it if you want to experience SF through a driving game, buy it because it's a pretty sweet game and one of the best driver games ever released. I had just moved to SF when I grabbed it thinking the map would be at least mostly there, for that reason it was super disappointing.",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Does it support Gamepads well? I can't imagine enjoying it TOO much with the arrow keys...,1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Why? Because it won't win, or because it's not a good game?",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,I just skimmed through this and it definitely sounds like my type of game. I really like the immersive experience types. Thanks for the link and the tips my friend.,2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,That article sold me on picking it up. Thanks for the read.,2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,that's funny. that's exactly how I played this game. I loved this game. ,1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Hardest difficulty level is ridiculously hard,5
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"This is true, I personally just went with the regular edition because I'm running out of money, I had $100 put aside for this sale and I'm not on my last $3.99. The DLC for Human Revolution with exception for The Missing Link doesn't seem overly interesting so I don't think I'll miss out by not owning them.",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,G&K adds espionage and religion back to the game.,6
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Really?  I thought the general concensus was that Civ IV pretty much mops the floor with Civ 5.  We all got V because we like the franchise, but I believe IV is the generally-accepted peak of the series. 
",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"ARGH...I just convinced myself to not buy the $25 package with both and all DLC, and after reading this, I want to try them both...DAMN YOU!

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Plus it's been ~5 dollars on numerous gaming sites for a long time now,2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Have you played 3? If so, would you say 1+2 are worth playing, even with the mass-hated ending? Is 3 worth playing?",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Except for Korea and Wonders of the Ancient World DLCs,2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,I can't find the game of the year edition you're speaking of. Do you have a link to it or is this a region specific thing? I'm in the US.,1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,I have Civ 5 already just not dlc. ,1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,I think so. It come out around June 20th so it's barely a month old. I'll be really surprised if it goes down lower than $20 in the next couple of months...,10
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Considering this is the third time it's been at that price, probably.  If you want a better price you'll probably have to wait until Christmas.",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,[deleted],1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"from what i have read, it adds back religion and espionage (but in different ways than they were in Civ 4).
",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,I can't think about civ 5 without adding in Gods and Kings features. I highly recommend it.,1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Get it. It adds Religion and Espionage, and changes quite a few features  from the base game.

Religion is different to how it's been done before. You gather faith, and once you have a certain amount you found a pantheon, and then later on you get a Great Prophet, who allows you to found a religion. This is when it gets interesting. You choose a symbol from ~10 real-world religions, and can name the religion anything you want. You then choose 3 beliefs, and can add 2 more later. There are a LOT to choose from.

Espionage is again very different. From the Renaissance Era onwards, you gain a spy per Tech era. These spies can be sent to other Civs cities to steal tech, or sent to City-States to rig elections to gain you favour, or placed within your own cities to attempt to stop other civs spies stealing your techs.

Other changes include adding in a few units, (Great War Infantry/airplane/bomber and Gatling/Machine Gun come to mind first) splitting Naval combat into Ranged and Melee, and adding another bucketload of Civs to play as.",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Debatable. You'll still grind along a bit slow on a large/huge map while in late game.

G&K's best perks are the new 100hp combat system (fixes the ""longbowmen killing a tank"" dilemma of past civs), and the religion system. ",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Thanks for your support!,2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Honestly I don't know but I can guess.  I figure it is either one of these two things or a combination of them.

1. We had a lot of positive reviews from indie review outlets.
2. The people at Steam played it and enjoyed the gameplay enough to greenlight it.

I don't really know though so that is just speculation. 

We applied and they said yes, there was no real back and forth about it.",6
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Thanks a bunch.  I didn't realize Steam was on phones now.  I guess I need to download it.,3

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"We have hotfixed pretty much every known error via commandline options.

Probably just -window will work.  If that looks weird do -720window which forces a 720p resolution window.  If -window is no go, -720window should fix it.

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Completely different experiences in my opinion.  Both are great but RO2 is the game I've sunk more time into.  Besides Day Z there is nothing that really draws me back into ARMA2.  While it can be fun it's just to damn clunky for me to play for extended periods and enjoy.  RO2 has come a long way since release though and is more fun than ever.  Tactical and realistic game play that relies on team play without being cumbersome. ,3
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Why not both? :) Pack a lunch/skip a coffee/eat Ramen/etc etc and drop the Lincoln for RO2.,1

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"My impression, though, is that Deus Ex fails when it comes to stealth as you are then *screwed* in boss fights.  (Stealth, by the way, was the reason I was considering Deus Ex.)

I think the majority of people already think it's at a fair price and just want to wait a few days to save a few bucks. If the price never drops it will still sell massively on the last day, everyone might get angry but they'll buy it.",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"point is. just about every game that has been a daily deal you haven't seen on a flash deal or community vote.

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Civ GOTY is only $5 more and includes All 4 Cradle of Civilization Map Packs (Mediterranean, Asia, Americas, Mesopotamia), Civilization Pack: Babylon (Nebuchadnezzar II), Double Civilization and Scenario Pack: Spain and Inca, Civilization and Scenario Pack: Polynesia, Civilization and Scenario Pack: Denmark - The Vikings, and Explorerâs Map Pack.

So for a poor college student (never played a civ before but used to love Age of Empires) is the GOTY version worth the $5 extra dollars",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,">Civ 5 got rid of backstabbing AIs with their ""oh, i've been your friend for millenia, but here's an out-of-the-blue declaration of war and an UNBEATABLE stack of 40 military units at your doorstep""
>

To be fair, the Civ 5 AI will still backstab the hell out of you. They just are less competent in terms of military tactics, so it's less dangerous.

Also, the backstabs are often predictable *if you pay attention and know what you are looking for*. Still, there's definitely code in the game where an enemy civ will intentionally pretend to be your friend just to lull you into a false sense of security.",2

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Most the DLC is just additional civilizations to play... but the newest expansion ""Gods & Kings"" adds quite a bit of new features.

I'd say load of any DLC and play that way if you got them.",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I've just started playing Civ and with 5 a lot of people recommend get the expansion so you don't have to learn to replay the game later with the changes.

Others recommend getting it when it's cheaper and then appreciating the changes. 

I'm doing the last, the choice is up to you.",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,I'd second the other comments and say that the Gods and Kings expansion really adds a lot to the game - I'd strongly recommend it. You can live without the DLC.,1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I'd get GotY. You can turn the DLC off if you want to experience the base game first, whereas if you wait to buy it then you won't be able to pick it all up at 75% off.

Honestly, none of the individual DLC adds very much to the game, but *at their current price point* they are very much worth buying. It's kind of like extra toppings on a pizza: a single extra topping isn't going to make or break a pizza, but if you're going to eat the same magic pizza for 200 hours then you probably want to pay an extra couple bucks for extra toppings.

Having said that, the expansion (Gods & Kings) is not 75% off, but it is absolutely worth buying. Not only does it add 9 new civs (more than all the DLC put together) but it is just an excellent expansion in general.

Note that GotY edition is missing [this particular DLC pack](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/11092/?snr=1_5_9__403).",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"There is only one **Expansion**, there is a lot of additional DLC.

You can live without DLC. However, not only does Gods & Kings provide 9 new civs, it introduces an extra mechanic (religion), and does a little bug fixing (notably that AI turns take too long in late game before expansion).

You will want Gods & Kings if you buy Civ 5. It is only 25% off now, though, so maybe wait on the expansion purchase.",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"I got addicted to Civ back in '94 and have played every single version of the game since.  Civ 4 is my fav - I still prefer it over 5, can't get used to the ""1 unit per tile"" thing",1

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"To be honest with you, I did not buy any of the DLCs until today because it was so expensive before (especially for an indie game). I got the ""Dungeon Defenders Lost Eternia Shards Complete DLC"" today since it is only $3.24 - totally worth it.

There are some other DLCs for costumes and heroes too. I can tell you now that you can still unlock some of the costumes even without the DLCs (e.g. Halloween costumes) by joining a lobby that is playing the DLC's map. I'm not sure if it is still the case now but it was when I was playing.

If you are referring to the ""Dungeon Defenders Collection"", then yes. I recommend you get that. For $12.49 it is a pretty good deal.",3
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"DLC, if you play much at all your're going to buy the DLC eventually anyway. The DLC is defiantly worth it as it ups the level cap and allows you to get the best gear in the game. ",2

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Yes.  I think Gods and Kings is a proper Game Expansion, and not just DLC addon.  The definitions are all blurred to hell these days, but it's presumably bigger than the ~$5-10 campaign packs.",1

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"[](/ppshrug) All I can say is that's how it is. Regional pricing for Steam games has always been kind of screwy. AUS and I guess NZ games tend to be more expensive than the American version. People have argued and complained about this since forever really. Since I'm in the US, this hasn't concerned me directly, so I don't any ways to get around it or any alternatives for international people. Sorry.",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Yes, you can drop out, and it passes to the next player, and an AI takes over for you.

The important difference is everything is done in real time, which kind of breaks multiplayer vs, as whoever has the fastest connection time can kill your entire army before you can click.

However, when you have AIs added, they go after you, so that is turned based still. I've found multiplayer co op to be fun and works rather well.  You and your friends go all at once, then all the AI.

We have come up with a way to get around the broken battle in multiplayer vs.  Go as usual most of the time, but then then if someone wants to attack, they get one surprise round, where they can attack whenever they want. Then after that, everyone currently at war enters a voluntary turned based order that was decided before the game started.  Anyone not in war can still go whenever they want.  We haven't tried it yet, but we think this will fix the current multiplayer problems.",1

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,I bought this game last year as my first Steam game. It was awesome and played through it completely. Bought it back in August of last year and totally worth it.,2

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,Awesome.  I'll check out the next one.,4
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"There are a lot of games where the combat does not feel...impactful? Zeno Clash does an excellent job of making it look/feel like your punches do the damage they should do.

ProTip: Master the Spin Kick. That just adds to the combat by giving you a move that will knock your opponent into oblivion.",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,So.. RO2 or RO2 Digital Delux?,1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,I can assure you it is reliable and I did get my key. You don't give them any information about your steam account. They send you the code and you enter that into steam.,1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Haha, oh well. Still got a great game at a decent price. ",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,I was surprised it wasn't picked.  Say whaaaa?,1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"No it wasn't. As PCCBFX said, it was one of the options for a community vote but it lost to Torchlight.",1
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"NFS:HP so far is more satisfying as a game. It comes with everything you'd expect from the NFS pedigree: great simulation, licensed cars from a Mazda RX-8 to a Lambo Reventon (also: Bugatti, anyone?), challenging races and modes. Also since EA bought Criterion, they put NFS on their plate. With Criterion's background (Burnout and the Renderware engine, obviously) and collaboration with DICE to create the maps, NFS:HP is definitely a buy. The Chameleon engine that's in this game makes for some sexy sexy graphics.

B:P is also by Criterion, of course. But the vision for B:P was taking the previous titles' game modes (minus ""Crash Mode"") and making them events in a GTA free-roam world. There's an included DLC that adds motorcycles, which are a blast to run around on. Apart from the events, each road in the game has a high score and it shows on your HUD who the fastest racer is on the road (time-wise). This is a pretty fun game mechanic in itself, as I've spent a good amount of time defending my high scores. There are lots of objectives to do (crash through billboards, crash through gates, etc) and there's more events as you move up in levels.  

In terms of challenge, NFS is definitely it. The races I've done in B:P I've won by 10-20 seconds on the first try. In NFS, you can pass events by meeting the minimum requirements (bronze), but getting gold in the events can be super hard (especially the ones where you have to respond to a call in a given time and you're punished for damaging your car).

If you want to jump in a car or motorcycle and have fun just screwing around, go for B:P. If you want challenging races with beautiful graphics and cars you only see on Top Gear, NFS is the way to go.

(and for the record, I use a Logitech F310 gamepad and it's spectacular for either game)",2
Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"NFS is more traditional, point A point B on a set track, no straying from it (but it does have free mode).

Burnout Paradise, it's free mode, you roll up to a stop light, start a race, can take any road to get to the end. 

That's the main difference.  Of course, NFS has the cop angle, and Burnout has the takedown while racing.  Burnout also took out that mode where you crash to see how much damage you can cause.

I prefer old school racing, so it would be NFS for me, even though I have both.",1

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,So the previous games aren't worth the extra ~$7?,1

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"sorry yes I didn't respond faster your in another timezone (based on you reply time so I assume you might not even notice)
if you want to move all of steam games and install steam only to your external HDD follow this (backup your  game saves first and steamapps folder first)
https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7710-tdlc-0426

If you want some games on your internal HDD and some on your external HDD:
Go to your steam installation folder generally here:
C:\Program Files\Steam 
Copy Steam.exe
Create a new folder on your external HDD where you wish the second steam to be located.
Paste steam.exe in this new folder.
Open steam.exe this will allow steam to download the other required steam files.
you now have two copys of steam one steam thats internal and one thats external. any games you install while running internal steam will install internally any games you install while running external steam will install external.

you will need to create a shortcut to the external steam or visit the external steams installation folder to open it up from there.

I used the second system to install steam to my SSD so I have a Steam SSD and a Steam HDD.

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"Because the prices are set by the publishers (not Steam/Valve), I doubt pricing decisions are made on the fly during the sale (except perhaps for Valve's own games or maybe indie games where Valve probably has more latitude).

Valve [has claimed](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/118547-Valve-If-Steam-Sales-Didnt-Work-we-Wouldnt-Run-Them?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=news) that dropping the price increases sales during and also *after* the sale, so even if a game is selling well at a given price, they might still be motivated to reduce it temporarily.",1

Steam Summer Sale Day 09: 2012/07/20,601,"If you enjoy the game then yes, it probably is.

AoE and Civ are wildly different games, though. Civ is a turn based strategy rather than an RtS. Basically this means your reflexes count for absolutely nothing, speed does not matter, and a single game will last 2-10 hours.

You might want to try the demo first. It's a great game, but if you're expecting something like AoE you may be wildly disappointed.",2

* **Sunless Sea.** You can both have a sweetheart/child back in Fallen London and engage in trysts with your officers at sea (often in questionable, horrifying, and titillating ways).

* **Cthulhu Saves The World.** Short, sappy RPG with the horrifying eldritch abomination as the main character. He finds true love.

* **Choice of the Deathless.** One of the ""Choice of..."" games that isn't explicitly romantic on the surface but allows your character to pursue several other magical lawyer love interests.

* **The Banner Saga.** Each of the two different protagonists can kindle a relationship with another member of the caravan, with story-based linear interaction. It can end in tragedy many different ways, as with most things in The Banner Saga.

* **Outer Worlds.** You're the bystander and facilitator in an adorable romance between one of your companions and an NPC faction leader.

* **Coffee Talk.** One of the primary subplots of this urban-fantasy-barista-adventure is the ongoing relationship trouble between an elf and a demon, and it is up to you, the magical barista, to get them to stay together.

* **80 Days.** There are at least three romance subplots between our earnest hero and various characters met on this steampunk decolonized journey about the globe, as well as the option to have a chivalric crush on your boss himself. LGBT friendly too!",1

Hell now that Iâm thinking about it thereâs actually a pretty important subplot revolving your character and his previous relationship. It starts off slowly drip feeding you what the relationship was before finally hitting you with the resolution to the subplot in the final act. So it actually might qualify for the initial list.

I highly recommend finishing the game. It has such great commentaries on society, relationships, how people relate and live in the world, politics, and more!

Thankfully in this modern age we live in we have the [extended edition mod setup tool](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/29337-eeeet-mod-setup-tool/) that allows us to pick what mods we want and it'll tell us if they're compatible or not as well as gives us the ability to take out features that are conflicting between mods (to a certain extent.)

It downloads mods automatically and installs them appropriately all automatically so we don't have to do any of that ourselves. Just be sure to have your baldur's gate 2 folder separate from the steam installation folder (I'd just duplicate its contents) so that if steam decides to update your game it won't brick your playthrough. That's a hard learned lesson I learned a while back. Lost many, many hours of a character that went through the first game and most of the second.

As for which mods, I'd have to say get a couple good banter packs. Romance mods are hit-and-miss but despite the (very old) controversy I enjoyed the Imoen romance mod. I'll get into why that's not worth the flak it gets these days if you want, but for now I loved the story. There are others but I really enjoyed the built-in romances along with the banter mods as the mods added so much more depth to the characters and conversations that could be had between you and npcs.

Steam Holiday Sale Day 11 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary/DRM?/Notes),486,"Here's commentary for day 11, (As usual, feel free to leave comments on any of my commentary or any of the mentioned games). 

**[The Binding of Isaac](http://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/)** is a very weird game. To put it (not so) simply it's a roguelike RPG shooter where you play as Isaac, whose mom has been told by God to slaughter thee. This is a truly bizarre game, I'm not going to lie about that. But, the core gameplay is very enjoyable (although challenging), and the artistic direction is so grotesque that I'd like to know what they were smoking when they made this game. The big question, is it worth 1.25? Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. It's an excellent game, and it'll last you a while. I do have 2 major complaints. First of all, there is no native gamepad support, you'll have to use a program like xpadder to use one. Secondly, it doesn't give you item descriptions, so you'll have to look on the wiki page. 

**[Swords of the Stars II: Lords of Winter](http://store.steampowered.com/app/42990/)**. In short, no. In long, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. I'm surprised that kerberos released a 4X game in this poor of shape. It's buggy to the point of unplayability, and despite numerous patches, it's still a bug ridden mess (although it's much better than at launch by a significant factor). What is a 4X game? A 4X game is short for ""explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate"", as you increase your empire, conquer foes, and travel beyond the stars. However, due to the insane amount of bugs, I still wouldn't pick it up.  If you want a good large space-themed 4X game, check out Sins of a Solar Empire or the original Sword of The Stars. As of now, stay away from this mess. 

**aMissingGlassEye** said ""Speaking as a big fan of the first one, this game is unfinished. I per-ordered it and have been watching its progress and while Kerberos' work has been admirable, it's still not complete.
That said, don't write it off entirely. It may take another six months, but odds are a very good 4X game is going to come out of it. The potential is all there and is 90% complete, it's just the last 10% is simply not done.""


**[The Men of War Series](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/MenOfWar)** is not for the light hearted. They are a set of brutal real time tactics games that will test any commander's chops. They are very historically accurate, and the direct control mode offers a new spin on RTS tactics. However, the learning curve is very deep, battles are very challenging, and the game can look somewhat outdated. For single player, pick up the original game and Red Tide. For an excellent multiplayer game, pick up Assault Squad. However, Vietnam was not a very good game, to say the least, so stay away from that. Again, they're very brutal, so be sure to check out the demos, as these games aren't for everyone. 

Moving on, we have **[the Mafia Series](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/Mafia)**. They tell the chilling tales of Mafioso and their struggles and personal tales. The first Mafia was an excellent game, with incredible action sequences and a masterful tale. Mafia II wasn't quite so good, and it has some sort of driving fetish, because you need to drive to all of your missions, repeatedly. A disclaimer, while technically being an open world game, the Mafia series uses that city to tell a linear tale, rather than let you go wild like in Saints Row. If you've been looking for a great blockbuster experience or a great tale, check out the first Mafia. While not being quite as good, Mafia II was still enjoyable. There is a demo for Mafia II, so try it out before you pass judgment. 

Next on our safari we have **[Dungeon Siege 3](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/dungeonsiegeIII)**. Eh. It wasn't a bad game, but it wasn't that great. It felt like a stale version of the original Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance games. The core combat is pretty mindless, and the story and characterization isn't that great. So if you're looking for single player, this isn't a very good choice. Co-op is a little bit better, but it has some ridiculous restrictions placed upon it that make it difficult to enjoy (why does everyone have to share the same camera?) It does have 2 player local co-op, which is the best way to play it, as the restrictions aren't nearly as bad when you're playing with a friend. Overall, I'd pass this game up, it's still too expensive, and I've seen it for 5 dollars on Amazon. you could do a lot worse, but you could do better as well.

Our next stop is at the classic **[Quake series](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/holidaysale2011quake)** by legendary FPS developers id software. At their core, these games are very excellent fast paced multiplayer FPS deathmatches, with Quake III: Arena being the pinnacle of the deathmatch FPS in the series. To some, these games might be outdated, to others, they provide a deathmatch experience unlike any other on the market. There are demos, so check them out. I'd highly recommend it to veterans of the FPS genre, or people interested in old school deathmatches. 

Righto, now all eyes onto **[Lord of The Rings: War In The North](http://store.steampowered.com/app/32800/)** another effort by legendary developers Snowblind Studios. To be honest, this game really isn't that good. It has poor checkpointing, the revival mechanic (as ripped off from Gears of War) is very, very frustrating at times, the enemies aren't very sharp, multiplayer has various issues, and the combat feels stale and bland. If you're dying for a co-op hack and slash game, you might be sort of interested in this game, if you're willing to take the faults, but it's still not very good. Combine that with a lazy PC port and the inability to turn off your microphone, and you have frustrations ahead. At this price, I'd pass it up even if you're a diehard fan of the genre.   

Next up we have the stellar **[Total War Series](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/TotalWar)** by RTS legends The Creative Assembly. To describe Total War to a newcomer of the series is a challenge, as they're essentially their own genre. In Total War, you build up an Empire and raise an army to crush your opponents who stand before you. On the campaign grid, it takes place as a turn based strategy game where you manage settlements, train soldiers, and enact new policies and maintain diplomatic relations. In combat, the entire perspective switches to a massive real time battle, as you try to kill off your opponents. The single player is quite engaging and will suck hours of your life to its charms. For newcomers of the series and veterans of the older Total War games, I'd recommend Shogun 2, as it's the most polished, streamlined, and accessible game in the series yet. There is a demo, so if you still have reservations, check it out. Medieval II: Total War has some excellent mods, and Rome: Total War is also an excellent game in the series.

Total War too in depth for you? Do you want a simple shooter where you slay hordes upon hordes of the undead? Well, look no further than the **[Left 4 Dead series](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/left4deadholiday2011)**, a set of remarkably polished and fun cooperative shooters. In the Left 4 Dead series, you play as one of four survivors who are on a mad sprint to the nearest safe house to survive the zombie apocalypse. Along the way you'll meet special infected, who pose a particularly large threat to your progress and will test your teamwork skills. If you're looking for a fun shooter to play with friends, this is an excellent choice, as it's simple but engaging. Valve is in the process of porting all of the maps from Left 4 Dead 1 into Left 4 Dead 2, so I'd only pick up the sequel if I were you. 

**[Wasteland Angel](http://store.steampowered.com/app/46520/)** is a remarkably dull arcade shooter set in the post apocalypse. To be honest, this is an incredibly generic game. There's really nothing that sets it apart from other games, it has no charm or any sort of redeeming features that makes it good. In fact, there's no multiplayer of any sort. So overall, I'd pass this one up, despite it being so cheap, and there being a demo as well. Your mileage may vary, but this isn't a very good game. 

**[Xotic](http://store.steampowered.com/app/92600/)** is a score attack focused FPS that lives up to its name. Nearly everything about it is unique, be it the weapons, enemies, graphics, even the story. In fact, it far extends beyond the point of becoming surreal, and then still goes on. Visually, the game is packed to the brim, to the point where you might distracted by everything on the screen. There are a few issues with jumping, but overall, it's an excellent choice for score fiends wanting to test their chops. Check out the demo, and if you like it, pick it up, as it's very cheap. 

Finally, we have the **[Two Tribes Pack](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/TwoTribes)** to round off our daily deals. The Two Tribes games are simple, charming, and unoffensive puzzler and platformer games that will cater to all gamers of any age. Despite their simplicity, they are all quite fun, and are good for a coffee break or a quick way to burn off some time. Every game is very cheap and has a demo, so be sure to check them out. Definitely worth a look if you want to have a quick fun game.

It's fairly lengthy too (around 15-20 hours).

I was given a bootleg copy of this game from my Uncle for my 13th birthday, so the Multiplayer obviously didn't work for me, but from what I understand, it's very similar to QIII (which has some of the most asskickingly fun deathmatches ever). So for $5, it's a worthy buy.",10

On top of that, the developers have basically admitted that the only reason they kicked the game out the door is because they needed the money. Their intent was to get buyers now, then use that money to actually finish the product. If they don't get enough ~~suckers~~ buyers, they can't release a playable game.

edit: As CFGX noted below, they flat-out **lied to their customers** when the game was first released, stating they'd accidentally uploaded an early build to Steam and would have the actual one up shortly. This probably got them a number of good-faith purchases to generate a little more cash.",35

To quote **Black_Astra** on the Men of War series ""Men of War, is a very challenging RTS. It has a much more complicated style than some of the other well known games, and requires much more micromanagement. It also has some RPG elements, where you can equip new gear found during the battles. It has some great big open battles, some cool stealth missions, and a few defend/counter missions. Each team has unique units, and it balances out fairly well. If you really want to play this series, get the first, Men of War. Its story is easier to follow, there is still a large multiplayer community, and plenty of great mods. If you like the original, then Squad Assault is a possible buy. Be warned though, it is just a updated version of the first but without the story and a sligtly upgraded multilayer. There are some fun single player missions as well. The game is also frequently updated and new maps/missions come out at a steady rate.
Stay away from Red Tide and Vietnam. Only get Red Tide if you love a great story in an RTS. Anyone who accidentally got Vietnam will tell you the same thing. Unless you want to beat your face in. Both are extremely hard, and near impossible, even for seasoned RTS players. Neither of them have multilayer Both are also very unforgiving as missions carry supplies and troops over to the next(most missions you only get 4/5 troops)."" 

rtwarner said about Left 4 Dead 2: ""I'd like to point out that while Left 4 Dead 2 is a fantastic game, the community is brutal. There's no room for newcomers, if you mess up, even a little, you will be kicked out of the session. The only map people play on Scavenger mode is No Mercy. If you don't have friends to play with I can't recommend the game; buy the four pack and distribute it among friends, then you'll be set."" (Although I personally think the community is fine)

Steam Holiday Sale Day 11 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary/DRM?/Notes),486,"I think I must be the only person who didn't enjoy The Binding of Isaac. The game, if you're unfamiliar, is essentially a roguelike randomly-generated dungeon spin on Zelda 1, with shump combat. In a nutshell, imagine playing Zelda with only a bow/boomerang, and bombs. The shump combat itself is boring and lacks depth, despite the enormous quantity of power-ups, because it never stopped playing like Zelda with a bow, or at best a really stripped-down shump. You have a ton of items, as well, which allow for many new strategies and challenges (and mystery), but ultimately that falls back to the core shooting, which I didn't find fun. It has a ton of replay-value due to randomness, and it's especially good if you like to set personal goals for run-throughs.   It's an bizarre amalgamation; it's not quite a pure dungeon crawler and not quite a pure shump. The level design is pretty meh as a result of mixing shooting with Zelda. I didn't enjoy it very much, and I just wanted to voice some contrasting thoughts. There's a demo on Newgrounds for the curious. the game also has bad slowdowns from time to time, which often render it barely playable on my computer.",4

Steam Holiday Sale Day 11 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary/DRM?/Notes),486,"I bought the Binding of Isaac the same day it was released. In total I've spent days playing this game. I've actually played this game far more than Skyrim or any other game which has been released this year.

It's a really, really great  and fun game (and especially for that price). There are only two problems with this game. It's created in flash, but it's not optimized with the latest Flash 10 hardware accelerator. The achievement system may also not work (or that the achievements won't show up at all). 

A guy on the Steam forums ported the game over to Flash 10 (in under a day) to run with hardware accelerator. He said that this helps a lot on the frame-rate. There are also someone on the Steam forums who've made a fix for the achievement problems. The thing is that it's illegal to mess around with these files, so you can supposedly be banned on Steam if you do that. I'm not sure though if that's true or not, so I won't touch those fixes. 

I highly recommend checking out the game on the Steam forums if you want to know more about this.

There have been a lot of people who've mailed Edmund McMillen (the developer) about the problems and also told him that they would love would help him optimize and fix the game for free. So far he doesn't seem to care about it though, which is kinda sad.

On the other hand, McMillen has written on Twitter that he'll release a huge update for the Binding of Isaac sometimes next year. This will be a DLC which will contain more than two times the amount of stuff which is already in the game. The game will become huge! I'm really looking forward to it.

Medieval II Kingdoms has FANTASTIC mods. If you are at all into modding, this is the one. There is a LOTR mod for it that recently was released. And it is great.

Shogun II + Rome are a great place for beginners to start. They are still complex, but they make it easy for a newcomer to get into the series.

If you only had to get one, I would say Shogun II if your computer can handle it. Rome if yours can't. Ignore Napoleon (for now). Empire will be easier to get into after you play one of the other games. I would only recommend Medieval II if you are really interested in the era or mods.

Steam Holiday Sale Day 11 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary/DRM?/Notes),486,"The best way to describe it is a cinematic, linear, third person shooter set in an open world.

There's not much impetus to explore other than for the purpose of sightseeing, but the main storyline should take you to all the places that are worth seeing anyway. The most apt way to think of the world in the game is as a stage for the story to take place on. It is a grand story however, and most criticism was due to the fact that people expected an open world experience as in the first game, but when you look at the game based on its merits it becomes apparent that it is an intricately woven 3rd person action game with a surprisingly encompassing story that spans decades.

Also, it has an excellent prison sequence.",1
Steam Holiday Sale Day 11 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary/DRM?/Notes),486,"Yes, the sizable city makes it easy for people to mistake this game as another GTA clone but its used less as an open world and more as a very large set piece for the game to play out in.  It is very linear and although the game can be uneven there are a couple greatly executed missions in the game.  That said the story and atmosphere starts off quite strong and really sucks you into the world but about half-way through it starts to unravel and lose focus and lasts about 12-15 hours which may leave you wanting.  I get the impression that they just didnt have enough of a budget or maybe time to flesh it out as much as it should have been which is a shame because there is a lot of potential here, but for 7.50 its still worth it for those who are interested",1

There is a lot more micromanagement. Each soldier has his own inventory, and if for instance he runs out of ammo you'll have to scavenge dead bodies for more, and transfer the weapons/ammo to your guy, of course that takes precious time during which you are vulnerable, it can also be very tedious sometimes. 

Also the single player campaign is very unforgiving, as in, if you don't pay attention at your units for 1 minute you can lose them all from a tank that showed up from nowhere so you'll have to quick-save a lot.

Assault Squad is the most accessible of them all so I'd say get that one if you can, there is a demo if you want to try it.

Quake 2: PLAY THIS CAMPAIGN.  Remember it's dated for graphics, but it's a blast to play through as a solo-marine against the Strogg.  The last boss battle is pretty epic too.  I'm actually trying to find someone to play through the two expansions with, so I can't give you feedback on those.

Quake 3: Multiplayer DM at its best.  Even the single player has good DM matches against the bots.

Quake 4: If you liked Quake 2's story, get Quake 4.  It brings you back to Stroggos (Strogg Homeworld) with all your familiar friends (railgun, grenade launcher, etc.)  Story is linked to Quake 2 and you'll hear them talk about a lone solider who managed to get behind enemy lines and take out...well, I can't give you spoilers, but I remember going ""DUDE, that was me!"" and I never say things like that.

The driving around the city is the greatest driving experience you can get in a non-racer game; besides that it feels like being inside a mafia movie, a great one that is. I've tried the Godfather game, it seemed boring, I've tried Mafia II, it was extremely disappointing, but I can't find anything to reproach the first Mafia for.

If you like sandbox games, Mafia I offers a free play mode, where you can do whatever the hell you want (it's available from start IIRC, you unlock vehicles and parts of the city by playing through the story though). The story really feels like a great mobster movie (think The Godfather or Goodfellas) and after finishing the story there's this incredibly challenging thing called Extreme Ride, where you get crazy tasks to perform around the city. For â¬2.50 Mafia is a steal and the gameplay really makes up for the dated graphics.

One more thing though: Mafia and Mafia II are VERY DIFFERENT games, they are both sandboxes set in a mobster environment, though with different approach, and although I love the first one, I truly hated the sequel: the driving mechanics are utter shit compared to the first one and more importantly, the story was to the first one what Uwe Boll's fantasy movies are to the LOtR film trilogy. Also, in Mafia I you can do whatever you want before, midst and after each assignment, so it does feels sandboxy, the second one reminded me of the ""modern"" FPS games, where despite rich environment you feel like in a corridor.

Steam Holiday Sale Day 11 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary/DRM?/Notes),486,"Shogun 2 is much more similar to Rome & Medieval 2 than it is to Empire, I'd say, although it keeps the fairly simple character traits present in Empire.

Something new it has, on the subject of characters, is an experience tree. Every time a general, ninja, daimyo, priest, or others gain a star, they get two (or more, at the higher star levels) points to be allocated into a tree of stats that give them bonuses. So, it's like all the bonuses that were around in Rome (+5% movement speed, +1 to field defense, etc), except that you can pick what stats you get. It's an interesting system.


The battles are still Total War battles, although I feel like siege assaults are more interesting, because the fortresses are arranged in a way where its size in comparison with your army is much more believable (And, beyond the first two fortress levels, they have multiple tiers that the attackers need to scale to get through.

Quake 2 is the better game, BUT, the times I've tried to play it, it doesn't work too well in Windows 7.  I could possibly be some exception here, but I tried quite a few things and had no luck.

No :( 

Yes, the concept of an in-browser game is strange but it makes sense when you see what they've done with the game. They've integrated a tier matchmaking system based on your playing metrics, they've integrated a friends and clan system, all with the ability to invite friends to an on-going match. Its pretty sophisticated compared to other FPS games. If you really want to get into the scene, QuakeLive is the way to go. 

Once the game itself pops up it feels like a standalone game anyway. You still have your console and full ability to customize things like hud and mouse sensitivity for each individual weapon. All your demos are saved to your qlive folder, etc. 

Unfortunately and sadly, most of the standalone quake games have dead multiplayer (unless you're a veteran who knows the IRC channels).",1

Here's the country (or continent) and here's what your little faction controls, now go conquer the rest. Much of your game time is spent managing cities and territory in TBS mode. Once you are engaged in conflict the game goes to a battle map which plays out in real time where you experience and control the best simulation of large scale combat currently created. There's no peasant running to and from a mine gathering gold for you to upgrade some faggot's shields. You aren't waiting on your mage's mana to regen so you can summon meteors on your enemies building. You recruit and move armies on the world map and then those armies are represented man for man on the battle map (hundreds of individual models formed into group units). It's all about formations and flanking, breaking the enemies morale and causing their ranks to flee! Good stuff. Now, if strategy and tactics is what you enjoy there really isn't a more satisfying game to play and succeed at. If you're a ""gogogokillkillkill"" kind of person than this is going to be too intricate for your mind to handle and honestly you shouldn't be off your ADHD meds to begin with.



There's a lot of people who are going to suggest Rome Total War. Know this: the Total War series has a very dedicated fan base and most of them got into it with Rome Total War. You know how fan boys get with their old nostalgic games? If you're interested get the demo for Shogun 2, play what it gives you and if you like it get it. Shogun2 is very pretty and, though some would disagree, a refinement of the genre (although it is simplified, some might say it's streamlined).


Looking at RTW it *is* 2.50. If you like strategy then there will not be a better way to spend $2.50. If you're okay with outdated graphics RTW is still an awesome game with the most variety out of any of the TW games (and honestly the graphics aren't that bad).

Steam Holiday Sale Day 11 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary/DRM?/Notes),486,"total war series is all about what you are interested in. 

If you are interested in classical history - RTW
if you are interested in the middle ages - Medieval 2
If you are interested in japan/samurai - Shogun 2
if you are interested in muskets/guns - Napoleon

I just got shogun 2 when it was $10 earlier this month and haven't been able to play much yet so I will not have a valid opinion of this game yet.

Steam Holiday Sale Day 11 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary/DRM?/Notes),486,It doesn't exactly fit neatly into the RTS category. I personally dislike most RTS games but love the total war series. Shogun 2 is the newest and most polished so I would recommend that over Empire unless you particularly enjoy the whole early gun era. Medieval 2 and Rome are both great even though they can't compete graphically with shogun 2. I mostly play Medieval 2 because it has far more mod support the Empire or Shogun 2. Third Age is a Lord of the Rings mod for Medieval 2 that is especially good. So for the vanilla game I would buy shogun 2 unless you really like the Empire Era. For Mod support I would buy Medieval 2. I think there are demos for both Shogun 2 and Empire that you might want to try out first.,2

Very replayable; after beating it once, it unlocks another level, better bosses, and more powerups  for the next times you play it.

",3
Steam Holiday Sale Day 11 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary/DRM?/Notes),486,"This would be true if the game had more heuristic design elements to it. As is, much of the loot system is entirely opaque, and the player often can only discover what item they have by using (wasting) the item itself, which can often be a game-losing scenario. Sometimes, using the item doesn't even teach the player what it does. The loot system is really a ""not-a-loot"" system for the most part, being entirely luck-based from start to finish.

Wild-ass guessing is not discovery, it's simply gambling, and it is not a painful decision when it is entirely uninformed. That's merely arbitrary. I might as well flip a coin upon entering a room, and unplug my keyboard when it comes up tails. 

It would be more appropriate if there were fewer loot objects, or if one loot object taught the player about subsequent loot (thereby attenuating the learning curve). As is, there is NO learning curve. It is simply, learning ""steps"" - game information that you either know, or do not know - or running to the wiki in order to not lose the game again. 

That said, it was still a pretty good game. I find nothing creative or fun about opaque game design. That was a crutch designers relied upon ~25 years ago when resources and technology limited design in ways it no longer does (i.e. low res screens, limited controls, and limited ROM capacity meant including explanatory text in-game was difficult).

That's the entire point.

I think you really missed the entire concept of this game.  It's about replaying over and over with your learned experience from the previous plays.  The ""dead cat"" does what the ""dead cat"" does whether it is play 1 or play 100.  

Further to it, not all items are good - some have good and bad, and yet others are mostly bad.  However, depending on your situation there are reasons to get/use one item over another on one play, but stay away from it on another play.

Basically, this is not a game anyone should ever beat on their first play, which is what it sounds like you are looking for.  That is neither a ""crutch"" nor ""opaque game design"".

With the exception of pills and tarot cards, all other usable items will recharge after a while, so you can use them again, and thus they weren't wasted.

I have about 10 of these on my feed today. 

That said, I agree that this particular example of social media integration is not especially insidious, Valve is pretty good at not being a douchebag about things. 

My disdain is aimed at this trend of trading social media integration for stuff or services, particularly when that 'stuff' is utterly worthless in-game purchases in some free-to-play shit. ",4

Half can only play what's latest and greatest, the other half wants to play what's more fun.

I never really liked L4D2.  I don't think the music is as good (though it has a cool creepy vibe) and I think the additional infected types are kinda dumb and not as perfectly balanced as the originals.",3
Steam Holiday Sale Day 11 (Useful Links/Info/Commentary/DRM?/Notes),486,"I totally agree. 

I never got into L4D2, partially because many of the new special infected (spitter and jockey, charger was good) didn't add much, and quad caps are pretty much impossible. I feel that L4D1 was more strategic and better for competitive play than L4D2. ",2

"So, I started playing Age of Empires II...",6,"Age of Empires 2 is by far the best of the AoE series. Been playing it for close to 15 years, and still play it every now and then. It's an absolutely fantastic game. 
I didn't really get into the later AoE games though. If you have an Xbox, maybe try Halo Wars. It gets bagged a lot for its simplicity by seasoned RTS players, but I had a hell of a lot of fun with it. Its made by the same people who make AoE, and is a really well made, fun game. ",3
"So, I started playing Age of Empires II...",6,"Age of Empires III was the weakest. At that point, a lot of the innovation in the series was dead and there were other RTS that did it better. I really liked Age of Mythology though.",2
"So, I started playing Age of Empires II...",6,I was having fun with company of heroes. I need to get back to those games. ,2
"So, I started playing Age of Empires II...",6,"""How do you turn this on""!",2
"So, I started playing Age of Empires II...",6,"If you like Star Wars, I can't recommend Empire at War enough.  $20 for the deluxe edition.  For other RTS games, my favorite are Rise of Nations and Empires:  Dawn of the Modern World.  The last one may be a bit unknown, but they're both incredibly solid.  Also, Warcraft III.  Solid game.",2
"So, I started playing Age of Empires II...",6,"I thoroughly enjoy the total war series (there are free demos on steam). The civilization series (though that is turn-based). And company of heroes. (should also have a demo I believe

Each of these are profoundly different but all enjoyable.",2
"So, I started playing Age of Empires II...",6,"I haven't played AoE in a long long time, so I am not sure if it was good or if I was just young.

I would recommend starcraft 2 - there is a free to play version of it that you can try before you buy.",2
"So, I started playing Age of Empires II...",6,Homeworld was always my favorite. The Command & Conquer series ain't too shabby either. If you're willing to dive into more turn based strategy the Total War series is amazing.,1

What do you think of AoE III?",1
"So, I started playing Age of Empires II...",6,"yea the ""emperors new groove"" graphics are a bit weird at first, but the civilizations you can play as are absolutely great! i actually made a video breaking it down and why it was done so well, but never uploaded it. the game is free so you should at least try it out. no harm done imho. i strongly suggest this game ",2
"So, I started playing Age of Empires II...",6,While not quite up to the standards set by its predecessor; the changes it made were great especially for the forwarded timeline of the game. The story was not quite up to par with the other AOE campaigns being fictional rather than past historical missions. But other then those my only quirk with the game was the lack of a random map generator. I had memorized all of the skirmish maps long before any of the expansions had come out.,2
"So, I started playing Age of Empires II...",6,"Thank you, sir. I may just have to do that. ",1
"So, I started playing Age of Empires II...",6,"No random map? That's one of my favorite features. I'd say that's something big missing, if I was to buy the game.",1

Guess Age of Empires IV isn't going well,2,Judging by the manager's response it seems like it might just be a disgruntled employee because the manager did seem to really care about what he had to say then again it could just be a facade,2
Guess Age of Empires IV isn't going well,2,"They will get it removed. My company had an influx of very blunt reviews and i believe paid Glassdoor to remove them.
I asked the guy who wrote the worst one if he took it down and he didn't. 
",1
Guess Age of Empires IV isn't going well,2,"I totally get where the employee is coming from though. Even though I don't have any background in game development, Too many places I have worked at where you have a passionate team and some check in the box routine the company goes through. Sometimes you have a manager that shares that passion, but theres usually some clog in the neck blocking the flow of communication from the heart to the brain. The big boss can ask if anything is wrong, and you can have a whole entire team full of people that may say no, but they have the answers to fix it, as it seemed to suggest from the employees wordy post. But that clog up top is going to tell the boss, ""Nah we're all good, nothing to worry about.""  This happens a lot. All it takes is that one asshole unwilling to communicate and the employees voice will be unheard up top. One of the such places I worked at ended up discovering their clog though and started cleaning house. Too bad I'm not working there now. It was a good job except for the circle jerk going on that wanted to hide the issues from higher and not work to try to fix them. ",2
Guess Age of Empires IV isn't going well,2,True. They probably are downvoting this too atm,1
Guess Age of Empires IV isn't going well,2,"I completely understand this, currently things are a mess where i work due to one person, everyone knows it and everyone knows why things are bad and no one is doing anything about it. ",1
Guess Age of Empires IV isn't going well,2,"Reason it was so bad where I was, was that you had the big head in California, us all the way in the midwest. The guy talking to California tried to remain inaccessible, and used a really oppressive supervisor to keep us quiet and in the main part of the building. Somehow word got out though and California sent someone to check it out and both of those guys were booted. The shit that was going on in that place was quite honestly probably illegal. ",2
Guess Age of Empires IV isn't going well,2,"Oh I know exactly how that feels, I've gotten tired of complaining it all falls on deaf ears at this point. Question is do I stick around and hope things get better, or get out there and find something else, hardest part for me is figuring out what I want to do with myself.",1
Guess Age of Empires IV isn't going well,2,"Personally, I left. I started working a second job, which sucked, but I had to have stable income before leaving there. Once I was ready to leave, I gave my two weeks notice and had to sit and listen to him try to guilt me saying I was ""screwing over the whole team"" and that it was selfish for me to leave. 

Before, we would have meetings in which the supervisor would tell us that we only worked there because we screwed up our lives and didn't amount to anything else. This is not an exaggeration...this is exactly what he said. He called out another manager and said they'd be stuck there the rest of their life because they were too dumb for college, and pointed out another guy not having custody of his kids. Not sure what that had to do with anything. He knew he was a prick. He also knew he was untouchable. He would tell everyone they were worthless and couldn't make it anywhere outside that job. Now....this place hires a lot of people with felonies. I however, had a clean record, no arrests, no drug use, a good work background, no felonies. When I put in my two weeks notice and he tried to give me the talk on how I won't make it, I was more than happy to tell him that I had a steady job elsewhere but I remained professional about it. My only mistake apparently was applying there. 

After discovering how much money I've left on the table over the years by not having a degree, I enrolled in college. I'm a year into my Associates degree right now and have every intention of rolling right into my Bachelors right after that. Now that dickhead is without a job and I'm doing pretty good for myself. He probably won't ever see how well I'm doing, but it doesn't matter. What matters to me is that I know what I'm capable of. With a degree, I can eventually move into higher positions and hopefully help keep a company efficient without feeling any need to oppress my employees and be a lapdog for a guy that sits in an office and wants no interaction with the people who work for him. 

If anyone takes anything from what I'm posting....go to college. Even if its expensive.....do it. ",2

If the ""HD"" (yeah right) rerelease does well, we could potentially see another game, but I don't think so, especially since the studio that had the resources and know-how to make a good Age of Empires game, Ensemble Studios, went under shortly after Halo Wars (maybe shortly before?) released.",1

Judge Me Based On My Games,0,You are An amazing awesome person who does nice things for people when you have the time,2
Judge Me Based On My Games,0,"The amount of strategy games you have tells me that you enjoy strategic situations where you use logic and planning to gain an advantage. A lot of the games are also based on fantasy, usually a medieval kind of time period. You are probably someone who loves reading and experiencing rich stories and lore. This means you are also a person with a good amount of patience and discipline.

To balance out your methodical and strategic approach, you also enjoy some action packed games where you cannot always plan everything. This tells me that even though you are meticulous in planning, you are not afraid to take risks from time to time. The Ghost Recon game tells me that even though you enjoy action games, the strategic part of your mind still overflows from time to time into these types of games, and so you have this urge to still make plans even in action games to ensure victory.

Finally, you have FC24, which is a soccer (or football) game. Based on this, there's a good chance that you are a fan of the sport and that you are living somewhere in Europe.

To summarize, you are a disciplined person who enjoys using the mind to plan your success and the downfall of your opponents. You have the patience and discipline to not just go rushing in even in action games and you would still try to make plans even in potentially chaotic situations. Your love for medieval fantasy games, and the existence of a soccer game in your current playlist suggests that you are someone who lives in Europe.

Trying to Find New Cheap Games in the Summer Sale like...,234,"Spore will run decently on a toaster, has nice ambient tracks (made by Brian Eno and Cliff Martinez wouldn't ya know), is an interesting concept and has a really fun avatar creation engine.    
*HOWEVER*, Spore is really shallow in terms of its mechanics, gets repetitive quickly (see shallow mechanics, you can experience practically everything in two playthroughs due to what amounts to a binary moral choice system) and the AI is a crapshoot.

I would recommend that you buy it while its on sale. Also the Cell, Creature and Space stages are probably the best ones for being actually fun and making good use of the mechanics, while Tribal and Civ are just bribe the AI until you decide you want to zerg rush them.",2
Trying to Find New Cheap Games in the Summer Sale like...,234,"picked up Brave New World for Civ 5 for like 4 bucks because I already had the game and Gods and Kings, totally worth it. Don't know if I'm going to grab anything else though. ",2
Trying to Find New Cheap Games in the Summer Sale like...,234,"For once, I was glad my library was relatively small. I got a $20 gift card for the sale, and stretched it a lot. Why? Because I didn't have that many games, so getting the biggest bang for my buck was important. For $21.50 or so(I had 1.60 in my account), I managed to get the following:

* Killing Floor. Great, a co-op zombie experience! Cost $5.

* Left 4 Dead bundle. More co-op zombies, but with an enjoyable campaign with a story and objective and less people as opposed to only fighting zombies on a map without an objective. It cost $6 for both via the bundle.

* Batman: Arkham Asylum. A Batman action game that is pretty good and feels really 'Batman' style instead of another game reskinned as Batman. GOTY Edition was $5.

* Postal 2. Beating the shit out of random people, accomplishing errands, kicking severed heads around like soccer balls, and urinating on people in the arcade. Awesome. The base game is all of $1.

* The Witcher games (1 and 2). I couldn't buy the bundle, as I had no additional funds for The Witcher 3, and I can not run the Witcher 3 on my PC. I dipped my toes in the water with Witcher 2's tutorial testing the games out on my PC. I was so blown away with the tutorial, I bought Witcher 1:Enhanced Edition with my last $1.50. Witcher 2:Enhanced Edition is $3. Total: $4.50.

Sometimes it pays to not have a huge library(My library before was Fallout games, Portal games, Skyrim, Bioshock, Binding of Isaac, Amnesia the Dark Descent, and some FTP games). 

tl:dr When you have a small library or limited funds(or both) , try to find the games that give you the most bang for your buck.

Trying to Find New Cheap Games in the Summer Sale like...,234,"That's a little bit of the customer base's fault.
Due to all the complaining about Flash and Daily Sales from their users, Valve made it so prices have to be at that price point for the entire length of the sale. As such, you're not going to get lots of developers and publishers to buy in to putting a super-low price during the whole sale.

But 8 hours? They could do that... and they'd expect the resulting buzz for their game being at that price for as few as 8 and possibly 48-72 hours at most? That'll carrry over. The buzz that they'd generate as people are talking about the new games they got/were playing would also lead them make a fair number of full price sales over the next few weeks.  

Now to put something at a bargain basement price for the full duration of the Steam Sale? That's not going to happen. It's why ALL the sales are blah, the steam sales are meaningless because you'll find the same games for a better price (or bundled) somewhere down the road in a few months, and MAYBE you manage to scoop up a few hidden gems or a price a AAA game that's reasonably competitive. 

There's no excitement, no buzz, and no great deals... because the primary avenue to get those out there was killed because people cried that they weren't able to sit and watch Steam ""all day, every day"" to get good sales. So their answer was ""Noone does.""",8

The point is to build up as much scrap as possible. Stores will always have ok to pretty good gear, meaning that as long as you have a reserve of scrap you can buy your weapons up.

Defense drones are almost 100% success rate in shooting down single missiles, invisibility can temporarily raise your evade above 100%, beams always hit their target.

If you didn't love Game Pass before... You're going to love it soon enough,0,"This is just straight up false information. There are some discs out there which contain only a small fraction of data, essentially acting as only a physical license. Though this is not true for 95% of games. Most games have a full 1.0 master of the game on the disc, unless specified on the box that it requires internet.

Microsoft and Activision published physical games are notorious for not including the actual games on the disc. Avoid these discs at all costs. Hence why physical media still has some popularity on Sonyâs machines, they always come with a polished 1.0 build printed on their discs.

And no it isnt true for all consoles. Its technically only on Xbox that Microsoft got deny you the use of a physical disc, since each disc has a unique ID on it. Playstation and Nintendo does not print their discs/carts with unique identifiers on them, so thereâs no way for Sony and Nintendo to deny you the use of a physical disc. 

Regardless, physical games on Xbox does have some value over a digital version. Like mentioned, most games does have a fully playable master on it, making it gold for preservationists. Youâll have something to pass down to your kids to enjoy when the servers are long gone. You also have full ownership of the physical structure which the game is on, meaning you can sell it as you wish.

The AAA devs don't care about bringing something neew to the table because they know this new generation of dumb, conformist Gen Z morons will buy a steaming pile of fecal matter if it has a popular game brand slapped onto it (e.g. CoD, Battlefield, Rainbow Six, Far Cry, Ghost Recon etc).

i list some things i enjoy in case you care:

endless maps, it gets procedurally generated, i still find planets with new ""themes"" after 20 hours of playtime, the planets are massive, i have not tried to circle around one, it takes like 20-60sec to travel between planets (depending on pirate attacks)

massive base building opportunities, similiar to subnautica below zero, but even more pieces and functions, you can even employ aliens you find in stations to do tasks

a hub like in destiny where you can buy all sorts of upgrades and find the mission board for online coop

a great story, it starts a bit casually and then hits with decisions harder than in matrix

huge amounts of upgrades, your ""multitool"", suit and spaceship habe multiple inventories where you slot functions and their boosts depending on what you prefer

a lot of customization, there are many different kinds of ships and multitools (imagine laser pistols and assault rifles) aswell as multiple suit skins

the creatures get also randomly generated, similiar to spore lategame (which means potentially endless amounts of different creatures).... and you can adopt all of them as pets and take them with you or... if big enough..  ride them

Terraforming

you can scan flora/fauna/minerals for databank entries which reward upgrade units and cash (my favorite activity)

Can't find a game to play,2,Maybe Warframe,3
Can't find a game to play,2,"Maybe look for something in the ARPG genre? that's like Diablo, Divinity Original Sin, Path of Exile, etc. etc.  
  
Gameplay is a bit hack-and-slash, with lots of enemies to kill (so should feed his need for things like Wolfenstein)....and then the build trees are exactly like you'd get in a traditional RPG like Oblivion/Skyrim.  
  
It'll be a compromise for both of you of course....the pace is going to be faster/more mindless than you're used to from traditional RPGs, and needing to manage inventory/think about a skill tree will be more than he's used to from the games you listed. But it might work.   
  
One oddball suggestion - Deathtrap. It's a co-op tower defense/ARPG hybrid. It looks/plays a lot like Diablo (pick a class. Build a skill tree. Kill hordes of enemies). But each class comes with their own kinds of buildable traps in addition to the ARPG autoattacks + magic attacks. You need to build your traps (towers), and defeat each level of X waves of enemies coming through a small map/path.   
  
So there's the mindless killing elements, but also a strategy element as the levels get harder and you need to actually plan what traps/skills need to be used for each level.  
  
Edit: Holy shit how could I forget. ""Orcs Must Die 2"". It's also a tower defense game....but it's a fantasy-themed 3rd-person shooter. That would probably be a lot more up his alley than the Diablo-style of ""Deathtrap"". This is, hands down, one of my favourite co-op games ever. It's so much fun. And again, for you, it has good strategy/planning elements. If you try to just shoot/magic everything to death, you're 100% guaranteed to lose. You NEED to have the right traps in the right order, and in co-op they limit your ""trap inventory"" to like 4 or something, so you can't just bring every trap to make a level easy. So good.",3

In short it's a co-op survival experience, kinda like left for dead but in the Warhammer fantasy setting with less ""shoot"" and more ""bonk"", ""smash"", ""slash"", """"stab"". What l'm saying is melee combat. You can play as 5 character of the amazing group of Ubersreik 5 each of them with 3 classes (4th ones are on the way) and a plethora of weapons, guns and outfits to choose from. I personally love the game. If you decide to check it out then ignore the ""versus mode trailer"" as it's been 2 years since anouncement and FS is gonna push out the classes first. Try and check out the ""gameplay trailer"" for most info. If you dislike the fantasy setting you can wait for Darktide to come out, which is or will be a similar game but in the Warhammer 40k universe which is just as grimdark but a lot more sci-fi.",2

Underground 2 doesn't have any police. It has a lot of car customisation, but you should probably skip it if that isn't your thing.

One general racing game I'd recommend - I really like racing games lol - would be Sega Rally 2. Daytona USA could be fun too, but there isn't that much content in the console releases of the games, even though the games are fun. The XBLA version, for example, is just the Beginner, Advanced, and Expert stages and the ability to play online with your friends. I guess Daytona USA 2001 could be fun.

Because you played Spiderman and liked it, I *really* think you should play Spiderman 2. There's also Spiderman for the PS4, but I've never played it so I can't vouch for it. You could also try out the original Star Wars Battlefront 2.

One series I'd recommend is Tony Hawk. More specifically, from Pro Skater 1-4 up to Underground 1. Some of the other ones are alright, but those are objectively the best ones.

Battlefield 2: Hard but wonderful online modern day multiplayer hardcore fun.

Team Fortress2: simple-ish online team based kill-a-lot game. Great fun.

Medieval II total war: An amazing turn based war game with real time battles.

CIV IV: more turn based fun, start from the stone age and grow your empire to a futuristic age.

Zombies you say : Left 4 dead 1 and two should cater for your undead requirements.

Half-life 2- Great FPS with a nice story. Also then you can be as pissed off as the rest of us and await episode 3.

If you want an MMORPG, you could do a lot worse than World of Warcraft, it has 11 million accounts for a good reason. Or you could try Dungeons and Dragons online as it is free to play and only requires micro payments if you want more.

But that is more a multiplayer thing, you probably want some single player games. So here is a good list

* Dragon Age: Origins (does take a while to complete, so it might be hard if you take long breaks in between)

* Mass Effect 1/2 - My favorite games ever along side...

* Half Life 2 and Episodes 1-2 - pretty awesome games and they have texture packs to bring them up to speed a bit

* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - The best Star Wars game ever (I never played Tie Fighter) You can get it on Steam for ~$10.

* C&C Red Alert 3 - the last game before they destroyed the C&C franchise, campy fun. You'll enjoy it if you've played any C&C game since the first one

* Portal - you'll pick this up with the Orange Box (and get TF2 and HL2 EP1&2 in) is brilliant, plus its pretty quick, perhaps 10(ish?) hours to complete

* Supreme Commander 2 - Better than the first one because its quite a bit quicker, Single player is interesting enough. Multiplayer skirmishes are fun and you can at least play against a computer opponent if you wish.

* Battlefield: Bad Company 2 - Since you are on the PC this is what MW2 should have been. I play it on the 360 and love it.

What graphics card do you have now? It is almost more important than your CPU. If you want triple monitor support go with a 5850/5870 if you have the cash, otherwise a used GTX275 is <$200 and will rock games, or try for a GTX470.",3

"Asking redditors for a thoughtful recommendation: What one addictive PC game from the past five years would be your drug of choice?
",11,"Well, I'll definitely recommend either Civilization IV or a game from the Total War series. Both are mainly strategy games, and Civ IV is the epitome of turn based strategy game, the game is frequently compared with chess, and the Total War series has a more simplified turn based gameplay, but complements it with absolutely awesome and unparalleled real time battles. Both of them are absolutely time soakers, and I have spent countless hours in each. All of them are a case for ""always installed"", and whenever I'm done playing the most recent games, I fall back to those.

The Total War has three main titles: Rome: Total War, Medieval II: Total War and Empire: Total War. People usually have varying degrees of preference, my favorite is Empire but there are many who prefer Rome. I guess it's up to what period of history you like best.

Civ IV has two expansions, Warlords and Beyond the Sword, and they're both highly recommended.

I guess it's up to you. There's no way I can recommend one of those instead of the other. Both those games are complex, and you'll spend hours managing an empire / civilization. Both will keep you awake until 3am thinking ""alright, just one more turn"". You asked for one game but I really think you could buy all 4 and just try them out, you'll  not regret.

Oh, they are also both available on Steam.

EDIT: Holy Shit! I just found out that Civ is also on sale on Steam right now. Don't think, just buy it and you decide later

[Civ IV complete for US$10 motherfucker, no way you can't let that get away](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/1618/)

[Empire: Total War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/10500/)

Again, my personal recommendation is that you buy all 4 games on this list. This you probably have you set for the next 10 years.",2
"Asking redditors for a thoughtful recommendation: What one addictive PC game from the past five years would be your drug of choice?
",11,"Several other people have mentioned Team Fortress 2.  I think one of the things that makes Team Fortress 2 rather unique is that although it's a first-person shooter, the emphasis isn't really on guns.  Of the game's nine classes, less than half have a gun as their primary asset.  For the others, there are rocket launchers, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, kits for building stationary guns, healing beams, and knives.  There are no assault rifles in Team Fortress 2.

Team Fortress 2 is one of the few FPS games where you can do incredibly well even if you're bad at aiming.  Although games like Counter-Strike do involve a heavy amount of strategy, at the end of the day the outcome of most encounters depends on your ability to put your crosshair on your opponent's head faster than they can.  With Team Fortress 2, you often see enemies long before they enter your effective firing range.  The game moves fast enough to keep things from getting dull, but it's slow enough that strategy and team play become especially important.

I definitely recommend trying out Team Fortress 2, even if you're usually not an FPS fan.  One of the biggest addicts I know was an RTS junkie before he got hooked on TF2.",2

It is possible to play just a couple hours a week (just do a few pvp battlegrounds on  or a couple quick 5 man dungeons with the party matching system).  I really do think WoW is one of the best games of all time and you do get your moneys worth at $15 / month.  ",1

There are loads of great and some not so good games out there, my recommendation if you are considering a mmorpg game, go visit the site by the genre name, they have lots of info. SWG really did it for me in the old days, but alas that is not quite the same now. 

current personal favorites include Splinter Cell Conviction, BadCompany2 and Mass Effect 2.

",11,"If you like escapism, epic feeling, and a game that can last you a long time with replayability, I'd say look into Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. This is my single player recommendation, at least. It's a first person RPG with ridiculous customizability options for your character. You're never going to run out of combinations of skills, spells, etc to build a character on.

Another option I have to recommend is World of Warcraft. When I first started playing, it was mind blowing how large the game world is. MMORPG just means that when you log in, there's going to be other people playing the game as well (also a monthly subscription). You aren't required to play, either. You can log in a year later and pick up right where you logged off. The fear of 12 year olds is unfounded, because Blizzard is good at taking care of assholes. Also, you have the option to ignore people so you don't see anything they say. You can download this game from the blizzard site and play 10 days for free first to see if you even enjoy it.

My dad is 50 and he likes both of these games. Loves warcraft. He used to play Age of Empires as well. Bought every single one, including age of mythology. 

Also, not sure if Oblivion is too graphics intensive. It has settings for raising and lowering quality, on your comp. You can also play it on PS3. WoW's graphics requirements are really low, but it's at least 10 gigs.",1

",11,"World of Warcraft.  Just do not get involved in a guild if you don't want to waste too much time on there.  Use the dungeon matching system that they added to get 5 man groups and que pvp battlegrounds solo.  It is possible to play only a few hours a week.  Be your own guild leader and have the entire guild bank to yourself.  WoW is one of the best games out there and at $15/month you definitely get your moneys worth.  Download helpful plug-in's like healbot (definitely recommended if you are playing a healing class) and cabonite (only download these from trusted places like curse gaming).
