Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-10-22,this game has to be one of the most compelling multiplayer games i have ever played. i would strongly recommend giving it a try.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-09-25,it was fun for the first 2 weeks now its boring i played it for 12 days and now that i have finessed i cant play it again
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-09-05,not on the same league as aoe21 but definitely better than aoe3. it is a solid game all in all
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-08-09,game has no real soul. on top of not being able to pause and issue commands in single player.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-08-05,boring ontherails campaigns without any freedom of choices game is without a soul and there is too much talking all the time during your gameplay. if i wanted to watch a documentary i would use my tv and not my pc. graphics are cartoony with overproportioned units only the videos are great. big meh
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-27,"way too many trolls in online multiplayer. tons of disconnects when queueing  all players in a match are punished when a random disconnects makes no sense. developers leave bugs unaddressed for years, don't waste your money and time."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-09,"started off strong with captivating gameplay, but certain design choices later soured the experience. despite this, it remains enjoyable overall."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-02,ehhh. too much to do. i appreciate the simplicity of civilization revolution.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-02-01,"unfortunately, it is one of the best strategy games. i say unfortunately because even though they did their best, there is still a lot of room for improvement. i guess they don't want to waste time."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-19,"he is back ! finally ! taking the universe of age of empire 2, crossing it with starcraft for the isometric side, improving some mechanics that were a little too rigid on aoe2, here is ao4. the visual seems a little dated, but you get used to it relatively quickly. we find our bearings on civilizations like the english and the french. then if we are looking for something new, other civilizations are there. the single playerstory mode is nice, well documented and less fantasy than the previous opuses concerning historical reality."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-27,"i would have scored this game an 8 or 9 but the single player experience leaves a lot to be desired. however, the multiplayer is absolutely fantastic."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-11,"looked promising on trailers, but what i actually got was... no freedom, full of talking, guided experience. i didn't like 3rd, but 4th... it felt like everything was wrong with it. no fun at all."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-07,gameplay  8 graphics  8 story  8 sound  8 overall  8
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-06,"age of empires iv is a great rts game. imagine designing a game to satisfy all of these audiences and more campaign fans, competitive multiplayer fans, citybuilder fans, historical storytelling fans, etc.  all of that kind of content for all these fans is in the game! the developers have improved the title in significant ways through several balance and patch updates, and content updates. some gameplay mechanics are new to the series e.g., influence mechanic from landmark or other buildings to improve something in the vicinity, and more recently, the development team has completely reworked some civilizations from their launch state e.g., improving an english landmark by offering a novel unit for the game  a mounted king with a healing aura bonus. there is a healthy and stable competitive scene that seems to grow slightly after every major tournament, and even more after major content updates e.g., after the ottomans and malians were added as new civilizations. the modding community is showing promise too, creating more than a handful of addicting custom game modes e.g., castle blood automatic remake from age of empires 2, a team arena mode, and even more creative concepts. the original campaigns the normans, the hundred years war, the mongol empire, and the rise of moscow were well made, but the documentarystyle storytelling welcomed mixed reviews from fans. but make no mistake, the documentaries were wellshot, informative, interesting, and nicely intertwined into related campaign missions. to speculate, the game has a healthy future both for content updates and for competitive and relaxed multiplayer scenes."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-15,improves on some things but overall is still the same experience as the previous installments.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-08,"very very empty. the graphics, campaign and new mechanics are good, but we don't have many civs, don't have scenario editor and don't have a good history tab."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-08,"a year after it's release on pc somehow relic entertainment  world's edge managed to port this game on xbox systems and it's amazing, you are in full control of your army and it doesn't feel weird using the controller at all, i couldn't recommend it enough."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-07,"very bad graphic browser like men not visual good slow responsive screen units ,not recommended an multiplyer no players at all"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-01,"it's actually great aoe. love the historic campaign so far. it feels like direct upgrade and mix of aoe2aoe3 and also it feels a bit like stronghold. it just needs some more work and some stuff is really missing like player scores ingame, minimap filters and many other features should be added so i hope it will get frequent updates and i can't wait for the mods and hopefully, in time, multiplayer will be as successful as in aoe2"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-01,
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-09,not even 1 tenth of the game of its predecessors and not engaging. just get anything else or one of the older games in the series this one isnt it.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-05,"great! great! great! historical videos, stories, and gameplay! wow. such a nice rts. but sometimes ai is just horrible. in any case, i am just glad that i decided to take a break from consoles and play this game. extremely recommended."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-09,nice game. would love to play again in future. good graphics and mechanics!!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-15,"this is really great real time strategy game, especially all countries have different specialty and you can feel good this when you're playing different countries."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-17,"historical narrating is really good as a person who loves history i really liked that. after some years now we have a real time strategic game with a good and cooked graphics. it has an acceptable gameplay, differences between factions are good. this game reminds me age of mythology."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-25,horrid cartoon art style and graphics with exaggerated proportions and low detail models. probably because this pile of dog water is coming to consoles. story missions should have been like previous games instead of this pseudo documentary immersion breaking format. mp is a wallcannon spam fest with some maps too big for any sort of early skirmishes and now there even seems to be resource hacks. but what would you expect from lelic the team that destroyed dow....
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-09,the best aoe to date. i really enjoyed how the added a campaign that was not only a great story but a real one aswell. the game overall plays well with no issues. the improvements they made over previous installments were all good ones. really glad this series still gets attention after 25 years!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-31,"me encanto el juego, de lo mejor que hay en juegos de estrategia en tiempo real"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-11,solid classic rts with a fascinating documentary wrapped into the campaign interwoven as each new mission starts. the gameplay is addictive if a little repetitive over longer sessions of play.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-21,story with realworld cutscene design is really good. gameplay a bit messy but ok for me. looking for console release.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-04,"i love the game. after over 200 hours it still makes fun. the ai is much better than in aoe2 and it is easier to focus on troop movements and strategies for casular gamers. i like the graphics, the nations and the single player campaigns are also very nice with a lot of content and education. there are not too many nations, but it takes a while until you master only one of them. i can fully recommend and am looking forward to the continous improvements and additional content."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-30,"it's age of empires iii in a more modern and more balanced jacket, with interesting gamechangers and a full team of developers, analysts and players playing the game for balance updates, which is great. the ladder is a good feature. the win conditions with landmarks is a fantastic change. vision and hill usage is great, and in single player everything is wellexplained and clear, as opposed to aoe2, where you had to google and watch youtube videos to find out specific game features. being able to stand on walls is so logical and thankfully it's in there. real sim city vibes, i love it. it's game pace is much quicker games can easily be won after 1015 mins. however, after launch age of empires 4 started the game started off as rather clunky in gameplay and pathing, luckily most is fixed now. what remains rediculous is that arrows can't miss their target and will follow a unit anywhere once it's shot by a town center or archer. lastly, the civilizations are so different, they are hard to learn and you see many onetrick pony's in the game. on the contrary, single player does learn you some civs. single player should have included every civ, however, it feels a bit empty, short, quick to play fully."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-03,gameplay wise and graphics wise nothing too special. it's just a more modern version of aoe2. overall the game lacks a ui that immerses you into the game. it looks too modern. gameplaywise they added some new features but these are also not really groundbreaking.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-08-02,"a big request to make the russian voiceover for the game, as it is very inconvenient to read the subtitles, as i'm visually impaired."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-07-31,"graphic i personally don't think the proportions are right. the hotkey menu with epochsorted buildings takes a lot of getting used to. i found the division into civil and military from the old predecessor to be considerably more convenient  especially with the new hotkeys in the de. the graphic style is way too comical. the gold looks weird, the stones are kinda weird. however, i think fields, buildings, forests and most units are okay. the animations are all very smart too. what surprises me there are no racespecific differences between the camps. and they also don't change their appearance when epoch advancement  why? the mill in aoe ii is derived from a donkey mill to a windmill. i thought that was very nice. in addition, the buildings were mostly racespecific  here, as i said not. audio creation very clever, little criticism. except that the fields burn for too long and the noise really gets on my nerves. cards the map selection looks spartan. the cards that are there are playable.example black forest  today's dark forest yes, we were used to having  to use moba jargon  lanes to the enemy. these are almost still there. the problem is that they are built like labyrinths. far too probable, with no natural expression. one could also say they are rigid. sometimes the lane has a perfect right angle. there are hardly any curves or bulges. and exactly in the middle there are two clearings, each with a holy place. yes, of course balancetechnically definitely understandable. only isn't it that the cards are so obvious? why should i play with a face down card? seriously i don't discover anything new anyway. if you know one, you know them all. yes, the resources are slightly different from time to time. but the maps always have the same structure. ai well, i'm a pve player, so i often play ai vs ai. for me, aoe simply means playing a round in peace to switch off your head and just do something else instead of studyingwork and so on. it's my  yes, even if aoe is the most hectic rts in the world next to starcraft  resting place. admittedly, the enemy ai !can! be demanding. so far i've played on hard and very hard and i did have my problems at first  i guess it was the warming up though. all in all, the ai is okay as an enemy. as an ally, however? absolute crap! just played a round of black forest with the chinese. because you can build quite a lot of landmarks as a chinese, you need a relatively large amount of space. and so that the tax collectors can collect money, it would be nice if you could somehow get your buildings close together. the planning itself also worked. until my ally, for reasons i couldn't understand, came up with the bright idea hey! i'll build a second base. in my ally's base! and grab their berries. and their rocks. and their gold!  yes! that's what the ai did in aoe ii too. and in principle i have no problem with stealing resources. had my ally been in distress it would have spread to me to rebuild  no problem, total understanding. because i was calm and able to defend him  !in front of the enemy base!  there was no reason to nest with me. there was no reason to pave his fort in the center of my village, or put two mills next to my berries, that i didn't even have the option to plant my mill fields because his mills were in the way. in aoe ii no thing  onager out, click ax icon, demolish ally's buildings. alternatively in the definitive edition chat on, 69, pling on the building. tear down the building at this position  rmms  done. this allowed you to control the ai a little, especially in the definitive edition. that worked great. guess what's not possible in aoe iv. 1. use onagers to correct such stupid construction errors 2. give orders to the ai via chat. god knows if the ai even notices plings. because while the ai in aoe ii always reacted in the chat a little wood please  right away, sire! palim 1001000 wood came as a tribute, or attack the enemy from this position  it can i'm not, sire, the ai doesn't react at all. in aoe iii  what mmn. was also a flop  at least the ai had some character by taunting the player. but she doesn't do that anymore either. she is there. there is no option to interact with her. she is just there. minus point to the power of 10! but since i can only complain about the ally ai, i will return to aoe ii here as well. campaign documentaries are nice. they are fun and i read a lot of texts from the story section in aoe ii as well. personally, i think it's okay that you unlock short documentaries with every mission  even if i think that the videos should be available from the start via a story section. but when i play a campaign, i actually expect  preferably historically accurate  that the story is told either from the point of view of a soldier through cutscenes, as in aoe ii from the heroic point of view."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-07-24,"great skill based game! only your skill matters here. instead of developing a character in an rpg by leveling up you develop yourself from time to time. there is always a good reason why you lost the last game. learn from every lost game, don't repeat the mistakes you made and you will be a high elo player very soon. don't believe what others say, game is balanced as it is. you need to be at least top 1 to notice balance issues. like i said, only your skill depends. a former master sc2 player"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-07-06,"the biggest negative about this game is the community constantly complaining about bugs and missing features. the game itself is extremely rewarding and feels completely different whether you play 1v1, 2v2 or even 4v4. coopteamplay is amazing and with season 2, this game will be anough polished for all players to give it a try or come back to it. if you fix this, 10  10 stars. there is just one thing i want the devs to take care of if you target an enemy siege unit, your units will run in and target only this unit with their semilongrange torches, that's perfect unit control. but if you attack move on a single archer with your knights, they will circle and circle around the enemy and die, because that archer is not to reach. what you need to do is attack move the ground in front of the archers and never click on a single enemy to attack move. this is a noob killer, and the attack move should work differently. even a single rightclick on an enemy should not cause this problem."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-05-03,"graphics and performance.  micro, fov, hotkeys, number of civilizations and campaigns. it is a 2021 game and this has to be considered. just talking about the multiplayer, it's not that bad, but far from being an improvement to the saga. the ii de is still the best option by far. aoe i 1997  610 aoe ii 1999  1010 aoe iii 2005 310 aoe iv 2021 410"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-26,"over a decade of waiting for another title inferior to age of empires 2. hell, age of empires 3 had better graphics than this. bravo, microsoft."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-06,"this game hasn't a soul, there is no atmosphere what makes it  boring the games of ensemble studios wereare much more fun"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-12,"beginning with the good parts  they've brought back the good old medieval timeset.  the investment in historical research is noticeable, and the storytelling aspect is the best ever seen.  game seems overall balanced, while being fun at the same time  good for newcomers to age of empires. for the bad parts  it shouldn't be called age of empires, as it departs completely from the series main mechanics.  the astounding new graphics are on par with stronghold 2, literally age of empires 3 original one, not even de had better graphics.  if you're an avid aoe series fan, used to micromanagement and lowlevel field strategies, this is not the game for you it's basically only combatchain, you can't even dodge projectiles...  the overall ui and hotkeys are a complete backstep, more akin to company of heroes than age of empires."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-02,"i am very impressed and incredibly happy with the title. note, while not incredibly competitive, i love the single player content. it reminds me of the good times 20 years ago. well bloody done people"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-24,"aoe ii,            3,    3 def edition,  ,  .      100            ,  ,       ,         aoe 4  .  ,   .  ,      ,         ,   ,          ,        ."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,"people complaining about graphics being too low in an rts do not know how an rts works. try loading in a big frigging army and see if your fps survives. performance  your units looking like a diva. game runs nice, civs feel unique and you actually learn something if you want to as you unlock documentaries they recorded for this game. if you are one of those nerds like me that read the descriptions in age of mythology you will greatly appreciate this. i would give this game a higher score, but it did have some, albeit not directly game breaking, bugs that show up now and then at launch in some of their campaign missions. it also misses some features at launch like saving your game in multiplayer or pausing the game in multiplayer when you need to take a leak while playing with a friend. if you care about gameplay and think performance and skill matter more over your buildings and units wearing a nice and fancy pixel dress this game is for you. if you'd rather look like a sparkling princess, play the games those 010 reviewers are playing."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-11,nothing but fun all day the gameplay refreshed the story intresting so much videos and storytelling of history. so many unlocks to keep playing each era of history has so many story missions. building building units upgrades are so simple to use
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-09,"potentially great. the good points said about the game already, i would also say. i really just want to send a message to the developers hope they read this. please add more customisation options. specifically, 1 i find the game speed too fast when there's lots happening. please offer a speed selection option for single player, which allows us to slow down the game when it's complex or speed up the game early on when not much is happening. 2 please allow a free pause. this allows you to pause the game, analyse the situation, and give orders, then resume the game playing. some people believe free pause is cheating. that's fine, if you don't like it, don't use it. free pause could be a tick box in the options to enable or disable. i like free pause because i enjoy having the time to analyse a complex situation, and having the time to assign orders to my units to implement my plan. without free pause or slowing the speed, the game bec0mes a hurried, actionsperminute actions frenzy. some people may like that, fine, that's why the suggestion is to allow customisation options and let players choose the type of play they enjoy."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-07,this game has the worst graphics of all the games i've played. the worst aoe of all time.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-17,"it's a great game because it's similar to the good old aoe 2, the age of kings. the developers did a good job in the art design, the ui, the sounddesign and also the fractions. it looks good even on my 7 year old gaming pc. only in 4 vs 4 games i have to go on low settings. the campaign is also very good. i like also the history videos. great stuff. there is some content to come with aoe 4 and i really think it has the potential to become played for years. we just have to build up a strong community and playerbase. 810 is just for one reason there is no option to buy a dvd or blueray just download and if ordered in a box it is just some cheap paper without any love for detail. to be said better having a cheap box for a good game than a good box for a cheap game."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-12,great job bringing aoe back into the spotlight. i wish there was more countriescultures to play but i'm sure that will come with time. this game could have only been better if they had added more trebuchets.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-10,this game is poorly done. graphics . game response slow. i am playing and not addicted. i'd rather play candy crush. aoe 2 and aoe 3 were great and i could play for hours. this one not so. i think the main problem is the units don't respond how you expect... like if you grab a treasure chest of 100 gold it's not like you walk over it and just get it. you have to click a certain way... it's frustrating. i didn't give is 0 because the history lessons in between the limited campaigns i did play are good.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-09,"good campaign, bad multiplayer and graphics feel worse than in aoe iii.. the game has low dynamics, ugly graphics, poor ui. each civilization, in my opinion, has little difference from each other... but since there are no more strategies, the score is 8."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-06,gostei muito deste game a desenvolvedora conseguiu desenvolver uma campanha histrica com uma narrativa bem atraente parabens.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-06,"comparado con las entregas anteriores este me parece el mas flojo, el primero fue innovador pero las mecnicas no eran las mejores, el segundo es el mejor en todo sentido, avanzo de era, de la antigua a la media, llevo las mecnicas a otro nivel, y que con el paso de las actualizaciones del juego llego a un punto donde se perfeccionaron demasiado permitiendo las mejores partidas multijugador de todas, el tercero avanzo de la edad media a la moderna, lo cual es algo que agradezco mucho, sin embargo los ejrcitos se redujeron y eso hizo que las partidas multijugador no fuesen tan emocionantes, sin embargo la campaa con su gran apartado visual es de mis favoritas, sin embargo esta cuarta entrega recicla la edad media, mata casi al 100 el micromanejo, y adems el apartado grafico pareciera que volvimos al 2010"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-06,amazing game! i play 12 games every day! i would recommend if you enjoyed aoe2
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-06,"best rts right now, that brings all elements together of fast strategy games and a bit slower economy aspects."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-05,rts   .              .
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-02,"this is the first age of empires game i have ever played, as a fan of rts genre i hate the gameplay of this game, it's boring and unimpressive and the graphics are a shame for a 2021 game the charachters are as big as building and they look stupid and slow and too unrealistic i miss the great rts games like warcraft and older stronghold games"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-27,age of empires iv is the best age of empires and the best strategy game ever! i love the campaign and multiplayer mode and looking forward new add ons with new civs!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-26,"yup, this is aoe, great game so far, recommend u guy play it. the graphic and  great ! gameplay so good.... pvp is the most fun and dramatic, campaign is an art ! some little bug and ai is not that great but it still good and will be update soon !"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-25,aoe4 gives off strong aoe2 vibes and it feels great to play! really takes you back.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-23,"it's hard to believe this is an aoe game released in 2021! the graphics are horrendous, just as if they stole the models from stronghold 2 and put some lousy textures on them! not only that but the ai is absolutely pathetic, most units would start spinning like a bunch of headless chickens when engaged in fighting and the single player is beyond boring. the only good thing about it is the name, which unfortunately the actual game doesn't live up to, even in the slightest. a hastily made piece of trash, more suitable to be a free mobile game."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-23,"i'm currently playing this game via game pass for 1. i would normally buy it through steam but i don't think it's worth 110 nzd. i'll buy it from steam once the price drops to about half that. i don't think it's a bad game but it's not as good as the fan boys are saying. do some of you guys really think it's a 1010 in it's current state? come on, that's a big call. my short story is that i think it's about a 710 right now in it's current state. it feels like this game has been designed more for causal gamers. initially, i don't have a problem with that however, aoe 2 de has proved that you can have a complete game be suitable for both causal and hard core, without much of a compromise. i'll be following this games development closely over the next two years and if some of the issues are improved upon then i'll be happy to change this review to reflect that."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-22,"im gonna give it 8 out of 10 just because i feel like this game should get more civilizations and a bit more features in next updates. compared to previous ae's where they had more civilizations and some tribes i think this game deserves getting more stuff like that too. other than that game is very fun, challenging and engaging."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-20,"game stays true to its origins in terms of rts point and click with an amazing historical accuracy of history. at times, i felt like i was watching the history channel and not actually playing a game lol. all in all, yes, 100 worth the release price and relic revived my confidence on this great gem! i cannot wait till company of heroes 3 releases after playing this. what you see on the 4k hdr video cut screens is nice from other players or screen shots, but what you don't experience when playing the game is the history that draws you into each stage of the campaign experience before reliving it as you control the battlefield. all i can say is wow, they knocked this out of the park and then some."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-20,"best game of the series, dont listen to the babies whos till play aoe2, they live in the past. with some balance and updates will turn into best rts ever."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-18,"all civizilations have diffirent gameplay its very good in aoe 2 almost all civizilations gameplay is same graphics 1010 very good. campaign,multiplayer and singleplayer modes are very good too. i played aoe 4 102.7 hours"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-18,"this is a successful sequel to the aoe series, following the footsteps of aoe2 a little more than the others but with a few aspects of aoe3 trickled in. the game isn't perfect but with a few patches and upcoming content it's a great rts for casual and competitive play. yes, there are fewer civs but they play vastly differently as opposed to previous games' starting civs. there are a lot of details of love in this game that make it pop such as the language and appearance evolve as you age up. it will only get better with time and as the team works on balance and content for the game. the campaign itself is very educational and the cutscenes are a beautiful mesh of real life footage overlayed with golden reimaginings of the soldiers on spot. i can't wait to see more of these in future expansions. the issues that i currently see and i have faith they will fix them  personal feature wishlist  unit pathing can be difficult and clunky  ability to choose your color in skirmishes, maybe add more variety of color  in game taunts like aoe3 are sorely missed  wololo  when graphics set to max the game looks blurry for no reason. for now i set a 50 sharpen in nvidia control panel and it's fine.  follow and patrol commands for units is missing  map editor and modding  random civ option  save, load, rejoin games  improved map generation, right now there are small problems with balancing. some of this has already been confirmed as on the way in the next several months. overall it's the aoe sequel i've been waiting for the past dozen  years and i can't wait to see more. i really hope they support it for years to come with qol, features and 3 dlc with new campaign and civs."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-17,great game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-17,i am having a good time with age of empires iv so far. the gameplay is fairly straightforward and anybody with rts experience will find it easy to hit the ground running. i think the historical aspects of the game are greatlove seeing the armies overlaid on top of modern images. they really need to add the ability to save andor pause multiplayer games  i play a lot of coop against the computer and the inability to saveresume a multiplayer game is killing me and prevents me from rating this higher. it is ridiculous to expect people to sit there for hours with no break...life for most of us simply does not work that way.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-17,"sebagai orang yang main seri age of empires dari kecil, menurutku aoe4 tidak jauh berbeda dari seriseri sebelumnya, itu bukan berarti hal yang buruk. ada 8 civilization dan semuanya memiliki gameplay yang berbeda, untuk saat ini menurutku setiap civs nya masih belum balance, ada beberapa yang perlu di buff atau nerf. untuk campaign, cerita yang dibawakan ada 4 dan diisi dengan video sejarah yang sangat menarik dan informatif. untuk grafis menurutku seharusnya bisa lebih bagus. 8.410"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-16,"good game. got it in gamepass from xbox. she deserves your attention. i'm not a super fan of this episode, but i really liked this part."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-15,"recuerdos de la infancia y de la era de oro de age of empires. gracias microsoft, supieron escuchar a los usuarios y corrigieron los errores del 3. recupera lo mejor del 2 e incorpora detalles muy valorables en jugabilidad, grficos e historia. enhorabuena para todos los amantes del gnero."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-15,"i would not actively buy this game, but its ok if you get it on gamepass it feels like a generic dumbed down version of age of empires 2. very generic units and very few nations to choose from, there is little soul to this game and the combat looks like poorly animated blobs with no significant strategic option's except ro have more units the graphics are a bit dull and reminiscent of a mid 2000s rts, similar to battle for middle earth but not as good physics. the only new positive factor is the historical documentaries it plays betwern missions"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-15,on realise game felt like there a beta test as they dont wana test it itself  ai and campaign is awful  no ranked  no balance  many bugs interesting nation difference
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-15,"an awesome return of the franchise. relic did a good job here. the potential is huge, like aoe2."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-14,"no perfect game, but the super fun gamplay lets you forget about the many minor flaws. a worthy successor to the age series."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-13,"aoe2 was my first ever pc game, and also my favorite one, glad to see aoe4 is finally released."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-13,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-13,"it feels like a good remake of aoe ii but there's nothing that makes me want to play it for very long. it honestly just feels very basic, but maybe that's what people want from it. the menus for setting up 'skirmish' matches are awful, they have a few presets, but even just to set up a 4 player free for all with no teams takes way too long. i also think that the difference in difficulty levels is too large. the standard ai difficulty is challenging in a 4 player match, but dropping it down a level, the ai literally can'twon't do anything to stop you."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-11,"excelente jogo, ficou muito bom a gamelas, os efeitos sonoros. a histria. perfeito. parabns ms."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-11,"yes, the game runs on 1 core. yes, the game requires dx12. yes, there are many jambs in the game hotkeys, statters, no ranked at the start of the game. but it's !new! part of one of the most popular rts series. which rts series is still alive? wc3? hello blizard with their reforged. sc2? blizard again, and given the current state of the studio, they are unlikely to be able to revive, even if they want to. cc? hi ea with their policy of burying the original series and unwillingness to properly support the developers rip visceral games. be happy with the remaster of the first part with a bunch of bugs on top on the already clumsy engine of the original. there is little hope for company of heroes 3. either it will be a clone of the 1st part with bows, or it will repeat the fate of the 2nd. stronghold? warlords from firefly studios showed that nothing good can be ugly developed by developers. the dow series, supreme commander, cossacks, rise of nations and other less wellknown rts are also dead. attempts by indie developers to do something serious turn out to be a failure iron harvest could have shown something in theory, but the balance and variety of mechanics is close to 0. given that aoe4 has a well thought out gameplay, it is interesting and varied  the game will live on and, hopefully, evolve. the rest can be finished without serious injections of manhours. p.s. and there is also hope for aom2"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-11,"the king is back, long live the king! for those of you wondering what previous title from the franchise is close to this, the answer would be 75 aoe2, and 25 aoe3 and aom. needs more patching and improvements, but rts is back baby!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-10,"when aoe iv was announced, i was skeptical, but after having played a dozen or so hours almost 2 full campaigns i can safely say my doubts were wrong. relic have improved on what aoe2 had already built. i like that they added their own twists, like unit actions  la company of heroes. the campaigns themselves are what really changed my mind. the cutscenes in between missions are almost out of a bbc documentary and you unlock additional videos and historical tidbits as you go along. of course there is room for improvement but the game is definitely worth your money if you're a fan of the series and rts in general."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-09,"a great game, with a marvelous story, even tho the second age of empires remains one of my favourites, and one of the first games i had played as a young lad, thos"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-09,iiiiiiiiii game score  71 iiiiiiiiii
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-09,could the graphics be better for a aaa big budget title? yes are there pathing issues that need to be worked out in a patch? yes does the game feel underwhelming if you have impossibly high expectations for aoe? yes so why am i giving it a 1010? because its so fun and addicting that as soon as you pick up a copy of the game you'll forget all the reviews and forget that you have a life. buyer beware.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-09,"while it is not a 1010 smash, it is for sure a good start to the rts revolution many players are waiting for. the campaign is pretty cool but not very good at teaching the player the ins and outs of the game or the 8 different factions themselves but this is for sure a game made with multiplayer and possibly esports in mind. i think the game will vastly improve over time and as most of the top rts stars are converging onto the title, there is a bright future for aoe4 it shouldn't cost 60 in its current state and 40 would be a better price. although it has not been announced whether or not there will be priced additional content in the game so i won't take the cost into account when giving my score. i'd give the campaign a 610 and the multiplayer experience a 9.510 although there are some balance issues and exploits and as the game is clearly made and advertised with multiplayer in mind, my overall score is 910 very cool fun fact the language of your faction will progress through the ages, dark age english voice lines are impossible to understand, and the imperial age english speak a rather modern style of the english language."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-08,". 10    .     ,   .    game pass"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-08,we waited a long time but it was worth the wait. and very low system required.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-08,"good old rts gameplay, exactly what ive expected. i was a big fan of aoe2 and this one comes pretty close."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-07,"i like the game very much, i have been waiting for it for a long time. decent gameplay, highlevel sound, the campaign is solid and movies are the best. the graphics only thought it would be better. overall, i highly recommend it, especially for fans of the series."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-07,"the alarm bells went off when i heard they had decided to not include blood and expected the modders to do it for them. but i didn't expect it to be this lacking. i only play aoe in multiplayer, so that's what i'm reviewing 50 gbs, 2021... and the graphics are mediocre. there's no save or pause. there are 6 civilisations to choose from as opposed to aoe2's 35. aoe2 was made in 1999. no randomizing options. no random maps. no random races. you don't choose your colours. the ai aren't named. they're all just called ai. they don't have personalities. no auto scout. it feels like you have a really boring history teacher, instead of the way aoe had of making history fun. this game feels unfinished. i've noticed game developers are struggling with resurrecting old franchises. so here, i'll help step 1 use the most loved model. step 2 work out what people thought needed improvement in the old model. step 3 fix those areas and add extra content  improved graphics. step 4 make anything contentious an option step 5 profit if you have to take important features away from a game old enough to graduate college, leave it alone and move on. make something new. radical, i know. what you don't do is release a half done game. or maybe you do. my generation is pretty gullible. they'll throw money at anything with a name. so, if you're a gamer reading this and wondering if you should buy this game, here's some questions? do you own aoe2, does it work on your machine, and are the old graphics just fine? if yes, then this game isn't worth it. if no, then you might want this game. do you play mp and sometimes have to eat, cook, take a leak, sleep, take care of a babychild, work, or do anything other than play the exact same game without break for several hours? if yes, this game may not be for you. are aesthetics a big deal for you? you might want this. the graphics are lacking for the time but they are better than aoe2. do you intend to only play single player? then maybe, some annoyances are not relevant to sp. do you desperately need a modern game to indulge in nostalgia so bad you're shaking, and just playing the old game isn't getting you there? then yes, this might help your sad condition. condolences. this is probably the closest we're getting to a new aoe that doesn't feel like it's playing itself. so i see the appeal. in another year they might even add all the features they've stripped back. but their comments about letting modders fix their failings is not a good sign and without a time machine i will rate what i see now. you tried, you half succeeded. but you don't get a c grade because the places you disappointed were key to making this something i can play."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-07,good classic rts but has bugs that coould reduce enjoyment by campaign. in multiplayer more polished but still require some qol adjustments. p.s. actualy it should be 810 but those ingame videos about medieval things are amazing!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-07,"whether you're new to the series or have been playing since the early days, age of empire iv knocks it out of the park on nearly every level. new players receive the benefit of a fantastic set of tutorial campaigns, while oldtimers can almost jump right into the action they know and love. there's little not to love here. the graphics are fantastic, the soundtrack is again, almost the best of the series to date, and the gameplay is extraordinary."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-07,best medieval strategy game !!!! after so many years to see a worthy sequel to one of my favorite childhood games. the only thing i would give a minus for is the very bad ai.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-07,"i genuinely cannot get enough of this game. i love the documentaries that play before missions. the villager ai is very good, whereas i feel sometimes the ai for your fighters isnt the greatest but thats an absolute nitpick from an amazing game. cannot recommend anymore and i definitely intend on going back and playing some of the older aoe games."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-07,"i was suprised by this game. the multiplayer team play capabilities are super, you can really play together and create all kinds of possible scenarios. there will be a great variety of battles in this game. the vibe is great and most importantly  its fun to play! if i could change one thing  it would be to slash the possible upgrades with about 50. upgrades are a core functionality concept. yes, they are important and fun. but the current number of possible upgrades are just overhelming and doesnt add playability and enjoyment. but again, all in all, this is great rts game. probably the best at the moment."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-07,la saga aoe continua con su legado. y nos trae un juego renovado pero que mantiene lo clsico. depsues de varios das jugandolo voy a ponerle nota grficos 1010 tiene un toque caricaturesco que le hace ms divertido y nico jugabilidad 910
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-06,"outdated graphics  ui feels lazy, old and clunky  unit cap again, like the old habits  feels like a copy of age of empires and not a step up from aoe 2  lack of unit options patrols, formations, etc  no really primitive age feeling like aoe 2  no wasd camera controls possible even with rebinding  tutorial is well made for newcomers"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-06,"i can recommend this game for sure. i've played aoe since it was released in 1997 and can say for sure that this game is well made, with roots elements from the aoe iii titles. the gameplay is similar to the original aoe's, excellent! in one ward. full disclosure i played only through the campaign and have not yet tested the multiplayer and the skirmish. the campaign is fantastic explained, with 4k video arts based on real battles in the eyes of today's locations including cities, regions, castles, and counties. the moderator is excellently pleased to the ears. one pron for me is that the developers want to keep the oldschool graphic, and i think it is not acceptable for the 2021 title."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-05,"this is mostly different game than originals but i like it. finally there won't be 100 monks in enemy attack. refreshing and relaxing game. i like how they did history lectures in campaign, also short movies about important details like how war horses were used are great."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-05,"brutal. una vuelta a los orgenes. infinito, se nota claramente que est basado en el ii. las civilizaciones son muy distintas y el nivel de aprendizaje el adecuado. va muy fluido incluso con el mapa a tope de recursos. cmo contra me parecen pocas 9 civilizaciones y pocas opciones."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-05,exception work. this game will have a great advenir. i hope the devs wont wait too many time to give us dlc.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-05,"not a bad game. it might help bring a new generation of players to aoe, but for returning players, it's a massive disappointment. there's nothing here to cause players to move over from aoe2, which is still a far superior game. aoe2 has way more features, civs, and better game mechanics. they played it way too safe, and they really needed to do more. just feels outdated at this point, definitely not worth the 60 dollar price tag. 16 years for this??"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-05,"really good mechanics. everything feels smooth. being a long time rts player, i loved the way they crafted this game. 910"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-04,"i love this game soooo much. age of empires has always held a very special place in my heart. aoe ii was the first video game i ever owned at age 9, and not only did it help instill in me a love of video games, but it furthered my love of history. i have played many games since age of empires, from rpgs to shooters, other strategy games and sims, but there is nothing quite like the age of empires formula. when i saw a new game being made, i was both ecstatic and nervous. so many remakes have come across as shallow cash grabs, and the original development studio, ensemble, had been gone for years. i am thus happy to report that the game has, in my opinion, been a great success. you can tell that this game had a lot of love and details put into it, from the cool campaigns to the way soldiers and villagers speak, and it is a worthy successor to its great predecessors. few aaa games now seem to actually have heart behind them, but aoe 4 definitely does. the new gameplay additions and asymmetric civs are enough freshness to keep the game feeling new and exciting, while the original aoe formula has been followed closely enough to make the game still feel like an aoe game rather than a different franchise. for me, it has been a perfect compromise between the new and old, and quite frankly, im a huge fan of all of the new mechanics. this game is by far the best rts game to release in over a decade, and has the potential to continue to grow. i honestly believe that if handled correctly, this game may even outgrow its predecessors. i fully expect to play this game for years to come. p.s. a quick note on negative reviews the aoe community is extremely passionate, especially the aoe 2 community. while i love aoe 2, it is time for the series to grow and modernize, which aoe 4 does expertly. unfortunately, it seems that a vocal minority of aoe 2 fans are opposed to anything which might threaten their beloved game, and seem to have taken to trashing this game simply for the fact that it isnt aoe 2. instead of seeing this as a chance to grow the fandom, they view it as a threat. they build mountains out of anthills by complaining about, in my opinion, extremely minor things, like having to learn a new control scheme, and trash the game for not having the same content as a game that had been contstantly worked on and modified for over twenty years. its a shame, because this is a great opportunity for the rts genre to move forward and grow, but many seem keen to keep it trapped in the past. i love aoe 2, but after playing aoe 4, the amount of positive changes and modern elements is staggering, and it would be hard to go back to the old games now that the series has implemented so many positive new changes."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-04,i'd love to love  i'm really sorry... nostalgy is not enough... back to age of 2 remastered.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-04,best historybased rts. i cannot wait dlcs with more civilizations. campaigns are very interesting and 4k hdr video clips are very informative.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-03,"i really likes this game, soo far i have a blast playing and very addictive, so far i have 200hrs gameplay"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-03,"age of empires 4 traz uma melhora significativa quando comparado com seu antecessor e  o jogo que todos os fs da franquia queriam. pontos positivos civilizaes com caractersticas nicas. nota 10. modo campanha excelente contando batalhas e acontecimentos histricos. nota 10. diversos modos de jogo. nota 10. grficos muito bons. nota 9. animaes muito boas. nota 9. audio design excelente e as vezes at mesmo satisfatrio. nota 10. excelente variedade de mapas e todos bem construdos. nota 10. jogo bem polido e bem otimizado. nota 9. trilha sonora com msicas de alta qualidade, porm pouca variedade de msicas. nota 8. pontos negativos ausncia de um editor de mapa no lanamento. resumo age of empires iv  um dos melhores jogos de 2021"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-03,"first of all, sorry for my english. i've been playing strategy games since i was little. it has always been my favorite genre and the one that i have enjoyed the most games. among the video games i have played and mostly completed you can find empire earth, praetorians, crusaders, total war, tzar, ground control, lotr the battle for the middle earth, starcraft 2, etc. and i am in these comments because in its day, i played aoe, and its 2nd and 3rd, and the magnificent age of mythology. some time ago i found out that this installment would come out and 2 days ago i started playing wanting to be surprised and get excited about these games again. after these days, i find myself a lazy game, with few civilizations and a difference between the units and their upgrades. we will all remember the units from aoe 2, i think all of them were recognizable, along with the buildings and some of their animations and this is one of the things that the game does not achieve. it also has few multiplayer options and few possible strategies, since after all, we all usually play in a very similar way. for my taste, they have not struck a good balance between units, factions or buildings. it does not manage to create different games, or exciting battles. i think that the people who defend this game the most, do not remember much what other games offered, which for my taste, were superior in many characteristics. for my part, i still feel that no one can match what american conquest did in his day in gameplay, tactics, civilizations, units, even use of resources. i just hope they keep improving and completing this game. still, enjoy."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-03,"doesn't revolutionize the formula, and it has some technical problems at launch, but this is honestly a damn good aoe game. moreover, it has the potential to become by far the best in the series, since its graphics and mechanics create a very solid base to build on via mods  future dlcs plus updates. and this is coming from someone who plays aoe since the first one. so, if you are into this type of games, it's definitely worth a buy or at least worth a shot in game pass."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-03,"eventho it has some bugs and stuff to improve, campaing is amazing, the fact that between campaigns there is short documentaries made me rush it. wanted to watch them all, they are so good. ia is awfull, if you are a vs ia player i suggest you to wait til they improve the ia, but multiplayer is amazing. if you have some friends to play with, its a lot of fun."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,"when you can grab this game, if you want to go tactical with lots of history to leran, dont hesitate getting this."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,"great game, and if you are into rts games you will absolutely love this. you will like this."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,"probably on of the best age of empires game ever done, if you play the campaign you wil learn a lot of history in europe."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,"great new addition to the aoe franchise. it is instantly familiar to anyone who played aoe2 but with enough changes to make it feel fresh and new, particularly when you get into the way every civ plays differently. single player campaigns are extremely well done, and i've been enjoying my experience with multiplayer matches so far."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,the graphics are amazing moving is clunky and has no wasd option the games currently balanced for early game rush to hide the lack of end game content lack of civs and campaigns
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,"there is not much to say, one of the best rts i've ever played, and i've played many. age of empires 4 is similar to age of empires 2, but with many improved aspects. sure, there is still needs to add something like other civilizations but as it stands now, age of empires 4 deserves 1010."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,"what the rts needed. it's fun and innovative. the graphics were chosen so that it also runs on smaller systems. the sound backdrop is affected. it is a solid game, it still needs more updates, these were promised by the developers."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,"so the devs called me sexest for not liking the voice actors voice. i thought it was bland and wasnt rough enough to bring me into the setting. since i was a male i was discriminated just for critisms and called a sexest wich is also defamtion of character. this is illegal in the state i live in as well do to the lose of money paying for this product. defemation is the lose of money and then telling others i was sexest. im pro choice for womens rights and trans rights. but being called sexest cause i dont like the voice actor and was wondering when they were going to give a option to change the voice. so the game is actually bad as well and dont suggest to pay for this product at full price i say 10 on sale or game pass. graphics are terrible, animations are terrible, ai pathing is bad, there is no option to turn off pop cap for a sandbox skirimish. all and all i say stay away from this game cause it was made by true sexest."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,stop comparing this to earlier games. the campaigns are really fun and the story telling  videos are top notch. just don't overthink it and start playing. the hours will fly by. has been years since i had so much gaming time.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,"the campaigns are good, they chose interesting time periods, and the presentation is really good. they made some documentaries that go along with them that i love and are genuinely great. my issue is that i am not an aoe 2 super fan. i don't think it's best age of title that's mythology, i don't think it's the best historically influenced rts that'd be rise of nations, it was a great rts for 1999 but has since been long surpassed. as such i find aoe 4 to be very mediocre, because it is one of the most unimpressive and pointless aoe 2 clones ever. it might be better than aoe 3 as it doesn't have any of the additions i disliked but it doesn't progress the series in any way what so ever and as such is more boring so far. graphically it's 10 years out of date. i get making games that can run on potatoes but this barely scales at all. and it doesn't even run that well considering what is being renderedsimulated. there are no quality of life improvements. the new mechanics are slim. the scale has not changed at all. is it a bad game? not really, it's just a pointless one."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,exactly what i expected of the game. if you like multiplayer rts but tired of sc2  definitely try aoe4.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,"if it was the first chapter i would have given a solid 10. but it's the 4th and it's worse than the second and the third. at the moment it has a lot of bugs oh yes aoe 3 had a lot of bugs and still have, but i paid 10 eur for it, not 60. just to mention some of the most common bugs, units jump on and off walls at random they seem to teleport!, units don't know where to go in the middle of a forest, many units don't even defend themselves if you don't command them to attack the enemy. graphics are bad, i mean not only not better than 15 years ago but much more paler, everything seems as if a veil of fog is covering everything. the campaign is long but definitely not interesting. you won't command the same character for more than two missions and if you let he die during the mission, no problem, the mission will go on anyway. there isn't any story, just history. and it may be interesting to see how medieval weapons worked but i would have appreciated a story, a character to follow and a civilization to develop. every mission is just 'defend the castle', 'attack the castle' and the only strategy is to make siege weapons and a lot of soldiers, gain meter by meter and destroy the enemy. many missions can be finished without ever lowering the maximum number of units at your disposal. and that is the next big problem. with a cap of 200 nothing seems real, big battles seem just mock battles done by a poor guy with some plastic soldiers on a pale carpet. there are just a bunch of civilizations and at least two or three of them are practically the same. multiplayer is not bad at all and if you can find a bunch of friends to play with, the game will give you some joy. but aoe ii or iii will give you the same or more joy. improve the performance, add more civilizations and resolve some bugs, then sell it at 30 eur and you will have a good game. now it has too few for too much money."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,"one of the best rts to be released in recent years despite it's technical hiccups. i am glad and thankfull we got a new aoe despite what people here are saying. thank you microsoft, world's edge and relic!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,age of empires iii released in 2005 and this game released in 2021 but it looks like released in 2008 that's all my comment.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"by far the best aoe if you let it be. love the campaign especially, but every aspect of the game is great to me. it isnt perfect and peoples complaints are legit pathfinding, etc., but to me, theyre making a mountain out of a molehill. 1010 recommend"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"este juego es un buen paso adelante para la franquicia y aunque no es perfecto cumple bastante bien , sin duda alguna una gran opcin para pc. y si eres usuario de xbox gamepass es un imperdible."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"i came in with low expectations and wasn't initially a fan of the toyish aesthetic of the graphics. but i've grown to appreciate it and also recognize the whole documentary theme going on throughout the game. first, the obvious, are the realworld 4k shots of historical places and artwork with overlapping cgi that matches the game's art style to deliver a 'national geographic' style presentation. next, i noticed all the yellowgold visual effects like the cgi are really sort of metaphors to present the game world as some sort of virtual reality documentary. you'll notice the gold animations appear on construction animations, for example, to portray the passing of time, signifying multiple people not just your one literal game unit built that cathedral over time. i notice these kinds of visual metaphors throughout the game and really appreciate they put that kind of thought and detail into it. besides that gameplay is great, voicesnarration, score, and sound effects are immersive. wish the load times were shorter but maybe that's on my hardware."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"the king of rts games is back! had to make a new account just to recommend this gem. they didn't reinvent the wheel at all but they took everything great about aoe 2 and 3 and expanded upon it tremendously. you'll definitely get your ass kicked if you're new but it's a ton of fun to just get good. the graphics, ui and history channelstyle cutscenes aren't for everyone, but for me it modernizes the game just enough to still have the nostalgic feel while being an entirely new experience in it's own right. haven't lost track of time while playing like this in a long while"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"it's funny when in 2021 there is no language change, but it is tied to the system. maybe i want to go through the game in french? now what should i change the system language for the sake of this?"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"this is the best rts i've played in years, such an epic return for the greatest rts series of all time! the tutorial is a great intro and the campaign is wonderful and i've even learned some history along the way!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"en resumen es un aoe 2 remake por llamarlo de alguna manera, las campaas es como jugar un documental, estn muy bien echas aparte de que el gameplay es muy divertido aprendes historia de la mejor manera. el diseo artstico esta muy bien logrado, aunque por otro lado el apartado grafico no es de lo mejor pero esta al nivel suficiente para la next gen. adems con los antecedentes de el estudio es un hecho que se ira agregando mas y mejor contenido para mantener al juego con vida y inters para sus usuarios."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"it's actually great aoe. love the historic campaign so far. it feels like direct upgrade and mix of aoe2aoe3 and also it feels a bit like stronghold. it just needs some more work and some stuff is really missing like player scores ingame, minimap filters and many other features should be added so i hope it will get frequent updates and i can't wait for the mods and hopefully, in time, multiplayer will be as successful as in aoe2."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,the piece of garbage graphics 010  2010 year animation 010  1990 year physics 010  1999 year campaign 010 progress from previous games 10010 we had the remaster assets and we used them. the game's quality for  10 a month from microsoft.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"weak storyline, mediocre and boring gameplay, poor optimization. you can pass by, you will not lose anything."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"good gameplay. not bad graphics, also love to watch videos. highly reccomend"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"i am more solo vs ai player and i have to say that aoe4 ai is useless. full of bugs and does nothing interesting. in aoe 2 i couldn't handle strongest ai but here hardest is a joke. beat it in first try. game is full of bugs and stupid moments like all enemies being red even graphs line are red after game ends... gods.... customization of match is minimal. graphic is too cartoonish, can't properly distinguish between soldiers. and a lot more... goods parts are new new age builds and scout system gathering sheeps and hunting overall game is not worth it. aoe2 is better for vs ai"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,the best strategy game of 2021. one or two details to polish but overall a very good game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"nice way of telling how the battles of history changes the way that we live, good gameplay, it could improve on graphics"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,excellent gameplay. good successor to aoe3. video content also good. recommend!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"best value in gaming history  being able to play a new release for 1 with the xbox live trial. if you're on the fence about trying this game out, use that option to play it for a month before buying on steam or we, super fun game."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"the graphics are bad, especially combat motion is very bad. the campaign is boring and the battle scene is not great."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"1. ui takes up too much space and it's modern look is not appropriate or the medieval time period. 2. every map looks and feels the same. gets old fast.z 3. no replays, ai has no personality, no random race, no color choice. 4. feels like a mobile game made by 10 people."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"we can feel the legacy of aoe ii in aoe iv, and it feels good. the campaign is awesome and the documentaries are very well made. a few performance issues remain at launch but nothing too hard."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"doesn't revolutionize the formula, and it has some technical problems at launch, but this is honestly a damn good aoe game. moreover, it has the potential to become by far the best in the series, since its graphics and mechanics create a very solid base to build on via mods  future dlcs plus updates. and this is coming from someone who plays aoe since the first one. so, if you are into this type of games, it's definitely worth a buy or at least worth a shot in game pass."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"i play to the aoes mainly for the campaigns and in this one they are amazing so i am completely satisfied  i like art direction, the gameplay is still great and changes are welcome. great job relic!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"es tan bueno como el aoe2, sent tambin que es una mezcla con empire earth, otro gran rts de mi gusto, el combate se siente ms fluido y frenetico que la anterior entrega, sin duda lo mejor de lo mejor"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"finally new aaa rts! it's all what i want to say. nice cinematics in campaigns, multiplayer, not many civs, but it's not a clons as in aoe2 with small changes. i love aoe2 and aoe3, and this mix of them very nice as for me. i hope what game will be live so long as aoe2. i don't whan't say something about graphic, i think what is's part not about stategis. and yes   ."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"un gran juego volviendo con todo, el padre de los juegos de extrategia. jugabilidad exquisita mas unidades mas edificios. extrategia pura y dura."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"best strategy game with humankind since civilization 6, both in gamepass d"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"campaigns . they should learn a bit more from latest aoe2 campaigns. the documentaries are nice though. also, there are too many bugs, seems like a release from a small studio."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,very bad grapchic. bored gameplay... not to bad multiplayer... i am not recomend this game for new players
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,this game is everything you wished aoe2 would evolve into. the game separates itself mechanics wise compared to the prior entries while taking what was good in them and further adapting to make aoe4 unique and engaging. aoe4 is a fun entry to the series and is a must play.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"not so, bad however the previous versions were much more playable. there is no guiding story to focus on. there is just some kind of history lessons which are more boring then enternaining. graphics is like it was released five years ago at best. as a whole the game is quite dissapointing."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,this newest entry into the franchise got rid of everything that was added between ii and iii. the only difference between this game and aoe ii is an increased distinction between factions. i have never seen such a large step backwards in a game series i had previously adored.
