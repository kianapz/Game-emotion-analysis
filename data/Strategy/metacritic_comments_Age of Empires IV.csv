Jimbob135,2024-10-22,100,This game has to be one of the most compelling multiplayer games I have ever played. I would strongly recommend giving it a try.
bigbillybobjr,2024-09-25,70,it was fun for the first 2 weeks now its boring i played it for 12 days and now that i have finessed i cant play it again
JERICHOita,2024-09-05,80,Not on the same league as aoe2/1 but definitely better than aoe3. It is a solid game all in all
darthobscurity,2024-08-09,0,Game has no real soul. On top of not being able to pause and issue commands in single player.
Audit,2024-08-05,30,Boring on-the-rails campaigns without any freedom of choices game is without a soul and there is too much talking all the time during your gameplay. If i wanted to watch a documentary i would use my TV and not my PC. Graphics are cartoony with overproportioned units only the videos are great. Big meh
SirQuackalot,2024-03-27,0,"Way too many trolls in online multiplayer. Tons of disconnects when queueing - all players in a match are punished when a random disconnects; makes no sense. Developers leave bugs unaddressed for years, don't waste your money and time."
ebodur,2024-03-09,70,"Started off strong with captivating gameplay, but certain design choices later soured the experience. Despite this, it remains enjoyable overall."
Djohnson106612,2024-03-02,0,Ehhh. Too much to do. I appreciate the simplicity of civilization: revolution.
borannogay,2024-02-01,80,"Unfortunately, it is one of the best strategy games. I say unfortunately because even though they did their best, there is still a lot of room for improvement. I guess they don't want to waste time."
ioxx,2024-01-19,80,"He is back ! Finally ! Taking the universe of Age of Empire 2, crossing it with Starcraft for the isometric side, improving some mechanics that were a little too rigid on AOE2, here is AO4. The visual seems a little dated, but you get used to it relatively quickly. We find our bearings on civilizations like the English and the French. Then if we are looking for something new, other civilizations are there. The single player/story mode is nice, well documented and less ""fantasy"" than the previous opuses concerning historical reality."
Tactichan,2023-11-27,70,"I would have scored this game an 8 or 9 but the single player experience leaves a lot to be desired. However, the multiplayer is absolutely fantastic."
AmandaMoorgan,2023-11-11,20,"Looked promising on trailers, but what I actually got was... no freedom, full of talking, guided experience. I didn't like 3rd, but 4th... it felt like everything was wrong with it. No fun at all."

johanbak,2023-10-06,80,"Age of Empires IV is a great RTS game. Imagine designing a game to satisfy all of these audiences (and more): campaign fans, competitive multiplayer fans, city-builder fans, historical storytelling fans, etc. ^^ All of that kind of content for all these fans is in the game! The developers have improved the title in significant ways through several balance and patch updates, and content updates. Some gameplay mechanics are new to the series (e.g., influence mechanic from landmark or other buildings to improve something in the vicinity), and more recently, the development team has completely reworked some civilizations from their launch state (e.g., improving an English landmark by offering a novel unit for the game - a mounted king with a healing aura bonus). There is a healthy and stable competitive scene that seems to grow slightly after every major tournament, and even more after major content updates (e.g., after the Ottomans and Malians were added as new civilizations). The modding community is showing promise too, creating more than a handful of addicting custom game modes (e.g., Castle Blood Automatic remake from Age of Empires 2, a team arena mode, and even more creative concepts). The original campaigns (The Normans, The Hundred Years War, The Mongol Empire, and The Rise of Moscow) were well made, but the documentary-style storytelling welcomed mixed reviews from fans. (But make no mistake, the documentaries were well-shot, informative, interesting, and nicely intertwined into related campaign missions.) To speculate, the game has a healthy future both for content updates and for competitive and relaxed multiplayer scenes."
CptJohnOak,2023-09-15,70,improves on some things but overall is still the same experience as the previous installments.
Talkys,2023-09-08,50,"Very very empty. The graphics, campaign and new mechanics are good, but we don't have many civs, don't have scenario editor and don't have a good history tab."
Bavari1990,2023-09-08,100,"A year after it's release on PC somehow Relic Entertainment & World's Edge managed to port this game on Xbox Systems and it's amazing, you are in full control of your army and it doesn't feel weird using the controller at all, I couldn't recommend it enough."
zmija1,2023-09-07,10,"very bad graphic browser like men not visual good slow responsive screen units ,not recommended an multiplyer no players at all"
Luiszxc,2023-09-01,100,"It's actually great AOE. Love the historic campaign so far. It feels like direct upgrade and mix of aoe2+aoe3 and also it feels a bit like stronghold. It just needs some more work (and some stuff is really missing like player scores ingame, minimap filters and many other features should be added) so I hope it will get frequent updates and I can't wait for the mods and hopefully, in time, multiplayer will be as successful as in aoe2"
Ezio1459,2023-09-01,100,微软牛逼，总是愿意花钱在不挣钱的领域，这么多年总算解决了一个问题，士兵可以登上城墙了！
Gilchristion,2023-08-09,0,Not even 1 tenth of the game of its predecessors and not engaging. Just get anything else or one of the older games in the series this one isnt it.
DzmitryBoston,2023-08-05,90,"Great! Great! Great! historical videos, stories, and gameplay! Wow. Such a nice RTS. BUT sometimes AI is just horrible. In any case, I am just glad that I decided to take a break from consoles and play this game. Extremely recommended."
Harthik69,2023-07-09,90,Nice Game. Would love to play again in future. Good Graphics and mechanics!!!
Crazygame,2023-06-15,100,"This is really great real time strategy game, Especially all countries have different specialty and you can feel good this when you're playing different countries."
erfunfazli,2023-04-17,80,"Historical narrating is really good as a person who loves history I really liked that. After some years now we have a real time strategic Game with a good and cooked graphics. It has an acceptable gameplay, differences between factions are good. This game reminds me age of mythology."
Lupercal_XVI,2023-03-25,0,Horrid cartoon art style and graphics with exaggerated proportions and low detail models. Probably because this pile of dog water is coming to consoles. Story missions should have been like previous games instead of this pseudo documentary immersion breaking format. MP is a wall/cannon spam fest with some maps too big for any sort of early skirmishes and now there even seems to be resource hacks. But what would you expect from lelic the team that destroyed DoW....
CnPx98,2023-02-09,100,The best AOE to date. I really enjoyed how the added a campaign that was not only a great story but a real one aswell. The game overall plays well with no issues. The improvements they made over previous installments were all good ones. Really glad this series still gets attention after 25 years!
RetroGameCO,2023-01-31,100,"Me encanto el juego, de lo mejor que hay en juegos de estrategia en tiempo real"
Voodoo123,2022-12-11,80,Solid classic RTS with a fascinating documentary wrapped into the campaign interwoven as each new mission starts. The gameplay is addictive if a little repetitive over longer sessions of play.
ustunab,2022-11-21,80,Story with real-world cutscene design is really good. Gameplay a bit messy but ok for me. Looking for console release.
darkshaol1n,2022-10-04,100,"I love the game. After over 200 hours it still makes fun. The AI is much better than in AoE2 and it is easier to focus on troop movements and strategies for casular gamers. I like the graphics, the nations and the single player campaigns are also very nice with a lot of content and education. There are not too many nations, but it takes a while until you master only one of them. I can fully recommend and am looking forward to the continous improvements and additional content."
MooiWeer,2022-09-30,80,"It's age of empires III in a more modern and more balanced jacket, with interesting game-changers and a full team of developers, analysts and players playing the game for balance updates, which is great. The ladder is a good feature. The win conditions with landmarks is a fantastic change. Vision and hill usage is great, and in single player everything is well-explained and clear, as opposed to AOE2, where you had to Google and watch YouTube videos to find out specific ""game features"". Being able to stand on walls is so logical and thankfully it's in there. Real Sim City vibes, I love it. It's game pace is much quicker (games can easily be won after 10-15 mins). However, after launch age of empires 4 started the game started off as rather clunky in gameplay and pathing, luckily most is fixed now. What remains rediculous is that arrows can't miss their target and will follow a unit anywhere once it's shot by a Town Center or archer. Lastly, the civilizations are so different, they are hard to learn and you see many one-trick pony's in the game. On the contrary, single player does learn you some civs. Single player should have included every civ, however, it feels a bit empty, short, quick to play fully."
Marinusf,2022-09-03,70,Gameplay wise and graphics wise nothing too special. It's just a more modern version of AOE2. Overall the game lacks a UI that immerses you into the game. It looks too modern. Gameplay-wise they added some new features but these are also not really groundbreaking.
Nikita_Myshov,2022-08-02,40,"A big request to make the Russian voice-over for the game, as it is very inconvenient to read the subtitles, as I'm visually impaired."
Lumpendoktor,2022-07-31,20,"Graphic: I personally don't think the proportions are right. The hotkey menu with epoch-sorted buildings takes a lot of getting used to. I found the division into civil and military from the old predecessor to be considerably more convenient - especially with the new hotkeys in the DE. The graphic style is way too comical. The gold looks weird, the stones are kinda weird. However, I think fields, buildings, forests and most units are okay. The animations are all very smart too. What surprises me: There are no race-specific differences between the camps. And they also don't change their appearance when epoch advancement - why? The mill in AoE II is derived from a donkey mill to a windmill. I thought that was very nice. In addition, the buildings were mostly race-specific - here, as I said: not. Audio Creation: Very clever, little criticism. Except that the fields burn for too long and the noise really gets on my nerves. Cards: The map selection looks spartan. The cards that are there are playable.Example Black Forest - today's ""Dark Forest"": Yes, we were used to having - to use MOBA jargon - lanes to the enemy. These are almost still there. The problem is that they are built like labyrinths. Far too probable, with no natural expression. One could also say: They are rigid. Sometimes the lane has a perfect right angle. There are hardly any curves or bulges. And exactly in the middle there are two clearings, each with a holy place. Yes, of course: balance-technically definitely understandable. Only: Isn't it that the cards are SO obvious? Why should I play with a face down card? Seriously: I don't discover anything new anyway. If you know one, you know them all. Yes, the resources are slightly different from time to time. But the maps always have the same structure. AI: Well, I'm a PvE player, so I often play AI vs AI. For me, AoE simply means playing a round in peace to switch off your head and just do something else instead of studying/work and so on. It's my - yes, even if AoE is the most hectic RTS in the world next to StarCraft - resting place. Admittedly, the enemy AI !can! be demanding. So far I've played on hard and very hard and I did have my problems at first - I guess it was the warming up though. All in all, the AI is okay as an enemy. As an ally, however? Absolute crap! Just played a round of Black Forest with the Chinese. Because you can build quite a lot of landmarks as a Chinese, you need a relatively large amount of space. And so that the tax collectors can collect money, it would be nice if you could somehow get your buildings close together. The planning itself also worked. Until my ally, for reasons I couldn't understand, came up with the bright idea ""Hey! I'll build a second base. In my ally's base! And grab their berries. And their rocks. And their gold!"" - Yes! That's what the AI did in AoE II too. And in principle I have no problem with stealing resources. Had my ally been in distress it would have spread to me to rebuild - no problem, total understanding. Because I was calm and able to defend him - !in front of the enemy base! - there was no reason to nest with me. There was no reason to pave his fort IN THE CENTER of my village, or put two mills next to my berries, that I didn't even have the option to plant my mill fields because his mills were in the way. In AoE II: No Thing - Onager out, click ax icon, demolish ally's buildings. Alternatively in the Definitive Edition: Chat on, 69, pling on the building. ""Tear down the building at this position"" - Römms - done. This allowed you to control the AI a little, especially in the Definitive Edition. That worked great. Guess what's not possible in AoE IV. 1. Use onagers to correct such stupid construction errors 2. Give orders to the AI via chat. God knows if the AI even notices plings. Because while the AI in AoE II always reacted in the chat (""A little wood please"" - ""Right away, sire!"" *Palim* 100/1000 wood came as a tribute, or ""Attack the enemy from this position"" - ""It can I'm not, sire""), the AI doesn't react at all. In AoE III - what mmn. was also a flop - at least the AI had some character by taunting the player. But she doesn't do that anymore either. She is there. There is no option to interact with her. She is just there. Minus point to the power of 10! But since I can only complain about the ally AI, I will return to AoE II here as well. Campaign: Documentaries are nice. They are fun and I read a lot of texts from the story section in AoE II as well. Personally, I think it's okay that you unlock short documentaries with every mission - even if I think that the videos should be available from the start via a ""story"" section. But: When I play a campaign, I actually expect - preferably historically accurate - that the story is told either from the point of view of a soldier through cutscenes, as in AoE II from the heroic point of view."
Voyagerx,2022-07-24,100,"Great skill based game! Only your skill matters here. Instead of developing a character in an RPG by leveling up YOU develop yourself from time to time. There is always a good reason why you lost the last game. Learn from every lost game, don't repeat the mistakes you made and you will be a high elo player very soon. Don't believe what others say, game is balanced as it is. You need to be at least Top 1% to notice balance issues. Like I said, only your skill depends. A former Master SC2 player"
Moglebaum,2022-07-06,90,"The biggest negative about this game is the community constantly complaining about bugs and missing features. The game itself is extremely rewarding and feels completely different whether you play 1v1, 2v2 or even 4v4. Coop-Teamplay is amazing and with Season 2, this game will be anough polished for all players to give it a try or come back to it. If you fix this, 10 / 10 stars. There is just one thing I want the devs to take care of: If you target an enemy siege unit, your units will run in and target only this unit with their semi-long-range torches, that's perfect unit control. But if you attack move on a single archer with your knights, they will circle and circle around the enemy and die, because that archer is not to reach. What you need to do is: Attack move the ground in front of the archers and never click on a single enemy to attack move. This is a noob killer, and the attack move should work differently. Even a single right-click on an enemy should not cause this problem."
bastianemmanuel,2022-05-03,30,"(+) graphics and performance. (-) micro, FOV, hotkeys, number of civilizations and campaigns. It is a 2021 game and this has to be considered. Just talking about the multiplayer, it's not that bad, but far from being an improvement to the saga. The II: DE is still the best option by far. AOE I (1997) : 6/10 AOE II (1999) : 10/10 AOE III (2005): 3/10 AOE IV (2021): 4/10"
theirrelephants,2022-03-26,40,"Over a decade of waiting for another title inferior to Age of Empires 2. Hell, age of empires 3 had BETTER graphics than this. Bravo, Microsoft."
S1l3ntr1v3r,2022-03-06,0,"this game hasn't a soul, there is no atmosphere what makes it **** boring the games of ensemble studios were/are much more fun"
CRCMismatch,2022-02-12,40,"Beginning with the good parts: - They've brought back the good old ""medieval"" timeset. - The investment in historical research is noticeable, and the story-telling aspect is the best ever seen. - Game seems overall balanced, while being fun at the same time - good for newcomers to Age of Empires. For the bad parts: - It shouldn't be called Age of Empires, as it departs completely from the series main mechanics. - The ""astounding"" new graphics are on par with Stronghold 2, literally Age of Empires 3 (original one, not even DE) had better graphics. - If you're an avid AoE series fan, used to micromanagement and low-level field strategies, this is not the game for you (it's basically only combat-chain, you can't even dodge projectiles...) - The overall UI and hotkeys are a complete backstep, more akin to Company of Heroes than Age of Empires."
ShaMana,2022-02-02,90,"I am very impressed and incredibly happy with the title. Note, while not incredibly competitive, I LOVE the single player content. It reminds me of the good times 20 years ago. Well bloody done people"
fruittwist,2022-01-24,30,"Просто натянули модельки на AoE II, для меня откровенная загадка как четвертая часть умудряется выглядеть хуже чем 3, специально только скачал 3 Def edition, графика ЛУЧШЕ, реально лучше. Как же нелепо выглядит когда 100 лучников подходит к дому и начинают се синхронно стрелять в центр здания, просто отвратительно, не понимаю за что такая хорошая оценка, видимо это тот случай когда на безрыбье и AoE 4 нормальная стратегия. Имхо неиграбельно, лучше предыдущие части. Ах да, еще очень интересное разделение по цивилизациям, русские орки в четвертой эпохе даже пушек не имеют, только требушеты строят, и когда английский флот приплывает на огромных кораблях с пушками, у нас лодки как в викингов и лучники."
NachoSlayer,2022-01-12,90,"people complaining about graphics being too low in an RTS do not know how an RTS works. Try loading in a big frigging army and see if your FPS survives. Performance > your units looking like a diva. Game runs nice, Civs feel unique and you actually learn something if you want to as you unlock documentaries they recorded for this game. If you are one of those nerds like me that read the descriptions in Age of Mythology you will greatly appreciate this. I would give this game a higher score, but it did have some, albeit not directly game breaking, bugs that show up now and then at launch in some of their campaign missions. It also misses some features at launch like saving your game in multiplayer or pausing the game in multiplayer when you need to take a leak while playing with a friend. If you care about gameplay and think performance and skill matter more over your buildings and units wearing a nice and fancy pixel dress this game is for you. If you'd rather look like a sparkling princess, play the games those 0/10 reviewers are playing."
Swat7,2022-01-11,90,nothing but fun all day the gameplay refreshed the story intresting so much videos and storytelling of history. so many unlocks to keep playing each era of history has so many story missions. building building units upgrades are so simple to use
Frankie321,2022-01-09,80,"Potentially great. The good points said about the game already, I would also say. I really just want to send a message to the developers (hope they read this). Please add more CUSTOMISATION options. Specifically, 1) I find the game speed too fast when there's lots happening. Please offer a speed selection option for single player, which allows us to slow down the game when it's complex or speed up the game early on when not much is happening. 2) Please allow a Free Pause. This allows you to pause the game, analyse the situation, and give orders, then resume the game playing. Some people believe Free Pause is cheating. That's fine, if you don't like it, don't use it. Free Pause could be a tick box in the Options to enable or disable. I like Free Pause because I enjoy having the time to analyse a complex situation, and having the time to assign orders to my units to implement my plan. Without Free Pause or slowing the speed, the game bec0mes a hurried, actions-per-minute actions frenzy. Some people may like that, fine, that's why the suggestion is to allow customisation options and let players choose the type of play they enjoy."
pion,2022-01-07,0,This game has the worst graphics of all the games I've played. The worst AOE of all time.
chrij,2021-12-17,80,"It's a great game because it's similar to the good old AoE 2, the Age of Kings. The developers did a good job in the art design, the UI, the sound-design and also the fractions. It looks good even on my 7 year old gaming PC. Only in 4 vs 4 games I have to go on low settings. The campaign is also very good. I like also the history videos. Great stuff. There is some content to come with AoE 4 and I really think it has the potential to become played for years. We just have to build up a strong community and playerbase. 8/10 is just for one reason: There is no option to buy a DVD or BlueRay (just Download) and if ordered in a box it is just some cheap paper without any love for detail. To be said: Better having a cheap box for a good game than a good box for a cheap game."
Jam_Cam,2021-12-12,100,Great job bringing AoE back into the spotlight. I wish there was more countries/cultures to play but I'm sure that will come with time. This game could have only been better if they had added more trebuchets.
TSTINKERS,2021-12-10,30,This game is poorly done. Graphics ****. Game response slow. I am playing and not addicted. I'd rather play candy crush. AOE 2 and AOE 3 were great and I could play for hours. This one not so. I think the main problem is the units don't respond how you expect... like if you grab a treasure chest of 100 gold it's not like you walk over it and just get it. You have to click a certain way... it's frustrating. I didn't give is 0 because the history lessons in between the limited campaigns i did play are good.
