Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,ah finally we can be crusaders and recreate the battles of the war of the roses!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"also, don't forget that templar are a variant civ in name only. the devs confirmed that the templar share no traits, bonuses, unique units, or unique upgrades with the french. the only thing that makes them a variant at all is that they'll probably speak french and have french buildings. that's literally it. totally new civ in every other respect."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,agincourt with blue english and red french looks cursed.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"for everyone saying i was hoping for this or that, remember this is only the first dlc of the year. they have confirmed a second one, which i imagine will have brand new civs instead of just variants. there is still hope! just hold out a little longer, fellows! but i'm maining the knights templar from now until the heat death of the universe."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,"well, alright im buying this"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,"awesome! the knights templar were always portrayed as the antagonists in games, so it's refreshing to be able to play them. but please, don't forget to keep working on new civs. we're still waiting on more catholic civs, mesoamerica, persians, and vikings."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,it's almost time boys!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,looking forward to this  i also wish my battles could be as organized  rather than just mass charging a blob of mixed units
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,"just put a coat of paint on the units so they don't look so cartoony, age ii still the king because of blood and how realistic it looks, if you could put the sound design of ageiv in ageii, it would be the dead of ageiv"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,please restart the maintenance and support for aoe3.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,get this game on ps5 also !!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"can't wait for these variants! this is gonna be sweet. i would love to see the spanish, hungarians, some scandinavians, or some celtic civs soon."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,no preorders!!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,i absolutely love  age of empires 4 because it's a wonderful game but age of empires 2 definitive edition has almost 50 different faction and why does age of empires 4 have so few?  can't you bring all the faction that are on 2 to 4? please thank you peace
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,looks good!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,"oh wow, agincourt, so original, we dont have every kind of media talking constantly about it... s. if we are going to have even more 100years war, can't we have the equally important, but never mentioned french heroic victories, like patay or castillon?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,nice
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,"we are truly blessed, thank you!"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,when are the spanish coming?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,"hoping to see future spanishportuguese civ and epic japanese variant with some elite samurai or ninjaclan emphasis and possible hero unit. vikings would be neat too, tying into the existing byzantine varangian guard units. moroccanamerican, or any african nation would be neat to see as well. or even some pirateprivateer focused group. i could see a potential mongol or rus variant upcoming as well. rus tying into nordicviking tribes as potential shared units."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,this is gonna be epic!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,wow
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,when is on ps5?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,"a large number of new units, with much more content than the 2 variants officially advertised"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,i purchased immediately
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,i just can't understand why is a teutonic knight on the cover image ?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,disappointed there are only 4 historic battles.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,is this game has the same charisma as the good old aoe? which i played some 20 years ago.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,so exciting!! thank you
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"good but...mexica aztecs, kingdoms of castille and aragon spain, the italian citystates, korea, the vikings, ethiopia, the kingdom of jerusalem which i guess is not happening after this...maybe something different outside of the same of day 1?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,insane hypeeeeeee
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"i was hoping four more biomes, random biome option or ai improvements so they can at least use their own abilities eg hre emergency repair. but this will keep me entertained"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,"finally, bought!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,looking forward to playing!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,"guys, where is the solo campaing?"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,niiicee
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"i don't know why i hate those graphics, maybe the colors are to saturated? i want to like this game lol"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,"love it, so many new units..! and what is that keepking's palace hybrid thing 0027??"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,super excited! preordered.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,please release age of empires 4 on ps5
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,why price in steam is lower than ms store? should have price parity
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-18,only variant factions?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"piece of crap, looks terrible, nothing new, scouts go into trees not around them, looks like it was made in 2010. 8  10. keep it locked on ign."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,the video is 80 criticism and it gets an 8. classic ign
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,it really sounded like he was going to give it a 67 score.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,reviews like these are why nobody takes ign serious anymore
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,shits on it for 6 mins 30 seconds says there's no time to play this old game. gives it an 8 lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-17,age of empires series is a game that should not lose its simplicity. that is how it wins our heart.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,absolutely can't wait for them to use this to build upon for age of mythology 2!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"it's true there is little innovation, but what is there makes for an excellent aoe title. and lower graphic fidelity just means more people can play."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"this review is the equivalent of belittling your girlfriend, saying that shes useless then at the end of it asks her to marry you lololol he craps on the game for nearly 7mins then gives it an 8 lol"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,im hoping we can get a new rise of nations one day that was like the original.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"when a pokemon game releases the only praise we see is how the age old formula still works. but here, for some reason it is deemed a negative aspect."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,that crash course reference was golden.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"its mounting reviews like this one to a degree that often pressure developers to continually change a winning formula to something unrecognizable in a sequel. its why indie game developers and fan funded projects often make a name for themselves by releasing spiritual successor games. if its not broke, dont fix it."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,age of empires is one of the first pc games most people would have played.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,it really feels like a windows xp game ign
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,straying too far from the classic formula for rts games is a death sentence. just look at command and conquer 4 tiberium twilight. i'm all too happy to have an old school rts. we rts fans still play the old classics to this day because they're still a ton of fun.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"it's almost like the reviewer said hey, i'm not very impressed with this game so i'm gonna give it a score of 6, but then his boss said we can't risk upsetting microsoft and the money stream that's generated because of them so you're gonna give this an 8. almost."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,it's playing it safe because they didn't want a repeat of the reaction aoe3 received. the fan base didn't want an aoe game that strayed too far from what they think an aoe game should be.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-20,"this review is mind blowing, he went to complain about how you have to micro units in a real time strategy game, the game will not play itself"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-25,one of the main reasons the age of empires was a success was because it could run on almost any system. these games arent supposed to stress your system they are designed to scale very well. ignoring that would have shown a lack of respect for the series' core values.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"big, big yikes. this review made no sense. giving it an 8 after all of what you've said has undone everything you've just mentioned. completely skipped over important deatils  no mention of hotkeys? no review of the campaigns? what's up with the 1080p, highly compressed video? run the game maxed out in 4k, then critique the graphics... so many issues with this review."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,im pretty sure the graphics are the way they are because they wanted everyone to be able to play it.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,a day may come where an ign review is not a laughing stock. but is not this day.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-07,you need to babysit your armies constantly. isnt that just an rts game?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,this review wasn't very helpful for someone who hasn't played an aoe game before.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,it's pretty impressive to see this series keep evolving till today. 24 years is a pretty amazing for a video game series. age of empires 2 was what got me hooked up on this video game series
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,for anyone who has played age of empires 2 two decades ago this is game is amazing. for the zoomers please move back to fortnite.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,i'm so sick of reviewers that want their chocolate cake to taste like the rainbow.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"give us rise of nations 2, microsoft. they're sitting on the rights to the franchise."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"relic didnt push the boat out enough... do you blame them, imagine the backlash, not like they have been on the receiving end of dawn of war 3 feedback."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"see microsoft , now u must make age of mythology 2 !"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,the movement of troops is really bad. why couldn't they improve this after all these years??
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,innovation of other frenchises when there's been almost no new rts game for the last 12 years.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,86 opencriticthe highest in the series84 metacritic
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,the fact that he compared this to another game in 2010 negatively made me think this would be a six.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,reviewer it change too little gamer when given tangible changes went berserk like when aoe3 did
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,the crash course reference made my heart happy.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-03,"game features that would make this game great 1 bigger maps like 5x the huge map size 2 better diplomacy ally, vassals, tribute state, militar alliance, commercial alliance ecc 3 1000 population limit 4 a proper map editor easy to use 5 heroes and generals with historical references 6 a family member tree for our empires 7 civilization creation and customization"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,is ign ever going to hire competent reviewers?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-12,"so basically, this game is to aoe what jj abrams was to star wars......don't break the things that made previous developers money."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"even on max settings, the graphics don't look that impressive  they look like garbage on ign's muddy compressed videos. for goodness sake, folks, you should have this down by now."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,does there review score go to 20?  this guy sounded almost angry about nearly everything he was saying and we ended at 8.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,"best game of this year, by far."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-23,so far i've played 700 hours. 1010
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,wait  was that a crash course history reference ? talk about blast from the past .
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,it seems like the reviewer was in a pessimistic mood when he was writing this review
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,this guy's voice  510 cannot wait for the official release
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-19,"there should be no other genres than fps, all others looks the same from 10 years ago.  ign"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"he didn't even reference the number 8 himself, it's like someone else went in and changed the rating after the fact.."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,too bad not a masterpiece... but it will become one after we start modding it
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,i'm barely 20 seconds into the video and i'm thinking  he's just going to give this an 8 regardless isnt he...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"truth is, rts genre did not really evolve and its golden age is gone, propably forever. total war reference is spot on  this gamegenre evolved, introduced new features and now, it is worth of 2021 tech. rts games abandoned most of their unique features like huge armies cossacks multiple ages empire earth, rise of nations and uses same of very similar pattern in every game  38 factions, 25 ages. build, uprgade, defeat enemies. even the unique things like leveling cities and unlocking uprgades from aoe3 were abandoned cuz most people did not like them."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"minimum system requirements are intel hd 520 or amd radeon rx vega 11 they are targeting this game for the masses. what's weird, though is that an integrated vega 11 gpu is like 3x as powerful as that intel."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,108 knowing rock paper scissors how dare you
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,perfect description 'comfort food for a certain age' it is to me
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,7 minutes of this isn't great and graphics are terrible but 8 out of 10. video sponsored by microsoft. typical ign
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,this was ok until he said jengis khan
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-06-22,"ah yes, jengis khan"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,the score is 8 but it reads like a 6
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-07,who takes ign reviews seriously anymore?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,really wish we could get a galactic battlegrounds sequel offa this
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,"you young bucks, don't watch the number at the end. listen what he says and understand!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,best rts since starcraft 2. sadly only because the genre is dead since... 11 years
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-09,"ign isn't to blame, simple and closed minded nerds are."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"thanks ign! yeah, the graphics needs to be above age 3 graphics but overall its still a great rts game to play for old and new comers."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,unfortunately it's the same old stuff... but i'm bummed that they didn't include my old favorite mode! 810 such a rollercoaster from a guy called leana.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,they should really use this graphics for a new age of mythology
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,the archers seems to be like firing popcorns.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,the game looks awesome and the new mechanics seems to be interesting.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-06,where are the knights in shiny armor riding under the sunrise? where is the daynight cycle or wintersummer maps? why no nobility and royalty? why units can walk through the tc walls? why religion and clergy play only a small role in gameplay? why are the maps so small? why attack animations are so slow? why the walls arent built following the grid? where are the templars and hospitaliers? why no drums or troubadours in battle or in town? why no units experience mechanics? where are the concentric castles? no javelins? why gold and stone look unrealistic? why the yellow ghost builders that distract the eye? no mercenaries? no looting and pillaging? why so many knights and so few footmen?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,who still loves aoe 2 definitive edition?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,this game had zero marketing.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,looking forward to this game!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-06,"imagine an ign employee was honest. well we'd never see their review and they'd be fired on the spot. it's not close to 8, at best and it's hard to give it this score but at best 5.5, but 8?!?!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,can't wait to play it in game pass
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"if youre not really a fan of the genre, then the review isnt really fair.... its too subjective that way.. .. having said that..... you continually criticize it.... then give it an 8"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,crash course history reference was epic
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,the house of wisdom comment was funny edit holy cow he made a crash course reference
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,why don't people check ancestors legacy? you might be pleasantly surprised
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-09,aoe 2 definitive edition was the last best aoe game created.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,seems like the score is kind of high considering you think it's nothing new and something we've been playing since 2003. why wouldn't it be a 4 or 5?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,when ign reviews a game at a 109 people complain. when ign reviews a game at an 8 people complain. when ign reviews a game at 7 people complain. when ign reviews a game at 16 people still complain. bottom line? people love to complain. a game can be a solid 8 while not being top tier graphically or bringing something new to the genre. people seem to think 8 must mean it's 99 percent glowing praise. 8 means it's a solid game that has a few weaknesses but still worth playing. how hard is that to understand?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"this game is for nostalgia, it's nonsense yo even put total war or other games for conversation, this is basically just a comestic rework of a classic, nothing bad about it, it's not like the fans wanted something new, they would burn down the walls if they tried something wholly new"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"official statistics say 99 of the likes were for the franchise, not the review"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"empires? there is only one empire and that's the american empire, silly devs, 810 ign"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-03,"its not a game, its history book. honestly age of empires 3 is 100 times better"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,the game is not that great. a lot of weird designs choices here
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,yes! that mongols reference is back!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,ill give ign 810 for this review
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-07,"devs noticed they have a lot of fans from third world countries. decent rigs here are a luxury. the graphics are a solid decision, one that is much appreciated."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,why do you even compare this game to a total war game? of course the graphics and game play will be vastly different as they are two different type of games... sigh
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,the game has an 84 on meta critic with zerooooo negative reviews.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,the cognitive dissonance is strong with this one
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"like the game devs, ign playing it safe too, giving it 8 after that review so that aoe fans do not get mad."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,excited for age of empires 5. this feels like the perfect game to build on
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,304 mongols!!! where is attila the hun?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,price tag is way to high. would have bought it on nostalgia for 30.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,i've never played this franchise. i've played stronghold and total war games. but i'll have to check this out. especially since it's on gamepass.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,stopped listening when they said they could play total war with more detailed units. wtf is wrong with you ign? this wasn't a review. it was a total whine.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-23,based they kept it true to the core how loyal fans like it. if they gonna do something new then it shouldnt wear the aoe title but a new series instead

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,this is going to be on some mobile game ad in 5 years guaranteed.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-23,"i like how, even at this scale, infantry steps aside so that cavalry can get through. that was a major issue in older games."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-25,0304 how many siege weapons do you have my lord? my lord hat hat hat hat hat hat hat hat hat ha that hat haththth
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-25,0304 how much siege you need my lord. lord yes
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-08-08,"i used to suck so bad at this as a kid, but the noises they made and the sound effects stuck with me, it felts like magic"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-26,"loved aoe as a kid i use to spend my time thinking about battle strategies, nostalgia sure hits."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-27,"i like how at 608, green was still happy with the idea of breaking down the walls. then the wall came down and the blue carvery swamped out, green was like sorry, wrong address... and retreated..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-13,"i prefer the originals, but age of empires 4 is great for trying out war strategies due to the enhanced terrain and building system."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-18,"man when i was a kid in the old microsoft xp i remember sending soldiers out and the handful ones who made it back after a battle were promoted to special forces  theres gotta be a system when you can level infantry individuals into classes like assassins, commanders ect. i would love it"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-02,what i really like about aoe 4 is its sound designs
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-30,307 when you open a pack of gum in class
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-11,finally a good game and not false ad
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-09,to be fair he has the higher ground. they had no chance...like anakin
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-30,my laptop slowed down just watching this..
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-07-17,"this is beginning to look like cossacks. but with newer graphics and gameplay engines, this looks damn satisfying"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-17,"look to my coming, at first light, on the fifth day. at dawn, look to the east."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-06,placing your archers on walls will increase their firing range
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-12,the older versions were the best and classic... miss u aoe era
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-24,027 that unmistakingly pling from a game trainer
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-12,we are playing de coconuts! that's what i hear every time he yells.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-21,"definitely need more of these, keep em coming!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-21,"who needs wall, you can just line up your men and hold the ground that way haha"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-30,"this is really unrealisitc. irl, you would never open the gate during a siege. even if you could kill them faster if you massively outnumber then, it makes no sense to send out soldiers to die when your archers could easily drive them away."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-09,309 the sound of impending doom.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-01,"as an aoe fan, i am impressed. looks like i can finally use more than 200 people!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-26,"playing with infinite resources or instant creation is a lot of fun. i've won some matches like this, but with the default mode for game resources."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-04,"i like how oh you got ram hammering my wall, let me pour out tons of trebuchet to stay here"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-21,definitely a gandalf knockoff quote right there
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-17,"this is what i like about age of empires, it develops your decision making capabilities."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-26,how much cpu power and ram would you need to run it as smoothly as this  love it
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-08,my man sent in 5 million cannons in 1 click xd
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-07-08,more realistic than the siege of winterfell.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-25,i have been playing these games for years they will always be my favorite games
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,i've played aoe 2 for many years and i didn't even there's aoe 4.... damn!!!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-09-17,"i'm imagining that poor worker who just finished building those walls, towars, and fortresses, and as soon as they're destroyed, he's like, oh, come on!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-14,this game looks like those fake mobile games ads but if they were true
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-24,my favorite youtuber made a new video again woww
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-30,i dont like it. because the units are moving too systematic while i am expecting some chaos at their act in the battle
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-03,the clink got me lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-06,my pc cant even play this game on high graphics without being dropped from games but this dude has high graphics with max units lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-28,bro that defense was massive.... do you know what else is massive?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-22,took them alsmost 6 minutes to realize they'd need bombards xd
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,"looks like rise and fall civilizations at war, i love that game still to this day."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-26,isn't this what we've always wanted to do?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-11,that cpu mustve been gasping for breath.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-21,nice. a game that doesnt limit thr units. its awesome... just keep on buying units.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-10,i laughed so hard when there was artillery spam in the end like tons of them
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-31,ancestors legacy has the best combat mechanics i have seen in any strategy game. i was kind of hoping some of that would be adopted in the new aoe. but i never get what i want.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-06-25,no blood effect just like a bunch of toys are fighting each other
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-06,that's insane!! how do you get that large of unit scale??
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-12,"if i watched that video for 20 years ago, i liked so much... aoe's movements and strategies are so old fashion and doesn't any sense"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-23,the one thing this game really needs is indeed a pop cap higher then 200 buttt 9999!! damn xd
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-02-25,glad i could see a few villagers too
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-10,it's impressive to say the least how the game was able to hanlde all that without a flinch! and they went for 200 only in 2022  smh
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-16,"14 yrs ago as soon as i came home after school wht i do is play aoe2 while in school what i do is drawing planes to destroy next kingdom, even befor sleep wht i do is planning. ahahah  what a great time. i m a good battle strategic planner. have finished all aoe methodology. tbh i still have never met something that can give same feeling as befor. maybe that cz i was kid that time  time flies"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-08,after all this years the developers still don't mind the archers mounting those walls ....
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-22,what is a game today played for fun was how people lived years back!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-14,"thank god for multiple cpu cores. also, someone in relic is an optimisation demigod."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-27,"my god, i thought it was cossack 3 for a moment there. look at that crazy amount of soldier!!!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-21,this game  rip my mouse but still one of the favorite game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-08,used to love this game back in 2002
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,thank you for the amazing 4k images! highly appreciated!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-06-19,"welcome to 2007, graphicwise."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-07,for some reasons i find age of empire 2 most entertaining out of all editions and the definitive edition just made is much better for me then just because i played aoe ii too much or maybe i am not aware of the mechanics of aoe iii or iv.just my point of view
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-09-13,so chaotic and exciting at the same time!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-22,i can see essence of company of heros in this game...especially the way the minimap behaves
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-08-22,everyone is gangster until he charges his cavalry battalion
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-06,how do you get such a high troop limit is there a setting for custom matches or something?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-15,oh wow!! i used to play this game back in 1997 aoe2 .i didnt even know they have aoe 4 now.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-06-26,"attackers  they are weak , we will defeat them easy . defenders  cavalry charge . attackers  tactical retreat boys ."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-04,even my own pc laged when the fight started
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-06-10,i'm sure the original studio for age of empires would have made a better age 4
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-17,307 lmao
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-14,"sun tze said the best warfare strategy is to attack the enemy's plans, next is to attack alliances, next is to attack the army, and the worst... ... is to attack a walled city."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-08,i recognize that cheat engine sound
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-04,now if only the units had collider bodies and did not enter inside each other this would be golden.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-14,my cpu is at 100 just watching this
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-19,1 villager knocked up that gate in 3 seconds yet it took about 1000 units to knock it down
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-28,sounds like machine gunfire during medieval times
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-21,"it looks fun enough, but maybe a description would be nice. i have no idea what is going on here. is it online, is it a game mode or custom scenario?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-02,"i was expecting aoe4 set in the years that followed aoe3, like the industrial revolution and the world wars. but we go back to medieval times. no matter, rts games are best when set in ancient times."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-29,ambuja cement se banai h diwaar nahi tutegi
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-05-12,my brain has been so conditioned by this game that i am constantly fighting the urge to click a location on the mini map.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-20,i haven't played age of empires 4 yet but there is no way he isn't using cheat codes
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-02,my man playing age of empire 4 like total war.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-23,looks like it's gonna be on ads of some mobile games
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-23,"i recognize that tone, i too use the wemod"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-22,i though they have not launched map editor for aoe4.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-15,my graphics card had a stroke just watching this video.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-23,love this game but 86 gb to install it's just crazy. why is every game so huge these days? graphics? nothing special for what reason? just to force us to buy new hardware to store the games? it's quite but when i find a game with less than 30 gb i'm just happy.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-08,our turret is under attack!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-11,the cavalry charge should have been backed with archers
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-14,"infinite money and population, it's not a defence, it's a slaughter"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-15,"looks very similar to aoe3, lack of new things like put soldiers on the wall, soldiers look the same, they could put in like some unit upgrade, like diablo, weapon upgrade etc, or like horses with chariots and people inside, or villagers could do more things, with different kind of tools, like axes, saw etc so long time has passed since aoe3 but no new things or renovation of age of empires, especially when compare hardware capabilities then and now, overall graphics are not that impressive."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-13,woah total mobile game advert vibes
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-19,how can you set that larger of number of solders ?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-01,im glad u guys found the add for my new mobile game coming out this december
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-30,how did he increase the populatation limit?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-07-07,i think this was a mobile game ad first
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,good dad game that's not just for dads
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,and the mongols doing mongol stuff. im convinced.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"i like that this is one of the few times in games where a developer made a game and essentially did what worked, played it close to the vest, and people actually loved it. a great example of not fixing something that wasn't broken."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"i remember i used to play the original age of empires everytime i would come back from school, together with warcraft 2. lots of history and even though i was like 10 years old, it felt like a fun adventure. couldn't beat none of the campaign lines though, the missions would get harder and harder, and i guess it was too difficult for a 10 year old lol"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,really wish they would reengineer rise of nations as well. loved being able to progress through to the computer age then nuke the opposition.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,me in 1997 playing age of empires i wonder what games will be like in 24 years? 2021
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,"while no doubt aoe2 is a great game, i would love to see the sequel of the aom. those myth creatures and attacking them or fighting alongside them is so fun that fighting withagainst human soldiers. campaign mode in aom is absolutely the best story of 32 chapters with 3 different civilizations. i wish they will create a sequel for aom with another good campaign mythological story"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"i have such fond memories of age of empires ii. i went on day trip to london with my mother to visit some museums and galleries, and afterwards she bought me aoeii because i told her it was educational. it turned out it actually was, and i learned all sorts about byzantines and goths. oh and trebuchets. i learnt a lot about trebuchets."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-11,"the not your dad's war game really hit home for me, i used to watch my dad play the second game all the time when i was a kid. i recently picked up the definitive edition on steam so i could play with him when he visits"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,was still putting on aoe 2 soundtrack to study during college just 3 years ago. its unmatched.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-03,"been playing it a bunch, really enjoying everything it has to offer, feels like they updated everything you wanted while keeping true to the game and making good choices to keep it competitive"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,you forgot the best part archers on walls
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"as i was watching this, i just imagined making lotr based scenarios in this game  makes me wish for a bfme 3"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,i remember when aoe 3 was so immersive. what sold me were the cannons blowing the soldiers sky high. i hope to see some new destruction mechanics.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-01,aoe 3 was good tooo.... everyone i know pretends like it doesn't exist but it's my favorite one  also just buy the game if you're remotely interested in the series.. very good worth your time absolutely fun.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"i enjoyed the history based cut scenes in aoe2 as well, skirmish was brilliant and was super chill on easy and challenging on very hard. the kind of game where a skirmish could last 1 to 4 hours, certain game sequels only need tweaks as their original iterations are so good."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"this series brings back so many memories, can't wait"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,this is exactly what i wanted. controls similar to aoe2 with better visuals and a generational update to add more features. so excited to get this d
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"as a kid, we had an old desktop with age of empires on it. i spend hours playing the heck out of it, haha. i'm excited to check this one out too!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,i havent played age of empires since 2 back in high school with my dad! that was over 20 years ago lol i bought them on steam a few years back but its just not the same. my sister used to come be his spy and then hed suddenly be outside my town with trebuchets haha. good times. this new one looks nice tho!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"age of empires 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. honorable mention to the original, rise of nations which i guess was a different developer, but still have almost the same exact gameplay, and star wars galactic battlegrounds. all games using the same exact engine and gameplay mechanics. but 2 was fittingly the king"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,they're using documentary footage in order to tell their stories now? that's actually really cool and something i would have never thought they would have done but it makes a lot of sense
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,i finally got to watch a before you buy before actually buying the game! lol keep up the great work you guys d
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"ah, that was my first rts game. seeing that age of empires title brings along back many childhood memories. aoe has always been a special, legendary game for strategy fans. and, i bet every history enthusiast like me spent so much time on this game in the past. by the way, a great review. i'm looking forward to adding this game to my steam library."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"while i do see why aoe 2 is the pinnacle, i sunk more hours into age of mythology. that game was so cool."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-02,"i've got a bit over 100 hours on the game, mostly custom game skirmishes against a.i i'll offer a few observations 1. don't expect a lot of initial peace to build and advance. expect enemy scouts poking and harassing your villagers right away. 2. concentrate on food production first. it is the key to adding villagers and everything else. 3. monitor and avoid idle villagers and uneven resource gathering. when a resource is depleted, the villagers will just stand there until you move them. 4. evening out your resources by buying and selling at the market is expensive and inefficient. 5. don't buy every upgrade that becomes available. some are more useful and  or a better value than others. 6. you don't need to control an area to take its' resources. if there is a huge gold vein on the other side of the map, i'll harvest that instead of what is near my town center. send enough villagers, build a mining camp next to it, and guard them with a few cavalry. sometimes you will deplete it before the enemy even knows you're there. otherwise, you still have all that gold, even if the camp gets discovered and overran. 7. your military formations should include religious units for healing, and a handful of villagers to repair siege weapons. 8. all siege weapons are costly and powerful, but very easy to destroy if left unguarded by infantry or cavalry. 9. your assets will behave stupidly and march blindly into annihilation if you don't pay attention and command them what to do. 10. the 200 population cap is awful. you can reach that very quick and then have to start killing off villagers to allow your queued military units to spawn."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"age of empires, age of mythology, and rise of nations were some of the first games i played in my youth like 4 years old and man do i remember every moment."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,i vividly remember the lan parties at my library for the original game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,i downloaded the age of empires 2 definitive edition on my pc on the first day that it was released. i'm still not complete with the european campaigns due to the sheer number of missions. best rts game that i have played since command and conquer red alert 2
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,"i have a recurrent thought about utilizing squads more in rts games  where you are commanding the leader of the unit and the rest of the units are ai controlled to follow as they see fit. in this way we could cross the 200 limit quite quickly and have massive battles. the mongols shows really nice design the prayer flags are not responding to wind though and gives a taste for modernized sollutions. i would personally be more enticed by a game which moves a little bit further in developing the genre in these ways. used to play aoe and aoe 2 as a kid but don't think i will find my way to the 4th installment, it looks a bit too similiar."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"there's like a lot of sheep in this one k, i'm sold."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-08,i feel that if you didnt play the game as kid you aint gonna fall in love with it as an adult
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,when playing the beta version i found myself very immersed. i remember one online game i played was 90 minutes but it felt like only 45 minutes. already preordered standard edition.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,"aoe2 definitive edition is just still so much better, such a masterpiece"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"for those of you that don't know, aoe2 received a 4k remaster recently. if aoe4 doesn't look like your cup of tea, the age 2 community is bigger now than it ever has been and we'd love to have you"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-11,"putting soldiers on wall, is a big game changer ! i can see it's going to be used as tower rush on pvp"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"i dont follow much gaming news, and aoe4 i've been excited since it was announced and had no idea when it was being released, this is why i love this channel. thanks guys! time for me to go pick up a copy"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-19,"i love how they have always mixed exploring, building, economy and war."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,i was 3 when aoe3 was released and i remember always sitting up on my older brothers desk as he played. im honestly really looking forward to buying this for myself and as a gift for him so we can enjoy some 1v1s. i hope that this game comes with a coop mode similar to the one in starcraft 2 where we get to play together to complete objectives
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-03,"my main issue with this game, from what i've seen so far, is that the graphics are too cartoonish. i wish it had aoe2 dynamics and aoe3 style graphics. i also don't really understand why they didn't go a little further in history again, as they did with the previous 3 games antiquity  middle ages  industrial revolution"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,they need to bring back age of mythology. those units made it way more interesting.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"my 6th grade teacher got me into aoe2, i used to play coop with him after school. if november wasn't so bloated with games i would have picked this up right away."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,it's amazing how they made a cereal with an age of empires cd like from my childhood. wololo's
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,i remember playing this when i was in highschool. we even have aoe tournament in school. 'd
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"as a huge empire earth 2 fan, this gave me the chills and flashbacks!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-30,i loved the unlocked documentary videos you get after a campaign mission things like how arrows are made and how horses were trained
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,i remember sitting on my dads lap watching him play aoe!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"well as aoe old fan, i still remember those days when me and my father use to play aoe 1 game, then aoe 2 and then i played aoe 3 myself, now aoe 4... man time flies, aoe 3 came in 2005 when i was what, 10 something man time flies"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,i remember getting age of empires 3 in a box of nutrigrain ceral hopefully they do the same with number 4
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"my dad loved these games, land air sea, command and conquer, shogun. i played them and can't wait to play this."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"they didn't change the formula, just needed it up for the modern age perfect"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,i have been playing age of empires for over 20 years!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"been missing rts since i last play stronghold 3. hopefully building here is as peaceful as the old time. i like building, both for defensive and economy purpose, and then actually make a nation conquering army out of them. i preferred stronghold 2 more than 3 and i also prefer aoe 3 more than 2 because of it as i like building more than the army stuff."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-09,great video! first age of... was age of mythology way back when and it was great. quickly got into age of empires ii and iii. glad to see this one looks just as good if not better.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,awesome. haven't played an age of empires game for twenty years.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-07,"aoe ii was my childhood. this though... i don't know. feels more like a remake than anything else. if this was big budget i got no idea where it went. aoe ii came around the same time as starcraft, which got its own sequel ten years after. this came a decade later yet if i didn't know any better i'd think this came at the same time as starcraft ii."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"i've bought aoe ii three maybe four times in my life. i love that game. so i am excited this bought into the spirit of that game! my biggest disappointment of bgiii maybe second biggest after it being incomplete was that they modernized it to the point it feels like a whole new game stealing the title. where this looks like the same game. i want the same game, that's just new. still probably won't buy until it goes on sale. haha"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-08,a little something for everyone. nervous shiver just got a flashback of igns game reviews xd
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,hopefully this will bring the rts genre back on track and then maybe well get a new cc!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-26,"best aoe out there now for me. love the graphics, art style, audio and pretty much all the rest and the campaign is brilliant."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,damn i can't wait to get this. when i was in middle school every class room had like 3 computers and age of empires. so at lunch there would be a ton of lobby of just flat worlds and max resources and everyone would just strait fight
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-13,"i bought aoe2 in high school when it came out and loved it. aoe3 came out when i was overseas and i was able to eventually get my hands on it and play when i could. i've been waiting and hoping this new addition would come out and i'm so glad it finally did. hopefully i won't have to wait another 1520 years for a new one. i'll be buying it for my kid by then, not me."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,"what a great review, what totally sold it to me was the history channel content. i always loved the aoe campaigns because of that."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-10,"cossacks games from the early 2000s had a limit to max 8.000 soldiers on the map, and even that was lifted. several years ago i managed to achieve around 28.000 soldiers before the game started crashing all the time. it felt incredible"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"my favorite part of aoe2 was the ability for two players to play the same empire. you could have one in charge of military while the other runs the economy. it was a lot of fun being the same empire, and is very different than just being on the same team. few games allow this, another honorable mention that does it is tzar the burden of the crown you can choose on unit share for allies. gameranx, do they allow two players to be the same empire? literally, not just playing the same empire as each other."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"man, i'm so stoked for this game. i can never play aoe 2 for more than a match or two because of how dated the controls feel. i'm excited to have a more modern iteration so i can finally get my rts fix."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,omg it look so much better now ... without the technical stress test floating around
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-30,as a graduate of uni of lincoln it was very cool to see my city in the game especially after exploring the ancient castle myself and learning it's history.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-04,"this sounds like nostalgia speaking, it just felt like a remake of aoe2 to me."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-11,"use to play these back when dialup and satellite internet was the thing in rural areas, loved messing around with the console commands when i was younger."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,would made more sense to do the bronze age civs instead of the medieval period for a soft reboot.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-03,bro just took me back to when i was 5 years old and the world was still a blur. its not your dads strategy war game anymore man i cant even describe the feeling that those words just gave me.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,ive played this early and its so much fun. im just stoked i get to play this from day 1 and learn it with everyone and have a chance at being good at it. starting fresh on aoe2 now is horrid. you just swamped by good players even in casual mp. 100 pick this game up. its awesome
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,i think keeping the basic gameplay and format is genius. aoe was always a blast to play. just enough simplicity and complexity to appeal to a ton of different play styles. i'm happy to see they have finally come out with a new aoe with updated graphics.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"if it aint broke, dont break it. good job devs."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-18,i purchased windows 98 cd and found aoe trial version in cd. i installed the game and keep trying to play for 3 days as internet those times was very slow so never tried online tutorial. fortunately i was able to play it and it's still very active all variants are awesome. aoe 4 is great build. goodluck aoe lovers.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,i love this series so much and i really did learn a lot about different time periods and events. i've been excited about this for years and i've been extremely impressed and appreciative of the remasters developed so far.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-04,"was looking forward to play this game with my father just like we did when i was a kid 20 years ago, unfortunately my father passed away 2 months ago and nothing has been the same since. still getting the game but something will be missing."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"i am looking forward to jump in on day one. watching reviews to feed the happy expectations. thank you for this passionate review, jake"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,i have logged more hours playing aoe than any other game. this game has a way of pulling you into these multi hour games. i am honestly glad they went back to the original look and feel of the gameplay. aoe3 was a new and an interesting way to play the classic but it just didnt have the same feel and i found myself not playing it as much as the others.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,"i dunno man, i was excited for this, but aoe3 tad still holds up and this feels like a step backwards."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,it's fun watching a before you buy video after pre ordering the game. got the digital deluxe on steam because i wanted to get everything they had to offer. aoe 2 and aoe 3 were gifted to me by my dad and they were a huge part of my childhood. this time i could buy the game with my own money and that feels really good.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-16,this game was a joke. aoe2 will never die
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"back when i was kid my first game i played was empire earth. very simmilar to aoe. it was a solid strategy game , but also educational , full of historical moments, battles , events. thanks for the review , i m 100 going to pick up this game."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,age of empires 2 definitive edition is still way better.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"aoe 2 got me into pc gaming when i seen my younger brother play it , what a legendary game ... i am 44 years old now , have not pc gamed for a few years now , but i want to play this ... i wonder if this would run on my m1 macbook air i use for work on the road ..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,feels overpriced for the amount of dlc incoming
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"aoe was the first computer game i ever played aside from moonlander on my dads oblong mac. i was visiting my friend in another part of the country, so everything around me was new and mysterious, my friend started a game without telling or showing me nothing beforehand, poped me down in front of the computer, turned off the lights and left the room. after building my first clubman i was hooked!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"ayye a long time coming for this one! does anyone remember that cover art from the days of aoe 3 that showed games 1 through 5?? that was dope, and the envisioned aoe 4 and 5 in that looked incredible. wish it could of been true"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"age of empires made me love and get interested about history, especialy western european !! over 20 years later, i learned so much, started to speak old norse, a bit mittelhochdeutsch, and will learn old english. i just love it, and it all started with aoe 1 but even more aoe2. changed my life literaly though sometimes i forget how to write . english, german .... it made a little girl, a history and old languages fanatic!!!! thanks for the video, by the way !!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"can't wait to play as the mongols, they look like fun! glad this game turned out good. i do hope they add more factionscivilizations though."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,something that people never talk about when they're talking about rts game is gameplay fluidity it's something that you notice when you play old blizzard rts games like starcraft and warcraft where the gameplay feels so fluid without any delay at all which makes the gameplay feel a thousand times better
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,the fact i first started playing age of empires in kindergarten blows my mind. i am now going into my last year of uni. time goes by wayyyyy too fast
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-20,i don't know why i've never gotten into aoe. i'm a big history buff and i love these type of games. definitely going to check this out.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,"its almost the same as aoe 2 me thank you lord, we dint want a repeat of aoe3"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-13,"i grew up watching my brother play games like dune 2000, lord of the rings battle for middle earth, the original aoe, aoe 2, rise of nations, u name it, and for me being in college away from my home town, buy and playing this game, know where it comes from it just feels right im really happy, and want to explore it more, im 23 btw xd"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"aoe2, rise of nations, starcraft, and warcraft 3 were the first games that introduced me to the rts genre. aoe4 looks like a combination of aoe2 and rise of nations and i'm already sold!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-05,first one. and its very very very boring. ill stick to total war. this was just a waste of money. this game has no content
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,i love this game it focuses on understanding tactics not build order and muscle memory. i love how obvious the weapons are to identify. i can't wait to see what this game becomes. i like how the hot keys are for units and formations not on building buildings. also best campaign on a rts since northgard.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"that's a really stellar intro to the game. i've seen about a dozen videos of people discussing and playing the game and couldn't make much of it, and then sotl comes in and nails it in just under 15 minutes. that's a pro creator move right there..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"350 villagers actually have an autogarrison key on g next to the manual garrison, so you dont even need to click the tc then, just the hotkey and they take cover on their own"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,loved aoe4 throughout the beta. glad to see you're making content on the game!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,i'm loving the aoe4 content! i look forward to hopefully seeing civilization specific videos!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"thank you for uploading. i was a hardcore starcraft 2 player a while back, and this will help me in the transition."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"another note about setting buildings on fire unless they changed something from the open stress test, buildings on fire will actually continuously take damage until they're repaired from their burning state. you can set a building on fire by getting it's hp low enough then walk away and let mother nature take care of it for you. it's slow as all get out, but if you, or your opponent, take some damage on your buildings and fail to repair it from burning, you could be in some trouble later as your buildings seem to collapse from nothing."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"i'm excited for when they add the editor, because then you can really make those math videos we love."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"a great followup tip, after you've played around a bit with the info in this video, is to then learn a single build and practice it. that's probably the most common, and crucial, bit of advice i see given to aoe2 players who are either new or wanting to improve their skill. don't be super picky about which build as, once you've gotten good at it, it'll be much easier to pick up further builds to add to your repertoire."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-16,this is so advanced for a beginner like me...i needed a what botton to press to make things move...might be back to subscribe one day
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-27,"honestly thank you, i wasnt sure about how easy it would be to get into, but this was very well put together and easy to understand."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,the videos are pumping out like hotcakes!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"i enjoy the aoe4 content! keep it coming  i'll pick it up eventually, the campaigns look super cool."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-12,"thank you for working on aoe4 bro. your voice is really peaceful to listen to. thats the reason why i am watching your aoe2 video, although, i havent played it for the past 10 years."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"thank you for mentioning that f1 key selects all military buildings, and f2 all economic buildings. coming from games like sc2, wc3 and cnc3, i've gotten so used to putting all economic buildings on one hotkey so that i can find the upgrades, and all military buildings on another hotkey to help with production. this is such a nice quality of life improvement!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-26,"this is, by far, the best video i've watched for begginers in aoe iv. and i've watched plenty now since i bought the game a couple of days before"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,wow a beginners guide for a game i've been playing for nearly two decades. it's come full circle.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,gods i hope there's going to be a new civ series. they were by far some of my favorite videos from aoe2.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-26,"i really love this game due to unit mechanics like spearmen standing ground, shield walls, and the cavalry charge along with archers being ontop of walls"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"thank you for all the content, your work has been helping me cruise through my work days. ive been learning aoe2 at an awesome rate these last few weeks and cant wait to dig into aoe4. cheers."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"biggest aesthetic gripe for me is the icons, i do missprefer the artistic aoe2 icons over the simplistic ones of age4."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-08,one of the best introductionreminder vids ive seen appreciate ya
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"thanks, i've been following you for years and you made me buy aoe4, i deserve a little qt gaming time. even if i'm 32 d"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,love both the aoe 4  2 content
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,empire earth player moving to this game after a long rts break. excited. how trading works is most confusing thing for me. thanks
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-07,been looking to improve my game and figured i'd revisit the basics  super informative!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"this is an amazing guide. will take a bit of time to really get used to them and utilise all their strengths, but so keen!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,definitive guide for both 2 and 4 now. staying at the top of your game for sure!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-17,"thanks for making this video, i hope you do even more content around beginner tips to this game! i am completely new to rts new to your channel as well and its been... difficult.. to say the least... feels like i will forever get stomped in this game! but, this guide has definitely helped me out and i'm starting to see small improvements! so thank you!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-08-26,"i've never played age of empiresnot sure why but i love civilization, watching this video reminds me of a game i used to love playing years ago called settlers. think it's time i gave age of empires a go"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-28,"this was a very thorough and helpful video, thanks for making it."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-10,"so i played a few matches now before the game crashed because of my lack of ram. but what i played i enjoyed very much, i can't complain for now. maybe some more civilizations in the future but for now i'm happy with what i got, considering the gaming industry now days. i was especially surprised with the campaign, i love the historical real life movies with added ghost armies to illustrate what happened."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-09,gota say bud. its nice to find a video that focuses on people that are waiting to play the game. not those who have played and want more. very helpful. p.s. glad they have gone back to aoe2 style by the looks  3 put me off a bit.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,i like the idea that ageing up is a building  it will be interesting to see pro games where the winner has literally 0 seconds idle tc time.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,love the video and also nice to see yt comments that have some positive feedback or critic on the game instead of all the hate. see ya all tomorrow at 5!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"to be honest i feel the light unit iis actually reclassification of 'trash' units, with some rebalance. basically aoe 4 archers actually fulfil the roles of the skirmisher basically they counter spearmen and heavier archers. scout lines are weaker and more specialized against archers so they aren't as effective as general raiding unit and are weaker in melee"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-13,aoe4 has been a very good experience so far. bravo to the development team!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,i'm really glad you're making videos on age four. i am looking forward to more coming out. i know i wouldn't be nearly as successful at playing age two if it wasn't for your videos. i like your new outro music. keep up the great work.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-12,thanks! i'm brand new to aoe and this was helpful!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-24,thanks i played aoe2 b4 and now playing 4 on my xbox this will be some great help i'll start as the english 1st vs easy ai to get the basics
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-03,"played this game for the first time yesterday. not that far from aoe2, which i also didnt play that often. it was really easy to get in, not sure why so many ppl complain. great game. really enjoy the game, got my best friend into buying it, we will most likely now play with 4 players"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,please continue with your campaign playthrough. i really enjoy your style and tone.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"thank you for this guide! i hope you keep making more aoe4 videos, your explanations are always the best for these games."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"i don't know if aoe4 will be successful or not but in case it's here to stick around  even if it's less popular than 2  i really hope you will still make content for it like this video. awesome stuff, thanks a lot!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-03,this is so helpful. thank you!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,thanks for making this! seriously thinking of getting 4 now.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"excellent guides, i especially enjoyed the feudal age in 5 minutes guide"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"i was very skeptical, but there are some nice features for sure. the new defensive buildings makes much more sense, enough with castles destroyed by swordsman"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,i learned more from this 14 min video than an hour of actually playing the game.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,i really don't like the icons for units and upgrades. you need to focus on the outline to see what it is. in other games they're with colour which are so much faster to recognise at a glance.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"i live a simple life. sotl uploads, i click"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,cool they remastered age of empires 3... nice! can't wait to get my hands on something fresh one day before i pass out i hope!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"great, compact introduction video. i can't wait for the release tomorrow. i hope you make more aoe4 content, the game has great potential in my opinion."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,thanks sotl for a review of the game instead of all the constant whining about things not being same as aoe2 or 3 that some other ppl entertain them selves with. very refreshing and relevant.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-12,we need more spirit of the law for aoe 4 ! plx
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-06,your tutorials are great! much thanks
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-12,i have played a lot of warlords battlecry 2 and could see lot of similarities in units have played a little bit of aoe 3 as well. anticipating to play this one
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"thanks, a lot of useful information in this video."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,what the heck. youtube unsubbed me from your channel! so glad i manually looked you up for aoe4 content.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-08,"with control groups.. it's like sc2 control groups maybe aoe2 as well but i haven't played that, with control will set whatever units or buildings you have selected as the control group. however shift  number will add the units or buildings to a control group, without reseting the control group. i haven't tested this one, but alt  number will likely remove the units or buildings selected from any other control group, and put them only to the control group selected. this also does not add units like shift does, it resets the control group that you binded them to."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"thanks for the good content, keep it up"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-23,"1037 picks up relic, rotates it 90 degrees and probably tosses it into an open window of the monastery."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,great video as always!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-12,"great video, comprehensive as always. just a minor tidbit nitpick archers are also infantry, so the blacksmith text was correct from the get go."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-19,thanks spirit!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,lets get an intro recreating the aoe2 intro!!

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-15,thx to you now i can defeat intermediate a.i with out problem before that i couldn't even win on easy or was struggling
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"i personally start my games with 4 villagers on the sheep, 2 to build 2 houses and then transition into wood, after that around 6 more to food and the rest before the next age to gold, depending on what civilization i'm playing and what type of map it is. i tweak it a little for chinese sense their tax collectors make 15 extra gold when over seeing gold mines so i usually throw 2 to 3 extra workers on wood at the end of dark age. and water maps i put around 4 on wood before worrying about gold."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-31,bought aoe2 instead of aoe4 but im finding aoe4 to look so much better. excited to buy and play this soon too!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,beautiful thank you

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,awesome content! keep it up
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-02-04,thank you i stay on aoe2 de after this video
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"hi law, spirit of the guy here."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"i do like the idea of having an indication of where the monk is. i hate hearing the sound and then having to search for the monk, difficult when you have multiple fronts."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-28,455 turn on captions
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"mongolia, mongolia, mongolia! so excited!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,what is that music starting from around 1300? it reminds me of the anno 1800 soundtrack 'a night at the cabaret'. i really like that song.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,i don't understand the disdain towards aoe4. it looks good. from my dumbass perspective it doesn't look like it's going to render aoe2 obsolete anytime soon
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"i'm pleased to see that the devs implemented most of the fundamental game mechanics from aoe2. aoe4 is the real sequel to aoe2. i can't wait to watch the toptier aoe2 players play aoe4 and how they adapt, etc. btw, t90 needs help with the hotkeys. my only suggestion was to remap a keyboard in software. also he is having a hard time placing farms efficiently.  seriously though, do you have any ideas or insights on streamlining the interface for experienced aoe2 players?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-04,nice video. thanks
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,aoe4 is stier rts
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-20,"cool video, just a few thoughts on my part  unit pathing is really bad in certain situations sometimes the units go all the way around a big building or around the gold instead of just going around their allied units, which would have been a lot quicker  you can build a gate even when the wall has not been built, simply select the wall part the blue print and there you should see the option to turn the wall into a gate"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-22,its a very good rts especially for consoles...cant wait for 2025 dlc and new civs they will add to the game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-09,"i like it a lot, but i already mastered aoe2, so i play aoe4 often, but no everytime i could"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,wololo
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-19,stagnation??? u play one meme map in the vid and no ranked whatsoever...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-08,"i wouldn't want to see more innovation in rts, aoe4 innovates enough with the unique landmark age up mechanic, hard counter system, and the influence mechanic. there is even more innovation in the form of game modes, you can start as nomad, as an empire, play seasonal events, and so on. sometime when people ask for rts innovation it just sounds to me like they don't even like rts and want it to be something different, i had the same feeling watching your video innovation shouldn't equate to changing the genre we like it for what it is. and i sincerely don't see what you imply by saying it should be more innovative that it doesn't already do"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-05,"when i was 16 i played age of empires ii the age of kings for hours, each day without internet. just me and the game in my room, thinking about nothing else. and now i'm 37 and downloading age of empire again. my mind is full of life problems and responsibilities, i will not enjoy playing like before. i miss my childhood.."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-03,"i remember playing age of empires 3 with my dad, and it was always one of my fav memories with him, him teaching me how to play, telling me strategies, but eventually, i just drifted away from the game, maybe because i got a new pc and i didint have age of empires on it, maybe because my dad moved out and i only got to visit him during the weekends and he didint have much time to play with me, or maybe because i got bored of the game, i was always afraid of a challenge, so i always played on the easiest difficulty. all i remember is charging in with cavalry and destroying villages, that was fun"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,stone walls are actually realistic in this game now. only siege weapons will bring them down. i always found it stupid that a sword or arrow would break a stone wall.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-11,"i miss the photorealistic icons instead of these mono color ones, they had a certain charm to them."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"i personally enjoy the game. started playing the campaign and it is entertaining. is it worth 60, well i paid it. i'm glad they are keeping this series alive. wish they would remake close combat and other old microsoft pc games."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-13,"haven't played a aoe game since 1998, got this downloading now and i can't wait, so excited to play a modern version of my old childhood joy."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-03,thanks for a non comment video.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-07,i wish they'd make aoe more like the rome game where you built villas and stuff but you also had to built food and religion and entertainment for them to be happy and healthy and to help keep crime down
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-04,"i love all age of empires games but i would like to change some stuff,such ac world dynamics...its to flat in a sense,nothing is moving.trees ,grass,...why not include wind power,and day and night cycle.some small changes which can still make game cool"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-04,"my wildest dream is that you have an age of empires game , where you start from the stone age and you advance through the ages until global age . it will be the most long game , but it will be the most destructive game ever"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-12,i will never understand how the ais on this game can get age 2 within 3 min. i just take my time gettin food and they over here age 15 and a half by the time im finally age 2

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-04,greatest game ever made
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-08,i was expecting aoe4 to be more like a mixture of napoleon total war fighting and aoe 3 that goes from colonial to civil war or possibly ww1 era as the top age. i'm kinda disappointed aoe4 is just a mix of aoe2 mechanics and aoe3 graphics....

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-14,so hype!!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-28,"battles dont feel like battles tho if there is no blood or some element of gore i mean adding a enabledisable bloodgore should be okay roight? when you battle it feels like a big sparring fight , physics are also bad compared to age of empires 3 .. like the game allows you to kill villagerssoldiers burn buildings etc but adding blood is just too muchhhhhh"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-22,
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-14,superb images art hope the campaign is good too
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-08-30,where are the aztecas?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-11,everybody gangsta until wololo becomes area of effect.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,"at last, walls that you can put archers on, i am ready..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-12,this game looks exactly like what all those fake mobile game ads pretend their games look like
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-16,guess how many mobile games will use this in their ads.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-14,"memories of those low graphic kings playing chess, i still dont know who won."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,"i hope they work on the pathfinding, the movement of units and these arrows"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-14,"at least it's a pure classical rts that we need, but those arrow animations are scratching my brain"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-16,"the buildings and environment look good, but there's something about the player models that doesn't quite match... they look more cartoony than the original games."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-12,i'm so excited for age of empires 22.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-12,"finally, the villagers fire hunting arrows at enemies, instead of using the short knife."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,253 i can so relate with the two lazy guys just chillin in the forest during the ambush
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-05-16,"1. the arrows certainly need to be scaled down with some curvature in trajectory. 2. catapult needs crews, not much, just two dudes operating them, it certainly needs to be there. 3. need blood  skeletons of dead units to be around longer like aoe1 ror 199798can be made as optional toggles. 4. will be really nice if the buildings lose some pieces every time they are bombarded or attacked like aoe3 and like aoe3 the animation should not be prerendered. 5. somebody please copy  paste this at aoe4 forums where the developers are present  active."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-13,age of empires ii extra definitive edition
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,arrow movement looks like guided missiles
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-15,those projectiles need serious rework. the arrows look like spears.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-15,who here's still waiting for age of mythology 2
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-14,i hope they will change the physics of these arrows that are triggering me...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,250 everybody gangsta until the trees start speaking mongol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,"the buildings look great, but the units ... well ... look better in age 2"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-23,i'm impressed by these graphics!  someone in 2005
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-14,the giant arrows and wonky animations are killing the vibe did we just go back in time...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,those arrows and unit models look weird. hope they improve that
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,blood discovered in 1628. people in 1627
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-15,i really hope they make the units look less goofy and more like they did in 3
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-12,"technically, this looks like it could have released 10 years ago, wtf"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-14,they better have some massive maps. so far they look tiny af.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,"high ground and low ground terrains, ambushes, siege battle on walls, nomad civilisation..... just plug it into my veins!! i want this!!!!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-15,"only 6 years separates aoe 2 and aoe 3. they went from 2d to 3d. now, 16 years later we get the same exact graphics as aoe 3 ..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,age of empires iv  age of empires ii definitive edition hd
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-14,am i the the only one who needs another rise of nations?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-11,finally players will build walls of rock instead of walls of markets and universities.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-18,"what throws me off are the sizes of the buildings, they are too small for the size of the soldiers."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,539 everybody gangsta until wololo comes in
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,darn ill miss the more realistic look of age 3. not really sure i dig the cartoony look of this one. looks fun though!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-13,i wish they'd bring back the decaying bodies on the feild....
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-17,539 the most epic wololo
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-13,they should really make an age of mythology definitive edition
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,they have to make those arrows fly more realistic and slower. now it just looks weird...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,"looking forward to this. though, it's a bit bright and cartoony. and projectiles, arrows and such need some work they travel perfectly straight and then disappear. i think it's mostly because the entire arrow appears white, if they made the tips darker maybe that would draw attention away from the pathing."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-19,"cant wait to play against my older brother while hes secretly using robin hood, rock on, philly cheese steak jimmys and lumber jack."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,i didn't expect the graphics to be like that tbh
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,that wololo at the end.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,they finally added the chance to have troops on the walls
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-26,those arrows got me laughing every time
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-11,"i hope they make buildings little bigger, units look like giants comparing to the buildings."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-11,"somehow it looks like an unholy mixture of aoe iii, aom and stronghold, i highly doubt that it'll ever reach the popularity of aoe ii."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,i think shooting arrows are not as realistic as other aoe games . i hope they can fix that
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-16,now i'm waiting for aoe 4 hd edition lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,"gonna be honest, i expected more unit detail. these looks like on the level of the definitive editions."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,"i love that they introduced real special abilities to each nation. like mongols can take their buildings with them, just like they did irl and still do not all, but still many."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,the incredibly massive arrows just looks bad
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-16,wow those are really big lego swords and arrows!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-12,"since we've been spoiled by tw for years now, when i see cav charge, i expect them to knock over units."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,the only thing i'd really like would be more detailed units.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-12,cavalry with lances that suddenly stop before impact..... really dynamic lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-15,all this did was make me appreciate aoe 2 even more.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-11,guy prostagma me vulome
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-12,age of empires 2  cartoon edition
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,hiding in the forest and taking the enemy by surprise will be great to do in multiplayer xd
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-14,i love the age of empires theme song mixed to the various cultures being shown.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-12,even arrows move more realistic on age of empires 2
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,the graphics sadly dont look much better than aoe 3 definitive edition. still exciting tho.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-11,im kinda dissapointed by the very low amount of army units on the screen tho
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-16,why are the graphics poor? i would expect this quality 10 years ago
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-12,"2008 called, they want their graphics back."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,that epic and deep wololo at the end..it hit me so hard..
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-12,this looks exactly like if those phone ads were an actual game lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-16,"we need more physic details, the charge from the horses its so bad."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,"love this so far, but the buildings look really small and far apart. i would love it if they were bigger and you could make less empty looking towns."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-11,dat frame drops though!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,welcome to the year of 2000 fellas
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-23,do you guys not have phones?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,please don't make one of these modern uninspired 2 colored uis that you see in every game nowadays and make it look more pretty and artistic like the old games.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-12,i remember aoe 3 trailer release with the sickest water graphics and ships. kinda disappointed not to see that in here.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-12,looks like well developed mobile game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-22,age of empires i classical era age of empires ii medieval era age of empires iii age of exploration age of empires iv medieval era
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-14,"this looks like upgraded version of age of empires online, with archers on the wall dlc."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,whats with the arrows being 6 feet long and curving on strange arches..
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-11,522 lmao that explosion tho
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-17,those 3 floors high indian elephants are really impressive. too bad that they extinct!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-12,338 that frame drops are insane hahaha
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,wololo !!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-11,"so, it's basically age of empires 2 with an age of empires 3 skin."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-15,"not gonna lie, this just makes me want to play medieval total war 2 again. its not quite what i hoped for sadly"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,and here i thought i will never get aoe4
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-14,so they finally made age of empires 2! again
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-15,age of empires 4 or aoe definitive edition part 2?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-15,the engine looks like an mobile game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-11,age of empires online 2011 definitive edition
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,the game looks absolutely amazing but i hope they reduce the size of the arrows.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-11,have we waited for this all these years ?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-16,"tbh, for the aoeiv i was expecting much more populated battles, even if we don't need to be so close to the action e.g. more rendering for the machine. i feel kinda bummed."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-13,looks great for 2009..
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-11,"i don't know bro, it just doesn't look like something that would last two decades currently."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-10,those arrows... oof!!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-19,this looks great for an old mobile game!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-13,"please, we need to have blood in this game..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-12,"2011 called, they want their graphics back"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-11,im just gon hope that animations will be improved by the time they release the full version
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-04-15,age of empires ii mobile edition
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,jesus  infinite guns it's just basic science!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,i like your tea and choice in video games.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-30,spiff aoe 4 is a perfectly balanced game. french civ ...and i took that personally
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,me in 1997 playing age of empires i wonder what games will be like in 24 years? 2021
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,"this is not done by error but it's historically accurate, ever wondered how we ended up with multiple relic like 12 femur of the same saint?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,the spiffing brit's comment section is a perfectly balanced community with no exploits!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,i fondly remember having an aoe match where i just had a wall of castles filled with the nation's special units that added loads of arrows to the castle's own attack. nothing could get past them and things like catapults were dead before they could deal damage. the things shot like 20 arrows per attack.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,"strangely, this was the exact relic strategy used by the realworld medieval churches."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-02,"the economy score takes into account how efficiently the resources are used. having a bunch of resources, but not using them, is considered very inefficient, hence a low score."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,"the first 100000 of you to like this video won't have their homes invaded by overpowered russian troops  meanwhile, the spiffing brit be like my goodness, 40 million likes on a video in 4 hours. weirdly, most of them are coming from ukraine. that is simply majestic."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,human casualties are temporary casualties you really nailed the russian way of war.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,"so exciting to have this game back again. additionally can you get the shelby cobra? i want to see you use the cobra. fairly and balancedly, of course."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,"if spiff were to recreate this exploit irl, he would just use yorkshire tea for relics. even if the exploit doesn't directly give him resources, he still gets infinite tea."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-07,"the historical accuracy of this game is amazing! after all, relics were duped irl all the time. well, either that or most saints had some very disfigured, centipedal bodies."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-07,"to be fair, jesus has a history of duplicating items for his followers so i believe this game is canonically accurate"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,as soon as i saw him pick the rus i knew where this was going. i am also happy to say this glitch has been rectified as of yesterday's patch.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-30,"this comment section is perfectly balanced, with no exploits what so ever"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,its funny how the chinese just couldnt get through the great wall of russia
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-02,"is it just me or i found it hilarious whenever spiffing brit saying something non comedy in almost every videos he had, such as 1618 ooh you have a canon, very nice but that canon is now dead, ooh you have a catapult very nice but that is also now dead"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,"hey spiff, hope your game goes well, just wanted to suggest exploiting the new systems in the hoi4 no step back dlc, just a thought. have a good one"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-30,parasocial relationships are perfectly balanced with no exploits.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,imagine liking and commenting the premiere to help spiff test a youtube exploit
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,"let's be honest, spiff chose the rus to abuse and exploit because the french have already been abused and exploited by every top tier aoe4 player who were pros from the other games who had benefit of beta testing by now."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-17,the only thing bad about spiffing brit and comment section is nobody talks about if it is patched or not
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-02,thank you for waiting for them to patch this glitch before uploading this video lol

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,damn. that's... that's a crazy exploit.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,was just checking if there were any new videos and saw this chance to join the experiment.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,i think the score got too high. i don't think they ever anticipated it to go over a certain amount so it just wrapped back aroun to zero and started again from there. an integer overflow.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,"tea is the best, and remember insurance fraud is the only way to go."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,i think spiff is secretly a russian. built a massive army of inexperienced musket shooters and rushed the enemy. stalin approves
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-04,i just want you to know that as an american i never really drink tea but because of you i bought a box of the red yorkshire tea on amazon and now its been part of my daily routine for months.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,this premiere is completely balanced.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-01,the video hasnt started yet but i am sure it will be awesome because of the host.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-30,looking forward to this one. comment for the almighty algorithm.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-30,"i find myself wondering, only briefly, if youtube comments that are containing of more words than normal, or perhaps even key words like fantastic, best, love, tea, great, splendid, handsome, british, csgo pro, fortnight, age, empires will help or in some way affect the outcome of the search algorithum."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-02,"fun, as always. keen to hop in and try this myself. tyvm frenn"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"aoe4 is the best realtime strategy game i've ever played. i'm very happy with its current state and having fun in all pvp modes. the campaign was a great experience with all the historical context included, which has always attracted me a lot in aoe. great job, beasty, and greetings from brazil!!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"hell yeah, putting the strategy back into 'rts'"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"what a great game. they saved it early enough, and now it feels so good to play competitively. only game i want to play!!!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"people are so used to negativity in aoe4 and gaming communities in general that this video still gets comments purely complaining about the game, or calling it out as glazing. fucking wild. these people are doing more to try and kill the game than lack of content, poor balance, or just about anything else they complain about."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"as a console player, i had a lot of fun with the campaign got aoe4 via game pass but have absolutely zero intentions, to ever play it competitive myself, even on the lowest leagues. ranked game counter stays 0. but i follow this game via egc, drongo and you basically since the release and i barely remember any day in the last years, where i didn't watch at least some aoe 4 content. love how this game has developed, it's so much fun to watch. thanks to everyone who makes it possible, you all do a great job. to the next year's and whatever is about to come!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"i'm diving right into ranked with a friend in team games...we suffered a lot of losses at the start, but we are starting to learn and get wins after just trying to have fun and learn playing matches...still in bronze lol but i'm having a kickass time 3 never really played rts online before and aoe4 has been some of the most fun"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,im also an old sc2 player and i agree. i would also add that for team games the variety of the civs adds a lot of dynamic to the team games. its fun to play at lower levels as there are so many approaches to everything. in sc2 there are only two resources and one way to win which makes things stale.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"if youre nervous about the price, it often goes on sale for 20 or you can try it on game pass."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"ive played age of empires since the original released in 97.aoe4 is the best honestly, great game! highly addictive!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-14,great video! thanks for promoting this game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-12,"as someone who got into gaming because of strategy games warcraft 2 and has played every major rts game, i can confidently say aoe4 is in the top 3 rts games of all time. especially in the multiplayer aspect. can't wait to see what the future holds with dlcs and patches!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,thx for your amazing work for the game and community!!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,every day i take a look in the abo section starving for you announcing the new civs to us i am actually taking a break until dlc drops right now to be maximum hyped
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,i started playing a month ago first rts its awesome your vids are great i got all my boys on it too even the xbox kids  it being on game pass deff helps a lot
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,requesting feudal allin tier list thanks qt pie
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,best rts game.. hands down
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"im strongly considering coming back. i left for age of mythology retold, and that game is getting frustrating. a lot of defeats feel cheesy with op god powers where if youre a bit behind on an age up, you can get slammed with an attack that has huge aoe weakening your buildings followed immediately by a huge flood attack that can hit about 14 of the total map. much of this is due to the new chinese dlc, but as someone who plays ranked and enjoys being able to gradually improve these losses dont have much rhyme or reason other than not knowing about it a corny tactic. im not a cheese player, so i dont want to try and emulate that kind of strategy since it is short term. what drove me away from aoe4 was the overly boomy playstyle and the siege balls. namely styles like ottoman death balls, which while they take awhile to build up, were frustrating to face in the ffas id play where on player boomed silently in the corner. i also found english frustrating since they felt like they could sit back and do well, despite losing engagements and map control. mind you i was only diamond. it looks like pro scouts at least requires them to go out, and in turn, will greatly reward the player who takes map control. this balance might be just what the game needed. that, plus i miss the responsiveness of the game, whereas aomr requires you to babysit units since they can get caught up stuck on others and theres no way to find them since they dont register as idle. this wasnt a problem at all with aoe4."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"what a timing kekw! after beastyqt releases this video, in the same day, aoe officially released the new dlc !"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,for me it is the best rts out there at the moment.... ....because i'm butchering everyone in the world
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,w propaganda my liege
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-14,"only 1 thing i hate is the network delay lag which happens alot ,i hope devs will improve it"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"ive been coming back now and then and its one of my most played games ever 1,5k hours and i feel like i havent played that much"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,aoe4 is the game i put most hours in. played every season. taking a break to play mh wilds. aoe4 and beasty with his chat helped me through the worst times of my life.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-12,i took a break from the game and now it is a pain to return. my elo is way too high now that i haven't played it for a while. the elo should be more volatile when you return to the game after a while.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,"i love this game, have already had an absurd of hours of fun with it"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-13,my only complaint is the child like profile decorators which are very similar to coh3 pokemon kinda cartoon style and theme. the game itself i love.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,i am plat 3 with 56 wr and never pro scout or even care to try. if youre low elo complaining about pro scout meta its a skill issue..
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"worth to mention that campaign gameplay is not that great becouse devs do not implement changes from other gamemodes like multiplayer into campaign balance french from campaign is a bit different than french from skirmish, initial release balance that campaign uses was.... tricky p"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-12,as a casual i like to play the ai to learn the civs and i've been having fun with it.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-13,i'm back to aoe4 today
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,"hey beasty, im new like 3 days ago new, and ive watched about 2030 hours of content from creators and still get owned by the intermediate ai im scared of live matches. can you make a video not the how to win more style about learning terms, game play, and general knowledge about the game. btw i play ottoman but im still too slow when it comes to rolling out my ms as well as having terrible economic management"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,me and some friends tried jumping on to multiplayer as we've been casually having a blast playing with each other and got absolutely torn to shreds multiple games in a row by goldplat players. i have no idea how a casual player gets into this game without dedicating most of their time to it
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,"the only thing i wish is that the civs were more unique e.g. like sc2. i understand that it is a historical game though, so it is a bit harder to pull off."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-13,i played hundreds of hours in aoe 2... but now aoe 4 is finally on a 60 sale. i think my time has come. this video came at the right time .
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,aoe4 is the best rts ever. pro scouts is lame tho
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-13,i'm more of a solo player. so i wonder how the campaings are like for aoe4? and if each existing civ also has one. because with aoe2 it kinda bothers me that not each civ has a campaign of it's own. it would be cool if they had.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"im still mad about the removal of springralds as counter siege.... i mean its good but also hella anoying now ot kill canons and trebuchets... horsesmele units have trouble reaching the siege, they act dumb when u press to atakc ther siege. but now ranged units like archers crossboy arrcher horses are very effective vs siege... so its a cool mix up but im still mad about it... but i agree that its a nice touch that everry season or like 6 months they change the hole gameplay baasicly by changing stuff. like making walls more expensive and slower to build. orr removing the option of stone on french trader or make stone slower in guild hall. like basicly trying to nerve wallz keeps etc. and now rremoving springralds as anti siege. its cool doh but sucks but makesu change up the game play so its a bit fresh"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,it really is the best
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-14,"the game has a discount of 60 on steam, it's the right time to get it i guess."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,have they added any new civs that arent behind a paywall
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"i wonder, is the coming dlc gonna be 1 new civ 1 variant, or 2 variant civs.."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,"the only issue for me is time, as much as i'd want to try it out. i'll just settle for watching beasty and aoe4 content..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,if yall don't buy the dlc we fighting
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-14,ty
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,"let's be honest, aoe 4 is much better than it was at launch. anyone telling you differently hasn't played the game. i've been playing it much more recently. more choices of how to play, lots of maps, just need more civ variety really now. and a ui clean up, its very clunky"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-15,this is the only game i play. how to put in at least 100 hours so far
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,i was playing the game since day one. i played every day but suddenly i lost interest in the last 4 months
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,what do you think about aoe ii? i like it but i prefer aoe iv c
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,for me aoe4 is second best rts. number 1 is beyond all reason.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,aoe 4 is insanly good!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-12,aoe2 vs aoe4 ??
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-13,i dont like the campaign. but this game is the best beside wc3 and sc2 atm.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,haha he said doodoo 1018
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,clap clap
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,aoe is really fun right now but this proscoutmeta is annoying
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-12,the game itself is great but the ui out of game is the worst out of any game i've ever played
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,pog
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,wait for the dlc and the new civs and the balance.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-12,"respectfully, this game is unplayable unless youre a huge sweat."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-17,"i may try it out this year. i've always been an avid aoe2 guy, and i've mostly stayed away from aoe4 purely because i'm not super keen on the art aesthetics it has everyone has their own taste preferences, no big deal. but i do hear good things... so maybe this is the year i give it a go. side note about other rts getting updates i have a feeling wc3 is about to start getting more attention from microsoft. they've already touched it a little, with the recent patches and changes to fixup the disaster that is reforged. it's still al work in progress, but, given certain recent events bringing a lot of eyes across to the game, i'm hopeful that it is about to get some much overdue love"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,i'll come to aoe 4 when they will have an mmr system instead a point one coupled with an invisible mmr
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,4rd
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,can we balance rus please? thank you.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,this game really needs a visual update. so much stuff looks so bad
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"aoe4 is the best it's ever been, in my opinion"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,first
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-12,"if you enjoy someone's 13 year old chasing your villagers in and out of their towers repeatedly with knights at 6 minutes into the game then sure, its a good game l o l. if you ask me aoe4 has horrible balancing and is just a massive waste of your time, not sure how much they paid bro to say this game is good but its actually like a hard 410 in terms of all videogames"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,sevenst
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,third
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,aoe3 deserves more updates

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"ranked matchmaking still broken, especially from bronze to platinum. they mix people who want to rank up with casual players that leave for the smallest reasons or hardly try and don't care about ranked. quite annoying. they need to add more requirments for ranked or have more penalties."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,deer meta ruined the game. it's so fucking stupid
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"healthy and balance? they changed the siege where there is no counter to siege, then they took the sieges favorite target and gave that target slightly extra damage to counter siege. so the unit that takes the most damage from a mango now is the only unit that can have a chance to counter it?? and this is healthy?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,those aoe2 videos and graphics are disgusting. how can anyone play that?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,fighting over deer packs. so much fun...

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-17,"as a player just getting into this game, this was the best comprehensive guide i found so far. most people get super technical about things but never explain them. it makes it even more hard to understand. i love that you explained the landmarks a bit, no one ever does this. also, nice quick video. very helpful."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-24,"excellent job,we need more guides like this !"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-28,"i've recently gotten into aoe4 and have been watching a ton of videos about the game. i have to say your channel has this breath of fresh air to it. the game is complex enough and majority of tutorials out there are so serious and stale, too competitive, min max centric approach at talking about the game. i've seen a couple of your videos now and i just have to say that this is exactly the type of contentvibe this gamecommunity needs."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-25,"unpopular build for english mirror that has been working really well for me lately because everyone does the longbow rush, i go for the king and mass horsemen. eat longbows alive, profit. works more often than not these days!"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-10-01,um this video was amazing
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-31,nice guide!!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-23,im a new comer from xbox
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-04,"anyone playing english and not learning to use the abbey of kings and wynguard palace is missing out. the king heals itself and all nearby units  the abbey itself does as well. it's great for early raiding because it's fast, nothing is going to take it out one on one, and you just run away from spears. being able to heal units is worth countless resources. you can literally heal and entire 100 person army while out of combat which can be worth 1000s of resources. longbows can serve a purpose but they are brutally slow  any decent player is going to scout your council hall and immediately cue up horses which will easily slaughter the longbows. wynguard produces fully upgraded units. the ranger 12 base damage and 24 against light infantry along with 9 tile range. the footman comes with 280hp, 20 base melee attack, 5 against cav and 5 base ranged armor."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-05,"long bows, spears, men at arms got it"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-16,im on controller and i am trying this step 1 sheep. max villager spawn step 2. i place farm one slot off so i try to cancel farm step 3 i accidentally kill villager step 4  i restart

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-26,reaching this meme density in an english vid without a single straelbora is... impressive
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-26,do one for byz and keep it under 6 minutes more challenging than winning a game with them im sure
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-10-06,marcus walks
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-08,"honestly, i love the wynguard palace. it just makes better versions of longbowmen and manatarms, and allows you to swarm with horsemen if you need more fodder."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-30,new to aoe that was great
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-24,the abbey of kings can be good if you decide to play with horseman if nobody scouts the stable and expects longbows anyway. that said if you have french in your team this might backfire. also its not berkshire its the backingham palace with the queen and her minigun sitting inside it and applying british rule. i wouldnt write off english knights. sure they arent anything special but having something that can cross the map a little bit faster with a little bit more punch isnt so wrong in certain cases.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-09,like for braveheart and the king.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-14,definitely going to need how to's on the rest of them lol

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-02,"happy new year folks! a few months in the making, i was finally able to finish this video and share these tips with you folks  be sure to share it with your friends! thank you for the support in the past two years, and more awesome content coming in 2023. take care and stay healthy everyone! cheers. 3"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-26,"i know that you are currently taking a break from making content for aoe4, but i just wanted to let you know that this videos, and many other ones about this game, have been so much more helpful than any video from other content creators. thank you for all you did!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-19,"extra tip establish a proper frontline. one mistake that i've seen even pro player make every now and then, at least in ffa games, is having their entire army production behind their main base walls, but the army itself, is currently fighting an opponent across the map. your reinforcements will spend ages to get to the front, and being worth the resources you spent on them. by the time they do get there, it may be too late for them to make a difference anyway. get some villagers to the front, and build a military camp! not, like. a singular barracks, archery range and a stable. nah, get as many as you can, while still being able to actually use them once they're built."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-29,i only just figured out your tip about remembering to have fun in the game rather than just coupling my worth as a player to wins v losses. that is by far the most important tip in the list.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-03,"this is actually a decent intro to aoe4, gives me an idea of what game mechanics are important in it relative to aoe2. solid video! was checking your channel since i still await the day you find the free time and desire to host aoncup4 and was watching old vods for nostalgia"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-03,"shift  number adds selected units to the control grouping rather than deleting the previous grouping and creating a new one, great for adding reinforcements at the base to your micro manage groups"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-02,"that is a great video and with great tips. i had no idea of the controlclick thing. i always double click and i hate how sometimes i miss the second clicks cuz of the hit boxes. one tip i would like to add also is to have one or more practice partners that have a similar skill level, it helps loads. specially if your practice partner plays the civ you struggle against."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-08,the tip about high apm being superficial was spot on. i used to play against high diamond ranked protoss players in sc2 who barely scratched 100apm while i was reaching 200 and they were absolutely crushing me.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-05,you say speed doesn't matter but the intermediate ai say different
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-15,"before beginning this video, i thought that practice and difficulty would be highly correlated.... but do not idle your town center was actually a perfect example of an low difficulty, high practice in my opinion skill!! you're the best, noob, thanks for the vids."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-25,"tip 51. you can select a unit and una shifta pre existing control group number and this unit will be inserted in the existing control group, works also for inserting a group into a existing group"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-04,"i have played the game since launch and sat through 19 min to find what i needed, thanks for the tip"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-03,one of the best guides i saw on youtube for games in general... great work!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-31,i always wish this game went farther in the future i wish there was a rts like it with this quality.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-07,"one thing about speed is fumbling with the controls or being distracted which is something that takes practice to overcome. as for the minimap, it would be nice if we could make it a bit bigger"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-12,thanks for the tip. the tip 11 as very helpful because i only garrison units by using the tc bell! using the hotkey t on villagers make sure my economy dont get all freeze when i under attack! thanks a lot
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-03,i didnt know the difference between attack command and manually clicking to attack. thank you! nice video again
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-02,idle tcs always get me. its hard to remember that it doesnt matter how much damage you do to someones economy if yours isnt growing either.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-07,"thanks for the insight. ballistas work great against cannons but i also use light horsemen , they can travel quickly and finishes them off. also i use them to lure enemies into a good spot for archers haha or mass catapults"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-03,thank you for the video! just got the game and am hopping straight into ranks.. i need to utilize a lot of these pointers! thank you again !
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-03,"i would include that shiftbuilding 8 farms around farms or tcs makes a lot of idle time of all those villagers, you have to manually click each of them on separate farm to make them build it all faster might save about 10 seconds of idle time"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-02,"your channel is so high quality, definitely underrated. hope you grow a lot with time."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-15,hoarding resources is my worst habit in this game. im sitting on 1k resources as a fallback in case i need to go defensive.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-14,i shed a tear
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-30,"for those who are coming from aoe2, aom, aoe3 starting with the french or english is the best start. other civs like mongol, rus and especially byzantines are not good to start with."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-31,have just bought the game with expansion and started with the campaign. would you recommend playing through it first or just jumping in against ai and players?

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-13,"this may be a silly question, but what i'd like to know is is 14 cumulative, like does 4 have everything that 3 does? is there a difference in more than things like improved graphics? is 4 an upgrade for 3 or are they functionally separate games?"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,console please
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,female character moves and acting so similar to lena headley from game of thrones cersei
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-04,"now this game is what i imagine when i think age of empires. this has been the greatest game to watch so far, very exciting!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-13,youtube algorithm brought me here. i don't play aoe4 but can still appreciate the entertaining cast  the beautiful defensive layers of walls at choke points. this shit fulfills my lotr helms deep scene. i was rooting for the blue guy even though i don't know any of them.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-03,"kaup was absolutely masterful. when you were saying that kaup's roaming back and forth along the back lines was a wasted effort, i was looking at how viper was looking behind him, instead of forward at kaup. outstanding return on investment, 4 knights and a scout buying invaluable time to build up defenses and infrastructure."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-04,"i dig that enthusiasm of yours, really can see the difference, when you are excited about a match and when not so much."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-06-16,3630 shout out to that mad lad villager who starts an enclosurefarm next to a destroyed landmark and the front lines.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-04,yay! finally a lategame cast where the english can't possibly lose!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,the strategy was to bleed out viper's units  resources at an impenetrable chokepoint. viper was also unlucky to have his trade route crossing the battlefield. great game!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-16,narration. game. players. trebuchets. tactics. choke points. tension. this has it all. finally a worthy aoe game again.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-30,recently got the rts fever again and this is by far the most enjoyable cast i've found so far. that's an easy sub for me.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-24,"i never knew i needed this in my life, but i love it!!! i'm trash at aoe, have been ever since 2001, but damn i love watching people that know what they are doing"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-27,those walls from kaup and the small harassing raids from kaup from the beginning were key to his victory.. very cool tactics both thematically and strategically.. a hard fought battle from both sides.. a job well done too from the commentary as well.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-07,"this is why i've always loved ae4, always an ebb and flow to the match, back and forth win losswinloss moving the line forward and back, rts's like starcraft seem to always end in a surrender after a battle with no chance to come back, just a big clash and that's that."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,"not gonna lie, that was a sick game. great job kaup."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,absolute beast of a game to watch. probably one of my favourite aoe4 games to date.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-01,saw this live 2 years ago but it still holds up as one of the best aoe4 games ever played!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-04,"thank you for releasing this drongo, hope you have a blast in berlin !"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-21,"his commentary makes me feel like i'm watching some kind of sport, it's fantastic"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-04,watching someone actually beat viper is incredibly satisfying.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-08-05,nice narration mate u just earned a new subscriber. i love every aspect of the commentary it's just amazing. the players are amazing too. i'm planning to invest my time in aoe 3 so i hope i could really play like them.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-02-24,"damn this game was fun to watch no matter which age fan you are. at one point in the game i was like, now this is what age of empires is all about!!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,"here is a tip for that trade situation wall the market in with a long line, forcing the traders to walk in from the far safe side. little longer route, but defo safe."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-15,"its what i love in ge of empire, building  city with a strong dfense. we see that too rarely i know it is not stronghold but i really like dfense"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,"i'd love to see unique upgrades for abbey of kings and  or maybe makes any future monastery to have the abbey of kings passive. would be interesting to have forward monasteries to do some skirmishes, have low hp units retreat, or do a full retreat to a more fortified position, heal up all units without needed a monk"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-04,"the landmark effect could either apply to keeps, or to network of castles. its not very versatile as is, made worse because its the first landmark you drop so you cant really set up for a forward drop where it could be useful."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-30,"wish this happened more in all rts games. people playing, with a commentator over the top. makes it all so much easier to follow and enjoy"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,"that's the sound of the army of the dead living on the mountains , send a knight and they'll fight for you"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-16,watched this game and wanted to play exactly like that. the other day i had a boom game with 200 villstraders and 0 military and 200 military when attacking  such a nice map to learn late game and use every unit available in the game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,"one of the funner games i've seen. excellent commentary as well, per usual."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-17,"i would like double or triple the radius, remove the out of combat modifier, but also reduce the heal rate a bit. so it doesn't massively impacts a battle, but overall it will help to keep villagers alive between raids."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-15,"thumbnail he made only bombards!' beastyqt makes springalds, mangonels, trebuchets and bombards"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-15,aoe2 days are over it has 5000 more average players
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-04,"english trebs are one the strongest super late game units in choke point games. reason they out range everything, shatter projectiles make their aoe actually okay, and network of castles dramatically increases their attack speed. of course they need rangedmelee support. in the multiple max resource 4v4 games i've played, i found that opponents just can't deal with mass treb  castles even chinese bombardnestofbees death army gets completely destroyed by it. the downside is that it is just an insanely slow push and requires a massive amount of resourceswood. also villagers adding castlestowers"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-04,can we get a casted game with sfx turned off and he is doing all the sfx himself? it would be beautiful xd
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-22,congrats on your first video with 1m views!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-07,"tbh i think this game displays one of the key issues this game has. you destroy a big defensive landmark and your opponent just rebuilds it instantly, and you just end up in a stalemate game where you keep destroying the same building over and over again"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-07-23,"in armies of exigo, there is temple building empire faction. temple heals all nearby non mechanical units. players usually were building a wall using various buildings, and the temple was placed in the pass in the wall to heal units defending the pass."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-26,"2550 i know its really hard when you're in the moment, and the commentating was amazing. the likelihood this ever happens again is slim, but quicker than a chokepoint of death is a fatal funnel the term we use for door frames and whatnot, but same concept. just food for thought great work regardless."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-07,i rarely leave comments but dude you are incredibly entertaining to watch. good commentary w a mix of gameplaystrat analysis and casual talk. i don't even like aoe iv but watched this whole thing. keep it up man!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-11,this was the type of game i've always wanted to watch! ty for this one
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-04,"this is one of the best english mirror matches i've ever seen. great casting too, keep it up."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-07-29,ive watched a few of your videos since aoe4 launchesdbut your commentary here made me sub! d the trebuchet sounds effects killed me.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-09-04,aussie drongo you commentate as if it's a fucking football match between france vs brazil. i just love the way you make it so interesting man.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-04,what an action packed nonstop game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-18,2928 generals command and conquer has a feature that can follow nukes in the air its so cool
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-06-29,this was legit exciting lmao. great commentary!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,"that was brilliant, and brilliantly casted too."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-22,i'm just imagining both of these players smashing their keyboard nonstop for 20 minutes. lmfao
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-14,great commentary my dude! felt like i was watching a football game lol. great enthusiasm!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,love a good mountain pass meat grinder. english and hre have a lot of potential after the 1 hour mark to keep the steamroller going.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-04,this was brutal!!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-20,having those landmarks early to hold the pass was really good. viper couldn't bring his own closer to the pass anymore
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-04,i feel like building the berkshire around the corner of that mountain pass would protect it from the trebs? i wonder if the trebs can fire over the mountain? if they can't id build a double wall or a v at the mountain pass and build the berkshire and castles on either sides of the v to lower the effectiveness of the trebs and force them to move into the choke a bit more and away from their defensive structures to fling their projectiles ... kaup already committed to his straight defense path when he built his walls so he wouldn't have been able to do the same
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-27,well i'll be damned i though i never gonna see a treb def siege combo tho the keep and the walls played huge roles in the defense too . gg to both players !
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-25,in aoe2 we also have also a tech that defeated viper we called it 'fatslob'
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,the treb meta is welcome imo they have their own war with the other trebs and buildings while the main armies can clash free of being one shot by the dreaded mango
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,the total war series allows you to follow ranged shots with the camera too!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-10,"if you look at vipers main tc, to the right of the monument there's a cart with open sacks around it. the other tc has closed sacks. but if you look at kaup's tc's they both have closed sacks, but his second tc has a smaller cart along the left wall. so there are other, probably randomized, differences."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-03,i am so happy you treat this like watching a sports game p
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-08,sounds effects is dope! new lvl of commenting  love it!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-04,loving this.. if i didn't end up watching more adverts than gameplay. youtube doing a number on me. keep up the good content.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-24,you do a great job talking the game through. keep up the solid work!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-03,"bombards seem incredibly balans. they can demolish walls with a few salvos, walk into range of trebuchets and castles and then walk right out with barely 20 health lost while being focus fired upon. ezy."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-08,i always love trebuchet when i play aoe 2 doing a massive vandalism
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-04,the sound effects lol xd
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-23,holy shit feels like im watching a bloody movie mate
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-10-09,"i saw theviper in the title and was severely upset it wasn't our lord and saviour, the viper schnake, francis higgins"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-05-03,watching games with kaup is just something else for me
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-28,wow! just.... wow! this left me speechless!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,i was just having a conversation with a group about abby of kings and seeing it actually played really makes me want to run it more.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-21,gg on both sides! great commentary. thank you for the content! really enjoying it.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-21,dude that was one of the best casting of an aoe game ever. putting others to shame here. big sub!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,"the only game where i'd rather watch than play. bravo, great voice, great commentary."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-03,you can follow the projectiles in like every total war game. at least from rome ii. greetings
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-13,"amazing, was so fun watching, thanks for sharing"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-30,i just came across your channel and i love your videos keep up the good work
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-06-29,viper crushed aoe4 and now hes back to the real game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-12,the most aggressive g'day i've heard yet
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-23,great commentary and game play!! been a long time fan of age of empires collections
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-03,fantastic commentary. great match!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-06-18,i always wonder why the attacking armies can see the defending ones inside a wall. they've break down the wall before just directly shooting arrows at the armies inside.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-27,such a crazy and intense battle. insane !
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-15,this gave me the same feeling i get from a high level clash of clans player successfully defending their base. pure satisfaction.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-04,kaup fatslobing it up as we say in aoe2.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-08-18,"for a moment i thought i was at the races watching the horses run, cool aoe video !"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-04,"as a shooter and rpg fan i must say i always was interested in these kind of games. i played age of mythology but i mostly lost when playing against other players. so the thing that keeps me from buying this one is probably the fact that i might not get the hang of it lol i would not have a clue how to start or to plan strategy, so much to chose from and to do haha. thanks for sharing the video m8, greetings from the netherlands!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-30,"back in the day, i remember my team mates lost their battles and i ended up against 4 people and held my defences strong and they couldnt penetrate it! it was a hell of a defence! this game was a master piece and can still be relevant in recent times.."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-01,great game. those six trebs were delivering insane amount of dps nonstop which viper clearly realized but not sure why he didn't counter with springalds
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,viper got caught with his hands int he cookie jar and then just got snowballed
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-05,"i think for viper, positioning few mangonels behind berkshire palace would have done considerable damage to the frontline units. anyway this was a fun battle to watch."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-07,all total war games have a projectile tracking function. i think you press insert to activate it.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-03,total war medieval 2 was the game you could follow the projectile! so satisfying. i wish new total war brought back some of those old mechanics.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-07,"stopping at 4 mins to comment this here's the reason that i go wheelbarrow first improved wheelbarrow as mongols faster movementfaster resource gain, extra carry weight faster resource gain, you take a slight hit in the short term but long term those bonuses snowball with each villager carrying and getting resources faster"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-05-12,abbey of kings should apply to network of castles with an upgrade
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-23,gotta go with the flow. this was incedible. you did a great job sir!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-04,this was chaos! brilliant.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-06,"abbey of kings is op if you use it to it's fullest, bringing weakened vills and soldiers weary from the battle home to a kingly feast for rest and recouperation."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-20,this is so amazing even in 2023 still the best play
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-10-08,im here bc of a book im reading for school aoe is a vital part of it and this counts as research
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-20,wow i dont even play this game but the commentator and gameplay was amazing and very interesting to watch!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-06-11,alot of quality players matching viper the community is getting better
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-10-27,they literally took the best parts of all aoe games and put them into one ultimate game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,this is legit content. all the relevant broll could not have been easy to put together. and i couldnt agree more with the conclusion! especially the sound design
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,you are quickly becoming my favorite aoe4 content creator and have inspired me to finish my deep dive into the history or lack thereof in some cases behind all the civs technologies. i would definitely watch any future videos on historical related aspects of aoe4.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"great video, chilly. really hits on all the things i love about aoe4."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"i love the way the game becomes more and more enjoyable. aoe4 in 2023 is in great shape, i can't wait for the new dlc thanks for the video"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-21,"very high video quality and editing. perfect for retention yet still focusing on the topic of the video, massive respect to you sir."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-30,"thanks man, you sold me. i'll be picking it up for sure next time it goes on steam sale!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"thank you for mentioning sound design and attention to unit detail, i truly think this attention to detail probably was part of the cause of the less than ideal release, but after the jank was straightened out, the little flourishes really make it wonderful to play."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-21,"interesting take on the release. i was pretty excited as you were there at the beginning, but was absolutely thrilled since day 1 and have been playing it weekly since then. i hadn't even noticed that the game had been considered dead."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-05,ive only ever played aoe for the single player campaign since ror. wish aoe4 had more. which is why aom had one of the best campaigns in the series.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-09-17,"you convinced me to get it. amazing review honestly, your style is excellent  to the point, light humor, fast pace and lots of insightful and passionate content. great job dude."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-05,"great video, never played any aoe but i enjoy watching rank and competitive matches, the only rts i played way back was stronghold."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,great video chilly! you are absolutely right. this game is alive and kicking. can't wait for the dlc. keep up the great content.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-17,"i really dislike the cartoony criticism, since it seems to come from a view that video games can't be colorful. it's the sort of criticism that thinks gears of war is the ultimate in aesthetic design, with grey and brown everywhere. it confuses what the speaker thinks is realistic for quality. if a medieval strategy game were realistic your soldiers would take days at the least to train knights would take years, and battles would be over in a few hours. sieges would be 90 sitting around and waiting, and most soldiers would die of natural diseases. the cartoony criticism always seems to come from self important over serious people who don't understand or care for good aesthetic design, and think everything they do has to be utterly po faced. nevermind a grey and brown color palette would render the units and buildings nigh on impossible to see. that and i'm sick of the stupid bigger number always good, idea that fewer civs are automatically worse when they showed one of the most radical departures from aoe formula, with the mongols, in that first reveal. it sounds like the sort of myopic bean counter bull that can't think past pure mathematics."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"this is great, i only wish more people that dont play aoe4 would see this. i think it's a great pragmatic take on the game"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-17,"gave a sub and like! unfortunately not an aoe4 player but i see it around because i do like rts, however, video is amazing quality so you deserve it man! enjoyed the editing and video itself, hell i might even get the game when i get the money."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,aoe4 has quickly become my favorite of the series. one thing you forgot to mention is the fantastic campaigns. i genuinely learned about history and felt like i was partaking in it. excellent production that feels ripped straight from a docuseries.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-13,fantastic video! as someone who has really gotten into aoe 4 the past month this was a great overview. subscribed!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"i've actually been won over by this. ive been kinda curious about aoe4 for a while and it getting a significant influx of civs it making me want to give it a shot. it also helps that after a thousand hours in aoe2 i'm a bit burned out on it. still, this is the video to actually tip the scales."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-05,my favorite nitpick is that if an unit is attacked from far away it actually sounds like someone shouting from you from afar so you immediatly know just from hearing ok that must be my scout for example
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-14,"i just started playing it recently, and it's become my favorite game"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-06,mates. this is some damn good videos on the game. we all glad to have more people joining the community!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"i started playing aoe4 and 2 a few days ago cuz of your videos, i'm a big history fan and rts fan but the fact that every faction had the same units turned me away, since i'v been playing recently iv realized that thats no so important. good thing i found you and age of noob and spirit of the law"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,nice work!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-21,"aoe 4 is amazing now, so so fun and polished. great detail!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,i was hooked right from the launch. it was not perfect but i know its the future of the franchise. still playing it now.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-19,"decided to buy aoe4 as a brand new player cause of this video, thanks for your input"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"for nonrts folks especially, aoe4 takes a bit of time to learn to a comfortable level. but once you do its just so rewarding!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-05,thanks for the video. tip calvary  the hill christ was crucified on cavalry  what you are probably looking to say.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-17,"i just came back to it, im still learning how to play but im currently gold 1 almost gold 2. the game is, at least to me, absurdly fun and i would recommend anyone to give it a try. civs are fun to play, pretty unique, and theres more new stuff to come."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-23,"i appreciate your love of sounds. to me, i'd like more focus on the gameplay, game balance, replayability, campaign, coop, skirmish battles, etc. than have 50 of the video on sounds"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-31,"spoton. i love aoe2, but the difference is aoe2de lots of unique stuff per civ, that is not always historically resonant, can be hard to remember, and has a deceptively small impact on gameplay. aoe4 a handful of unique stuff per civ, that is historically resonant, is easy to remember, and has a deceptively large impact on gameplay. the other thing i'd add is that the lightheavy armor distinction opens up more opportunities for counterplay. i think you just end up seeing more interesting armies fielded in aoe4 because of this and other factors. it's not always just, which three units make sense for this matchup?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"love the setting of the video, i think i will give this game a try once more"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-08-02,"aoe4 development is informed by decades of data on what makes a good game. it's conceptually masterful, the way they have incorporated the playstyles with the realworld civs"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-08,"like a lot your video. decent, inspiring, almost made me bought the game. i'm not an aoe player, but all my friends were. for sake of good memories i would buy it."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-13,as germanrus i enjoy the voice lines alot. the war cry everything. they really shout for their life. as a huge fan of japaneese culture im very hiped for new cheap season. got my ps5 with 80  games dusting bec i pump all my free time in age. ilalu my friends im gone for ranked now
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"excellent quality, keep up mate"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-06,"great content as always. i heard very good review of ottoman phrases from the turkish history students. they compared it with aoe3 phrases and aoe4 sounds much more authentic, not like the modern istanbul accent. student of iranian history said that delhi sultanate's farsi is also sounds great and authentic. the only small problem, according ot him, was that this dialect of farsi is more western as it was spoken in iran, while in india they spoke what's called dari as in the modern aghanistan."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-14,great vid mate. i'm having quite a similar experience with it.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-11,"great vid, for me it was the differences between civs, you could think they are similar like aoe2 or aoe3 but after playing the gamethey feel almost like aom different"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"that is clearly annoying for me because you litterally did the exact video i wanted to make ! i think exactly the same about sound design, gameplay mechanics and historical accuracy compared to previous titles. excellent job ! i hope you'll get more visibility"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,best game series ever
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"old yet lesser known rtses like medieval lords, caesar series, empire earth, all have those territory influences. actually, i can not get more shocked on how much aoeiv draw ideas from empire earth series. this mechanics where you can actually use walls and position soldiers over it is straight from empire earth iii  a game which was quite bad executed but is still extremely original and interesting."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,fantastic video
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-25,sick content man! excellent analysis !
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,thank you for making a compact video that i can link to as i proselytise to my history nerd friends. it's sad to see that the game is still put down for just not being another aoe2 and not recognised for actually having more national identity in each faction than most factions in its predecessors.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-06,"great video, subbed. i actually really enjoyed this game launch just because of the sound and visual design. the fact the english speak anglosaxon and then progress to middle english showed, to me, that a great deal of care had gone into the game, even if it was a bit unfinished. my interest waned a bit but the new civs and now new expansion coming out have got me playing again and i've convinced my friends to play as well! also i though the campaigns were pretty great. keep up the good content!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"what a well done video, thank you for your work put into it i'd like to add a 6th point to your list which made me give it a shot xbox brilliant compatibility i barely went through the tutorial and i got hooked, such a cool experience to play an rts on console, i'm glad someone actually thought of us console players as well also, how are you on such low subs? your videos are great"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-08,imo aoe4 is probaly the best new rts to play. they are charging you less for dlc them a cod skin
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-05,great video! love your content so much!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"loved the video, subscribed."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,i'd love to see more vids from you!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-10-24,great content! the amount of research and work you put into this is amazing. you deserve a like and a sub
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-25,"this video just made me download the game, thank you."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-21,"a very informative and entertaining video, well done sir."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-03,this video makes me want to play aoe4. thanks for the video
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-09,excellent video mate
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-04,344 you had me rolling with this one
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-09-03,"honestly i never had the negative experience you did at launch. maybe that's because i was more of a teamgamewithyourfriends player, but my memories are of incredible scale, beautiful attention to detail and immensely satisfying combat, in which the citybuilding aspect is as enjoyable as the strategy. the 8 civs immediately felt unique and asymmetrical in a way aoe2's never did. sure they've polished it up a bit since launch, but the core identity hasn't changed and has always been good imho."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-22,this is the kind of aoe content im looking for. easy sub 1
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-14,i'm glad i found you. i watched spirit of the law and he doesn't seem to cover aoe4 at all.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-25,"bro great video, you just get me."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-19,"i love the languages in the game in that they sound realistically different. also, civilization's units do look different and unique unlike in aoe ii where most units look the same though aoe iii looked great unit wise as well."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-07,"i didn't play the game day 1, but probably when the first couple of months. personally i loved the game back then. i was addicted, playing every day with my main the delhi sultanate. i stopped after one of the first patches where they completely nerfed one of the at the time main playstyles of delhi, which was based on going after monuments early on to put pressure on your opponents. as someone who is new to rts, nerfing the strategy i had committed so much time to as a new player hurt a lot, and on top of that the strategy was really the only way i liked to play at the time not hard to imagine with so few civs. nerfing delhi basically eliminated that playstyle or at least i was too weak of a player to make it work with any other civ so that was when i quit."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-09,ahh that's why i enjoyed it so much the second time around. i bought it on launch and did not enjoy it at all and stopped playing for a year or 2 but gave it another go a couple of months ago and loved it.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-03,"i can't believe axes, poleaxes on horseback, is even a debate. i think ppl underestimate how much warriors trained. i'm sure if you trained night and day, most of you could also weild a twohander on horseback. in fact, if you got strong enough, you'd find you could eventually swing that axe with one hand, just like my skinny a swings a sledgehammer everyday onehanded. once those tendons and ligaments get strong in the shoulders, it's just a matter of technique to keep the weight moving. same with flambergs and zweihanders, which i recently proved i can swing onehanded with my newfound strength. i'm 5' 8 and 135 lbs. imagine what a bigger frame could do. i think the hardest would be to combat in such heavy armor, and learning to trade blows with all that extra weight weight behind enemy blows."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-11,aoe4 is a superb game. i did play it for a year and a half like crazy. now im off to other things. will pick it up again once the expansion is released.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"i have always been wanting to get into age of empires, and i had played 2 a decent amount, but i only ever started playing a lot of age and entering the ranked ladder in 4. for me, the absolute diversity of the civs is really interesting because it means that i have to adjust my approach based on my opponent and what they are trying to do. i also think it helps players with a lot of different approaches get into the game. i personally like a lot of aggression, so i play english for their longbow rush, but other players who prefer booming will get more out of the abbasids. it can accommodate so many different approaches, even within a single civ. it really is a shame that this game is a slept on as it is because i think it is exemplary, and it honestly might make it a bit hard to go back to something like 2. i really hope the new dlc brings in a lot of new players, even if i think naming a civ after a whole person gets a bit too great manwoman of history for my own tastes."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,you are right. i liked aoe4 throughout when it came out when half their fans base was shitting on them. why? largely because of production value and historical authenticity. but with the variant civilisation they have crossed a lineno consistency and poor design and zero allegiance to historical authenticity
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-11,"i need to psyche myself up to play this game again. i liked war elephants, tower elephants, scholars and men at arms.. i want to try that again"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-02,elite vid! good job!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-02-26,great video. thanks a bunch 3
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-20,"i think the game was much better at launch than is implied here, but i liked hearing the things that won you over. the sound design is amazing"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-28,it won me over with the less aggressive micro and more counter play opportunity against enemies making the game a lot more balanced. and even though there wasn't many unique units but the civs itself is so unique. in 2 you had 1 or 2 troop and a few stat change congrulation because everything else is completely same. here i freaking jumped in my chair happily seeing that the same troops looks completely different depending on your civ.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-12,"i hope they keep updating aoe4, the longer this game exists and the more updates it gets the better it gets. i hope they show the same love to this game as they do with aoe2"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,please do the vid on the idiosyncrasies in aoe4
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-20,"hre age 2 musical theme has to be my favourite. great game, great content. anyone on the fence, get game pass and jump in, online is fun and not too serious outside of ranked!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-01,this video made me install ao4! good job!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-26,"i'm in the same boat, bought on release and put in 1215 hours at best then uninstalled. i didn't refund it for whatever reason. i installed it a week ago and it's all i've been playing. i went against my no prepurchase policy and scooped the expansion to show the devs some love, they've done a great job."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-21,great video!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-23,"436 well that was cringe... not only did the rus did not 'become russia' by any historically accurate definition, there is still a horrific war raging where the goal of the aggressor is to reoccupy the former borders of the soviet union. arguably not the time to meme on shit like this. to some people its not history, but the future they hope for."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-27,nice vid mate
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-05,"i must say all of these very valid points are not enough for me to give it a chance, im glad there is a blooming fanbase for the game but i'll stick to aoe2de for now. would be great to see aomde someday in the future."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-06,im a campaign player and played some on launch. i felt like the maps were always so small and cramped. maybe this has changed now but i felt like i was in the ufc octagon rather than a world to explore and conquer.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-07,"ok, you won me over. great content"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-08-18,"i swear, they couldn't have nailed it harder with the sound design. you ever want to get the most hyped you have ever been in your life? produce 30 chinese horsemen in castle or imperial, and attackmove around the map. the screams of that voice actor couldn't be any more appropriate with the stomping of the horses. sometimes i literally spam those audio commands as the game loads before i play ranked just to activate that bloodlust sense in me. call out to my girls the onnabugeishas for an extremely close second best option. those girls scream like amazons about to rip and tear the flesh of your enemies!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-22,"nice video, i also addict in aoe4"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-01,"i still massively prefer aoe2, both in terms of visuals and gameplay. also, the battles in aoe4 are way too small scale, i even remember some units costing more than 1 population and the max pop being a lot lower than the 500 we got in aoe2. still happy to see that this wasn't a failure."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,",  ! great video as always, your videos have inspired me to the point to rebrand my channel to have aoe4 content into the addition of other games i play, i used to play aoe2 back in the day and now till aoe4 had the stress test september 2021, i played it, forgot about the game for a year exactly on the start of september then came back before the announcement of ottomans and malians. keep up the great work, you are up to par with age of noob for the aoe4 creators that i am always hyped for a new upload."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-20,"the biggest issue with aoe4 is the early access sold as a finished game. because devs really bring the game to another level, and i wasnt optimistic at the start."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-09,"except besides the bug fixes a lot of these features sound design, civ diversity, etc. were in the game at launch."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-16,fair and honest review.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-11,"as an old fan of aoc, base on your opinions aoe4 is wellmade, this series age like fine wine, hope we get more civils."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-01,yaarrooooo!! redenddeeeee
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-23,i havent played age of empires in a long time. the last time i played was back in 2001 when i was still in elementary school. now im interested in playing it again. should i go for aoe 4 or 2? why do many people dislike aoe 4? i think it looks pretty good. do people prefer aoe 2 because its genuinely good or just because they enjoy the nostalgia?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,couldn't agree more esp. on points 2 and 3. but this is also what worries me about the upcoming variant civs..
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-01,emergent gameplay is the key to a good and popular game  chess is a great example.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-02,all i want is multiplayer coop in rts. sc2 showed its possible. battleforge was such a blast still is
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,great summary
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-04,"tha ability to play the army of saint john darkness and the boomstick. legit though, this game is fun and i can't wait for the remaster of age of mythology"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-24,"btw, i know a bunch of people only click on sc2 videos, but wanna say i love when you make videos on other rts games so just showing support for these kind of videos"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-19,"i don't play rts games, but i love watching your sc2 videos. this was a really fun video and i'd love to see more aoe4 as well!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,quite enjoyable to see you play aoe 4  wouldn't mind more of that
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,"love u playing aoe4. its my favorite game right now and also i play mongols a lot. btw the mongol towers have the same speed buff aura like the deer stones, but the deer stones grant u a improved version directly what would normaly accessabel at castle age tier 3. the normal aura only speed buffs caverlarie and traders. the improved version everything. thats why u should add some towers to ur tradeline to have even more ressources. also there is a trade buff if u have more traders. if u have 10 u get also 10 in wood and at 15 its also 10 in food so if 1 traders brings 50 gold it will also bring 5 food and 5 wood. i really hope to see more"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,"i love your starcraft content, but it's also really cool to see you transfer those skills to another rts"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-22,"i played sc2 for years, but aoe4 has surpassed it as my favorite rts of all time. i appreciate the slightly slower pace of play, and how the meta is constantly evolving with new patches. there are also a really nice variety of strategies, which vary by civ."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-30,"ngl, i enjoyed this a lot more than i expected. i was out of all of your sc videos and decided to give this one a shot havent been a fan of the other rts games you have tried out but this was very fun to watch. i would def enjoy some more of these and see you get betterplay the diff races over time! but my heart still belongs to your sc2 2v2 and 4v4 games  thanks for all the content, i watch them every day when i workout. the positive vibes and your energy do a lot for my daily quality of life 3"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-24,"i love aoe 4. coming from sc2, feels like a chilly new home."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,joan of arc steps onto the battlefield in her phase 1 villager form ahh what is that thing?!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-31,what a treat!! i love aoe4 and uthermal so this is a great colab for me!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,"arbaltrier in french means man with a crossbow dear mark, so it was crossbow in the end"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-27,"i love that you are looking into aoe4. more of that  men at arms are heavy, so are countered by crossbows. however, they destroy spearmen, horsemen and archers."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-20,"would love to see more aoe4, especially if you can find silly aggressive strategies that actually work in this game"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,"love all your content uthermal! i found myself getting too stressed out playing mobas, so your calm and fun demeanor has actually helped me get back to sc2! slowly improving my gameplay and trying to spread positivity when playing by complimenting good plays. keep on rocking!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-19,"really love you playing aoe4, hope to see more."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,"i love the alternative game videos. i know you said they dont do as well for views before, but i appreciate your fun first approach to content creation."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-01,despite it not getting a lot of views i hope this video gets part 2.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,"oh you got me excited, glad to see you playing some aoe4 again!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-19,i was literally just looking up aoe 2025 and boom thermy got me covered
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,"ahh, do more, for sure! aoe 4 has a different pace but it is a very good game. love seeing you trying it out. i want see you play against conquerors"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-02,aoe4 is my ladder game. i love it i returned it on steam when it first came out.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-25,"would also like to see more aoe4, love watching your sc videos, but personally, i am moving over to aoe4"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-19,"hey marc!  it was quite entertaining  fun to watch i must admit, especially round 2. if you enjoying it, then keep it up, always interesting to see, what sc2 tactics can do in this kind of game as well!  thank you so much, may your day light up with a smile. br an."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-20,i hope you do a lot more of this uthermal. i bet team games would be fun too. probably this is the best rts for team games. random 4v4 gets wild sometimes. love ya brother.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-21,"would love to see more aoe4 content, i heard there is a new expansion coming out soon for it aswell!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,"the villager with the crown is joan of arc. she was a huge french hero during the 100 years war. it's the french 'hero unit', similar to your khan."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-14,"i really like your video, your point of view as a ''new'' player on this game and as a rts pro player is quite unique. i would really interested to have these kind of video where you play 23 games a week and see how far can you go without practicing. but...i know you are a sc2 player. thanks for the video !"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,"man, i stumbled across a sortof stream and found your channel. your commentary is excelent! amazing video btw gonna check more even tho i don't play sc2 i would like to try it out as well"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,i enjoy this game. every 6 months or so i reinstall it to play a few campaign games. it's pretty chill. i'm glad it's on game pass.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-27,very good i guess! d
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,i'm really surprised he never heard of jeanne d'arc. she's maybe not the most well known french historical figure that woud likely be napoleon but still undoubtly top tier. it's kinda like saying you never heard of albert einstein or christoph kolumbus.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-20,i am personally very excited for the chance to see more of your commentary and gameplay on aoe or any other new rts games.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-19,i'm ready for the 0 to master or we the equivalent is aoe4 run
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-23,the markets effectively act as additional tcs command centers. so uthermal had 3x the eco production of the jean player. mongol trade is really powerful if not disrupted early. not that dissimilar from zerg droning off of a bunch of hatcheries. the sacred sites are a win condition and also give passive gold if you capture them. 75 per minute if i recall. jean is a hero unit and can capture sacred sites at age 3 like a monk.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-19,individual micro is very popular and important early to mid game.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,"3700 sacred sites.... if all are capture by a player, a timer begins which is a win condition, similar to if a player builds a wonder"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,loved it! hopefully you'll play it some more in the near future!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,thanks for creating such a fun part of the internet for us all. such energetic and fun content
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-09,we need more! aoe 4 doesnt get the love it deserves now!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-09,"at 2250 the thing to note is gather rate is better for deer than sheep. think of it as higher risk higher reward compared to sheep, then berries. some civs need more food to afford high food cost units like cavalry french knights in this case. some defensive civs may prefer to go on early deer and keep their sheep for when it's no longer to safe to stray away from town center. usually when fast castling since you won't be spending much on defenses and require more food faster and will have minimal wood for farms, so you save your sheep for the coming rainy day."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,nice to see you play aoe! im an sc2 watcher but an aoe4 player! so this was a nice surprise
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,another fantastic rts with a fun macro is is supreme commander. real love how you can zoom out the map to the absolute limits in that game. would highly recommend checking out and if you're interested in playing pvp then check out the forged alliance forever mod where the multiplayer scene is.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-20,"i think this is just the nostalgia talking but this is probably my second favorite rts of the channel next to, of course, sc2. loved this video and hope to see more aoe content!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,"love to see it!! just picked up the game myself after a hiatus! may we meet on the ladder!! aoe4 is also a great game for 2v2, 3v3 and such!!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-17,really enjoy your commentery and you really have great rts mechanics and micro skill. i know your content is mostly sc2 and i'm not sure when's the next aoe4 but i subscribe anyway. lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,"i played moscovia campaign when aoe4 came out and it was pretty fun, so i hope you'll play rus at some point"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,"enjoyed this, would love to see you play this from time to time"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,would love to see more of aoe4
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,"nice that you play aoe4 now or u give it a second try. personally i am not so competitive in aoe4 but i had many great moments with my best friend vs ai in this game d if i can ask do u ever will play sc2 arcade maps and upload it on youtube or will this never be a thing? i know what u play atleast on youtube but it would really funny to see some arcade maps played by u and maybe with the community or friends  i love sc2 arcade with friends, that's why wanted to ask"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,"jeanne d'arc is a patron saint of france, honored as a defender of the french nation for her role in the siege of orlans and her insistence on the coronation of charles vii of france during the hundred years' war. claiming to be acting under divine guidance, she became a military leader who transcended gender roles and gained recognition as a savior of france. wikipedia. i played fgo, one of my favorite heroes in the game."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,"looking forward for more aoe4 content, if it's in your calendar."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-22,"this was super fun, nice change of pace from sc"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-12,"2730 'is that a peasant??? who is that???' marc thats jeanne d'arc, or as we english know her, joan of arc. she is a famous historical woman who fought against the english in the 100 years war"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,attractive thumbnail. one of many reasons why i watch all your videos. good luck!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,so happy youre playing age again!!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,2. can you do the hold out challenges again? those videos were sooo entertaining and you don't even need to offer a prize. people will participate. it was awesome to see that part without any buffs or restrictions as to how long regular players could last
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-19,3 for the algo. making me considering installing aoe 4...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-23,the deer stones give a speed aura to all you watch towers so you can use them to speed up your traders and get more money if you make a bunch of them along the trade route
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,any chance for some more bar content?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-18,aoe 4 is my next love after sc2. it truly is a nice transition to modern mechanics of what an age game can be. i really love the uniqueness of all the civs and even the variants mostly play differently.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,whats that hunter with the crown  jean d'arc's enemies throughout history
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-20,they are billions would be nice to see sometimes  full playthrough plz d
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,"i like the sarcastic name. no one should take that name seriously. no idea how this game works, but i think uthermal explains it well enough as he goes."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-19,that sad feeling when no daily thermal upload
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,this is very enjoyable! variety is the spice of life
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,"just for information, in ao4 we gathering deer or boar faster than other sources of food. and realy fast with survival techniques upgrad. and if you already know, just i love your stuff"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-24,you haven't heard of jeanne d'arc? there's also this really short dude called napoleon that's gonna blow your mind.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-22,you gotta run a team game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-21,collab with beasty!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-13,age of empires 4 is so good. i buy it on steam rts sale
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,would love to see you do some free for all content with other aoe4 streamers like turin
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,hey marc i'm only about 10 minutes in the vid but if you're getting your first eco upgrade def grab wheelbarrow first but glad to see you play age 4! d
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-22,"the crowned unit is jeanne d'arc joan of arc  patron saint of the french xd think of it kind of like a hero unit from warcraft iii and yes, she is french."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,nice..good job uthermal
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-20,"if you want super economy and maybe worser units, malians could be a good choice."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,i think you did well with the upgrades. for civs i think in pro play they just get wheelbarrow and you seem to counter units well. free healing is always nice.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,play some aoe 2 please ! would love a hera or viper collab too
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,more of these videos please.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,crazy. i was just thinking that marc should do a video on aoe4
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,this game doesnt look too bad tbh. the graphics and the realism is very cool for getting immersed in it but i wish there was more depth to it. if they wanted to i think they could make this game great. needs many tweaks but is definitely possible if they wanted
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-26,"you are my favorite sc2 youtuber, but i genuinely tought i am going to watch video from my favorite aoe2 youtuber viper, you guys look like brothers."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-21,aoe4 is so much fun d years of playing sc2 have helped me learn lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,well played!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-22,finally aoe! thank you! waited for it for so long! i play aoe and bar more as starcraft feels way to microheavy and very punishing if you don't do it. these games allow more tactics which allows to compensate my poor micro.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-19,if youre going to play a new game please explain some more of the mechanics. ive never seen this game before but like watching you. explain at least whats going on maybe a few times as we have to learn it all
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,ohhhh yeah baby age of empires iv.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,being called a smurph while being brand new to a game is funny af d
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-20,"i don't play this game but i'm assuming that players outpost their gold for two rts reasons. the gold is a valuable and rare commodity, and it seems to be always out of range of town centre protection. love your videos, sir. salutes"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,i want to see thermy 1 on ladder.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,2056 noooo salt farming is my favorite part of the channel haha. honestly i personally hate smurfing. like dunking on newer players. it's why my favorite games are always against high grandmasters. but this time what can you do lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,i will use left part of thumbnail pic in private conversations for meme purposes. thank you. d
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-08,"in the first match your opponent probably expected you to do a tower rush bc mongols do tower rush 9 times out of 10. that's why he made 2 spearmen, to catch your tower builders."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-19,"this made me reinstall aoe 4 and i'm having fun, thanks thermy."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-19,ive been playing beyond all reason and its super fun
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,"hey , nice to see you in aoe4 , i recomend you take a look at pro scouts openings that are meta now , if not to do them , atleast to know how to counter them"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-25,"the real reason he started playing the mongols, is because he lives in maastkantje and he himself is a mongol."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-18,"gathering rate on deer is higher than sheeps, that is why people rush deer sometimes town center can target fire down units unit with the crown is a hero unit jean d'ark sacred wite gives 100 gold per min and is all sacred sites are captured for 10 minutes you win very impressive micro, normally a take defensive fight with worker in town center, but you were able to just out micro the opponent"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-23,"this was so refreshing and enjoyable, more aoe content please marc?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,"my man, idk if you have, but at some point would love to see you give ceaser 3 a try, one of the og rts games from way back."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-18,the keyboard sounds of these pros make me never want to play against anyone other than ai
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-04,bro be smashing that keyboard like crazy
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-08,can you mute the crazy key mashing lol. the gameplay and commentary is amazing but listening to you hit 12 buttons to move a scout is rough. haha
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-15,the only thing that prevented me from watching the video was the sound of the keyboard
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-09,dude is writing an essay
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-08,even crazier at the end learning that these aren't actually bronze players. too gud!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-08,checking in aoe4 world there was 3 silver 1 and 1 gold 2 so not bronze players. that's why this was so awesome ! nice job!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-22,it's the most chilled game a person can play and it sounds like his playing call of duty
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-27,"this is some incredible map control, leaving no room for enemy and no moment for respite."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-09,fun game. would be nice to see 4 abbasid players each take a different wing.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-10,this is so awesome!! so glad this content is here for aoe4
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-10,my only complaint watching this video is his insane clicking just to make the apm look better. you can play at a pro level with like 6080 apm
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-08,"this was a cool idea, i wanna see a 1v7"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-19,222 bottom left isn't this all the sheep of the map running behind that wealthy scout xd
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-15,love the content and the commentary throughout giving a better idea of what is happening and the thought process. this has improved my gameplay for sure. any way to dampen the sound of the keyboard and mouse? it is a lot of added distraction..
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-08-27,the clicking of the keyboard is hurting my brain.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-09-01,imagine being a 12th century peasant and having this dude as your boss. sheesh

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-08,"the keyboard is a killer for this. not sure it's all entirely necessary? i may be wrong, or is it too keep up the apm? seems crazy."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-08,"amazing gameplay  started watching you a month ago, and my gameplay has improved quite a bit!"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-24,this content is what we want.. hera figured it out
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-02,i managed to take on 2 bronze players as a gold3plat1 i dont remember exactly on pit in a team game once where my teammate crashed or left or whatever. he managed to slow down one side enough just a bit before he left that i was able to fight em. was still tough though. i can't imagine taking on four. elephants help though
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-24,in reality if all 4 players just send out all the villagers rally them towards him right away the game starts it should be over
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-24,"12345 clicks for the same time, for one simple order"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-23,i had a feeling green wasn't bronze considering he was reacting to your raiding. bronze players take two minutes to realize they lost all of their villagers
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,i would love to see an aoe game type that limits your clicks per minute
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-30,the obnoxious key tapping makes new players think this is harder than it really is
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-08,that was pretty fun to watch
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-17,beasty ur amazing but trying to watch one of ur utube videos is extremely hard with the keyboard bro
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-09,"why people click orders 20 times as if it would make the unit faster? i've never understood this. all my childhood friends did this. am i the only one who used to click only once to order units on this game? same with starcraft, cc, civ."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-18,"next time is pretty simple tho.... 4 doing feudal rush, game finished. no matter how pro you are, how fast your apm is, you cant do anything without army and eco. he is basically winning with insane effective apm, decision making and eco, and all these come after 10minutes."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-21,you must go through a pile of keyboards they way i hear tyhat clicking in the back haahhaa
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-11,so im playing on controller while pc players over here having a seizure and progressing 10x just due to the speed of controlling things
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-11,bro spends the early game clicking the same stuff over and over to pad his apm when he's actually doing nothing. lmao
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-08-07,thats pure art.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-08,i want to see 1v3 gold and 1v2 plat now! or maybe 1v3 plat and 1v2 diamond...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-23,you cant convince me all the clicking is doing anything lol  hes better then me hands down but the clicking for the apm has got to end lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-01,that clicking 10 times the same spot or selecting 3 times the same units is very unpleasant to watch
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-03,hear 1000 clicks for him to do nothing
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-10-02,and all is left in age of empires iv is this kind of player
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-05,it sounds like hes writing an essay
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-21,his apm is the biggest joke in aoe
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-14,don't take this the wrong waybut do you spam right click so much just to get the apm up?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-18,abronze mongol is hilarious. stays age 3 and just masses mangudai haha. all they had to do was mass spears and build trebs lol.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-06,i listened the keyboard keys sound you touched repeatedly

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-05,those are some crazy clicks lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-16,spamming the keyboard 'd
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-08-14,"i like what you do bro, you are awesome to listen to."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-08,more videos like this. nice
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-08,gamers! clapclap
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-26,this guy clicks.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-21,"havin 340apm, with litterally nothing to do. just spamming keys while waiting for the scout to move"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-28,they just had to make 4 towers at first minute around the base and use the resources around and gg
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-27,i've seen the ai do that... hahahahahahahahahaha nice game!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-08,"reading that chat gave me brain cancer. basically a bunch of people spamming the whole game they are not bronze, they are gold because, they dont seem like bronze ..... one would think after the first minutes that would stop but some of them are so out of this world that they think the chat needs to know again that they are probably not bronze. i mean the last time someone said that was 5 seconds ago so beasty might have forgotten it. just follow the chat guys it will make you mad as hell. '' funfact they are probably not bronze"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-12,man i am terrible at this game and i made it to gold. you have to be on console or using a trackpad to be on bronze. and i am like 5 minute villager idle time make spears against maa and archer cause i dont have gold but all this food in a 30 minute game bad.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-02,are the bronze players in a call coordinating or is it just randoms?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-25,i legit get nauseau when i see someone playing  like this must be sweating
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-11,those keyboard sounds almost made me mad
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-18,"we sometimes make 25, which is fun as well"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-08,beastyai is just too much!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-08,watching people with this high apm makes me feel so old. wtf.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-08,"can you make a video on the first 10 seconds of aoe4? it feels like for pros the moment they start the game, they produce villagers, move the scout, move the sheep and send villagers to two different tasks. i struggle with that and it takes me 10 seconds to get started. of course, this is partially practice, but i still think a video explaining the order and mechanics you use would be very valuable. especially because there's really no video like that."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-01,i tried watching but it just hurts my eyes how fast he moves the screen and smashes buttons. maybe i am old but i would never enjoy playing the game like this.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-18,"really nice content, drongo. i've been playing aoe4 for only 4 months, you and beasty have helped so much in the learning curve, it's a great thing! also, love to see some gameplay of your own from time to time."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-18,drongo china excells in the late game.. you don't want to push at 12 minutes also drongo casually shows a massive all in chop thru an entire forrest at 12 minutes with china
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-15,first video ive seen that makes sense as a brand new player. my friend talked me into playing and i instantly latched onto china. i tried basically every other civ and decided china is my favorite. ill be watching your strategies next
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-30,"this was really helpful, thanks! a quick summary of what are the styles and win conditions for each civ would be nice to know how to approach the tips provided here"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-29,"playing against ai can be really helpful. yes, you won't be dealing with as many strategies, but it def helps get you more comfortable trying things you wouldn't typically do."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-10,my problem is always trying to build a stable economy and defense first without trying to harass the enemy.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-06,"602 im trying my best to understand these concepts, i am learning, im happy, and then i hear that xd absolutely killed my plan of action lol"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-18,this game in the background was mad. gg wp drongo
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-19,"this video needs to be watched twice, once for the intense game, once for what youre saying  also just subscribed to your patreon cause i really enjoy your content!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-28,thank you very much.. i prefer this kind of guide rather than single full gameplay
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-06,just getting back into the game now and thank you so much for all the amazing advice!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-09-28,i just feel slow. about the time i start building a army im getting steam rolled by 100 enemies
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-03,french can do ultra heavy trade eco aswell. so i think it depends a lot on the maptype and the mapsize.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-18,good video for learning how to play. it's good sharable content. perhaps for these types of vids talk the game up a little so when i share it with my friends who are on the fence about the game will join
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-09,ive been playing aoe 4 with my buds for about half a year now. but every time we play against ither players. its complete slaughter. im lucky to last more than 20 minutes. i like these tips. im definitely putting in more time to skirmish with ai's to learn more about each civ. thanks for this channel man!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-11,"1. for mine civ that i like to play is the rus. i love using their warrior monks, cavalary archer and knight. also i like use their bonuses with hunting huts that makes sure i got nice food and gold income. 2. because i like to play as rus i know that mine enemy played as english i focused on knights so i could counter his archers but i must make sure they wont counter mine cavalary with those spikes 3. i know that i must build hunting hut next to big forest that for now i wont cut. the bigger the better and sometimes i dont even got gold mine but i already got enought gold to make next era building. usualy thats is kreml for early def and bonus into collecting wood. 4. here i take army of early cavalary knights that make sure i can make even in feudal age rush or with mine monks take sacred sides and block them with reinforced wood walls and their towers. 5. as rus you must know how to scout to make sure they find deer herds, sheeps, nice places for huts and on some closed maps where are the best chooke points to make some wood walls with some towers so mine def is easier. 6. i know how to use mine resurces. because you love chinese and talk with them i talk as rus. i make a lot of food and gold that i make from huts and upgrated villigers. i usualy make at least 4 stables to make sure mine line of knights is good. i also learned what kind of special building i should build next. if i see that enemy is more agresive then i build uniqie castle that alows me build stone walls so i have more defensive capabilities or build siege workshop so i can make unique techs and faster bombard cannons. no need for stronger monks? then i get the big hunter hut that also gives me deer from time to time to make sure i got extra gold and food. true that mastering the civ is hard but when you do it, you know exacly what you need to do."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-18,this was exactly what i was looking for. gracias friend.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-21,i have played so many competitive games yet can never convince myself to play ranked because i always feel like i have more to learn before playing ranked so i fully understand the sentiment of grinding out skirmishes to master something prior to enteringa ranked game.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-10,"drongo used to practice build orders against the hardest ai before going ranked ladder. nowadays, he practices in the ranked ladder before playing against the hardest ai!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-07,i didn't even know that the whistle means enemies spotted.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-18,"hey drongo, could you please release a water guide? as one who has never followed builds and made my own china build that caried me like 140 against gold and plat players i felt really solid. but i just got stomped. hard. by an hre player, and his tip at the end was never ignore water. i have aways hated water and avoided it, but after that break in my win streak, i feel compelled to learn water. and it is a lot harder for me to learn. ive been a land china main since start, being only civ with full mastery. ive considered myself a great player, almost always beating plat players unranked usually as china, but after being destroyed i really need to learn water. specifically the juggling of my land resources. how early do i invest into boats? how hard do i invest? how many boats do i want? how do i balance land military with navy?? i lost on mediterranean. overwhelmed by landschnencs and man at arms. i always have the best economy in my games, so i never feel so helpless like i did in that game. his economy was just way better than mine due to fishing. to the point i know i have to learn water to improve."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-02-21,"today i lost decisively as english v english ai . then i watched your video, followed your advice, played again and won against intermediate ai for my first time. i boomed faster than i have before and ended up going for a wonder victory behind layers of archer stuffed walls. maybe not the fastest way to win but i loved every moment."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-21,such a skilled caster! you'd be great in any game bro
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-27,i watched this once and immediately improved
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-29,347 hollywood producers be like
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-08,"i really like the english, and have liked them in every version of aoe. mainly because i love longbowmen. that said, i almost exclusively play against the ai with my wife, who also plays the english, so i'm not in the ranked scene. i like being relevant at all points in the match, but the french are a pain until crossbowmen. the only annoying thing about the ai is when you seemingly control the entire map and yet they still somehow always have a full army with the most expensive siege engines despite having no access to resources magically."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-07,"i'm a bit confused with you saying delhi is doomed toward end game, i've found that's just about it's best use. towards endgame you'll just have a massive army of elephants specialy if you took palace of sultan. everytime i late gamed the delhi they destroyed the others armt completely."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-18,drongo can you make a video about how to allocate villagers properly i always struggle with that
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-19,awesome content drongo! keep up the good work.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-18,"i feel bad for the guy in the background game, but expected the stone wall from you"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-20,"i just realized that as much as i like french for their cavalry, maybe its not best idea to play with them... i'm more boomer or turtle player then rusher. i harass other players to slow. probably should explore hre or something like that."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-19,those deers at the start are we in line formation yet?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-18,"woah, that game is in the background was quite mean to the other player."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-24,i had no idea that whistle sound meant an enemy was within sight of a scout. i thought it was just a generic background sound like the yelling villagers.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-18,my toxic trait is i only start getting eco upgrades when my keshiks and trebuchets are already on their way to attack d
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-22,"aussiedrongo thank you! one question why you do 10x mouse clicks when you move your scout? you need 1 click, why 9?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-10-23,"get a mouse with lots of progable buttons. i put all melee, all cav ect, each on their own button. i like to play skirmish and then save the game at about 7 minutes. then, i kept playing the same game over and over until i cut the win time way way down."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-16,"i love playing as chinese. their defence is pretty awesome and strong economy, but ill always remember playing 3v3 as new delhi. i amassed a ton of elephants and steamrolled all 3 enemies single handed with one major assault. they never saw it coming  knock knock, whos there? 100 war elephants."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-23,that killing of the deers so early that are near the tc in dark age makes me really uncomfortable.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-29,what is that gameplay in the background. while telling us chinese are the lategame boom faction who want to defend until they win having a video in the background where you have a feudal age base race.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-18,great video.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-24,alternative title how to optimize all the fun out of a game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-18,i enjoy just watching more
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-06,"is aoe4 harder than 2? i played 2 and it's looks a little bit complicated, especially on online. some dirty tactics with archers etc..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-12,i'm just now starting aoe4 after 2k hrs of aoe2. and so far i'm not a fan of being tied to one civ cause of my playstyle. good example for me is gear of war 5. the game forces you to play certain characters cause they are built for special reasons rather in older games you have 3 different ways to play all on one character. if you like to repair and build you now have to play as that chara ter who is only good at that and not much else. not a fan of that. aoe2 most civs give multiple options on just one civ. love that.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-02-03,now do a comparission between non dlc civilization and p2w civilization like japanese that is impossible to beat no matter what strategy i pick as chinese as they're just having too many buffs.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-04,what map is that
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-18,"drongo, im 1200 elo and plat for the last 2 seasons. i do not use military control groups and i know that it is a major flaw holding back my gameplay. assigning them is easy but i do not have the presence of mind to use them effectively, especially through the mid and late game. what drills can i do to improve on this?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-19,hey so i would like some training if you get your paytron up
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-01,this game is similar to aoe2
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-02,"im quite new an a low level, i play with high level people. my mate is high level and we when we play he literally ditches me to be on the winning side. even though me an him would do better on teams bs lol. need hwlpful allies"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-24,this games infuriates me.. i feel like i'm doing the right things then i get molly wopped.. idk what i'm doing wrong lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-18,"should i train against bots? although i train, i can't seem to perform better in pvp. i've been training with the ottomans, i like the civ, but it seems to fit my playstyle."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-18,i'm very confused for the chinese. you mention thriving in thr late game but doesn't your most recent build order circle around a feudal rush?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-13,if someone can send me a guide for a mongols would help out a lot
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-18,"so once i played 2v2 on this map and saw that my teammate was trash they had him real quick and i figured that i could not win so i ramped 2 villagers to make a escape route after i was in it a bit i hoped all my villagers in there to get enough space for my age up and built it in the forrest adventually they killed me but that was really fun to do lol. aussie i do have a question tho i listen to your advice and it really helps but i always come to this little problem that my economy is always better than the other things like my army , but i love to play ottomans does this makes sense? i also like the holy roman empire wich sooth players more that go for economy."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-30,i use 30 villagers and 170 troops. man at arms is usually the best to use. knights and horsemen die too fast as well as long ranged weapons.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,drongo your casting is gold. true top tier status.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,10931 the rams have turned!! my god i've never laughed that hard such a great game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,10938 looks like crackedy deleted half of his vills for an all in push
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,just the players chat at the end of the video would have been the icing on the cake
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-19,5400 what you mentioned is in the game the farimba garrison by the malians lets you train mercenaries for 100 goldcost.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,"the most beautiful game in the history of aoe4 and there is simply no argument about it. spectacular, memes and dreams with action and drongo's well thought out commentary. this could had been a movie."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-10,as a delhi main that was tough to watch at the end. i think if crackedy would have tried to secure the sacred sights instead of attacking traders he may have won. it wouldve been tough to defend but better than throwing units away against outposts.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,"this was amazing, it feels like conq 3 players using bronze 3 strategies... but they worked."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,it's been a treat watching this cast while doing some menial work. thanks for the video!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-06,"the battering rams strategy is called the salon de l'auto'  push in french. in other words, the car show"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,"4100 it's the siege workshops from the ram raids. if he's got them already yeah, he'll use them"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-10,this made me love mongol even more i started 2 weeks ago im a complete noob but i only play mongol so i will get on eventually . battles like this is what makes this game so gorgeous hope i get some friends in game to play with must be so fun
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-27,would have been fun to see the post game stats on this one.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,10900 crackedy going from 120vills to 80 to sub 40 in 30seconds and not instantly replacing them after his push died out seemed like the game ender
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,this is the game that caused crackedy to uninstall not joking. the reason he was doing nothing at the end is because he was typing a lot lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,drongo i rarely have time to watch your streams anymore as i'm slaving away paying for dishwash tablets as well. but what an hour well spent this was! i had fun! thank you!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,tfw when you think the game is over at 3800 only to mouse over the seekbar and see that it's only halfway in
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-13,"once the stalemate was hit, this game was always going to end when the wood ran out. crackedy was strangled to death by towers with emplacements."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-02,"so around 10 minutes the silver tree was blocked with walls and orange brings most of his army to take it back. this was the perfect time to attack oranges base. hit and run if need be. lure them into your fresh troops. if they go back to attack the walls, attack the base again."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,"omg what an amazing game, what an amazing casting! so much to learn from and to laugh at! best 1hour spent on a game stream ever... congratulations on the 100k btw drongo!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-13,"the rams reminded me of siege tanks with humans in warcraft3. really fun, but frustrating to play against."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-14,the silence when you were looking for the red bull was hilarious.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-17,been playing this game since 2005
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-12,"finally, a caster for this game that has energy and seems genuinely interested in the game. watched over a dozen noenergy having, speed though a game, casters before i found you."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-13,"anyone else feel like they just ran a marathon? amazing content kaup, crackedy, and drongo!!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,omg!! what a game!! i would have never thought of going wonder in this open map. kaup is a genius for thinking about it. i remember playing 1h40 min game and i knew my opponent will run out of wood but as mongols you get wood from trade
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-26,"this was incredible, my favorite is still the one beasty was hiding in the corner and busted out 22 rams to win the game, but great game guys, i learned soooo much from this, thx"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,"an absolutely awesome game, kept drinking from my empty cup, i was so transfixed. honestly crackedy could have done better with men at arms at 25 mins rather than horsemen spear push. and yes i really thought kaup was going to continue to push through with the proxy ram base, but he pulled it back. golden aoe4 award for sure"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,13 naked rams in the farms of ram ranch
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-22,awesome game. love the long games and this was the most entertaining of them
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,that ramranch reference had me laughing so hard
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,this reminds me of a typical low elo game just enhanced 1000 times because there is pros doing it. so enjoyable to watch! great game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,congrats for 100k aussie
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-15,"kaup saw crackedy memes and literally was like oh yea, watch these memes"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,i wanted to see the graphs at the end. total kills and gold collected for kaup it must have been like 300k
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-13,what an absolutely legendary game! can't believe i only just saw this!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,"i had my work in one monitor, but all my attention was in this game in the other monitor."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,kaup's gold per minute is killing me
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,what a game. i think the biggest mistake by cracked was not having defensive springalds to deal with rams. 5 springald shot kills a ram. and with the range he would easily be able to deal with the rams behind all the defense. but ofc this was a utter madness if a game!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-21,"daaaaamnnnn. what a game, what a cast man. top tier battle this is."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,congrats on 100k subs drongo!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-21,i am so excited for delhi imp rush ever since 4 months
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,"the score is 15 of the resources you spend, not the resources you're floating. but yeah, mongol score is still dented."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-13,i cant believe crackedy never traded himself or make mass rams or make mass towers cause compound gives him cheaper emplacements so besides the trading he could have outdone the mongols at their own game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,"you could return rams back to their release state and they would be more balanced than they are today. they are so cheap and take so little damage from anything, making them abusable to spam. these are not noobs, they are the top players who are spamming them in imperial. they have been changed so many times that it feels the devs don't know what they are doing."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-24,"when i clicked this, the liked button turned from 2k to 2.1k. such an honor."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-16,kaup not getting the last upgradesi was having anxiety he would loose because of this
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-14,food is fucking ridiculous though. it can easily cost 50 for ingredients for only 13 nights dinner depending on what you're buying.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-13,"that was great, ty drongo xd ultimately which one was the thumbnail??"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-23,i have never played an rts let alone know wtf is happening but i think imma buy this game now after an hour of watching hooked to my screen. reminds of the 2nd punic war.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,drongo youre such an amazing caster honestly. too good. also this game was insane!! what a game!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-02-20,"gg, nice video. question though, why didn't crackedy send scouts, villagers or even make outposts to see the rams coming?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-28,whenever drongo says deer stones i immediately imagine deer testicles and think to myself what a weird man
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,buying time as delhi is also good cause it lets your upgrades finish.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-15,"024 i like these casts alot, but... where is fck is drongo coming up with these fakenews numbers? crackedy is 34 kaup is 67.. i mean, ok you gotta substract the idiotic smurf accounts of beasty, demuslim etc., but anyway. according to drongo there are like 50 players in the top 20."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,"i see this. i say well, i know what i'm doing. grab a beer out of the fridge and sit down on the couch."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,any 1v1 that goes over an hour will be great to watch
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,i have to agree with the title of this game. brilliant.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-30,crackedy really just kept trying the same thing. i got the sense that he really didn't know what else to do
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-13,unit of the year elite battering rams
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-29,thats the craziest game that i have ever seen
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-14,as loving to play english this mongol rams make me fear. and the idea of what france does with it. first trade on wood.... ... but why crack dont spam springald? ... over all... this match needs an oscar! with the ending all in from crackedy fails.... really really nice.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-14,it is a very good match because there is a perfect display of skill mixed with some missplay wich make for a lot turnarround.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-07,insane casting. made me laugh so many times
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-13,"crackedy deserved to lose this. the amount of army he squandered fighting traders under outposts, instead of focusing the outposts and dropping keeps on the trade posts. there were multiple times he had the army advantage, and simply had to use those times to do something productive."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,thanks drongo this game is madness the best game ever and forever

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,trade and rams might be needing some nerfs
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,i'm exhausted just watching.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,crackedy spent way too much time chasing traders instead of delaying trade at the markets and finishing off the silver tree

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-28,i am running low on dishwasher tablets and it is stressing me tf out
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,this is why we don't go to late game unless we have to kids
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,spoilers crackedy deleted about 23rds of his villagers for the final push on the wonder. you can see him delete like 30 of them at 10910 and eventually he goes all the way down to 40 vills. after the push fails he's got nothing left in the tank. absolutely brutal game.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-09-06,"freyr probably hast he best starting power, unfortunate you have to pay more to access him"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-12,those towers seem to be a bit of a worry. too easy to spam them and it takes too long to knock them out.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-10-06,"3039 i can't control myself. yes, apparently so. in part it's somewhat funny to listen to you. the other part ist just very much over the top, borderline hysteria  sorry to say."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"maurice wrde ich auch 2 stunden dabei zuhren wie er ber strategiespiele spricht. einfach nur informativ, lustig und sau gut. so mssen tests sein! mit viel herz und maurice halt"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"danke maurice, das ist ein sehr starker test von dir. man merkt richtig wieviel arbeit du damit hattest."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,maurice ist einfach der beste deutsche redakteur in der gamingszene. ich ziehe meinen hut vor diesem unglaublich hochwertigen test. das gamestarmanagement kann froh ber so eine persnlichkeit sein! liebe gre und vielen dank!

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"ich finde, dass age 4 auch eine gute mischung aus age 2 und 3 hervorbringt. aus beiden teilen gibt es wichtige dinge, die bernommen wurden und einige neue innovative feauteres wurden dann auch hinzugefgt."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,um es passend zu formulieren das ich will
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"lieber maurice, das war das absolut geilste gamestarvideo, was ich jemals gesehen habe und es zeigt einfach, was du fr ein unglaublich toller gamer bist mit so viel liebe zum rtsaufbaumittelaltergenre. momente wie in 1241 sind einfach pures gold und machen so viel spa beim ansehen. vielen lieben dank fr dieses tolle meisterwerk. bist mein absoluter lieblingsgamingjournalist! ps ich wnsche dir und allen anderen ab dem 28. oktober ganz viel spa beim age 4 zocken! schnen tag noch!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,2001 fort! ihr edlen gesellen!  kills defenseless peasant
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"dieser test hatte so viel liebe, leidenschaft und knowhow  danke fr den beitrag"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"finde auch dass age 4 zu matt und blass aussieht. und das obwohl es wegen der spielerfarbe teilweise merkwrdig bunt wirkt. ja, bei den alten teilen gab es auch gebude in spielerfarben, aber dadurch dass bei age 4 alles andere so blass ist, tritt die spielerfarbe um so greller und unpassender hervor. die farben mssten insgesamt krftiger und wrmer sein, aber auch etwas natrlicher bzw. nher beieinander. das spiel sieht fr meinen geschmack atm fast schon kalt und ungemtlich aus. die getreidefelder mssten goldgelb in der warmen sonne wiegen. stattdessen sehe ich sterile, beinahe bleiche felder in graugrner umgebung, umrahmt von tyrkisgrnen bumen ohne witz, was sollen diese tyrkisen bume? schaut euch mal dagegen die farbatmosohre von anno 1800 an. so muss das aussehen. und ich meine damit nicht dass man jetzt einfach die farbsttigung wieder hochdreht oder vielleicht doch? k.a.. die mssten sich vllt. mal um vernnftige beleuchtung kmmern, die eine generelle warme atmosphre erzeugt. ich wei nicht ganz wie ich es beschreiben soll. aber wer schonmal ein vorhernachher video mit raytracing gesehen hat, wei vllt. was ich meine."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"ich finde den doku stil ganz cool. ich hab doch schon so oft irgendwelche mittelalter storys gesehen in filmen und spielen, das ist einfach nicht mehr so packend wie damals als 10 jhriger. finde das ist ein mutiger schritt von den machern und echt mal was neues. vielleicht lernt man sogar was"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"sehr sehr gelungener test! ich gehe komplett mit, auer in dem kritikpunkt zur story. ich finde dies einen gelungenen weg fr mich die schlachten sehr glaubwrdig zu gestalten. eine dokumentation nach zu spielen ist ein genialer gedanke meiner meinung nach."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"krass, der test ging ber eine halbe stunde und war zu keinem zeitpunkt langweilig! man merkte wirklich mit wieviel liebe und begeisterung hier herangegangen wurde. wobei ich finde das dieser doku ansatz die kampagne zu erzhlen interessant klingt. auf jeden fall groen respekt fr dieses tolle video! genau deswegen bin ich seit 1999 treuer leser der gamestar!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,2812 maurice gequltes ja danke. er spricht mir aus der seele haha
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"was mich am meisten strt ist die bewegungsanimation der einheiten. am besten lsst sich der vergleich an der kavallerie erkennen. wenn man die bewegungsablufe zum beispiel mit schlacht um mittelerde 2 vergleicht, dann liegen dazwischen welten.. trotz des alters von sum2 kavallerie prescht dort durch die reihen und berrennt leichte infanterie und sie reiten auch richtungswechsel mit einem realistischen radius, anstatt so abgehackt."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"ich feier maurice so hart, unfassbar. diese subtile comedy ist einfach nur ultra nice. ersten 30 sekunden und schon 3 mal geschmunzelt  love it."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,ich warte noch auf der herr der ringe schlacht um mittelerde 3 meine lieblingsreihe
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,du knntest dich mit videocontent oder podcasts locker selbstndig machen maurice. deine videos sind echt wahnsinnig gut.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"also ein spiel wie command  conquer undoder age of empires ohne basenbau ist fr mich ein absolutes no go. was ich bisher von aoe 4 geseehen habe ohnee es selbst getestet zu haben, hat mich schon begeistert. seit jahren freu ich mich mal wieder ein wenig auf ein neues spiel. dankee fr eure berichterstattung. daumen hoch!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"die rettung der echtzeitstrategie. strategiespiele sind in den steam chart regelmig in den toplisten der meist gespieltesten spiele. das problem sind nicht unbedingt die beliebtheit dieser spiele, sondern wenn du willst, dass es auch langfristig gespielt wird, brauchst du ein perfides balancing und  oder ein geilen coop  multiplayer modus. ber optik lsst sich bekanntlich streiten, das ist geschmackssache. kann aber die leute verstehen, wenn sie sagen, wir sind in 2021, crysis ist mehr als ein jahrzehnt hier und die spiele haben seitdem gefhlt grafisch eher rckschritte gemacht. aber wenn man starcraft 2 mit einbringt es hat eine geile kampagne, geile cutscenes und zum schluss gabs noch einen geilen coop modus. ich mag age. ich mag auch starcraft. jedes spiel verfolgt seinen eigenen ansatz aber man muss sich halt immer an sowas messen lassen. natrlich ist es was anderes, ob man frei seine eigene geschichten schreiben kann oder historisch gebunden ist"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,da merkt man wieviel liebe zum genre bei maurice da ist. ich wnsche ihm und uns dass der retter des genres noch erscheint!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,833 beste neuerung zu age 2 die felder lassen sich endlich gleichmig um das dorfzentrum herum platzieren d
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"die realfilmschlachtszene mit den aoeiisounds  den erzhlstil bei der kampagne finde ich katastrophal. der bruch zwischen spielgrafik und realfilmdokus ist einfach in jeder hinsicht viel zu gro. spielen werde ich ao4 trotzdem, aber eben erst, wenn es deutlich gnstiger ist. aber ich habe damals auch schon aoe2 gesuchtet und bin somit ein alter fan. wre das nicht so, wrde das spiel wahrscheinlich an mir vorbeigehen."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,an sich ein interessantes test video. finde es aber etwas komisch das du age of empires 3 irgendwie komplett ignorierst. gerade was ja die kampagne angeht war aoe 3 mit den zwischen sequenzen und charakteren echt gut gemacht. und hat auch sehr zur atmosphre beigetragen.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,"die reviews von maurice sind einfach immer allererste sahne. qualitt, unterhaltung und genau der richtige informationsgehalt mit den relevanten details fr passionierte gamer. so gehen reviews"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,32 minuten!!! maurice du ehrenmann xd
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-30,"das drfte wohl das beste testvideo seit langem sein! man merkt die liebe zum genre und die kritikpunkte sind alle auf den punkt genau getroffen. abschlieend kann man wohl nur sagen es kommt halt nicht von den alten ensemble studios  ob da nun ein paar kpfe von damals dabei sind oder nicht. es kann natrlich im laufe der nchsten monate  jahre durchaus noch zu genau dem spiel werden, was wir alle haben wollen. durch mods evtl. ganze kampagnen erstellt von usern mit hingabe inkl. geschichte oder selbstgedrehten historisch angehauchten videos? wer wei."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"ich bin jetzt kein groer rtsfan aoe hat mir dennoch immer spa gemacht und ich eigentlich auch immer nur gegen die ki gespielt habe, aber ich werde aoe4 vllt irgendwann im sale holen. mich strt eigentlich nicht viel an dem gezeigtem spielmaterial auer eins das ui ist ja mal zum brechen. also das war bei allen anderen teilen um meilen besser. ich finde es echt schade, dass hier auf eine mittelalteroptik verzichtet und nur schmucklose blaue oder braune ksten verwendet wurden. naja kommt vllt. irgendwann per patchmod genauso wie der wololo sound effekt  ."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"maurice wenn ihr das spiel in aktion erleben wollt heute um 19 uhr spiel ichs auf unserem twitchkanal monstersandexplosions im rnkespiel  schaltet gerne ein, ich freu mich auf euch!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"also ich muss zugeben, wenn meine 100 mann armee auf den unterlegenen gegner trifft, wrde ich schon gerne etwas blut sehen  aber das ist eine designentscheidung, vermutlich auch um eine bessere jugendschutzbewertug zu erhalten."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,also ich finde die kampagne klingt super interessant d
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"vielen dank maurice, ich liebe es einfach, wenn du strategiespiele testest. man merkt einfach, dass es aus dem herzen kommt."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"dass ich mal ein 32minutenreview vollstndig gucke... sehr sehr gut! und zum glck habe ich zwar keine soo emotionale bindung zu aoe 2, wohl aber zum genre. also bald ist ja weihnachten..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"wrde man aoe4 noch auf den series konsolen release , gbe es einen deutlich greren kundenkreis. man msste einfach nur maus und tastatur als mind. anforderung umsetzen. an der leistung drfte es garantiert nicht liegen."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,046 du warst der auserwhlte! i can't!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"maurice und age of empires scheinen eine eine hnlich leidenschaftliche beziehung zu haben, wie smeagol mit einem gewissen ring d"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"bei all den spielen die in den letzten jahren erschienen sind, hatte ich jedoch die ganze zeit trotzdem innerlich immer die hoffnung auf einen nachfolger dieser geilen reihe... jetzt ist es endlich soweit!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,was fr ein test. ich ziehe meinen hut und freue mich auf mein erstes age seit teil 1. danke maurice!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"1043 kann ich nur besttigen. hatte mit einem premate ein 2vs2 und als wir den ersten gegner berrannten, kam sein kollege und hat meinem freund ordentlich zugesetzt. also war die wahl meine truppen zum schutz schicken, oder doch lieber den feind angreifen. da mein kollege eh so gut wie hinber war haben wir uns geeinigt, dass ich mit meinen kleinem, brig gebliebenen herr seine landmarks angreifen sollte, was zu unserem sieg fhlt. lange rede, kurzer sinn ich hatte noch ein trebuchet und der gegner noch ein landmark mit max. 5 leben ber. wir haben mitgefiebert, dass das trebuchet noch einmal schiet bevor es zerstrt wird und dies tat es auch. das trebuchet fllt kurz nachdem es seinen stein abfeuert und sekunden spter kam die siegesmeldung."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"finde den test gut, aber ein punkt an aoe4 strt mich dann doch extrem. maurice sagt, es wird keine neuen spieler zum rts genre bringen, aber alte rts fans sicher begeistern. ich bin ein alter rts spieler und will es mir nicht mal holen, warum ich bin mit aoe1 und aoe2 aufgewachsen und habe rts lieben gelernt und habe hnlich wie maurice nur dadurch meine geschichtsklassen absolviert. mit stronghold, schlacht um mittelerde, battle realms oder cc generals hab ich dann aber bald gemerkt, dass es doch dynamischer, schner animiert  einfach flssiger wirken kann. mein rts geschmack hat sich einfach sehr gendert und ich war offen fr jegliche neue funktionen. mit reitern nicht immer stehen bleiben zu mssen und in trupps reinreiten und niedermhen? schlacht um mittelerde hat gezeigt, wie es sich richtig anfhlen muss. oder auch generals wenn man mit panzern ber infanterie fhrt. belagerungswaffen die sich wirklich wuchtig anfhlen und gegnermaen zurckschleudern? schn, fhlt sich super an. sum und generals. einheiten die auf pferde auf und absteigen knnen? battle realms. ausdauerbalken fr jede einheit, um mit doppelklick auch mal sprinten zu lassen? battle realms. helden und fhigkeiten auf einheiten? wc3 und battle realms gutes trefferfeedback ist meiner meinung nach das relevanteste im rts, egal ob es belagerungswaffen, pfeile, niedermhende reiter oder groe olifanten sind, die reihenweise infanterie umstoen. und ja auch heute gibt es solche dinge noch, wie bei ancestors legacy. es trgt einfach zur atmosphre bei, damit man richtig tief eintauchen kann. was ich damit sagen will aoe4 ist ein aoe und das macht es gut. aber als echter rts fan ist mir aoe einfach zu altbacken, weil ich die rts spielereihen rund um 20002010 lieben gelernt hab. und die waren einfach so viel weiter von der aufmachung her, animationen. dass sich aoe4 mehr als remaster anfhlt und ich nicht einfach 2025 jahre zurckspringen kann und alles vergessen kann, was es dazwischen an neuerungen gab. ich nehme einem aoe heute keine atmosphre ab, weil ich an jeder ecke erinnert werde, dass es ein spiel ist ... ich kann nicht eintauchen, wenn mir mit jedem befehl eine unnatrliche animation vor die nase gehalten wird. und mit einem punkt hat maurice da sogar recht, um die atmosphre besser einfangen zu knnen und nicht herausgerissen zu werden, muss man vielleicht fter mal die augen schlieen und nur die soundkulisse genieen. das animationsthema kann man aber auch nicht einfach nachpatchen, trefferfeedback und animationen sind nicht vorhanden. ein schlag erzielt dmg wenn er ausgefhrt wird, und der schaden kann nicht verhindert werden, wenn der gegner sich auer reichweite begibt. aus dem grund kommen situationen zu stande, die visuell nicht nachvollziehbar sind. es gibt keine hitboxen, was aber so wichtig wre. gutes trefferfeedback und dynamische schlachten gibt es auch noch heute und sinnvolle erweiterungen wie fackeln in der nacht, mehr schaden beim flankieren usw. sind nette features. ancestors legacy hat es vorgemacht. und dann nimmt aoe4 nicht mal die einfachsten dynamischen elemente wie pfeilphysik aus den vorgngern mit und wirkt damit noch blasser. zusammengefasst ich hatte mir ein gutes rts mit ein paar innovationen gewnscht  und aoe selbst stand dafr leider nie wirklich, das gameplay ist nach wie vor gut. aber allein damit gewinnt man keinen preis. ich bin wo mglich einfach mit falschen erwartungen heran gegangen, aber die aussage aoe4 wird rts fans einfangen  ist meiner meinung nach falsch. aoe4 wird aoe fans einfangen. eventuell einige rts fans, die sich nicht mehr erinnern knnen, was alles schon da war  weil es schon so lange her ist."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,der sound ist wahnsinnig gut. dass die einheiten je nach zeitalter anders reden finde ich genial! bei den zwischesequenzen htten sie sich aber mehr an aoe iii oder aoe ii orientieren knnen
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,ein 32 minuten test von maurice verst einem sogar den montagmorgen
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"1750 sieht aus als wren die sperrtrger ein verrckter hexenkult, der den rammbock beschwrt. hahaha"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"also age 4 hat mich komplett abgeholt und ich bin keiner der die teile davor gespielt hat, nur durch age 4 habe ich angefangen videos von den vorgngern zu gucken. ich liebe dieses genre zwar durch stronghold extrem dennoch hat mich stronghold warlords nicht annhernd so sehr begeistert wie age 4. ich hoffe deswegen das es neulingen wie mir, die nicht ganz seit 10 jahren in dem genre sind, so geht wie mir und age 4 auch etwas fr neue ist. zudem bestes video was ich seit langem gesehen habe, hat mich mitgerissen 'd"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"bin ich der einzigste dem nach fulltimejob, frau und kind nie zeit fr solch lange videos bleibt? ich vermisse die kurzen, knackigen reviews wie vor 1015 jahren. bleibt nur das lesen des tests."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"zugegeben, ich bin nicht immer der grte fan von maurice. als das video in meinen abos erschien mit dem zusatz test, dachte ich mir ja, klar, maurice hat getestet und alles ist toll, da er ja sowieso hart gehyped ist. doch, wahrlich schande ber mich, er hat alle aspekte sehr fair beleuchtet und ich gehe d'accord und bin zufrieden mit seiner einschtzung. danke fr das video, hat spass gemacht."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,"super test! das ganze erinnert mich irgendwie an mein lieblingsseminar im geschichtsstudium mittelalterbilder in film und computerspiel. da durfte sich jeder mit nem spiel, dem historischen kontext und der umsetzung beschftigen."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"ich glaube es wird viele zum genre bringen weil es im gamepass ist und wrde noch mehr leute ansprechen, wenn es fr die xbox rauskommen wrde mit maus und tastatur untersttzung"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"irgendwie erinnert mich maurice in diesem video wie eine mutter die sich darber aufregt, dass das kind nur oberarzt und nicht chefarzt ist d"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"vielen dank fr den wundervollen test. sehr emotional und das kann ich auch verstehen. warum? kommt es auch mir in den sinn, denn auf die kampagne habe ich mich sehr gefreut. in age 2 fand ich diese einfach stimmig und man fhlte sich richtig in die zeit hineinversetzt. jetzt berlege ich tatschlich ob ich vom kauf nicht abstand nehmen soll. vorerst jedenfalls."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"ich bin begeistert, dass du dieses spiel mit einem  fr gamestar verhltnisse so ausfhrlichem und detailliertem test gewrdigt hast. und natrlich kann ich es nun kaum erwarten bis es los geht fr alle. viel erfolg gleich im showmatch gegen niklasco , achja der age2 pro ist ja nun auch dabei. du schaffst das schon maurice  trotzdem gut auszusehen als feldherr."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"schade, kampagnen mssten schon interessant sein. ich habe aoe nie wirklich online gespielt."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"fan seit dem epischen, ersten teil!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-12,was fr ein bockstarkes video! der kerl ist mit 100 leidenschaft dabei. einfach nur gold!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"bin wirklich traurig denn das was mich wirklich von jedem spiel berzeugen kann ist eine gut erzhlte kampagne. mir ist vollkommen egal ob und wie gut sich der multiplayer spielen lsst. wenn die kampagne mll ist schlecht erzhlt, kauf ich mir das spiel nicht oder erst wenn es irgendwo fr 20 im angebot ist. so wird es nun wohl leider auch mit age 4 laufen. schade!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"sehr schn, bin froh, dass es kein 40min video geworden ist, 32min sind einfach perfekt! d an der stelle liebe gre an den cutter"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,wieso ist eigentlich das interface so komplett lieblos geworden? macht fr mich bei rts immer ein wenig mit vom flair aus.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-07,"ich finde du hast hier unfassbar.. wirklich unfassbar viel zeit mit kritik verbracht. und dabei sind die kritikpunkte gerade fr potenzielle neukunden meines erachtens relativ irrelevant, denn 1. die grafik war primr, bzw. fast ausschliesslich bei aoe2 fans ein kritikpunkt  wat der bauer nit kennt, dat frisst er nit 2. kein anfnger braucht 20 hotkeys.. ein anfnger klickt. 3. die kritik zu der erzhlung der kampagnenhandlung kann ich nachvollziehen, ist jedoch sehr subjektiv. du hast bei einem wirklich guten spiel 15 von 30 min damit verbracht zu kritisieren. ja, so glaube ich auch nicht, dass aoe 4 ein groes und auch neues publikum in deutschland erschliessen kann. ich feier das spiel, aber htte ich diese rezension als erstes gesehen und wre mir das aoeuniversum nicht vertraut, kme ich danach niemals auf die idee es zu kaufen. ich gucke viele aoe2 streams und ich habe die skepsis gegenber aoe4 auch von anfang an mitbekommen. das waren hauptschlich leute, denen schon die definitive edition von aoe 2 zu viel vernderung war. als aoe4 dann aber rauskam und die profis es gespielt haben, hat sich gezeigt, dass das spiel gut ankommt  sowohl bei den meisten spielern, als auch bei deren communities. ich kann wirklich nicht verstehen wie man als community oder journalist sich und seinen interessen dermaen selbst im weg stehen kann. du willst mehr aaa rtsspiele.. musst du wirklich 15 minuten lang meckern, bei einem spiel, das wirklich gut ist? ist das verhltnismig? wird das der realitt gerecht? ich mag dich. ich gucke auch das wwf aoe 4 event heute. aber ich hoffe, dass du ber meine worte nochmal nachdenkst. fr aoe 4 ist es jetzt leider zu spt.. aber ausgeglichene berichterstattung bedeutet nicht, dass man so lange kritisiert wie man lobt. ausgeglichene berichterstattung bedeutet, dass man bei einem sehr guten spiel auch sehr viel lnger lobt. bei einem sehr schlechten spiel, dafr sehr viel lnger kritisiert. das ist meine meinung und ich denke, dass sie gut begrndet ist. dieses spiel hat mich und groe teile der aoe 2 community sehr positiv berrascht und wir sind, davon bin ich berzeugt, mit abstand die anspruchsvollsten und hrtesten kritiker. wenn dieses spiel rts nicht rettet, wird es kein spiel tun. denn besser, auch davon bin ich berzeugt, geht es fr ein frisch herausgekommenes rtsspiel nicht. theoretisch ja, praktisch nein. die kleinen fehler die es noch hat sind normal und vor allem man kann sie nachtrglich relativ leicht ausmerzen."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,wer sonst ist der perfekte mann fr diesen test.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"maurice hlt die flagge fr qualitt nicht nur oben, er jongliert gleich mit vier stck auf einmal. super video!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"super testvideo! ich finde sehr vieles an aoe4 echt super gelungen, ich freue mich darauf es anzuspielen. aber ich muss schon sagen, dass mich die grafik enttuscht...bzw. speziell die einheiten wirken teilweise absurd lcherlich, oder wie maurice sagte schlampig. das strt mich schon sehr und ich verstehe nicht wie man das so dilettantisch umsetzen konnte. ich hoffe, dass ich selbst mit der zeit darber hinweg sehen kann, denn ich bezweifle dass ich daran noch etwas ndern wird."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"ich musste unwillkrlich lachen, als ich die stelle mit den speertrgern und dem rammbockaufbau gesehen habe. in der mitte standen sie einfach im kreis und berhrten einander im mittelpunkt mit den speerspitzen und der rest der truppe tanzte drumherum. das hatte eher etwas von einem ritual, als von einem handwerklichen vorgang. wenn sie das im nachhinein nicht verbessern, dann hat es fr mich aber auf jeden fall einen sehr humoristischen charakter, selbst wenn es dumm aussieht. d nachtrag das mit den bogenschtzen und den stachelschweinen ist mir auch aufgefallen. die einfachste lsung wre wohl, die pfeile einfach im krper verschwinden zu lassen wie in den vorherigen teilen auch schon. bei den kampagnen htte man vielleicht eine mischung aus doku und nahem geschichtserlebnis machen knnen. vor der mission im dokustil darauf einstimmen lassen und whrend der mission historische personen sprechen lassen, denn die sprecherin wirkt ziemlich deplatziert whrend man im spielfieber steckt. es reit einen frmlich heraus. und die modernen bilder htte man echt weglassen knnen. auf jeden fall hat dieses video mich aber schon sehr positiv auf aoe 4 eingestimmt, da ich im vorfeld auch sehr skeptisch war, ob sie es schaffen einen wrdigen nachfolger ins leben zu rufen"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,maruice ich glaub ich wei warum du enttuscht bist und ich ebenso. age 4 ist ein reines multiplayer game! es gibt quasi keine story auch keine dialoge. es gibt auch keine spielerfarben mehr . das war den entwicklern bei coh schon immer egal aber wenigstens haben sie da tolle storyvideos mit eingepackt! schade!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,irgendwie s wie die speerkmpfer ihren reigen um die rammen tanzen.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,wird es jetzt ein ballistiksystem geben? also dass fernkampfeinheiten bei highground auch weiter schiessen knnen?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"schliee mich den vielen positiven kritiken an. wollte nur 2 minuten reinschauen, bin dann ganz dran geblieben  weil das video so abwechslungsreich, spannend und wirklich voller leidenschaft ist. groartig!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,bin schon hyped auf aoe 4 aber meine hoffnungen fr die rettung des rts genre liegt bei frost giant studios
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-06,der dolchstich von command and conquer 4 ins herz sitzt auch bei maurice tief.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"nur die animationsablufe wirken hufig sehr befremdlich. zu gleichfrmig, zu fluffig. vor allem die hochfliegenden pfeile. das muss doch besser gehen..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-14,"genialer test. werde mir age 4 dieses weihnachten etwas suchten. das mit der kampagne ist echt etwas schade. hab mich damals auch mit age 2 durch geschichte gecaryt. erzhl mit im unterricht format das johanna von orleon sell und jene schlacht als frau gefhrt hat ... ich hab es sptestens nach der klausur wieder vergessen. lass mich als johanna die ersten bauern retten und das erste kloster befestigen und ich kann dir heute, 15 jahre spter noch einzelne voicelines zitieren, dir den ablauf der ereignisse skizzieren und ganz wichtig die konflikte aus verschiedenen blickwinkeln schildern. die dokus sind absolut spitze produziert und hoch interessant. aber sie nehmen dem spiel etwas den wind aus den segeln um die geschichte ber gameplay und sounddesign zu erzhlen."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,super review!!! kriegt man richtig bock drauf. ich warte halt immer noch auf einen empire earth reboot... das spiel war so unendlich geil.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"ich finde die tests von maurice ziemlich cool, weil es immer so eine persnliche geschichte ist. aber sie sind auch immer soo lang, dass ich mich sehr berwinden muss, darauf zu klicken."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-03,"klasse video, maurice! deine einschtzung zu den kampagnen teile ich allerdings in einem punkt nicht die verbindung der ereignisse von damals mit den orten von heute finde ich klasse und ziemlich spannend! es gibt so viele flecken auf der welt, an denen geschichtstrchtiges passiert ist. und gerade weil das leben dort weiter gegangen ist, hilft die verbildlichung auch dem verstndnis von geschichte bzw. der entwicklung von geschichtlichem interesse. so htte es vermutlich mein 10 jhriges ich gesehen. natrlich gibt es viele wege, geschichte spannend zu erzhlen und erlebbar zu machen. dieses stilmittel gehrt fr mich als gangbarer weg dazu. aus meiner sicht besteht berechtigte hoffnung, das auch dieser aoeteil unseren deine und meine ansprchen an die erfllung eines bildungsauftrages gerecht wird  ."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"hat bei maurice eig. irgendwer die fufessel aufgemacht? videos mit maurice, oder von maurice sind garantiert genial und werden immer besser, gerade seit dem letzten jahr. leidenschaftlich, informativ, detailiert, umfassend und reflektiert. macht die tr ruhig noch weiter auf. da kommt nur gutes d"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"sinngem zu sagen, dass niemals wieder ein rts gemacht wird wenn aoe4 kein erfolg wird ist aber schon hart bertrieben. gerade weil es auch noch durchaus erfolgreiche rts gibt, neben aoe2, nmlich sc2 und natrlich auch immer noch scbw. auch ohne dieses argument wre die aussage niemals ganz schwer bertrieben. ansonsten leider nicht allzu viel neues fr mich leute die, die entwicklung nher verfolgt haben dabei gewesen, aber grundstzlich eine gute review. edit. was mir gerade noch aufgefallen ist es gibt durchaus eine animation fr den aufbau von rammbcken, die kann man sogar im video selbst sehen. nur die units selbst interagieren nicht mit dem aufbau des rammbocks. es wird zwar von geisterhnden gesprochen, aber eben leider auch davon, dass es keine animationen gibt, was nicht stimmt. es gibt sie und mir persnlich gefallen die sogar ganz gut, da sie relativ simple gehalten sind und so nicht das spiel geschehen berdecken zugegebenermaen betrachtet aus reiner multiplayer sicht. auerdem die hold position mechanik ist m.m.n durchaus bewusst so wie sie ist. ein move mit den units nach vorne holt sie raus aus dieser haltung. diese funktion ist vorallem fr micro ggn. kavallerie mit eigener speerinfanterie gedacht. eine einrastfunktion wre an dieser stelle einfach quatsch. ein effizienteres spiel macht kein besseres spiel. gerade bei multiplayer und da gerade bei rts muss man darauf achten spielemechaniken bewusst umstndlich zu machen. jeden der sich da eine sehr gute meinung einholen will kann ich hier einen day9 talk ber das thema absolut empfehlen, dort spricht er das thema am beispiel scbw, sc2 und seinem damals selbst in entwicklung befindendem spiel aus dem nie was geworden ist durch. gibt's irgendwo noch auf youtube."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"ach ich find's immer schn einen test von maurice zu sehen. er verpackt das ganze immer sehr anschaulich, unterhaltsam und informativ"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"danke fr den test! ich mchte das spiel gerne mgen, aber auch wenn ich nichts gegen die grafik an sich habe, ich kann kaum einheiten und gebude unterscheiden. ich kann es nicht erklren und bei aoe2 habe ich so etwas auch nicht, aber es fhlt sich an wie ein bunter einheitsbrei. auch das ingame overlay hat kaum kontrast und geht unter. das kenne ich von keinem spiel und es hat mir whrend des stress tests keinen spa gemacht. durch den game pass gebe ich dem spiel mal noch eine chance und hoffe aber sehr, dass die aoe2 szene nicht drunter leidet."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-12,"also erstens danke fr das gute review und den schnen berblick fr das gesamte spiel. alles schn auf den punkt getroffen was ich nach knapp 2 wochen age 4 auch zum spiel sagen wrde, insgesamt habe ich nichts zu bemngeln auer an dem review ber die kampagnen, die fand ich in ihrer inszenierung eigentlich gut gelungen, ist vermutlich geschmacks sache aber ich mochte den doku aufbau der kampagnen sehr gerne, freut mich auch das euch die mini dokus so sehr gefallen haben, das war auch fr mich ein kleines highlight. ich fand aber das der dokumentationsaufbau eine schne herangehensweise an historische ereignisse in einem echtzeitstategiespiel war, als der versuch eine wahre geschichte irgendwie mit dialogen und zwischensequenzen zu inszenieren und aufzuplustern, da freue ich mich mehr darber das die entwickler sich die zeit genommen haben echtes wissen zu vermitteln und historische ereignisse zu rekonstruieren. ich hoffe das age 4 wieder mehr menschen fr echtzeitstrategie begeistert, es ist nicht perfekt, aber verdammt nah dran und es bockt mega und darauf kommt es finde ich letztendlich an."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,was ein tolles review! auf jeden fall eines der besten! danke maurice.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,25.47 woooow woooww woooow die kampagne und deren erzhlweise fand ich absolut hammer! die atmosphre passte einfach so gut mit der grafik zusammen das es wie ein bilderbuch war. die erzhlenden stimmen waren perfekt! wie einextrem gutes hrbuch.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,ich wage zu behaupten dieser test knnte legendrer werden als das spiel selbst!  danke fr die groartige arbeit!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-27,ich hoffe dein test kommt bei den entwicklern an und wird zu herzen gekommen. dann erschaffen sie wirklich einen wrdigen und legendren nachfolger. grandios erzhlter und dargestellter test.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,ich muss sagen nach den test bin ich wirklich enttuscht. ich bin eigentlich ein ausschlielich kampagnen spieler und das sie so langweilig sind ist fr mich wirklich ein no go. mal sehen vielleicht finde ich sie ja doch nicht hat so schrecklich wie maurice oder ich kann mich doch fr multiplayer begeistern. aber na ja unwahrscheinlich

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-25,"ich wrde den videotitel eher in age of empires 4 ist okay  aber nicht die rettung des rts umbenennen. neben deinen 3 angesprochenen schwchen kommt noch hinzu, dass es den editor erst 2022 geben wird, das ui vor allem von der lesbarkeit nicht so gut ist und die modernen neuerungen im vergleich zu aoe3 sehr berschaubar sind. atmosphrisch kann es auch nicht mit den anderen aoes mithalten. da wren die schwcheren kampagnensprecher, das generische mendesign, allgemein die spezielle grafik ohne feinere animationsdetails und natrlich die fehlenden skelette, blut, keine belagerungcrew und fr ein modernes spiel recht tot wirkende natur... nicht falsch verstehen, das spiel macht definitiv an manchen stellen spa und macht auch manches sehr gut, aber die schwchen trben fr mich das bild doch schon enorm und somit ist es fr mich einfach ein okayes aoe bzw. fhlt sich wie ein sehr gutes low budget spiel an. nicht mehr, nicht weniger. also letzlich bleibt es ein ganzes stck hinter den erwartungen, die man ja nach dem teaser  den entwickler relic und dahinterstehenden gigant microsoft schon erwarten kann. ansonsten stimme ich dir grtenteils zu, grafik, steuerung und besonders die kampagnen sind ernchternd."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-26,"vielen dank, maurice fr diesen umfangreichen testbericht. tatschlich ist er so umfassend, dass die fachpresse dich zitieren wird, wenn sie ber aoe4 berichten. man merkt, du bist mit eifer, bei der arbeit gewesen.  die kritik an der prsentation der kampagnen sehe ich aber als weniger schwerwiegend an. es ist halt age und nicht starcraft. wo starcraft schon von der grundprmisse her als episches scifispektakel angelegt ist, ist age auf der anderen seite halt... ja nchtern, sachlich und fr meine begriffe auch realittsnah.... was fr age vollkommen ausreicht wie auch fr den geschichtsunterricht in der schule... ach ja... good times ein spiel wie age bombastischepisch aufzublasen, wre aus meiner sicht geknstelt, wenig authentisch. dass aber alle sprechparts nur einer einzigen erzhlerin zukommen, ist dagegen ein rckschritt. viel stimmungsvoller wre es, die protagonisten selbst sprechen zu lassen und dass mit ihren landestypischen akzenten. oder warum nicht mal die muttersprache samt untertitel verwenden? ich htte bock, mir dschingis kahn mal auf mongolisch zu geben oder johanna von orleans auf franzsisch das wr doch mal was xd"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-27,can we all stop and take a moment to be thankful this game came out? thank you universe for making this all possible.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-14,have been playing this since it came out ran through the campaign with in the 2 days and now ive been doing nothing but playing ai practicing and then turning around and playing online matches against players to see how well i was timing everything. watching these videos allowed me to see the little details i was doing wrong. but also showed me what i was doing right as well and makes me feel good. super huge fan of rts games especially the aoe series
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-25,something to never forget is scouting your enemy in dark age and early feudal. you want to know the units you're going into asap so not to invest in the wrong units and techs to deal with what your enemy is doing.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-12,gold star for those bookmarkchapter things in the video and those slick graphic titles with the transitions. 1110 will watch again
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-27,holy crap that trick using shift to send your scout on a predefined route is magic
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-10,"pro strat for the rus, you could spread the additional scouts to collect and hunt the animals that are closer in the enemies realm first and harm their food production and get an early edge when going this way instead of the circle or spiral spread and go back to your own a bit afterwards and only have one or two sheep at a time to keep the gathering going. you may have to adjust when going against them too."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-01-12,best beginner explainer video ive seen so far. just started playing the game and its been super helpful thank you
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-04,"omg! been playing this game for less than a week now. i knew about shift commands, but i never even thought about using it for my scout. awesome tip!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-15,"idk how i wasn't subbed before your crusader kings videos helped me out a lot as well as informing me more about world history than any schooling i've ever had. commenting for the algorithm, too!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-15,"for hre make a preelate to start you'll make that gold back in like 30 seconds and age up at the same time or quicker while have a 40 gather boost, also have him rotate to food or lumber as the buff lasts quite a while. 1 prelate can buff 10 civs before he can't keep up with buffing to buff fall off ratio."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-31,"i love the cinematics the game has of battles with the troops all in formation and the signal flares going off etc. meanwhile, i never see a single ball of archers in any of the clips."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-10,"useful tips for the mongols is that you can use ports as trading hub for your land trade donkey too currently and because they're highly mobile having the trade come in a odd long stretch along the edge of the map can slowly have an early secure trade route and you could use your khan and scouts to snipe the enemy animals or snatch a few sheep. if you're going against abbassids and the delhi sultanate that means their boar is haram, so they cannot hunt it for food so they either have to just kill it off or you can use advantage of theirs instead."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-10,"bravo, incredible work on your part to put this all together."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-10,"great vid bro, first time i watch u, ur a chill dude like it"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-14,"super duper helpful, very descriptive and great delivery of information! you have 1 subscribers because of this! yay"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-01,"thanks so much man, im trying to improve and this video helpe me a lot!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-23,bruh. this video should be included in the game for new players  best explanation of the base mechanics. ty brudda
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-11,"with abbasid, if you practice their opening, you can perfectly time a few nice plays early. house of worship makes the push to ii trickier than other factions. so 1. how before lumber mill the 400f 200g wing cost will be in reach by the time it's built, then once you click econ wing to ii... 2. pull vills for mass wood, and replenish food with new vills or a few micro peels, by the time the wing is done and they do take a while you can get to 150 wood and place an archery range on the exact second you actually hit ii. 3. then pull vills for food and go heavy food and wood 4. go ca, ca cost180f 60 w.per they can harass really well until you make more units, or make a stable. this build order gives the the option of early pressure, or a better defense from early pressure, rather than building how after mill. also, 4 horseman, 2ca is a nice harasser squad for gimping enemy's gold or challenging early archer squad. total cost 760f 200w"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-06,"thanks for showing this, i was wondering what to do as build order with rus and mongol the rest was quite known to me. i did miss the time ingame though. in those build orders since they are quite important to me."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-12-27,"bought this game long time ago, don't know when will i start playing it"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-05-14,your video is very good and your voice is very manly. i got this game just this week... makes me relax and stress out at once
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-05,"i completed the hardest then i moved up to outrageous and i got my ass, served on a plate as well, so i feel for you"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-18,"on delhi, i highly recommend building a mill later. use max wood at all times. start with 7 on mill 1 on mosque. getting a mosque asap is key so you can research sanctity and start capping sacred sites"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-10,thanks for this very helpful video for new player like me
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-10,something cool about the chines to defend or attack you don't need to build lots of militery building just one of each type you need and add empireal offical to it add you boost your unit production 200 as if you have 3 buildings
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-11,me talking to my friend man i've been vsing the hard ai a lot but i keep getting kurb stomped the second i play against people friend do you know your build order? me build order? i'm now watching this video
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-15,a very strong build order with english is to not create any extra archery range but get onetwo racks and pump spearmen. obviously you keep producing archers but the idea is that if you keep a few villagers on gold you can make a blacksmith and your spearmen can build a battering ram. do not underestimate how strong this unit is early game and you can easily destroy some important buildings from your opponents and even if you dont get to a building it takes soooo much damage to destroy in the early game its a cheap tank for hp.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-16,i build 2 farms as english early. it really helps to make the sheep last longer !
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-12,"in my opinion playing as hre and going for prelate 1st is better as the buff that he gives to workers, never ends. even though they don't have it, they are still gathering 40 more resources. not sure if that's a bug or not, but that's how it is."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-10,"chinese could be a high villager powerhouse and i think having farms early can have a bit of a slight advantage if you force drop their ressources as they are making rice farms instead of wheat so their gathering rate is slightly different. you can atleast have 3 main strategies i think, depending on what you're up against. fast castle is on the board as you described, you may have to go full turtle even or you can have advanced villager boom if you're either not getting early harassment or have some success to repell that. going for the tax collectors early had given you a high surplus of gold that either means you can be slower on gathering from the mining camp and rather focus more on wood and farms or deer or berries. if you've a higher count on villagers has a higher success chance for boar which means even more food faster. so i think there's some versatility in the long run."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-12,this is really helpful for the newbs
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-02,"2719 small correction, mosque does not produce monk, it produces an imam"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-12,you should always make the prelate as the first thing in game. atleast thats what every pro and every guide says
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-23,"i usually do 2 goldmining camp, 2 woodlumber yard, 2 sheep rally all villagers o sheep until age 2. i think at about the 2nd villager produced, that one will make a house. also, when i get my first 50 wood, i make a mill  spend it on the meat gathering upgrade. this make its so i'm usually the first or second in a game to progress to age 2. as the english, this also give me wood for archers  gold for economy upgrades the moment i progress to age 2."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-21,thank you.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-11,i think you made a mistake with supply block its best to have the 9th villager come out to make a house since in aoe4 the next villager still gets produced and you have 35 seconds of lee way at 1010 population villager 20 seconds house 15 seconds
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-18,man thanks for this video this is exactly what i needed.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-11,thanks
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-10,wouldn't you ideally be using the 8th villager second vil out to build the house rather than 7thfirst vil out? you won't be supply blockedhoused because the tc still produces the full next villager before it would stop it. the house would finish with plenty of time before it prevents any progress on villager production

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-13,"the delhi build is totally wrong, as don't need wood to reach the second age you should avoid at all chopping wood until you have bought the ii age. just after it you can recruit villagers to gather wood but not before it."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-20,what does it mean to make something the center?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-30,"can i build smth without clicking on villager ,and after send villager to build it?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,"with hre you do actually want to get the prelate as the very first thing you build, 40 increase is defiantly worth it and i find myself getting faster age 2 than all of my opponents no matter what they play when i'm hre. all the hre players i've seen also do this. 100 worth it. the age 1 build i use is 6 workers on sheep, prelate first. first worker that's made be rallied towards gold, that worker builds a house when it comes out of the town center. after the house is done send it to build the mining camp. the second villager goes to mining gold, and all villagers after him do the same till you have enough to age up. at around this point you want to send the prelate towards the gold to inspire gold villagers, sometimes sending it back to food as well. once you have enough gold to age up, use the villagers on gold to make the landmark of choice but leave 1 or 2 on gold still, to save up gold for a second prelate. make sure to return any gold the villagers might be carrying to the mining camp before you send them to construct the landmark when its producing, rally new villagers to gather wood, and the villagers constructing the landmark also gather wood when they finish, so you can make the next house. depending on how aggressive you want to be, decide carefully as to when you want to send the villagers on wood back on gold or food. if you wish to age to castle asap, after you have enough wood for a house leave 2 or 3 villagers on wood for houses and send the rest back to gold mining with new villagers on food. if you want to be more aggressive, keep the villagers on wood for as long as nessicary so you can make the structures needed to produce your units of choice keep them there indefinitely if you're gonna make battering rams"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-09,you sound like sal khan from khan academy...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-12,its actually more efficient to send villager to move closest sheep as close as base as possible and kill it asap with villagers then produce villagers group base while you produce villagers click on scoot then click on map to where you wanna go. after that you want to rally it on the sheep and make sure there is a blue flag while your scoot still moving move sheeps as close as base as possible to the base and the sheep you are harvesting so that your villagers can kill it and gather without losing time in travel time. early game economy really matters a lot as a slight inefficiency has quite some impact to the midlate game and good bases matters a lot. i know its min maxing but sometimes having 1 extra unit earlier or be able to make wall few sec earlier can change the course of the game. edit  ha you said its not the not minmax haha sorry  yeah the general idea is fine

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,"french winning against english on water? what is this, napoleon's wet dream?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,"so one thing to consider when looking at win rate based on length of game is that the relative volume of games that end in that timeframe is also significant, particularly with very early games. for example if a civilization has no tools for rushing an opponent but have very good earlygame defensive options, just looking at the win rate might suggest they are bad at early game because they are never looking to end games early. but if there are very few games that in this length range because they almost always survive the early game, then calling them bad can be deceptive. and in general why would you be picking a nonrushing civ in order to win a game in under 10 minutes? so player behavior also comes into play. i'm not claiming that any aoe4 civs fit into that category just pointing it out as a factor."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-22,"i'm a pure abbasid after going through the civs and learning them, and i have a winrate i'm very happy with. the trick is go heavy spears early on, fast castle, and squeeze out a mangonal. at that point you are really uncontested in matchups. i try not to get greedy with a second town center until i have some map control, and being that spearmen can run across the map then build siege, it's pretty simple. i haven't played a game yet where camel archers even were remotely a good idea, but i do get some camels out to buff infantry. i love them and for the first time ever in an age game i feel really competitive  btw i love your vids!"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-15,just keep in mind that with the hre the reason they do so poorly early on is because most players are just trying to go fast imp instead of using the massive eco bonus to fight

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-13,worth mentioning that adding to hres weakness to cav civs is that their spears can't brace

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-15,"hre late game stronkness is from its relics.. honestly its so strong if you can get 3 relics for a hefty amount of gold, you can stop mining it entirely until you decide to make large amounts of siege units, especially bombards. and with so many villagers not having to mine gold you can get super far ahead economically in age 3 that you can produce twice the amount of men in arms as they have army supply which counter everything save for crossbows as your opponent whilst still advancing to the imperial only 2 minutes after you advanced to age 3."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,no civilization can get over 50 win rate on all maps mongols  we are the exception
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,mongols as the strongest civ seems kinda historical accurate to me.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,"nice video, but the main problem with these statistics is that it's hard to know just how much of them are affected by the players choosing the civs, and the build they use, rather than the civs themselves. for example, a player who's all about early aggression is more likely to choose english or mongol, which in turn would make english or mongol have a better win rate at the beginning of the game, with a steady dropoff as the game goes on for longer, because that's just how an aggressive strategy performs in general. it also makes sense that abasid and delhi don't have a good winrate early game, simply because the players who like to play aggressive builds aren't really attracted to those civs. i think however that those stats are a pretty good indicator of when to prepare for a push depending on what civ your opponent has chosen."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-22,"i've only played the campaign so far, but the mongals were definitely my favourite civ to play as, followed by the rus"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-13,hre and delhi have too many bugs... i main hre and the lack of bracing for spearman really hurts vs early game cav civs. hre also has prelate bug and relics boosting enemy ships attack speed
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-16,"i have to say, i was a mongols guy, and lately i've been absolutely loving rus. they just feel so right. and i'm not even tapping into as much as i should with their hunting micro in the early game. they just feel so balanced but i love throwing a ton of warrior monks into the mix with knights. so fun. mongols felt too tricky at times"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,omg i this video and i was hoping for it
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-18,"i suspect at least half of these civs suffer from metasyndrome, where hre must fast imperial and rus must fast castle and build horse archers and french must build knights even when they know the opponents is abbasid. still, very interesting breakdown"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,interesting that english have the best match up against mongols. since they get a unique mechanic to ward off aggro on a micro level. maybe aoe4 should make micro heavy defense options for defensive nations more often.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,"i think there is a data point missing when looking at the winrate over short and long games which is the amount of games with that duration. i would expect a defensive civilization to have a low winrate in short games, but because they should have a tendency for longer games. in other words, if a game with a defensive civilization ends early, it's likely the more aggressive civilization won. if a defensive civilization's game plan is to survive to the late game and win then, a successful early game for them would then be surviving the early game instead of straight up winning it. meaning, to measure a defensive civilization's success, one would need to look at the number of games that end quickly and not at the winrate for those games."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-04-07,"i think it would be very cool to see rebalanced nations that win on their respective bioms and historical records, like mongol bits rus on their biom, or chinese great as walls, or english having strongest naval on late games."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-13,"i think it could be interesting, yet complex, to look at the amount of wins over minutes played. as you tend to see the more defensive civs have a very bad track record at winning early game. however, i would not be surprised if the amount it's also very rare for them to loose early game, due to their defensive bonuses. however, since they lack an early game win condition it's possibly even more rare for them to actually secure a win early game. i could be completely wrong on this, but it does make me curious."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-13,however 1 sad thing is that we rarely see cavalry units being heavily utilized in most mongol games.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-13,"hi law, spirit of the guys here."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,"i think the other question is how many games for each civ end in a given amount of time. if a civ doesn't win in games that end quickly that could be a huge deal if most games end quickly, but it could be kind of irrelevant if they reliably win but take a bit longer."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-14,"the reason delhi lose on black forest is because they have no eco bonus'. when the map is so closed off that both people can boom safely the delhi just get destroyed. 'free techs' isn't even a bonus when your opponent is also not getting many because they are also booming up. the lack of sacred sites is less about not getting that small amount of gold, and more about not being able to force the opponent out of a boom. compare hre that are also defensive, but one of the best booming civs with the prelate, relic, and imperial landmarks."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,if i play i'm going to be an hre main i like stout walls
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-19,you should make civ overview videos for aoe 4
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-14,"still think that french have way too many bonuses and units compared to for example, the english who have literally nothing.. abbasids need a buff to camels with delhi needs to be fixed in research times"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-07,"if japan gets introduced, then the mongols might actually lose on the water maps."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-13,"team games are also interesting to see how civs compare. hre with china is a horrifying combo late game, mix them with mongols, french or english, you can't lose"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-01,as a new player i understand why holy romans are lower i play english but switched to holy roman but it was very weak before castle age
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-15,theres only one thing sure... mongols nerf... and rus abassid buff hre bugs fixed delhi fixes
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-07,i till think holy roman is the most fun for new players. the giant food producrion they can get from their teir 2 is crazy
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,looking forward to your next aoe2 vid. hopefully it will be a full in dept version of poles and when to go on stone and how their stone mechanic works with hold and stone resource gathering in the meta
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,"i simply love playing mongols as they are a civ that allows you to play so many styles. going infantry, going cavalry, going horsearchers, or even siege. mongols are so flexible compared to your bog standard french and english. would love to see more abbasids and dehli though."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-12,"250k 1v1 games over the last 3 weeks!? i was on the fence if i should get the game or not, since i wasn't sure if anyone plays it at all, but i guess there's not much reason not to get it!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,als een tweakers review op een reclame lijkt is het product vast heel goed. haha
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"ik vond tijdens het spelen van de beta, het spel wat 'dumbed down' en mijn algemene beeld was best negatief. zoals met veel spellen gebeurd. maar ik ben benieuwd naar de verdere ontwikkelingen, wel leuk dat er eindelijk weer een rts uit is gekomen!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,prima review! alleen de frame drops waren wel storend zo nu en dan. als dit aan het spel zelf ligt is dat noemenswaardig anders is het toch waard om misschien een betere pc beschikbaar te stellen voor de beelden
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,ligt het aan mij of dropt die fps soms ? ben enorme fan van de reeks maar weet niet goed wat ik van deze moet vinden....
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-14,echt goede video. thanks jeroen!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,schaapjes zijn niet nieuw. die beestjes verzamelen in aoe2 was mijn enige talent.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"als iemand die al velen uren aoe 2 heeft gespeeld, kan ik vertellen dat ik aoe 4 zeker ga aanschaffen na het zien van deze goede review"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,pas vanaf 1700 te spelen vandaag. ik had nou juist een vrije dag xd
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-03,is dit te spelen op macos via crossover of parrallels?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,komt deze game ook uit op de xbox series x?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,leuke recensie
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"paul smans. ben best benieuwt naar de nieuwe versie age empires iv in zijn geheel te zien . heb een stukje gezien bij mijn kleinzoon maar ik loop er nog niet warm voor . de poppetjes zweven zo over het beeldscherm ze hebben tot zover nog geen natuurlijke gang , en dat is niet leuk .ik vindt wel dat de opzet van gebouwen wel leuk is . maar om nu zoveel geld uit te geven voor dit spel is te bezien."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"ik kan er niet mee om dat karretjes en what not, uit zichzelf rond zitten te rollen. dat was vroeger zo, ok. maar sinds coh ben ik het zo geleerde dat een objecttoestelmachinevoertuig altijd bemand moet zijn."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-13,dankjewel jeroen horlings
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-12,heb je met dit spel een dag en nacht cyclus?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"goeie review, maar had aub even een sterke pc gepakt je ziet de lage fps etc."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,de belangrijkste vraag zijn dezelfde cheats terug aanwezig? d
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-05,"gaaf. protip, in buitenlandse winkels kun je het spel vaak met wat korting tegenover de nederlandse prijs kopen mits je een buitenlands ipadres hebt."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,"ergens snap ik niet dat ze dit proberen. het voelt toch meer aan als 2 maar dan in een nieuw jasje. veel nieuws is er precies niet te zien. het lijkt allemaal gewoon minder dan wat je krijgt bij aoe 2 de. die versie krijgt de laatste jaren zoveel liefde, en is goed gebalanceerd voor competitie. ik vind het een gemiste kans om iets nieuws te proberen. aoe 3 vond ik vroeger ook minder leuk, maar ze kozen wel een duidelijke andere richting, en er zaten ook wel leuke elementen in. maar je had nooit het gevoel dat je aoe 2 aan het spelen was met betere graphics. en dat proberen ze hier precies wel. dus, aan 60 euro koop ik deze zeker niet."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,ik miss info over de pop cap? en of er wel of niet een campaign is?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-02,"graphics doen me een klein beetje denken aan age of empires online, vergeleken met aoe 3"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-06-20,"die schaapjes had je met age of mythology al, de beste aoe game ooit"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-28,een nieuwe geit die schapen verzamelt
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-04,vind ancient empires interesanter zoals age of empires 2. met roman empire. egyptian pharaoh

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,236 dat is fijn??? nee geef mij maar die dorpeling zoeken dan die lame landmark win condition.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,goed dat ze geen risico genomen hebben? wat een stomme opmerking. ga dan aoe 2 of 3 spelen...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-13,"i often forget how much i love the aoe franchise, but when i remember every now and then, it tastes so sweet."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-15,those aoe ii animations aren't what i was hoping for 20 years later
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-15,"honestly, i was waiting for better graphics"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-13,meanwhile i'm still waiting for age of mythology 2
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-13,movements look laggyclunky in some places. horsescamels running animations make them look like they run in place. for an xboxmicrosoft ingame footage to look like that... i wonder how my rig will handle it.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-14,"i really want to play this, but my pc died. i was really hoping it would be released on xbox with mouse and keyboard support."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-13,"sweet joan, i shall avenge thee."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-13,would be more hyped for age of mythology 2!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-17,im hyped for this! ahh good memories from windows 98
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-13,ironically enough these graphics are what warcraft 3 reforged should have looked like. simple with smooth detailing.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-15,looks like those ads for smartphone games
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-17,i hope my mobile runs this well
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-13,bring this to xbox...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-13,it looks like 2005 still.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-14,animation at the level of the first part of the game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-14,there were modern units in the age of empire 3 art book. tanks and rifles were supposed to be age of empire iv ?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-13,how do you turn this on?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-16,"this looks good, but i'm nervous after what relic did to dawn of war 3. i hope this time cavalry actually charges and the fights are more realistic."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-13,why are the graphics so bad though?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-15,i miss warcraft iii
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-15,"defiantly looking forward to aoe4, but why are trebuchet autonomous? it be nice if they had animated crews manning them."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-14,they better release age of mythology with the best graphics not like the halfassed extended edition.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-14,these graphics and animations hurt my eyes.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-13,dude im so psyched to play this game.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-08-06,"everyone asking for better graphics and realism on units and buildings  for starters, we would need to command at least legions of footsoldiers, place them strategically, take into consideration the weather, the seasons, terrain, etc."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-08-20,"mates, if this game flops, say goodbye to age of mythology ii. so pray and try to bring new players to aoe iv. and tell your aoe ii lunatics buddies to stop boycotting aoe iv."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-06-13,"it's on xbox game pass and it's an xbox studios game but it's pc only and probably always will be. why even use the xbox branding, just say microsoft studios like you used to and call it game pass because it has nothing to do with xbox and that's frustratingly misleading!"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-15,"conoc a age of empires en los 90. mi to se fue a vivir a usa y me regalo su computadora. y mi tia habia alquilado una casa que tenia cientos de juegos originales de pc. sin conocerlos los copie a todos y empece a probarlos, sin, delta force, carmen san diego detective, piratas tu gran desafo, uno peor que el otro hasta que me tope con el age of empires 1. desde ese momento no he dejado de jugar la saga.."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"me parece un juegazo, sper divertido y las escenas tipo documental solo simplemente como history channel en sus mejores tiempos. pero es verdad, pudo ser an mejor, siento que ciertas acciones estn faltas de una animacin para representar una colisin, estoy muy de acuerdo con el anlisis en general. es muy bueno pero las crticas harn que posiblemente nos escuchen y hagan algo al respecto, ojal sea as y sea an mejor"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-05-06,"2022 y aun me sigue encantando este juego,fue uno de los primeros de mi infancia que mas jugue!gracias por el video,un trabajo estupendo!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,como olvidar de la civilizacin espaoles en aoe ii el famoso santiago
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,saladino a donde vas con ese gran ejrcito

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,espero en un futuro agreguen el factor clima al mapa
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"16 aos despus, aqu estoy, reencontrndome con el videojuego que hizo que muchos de mis compaeros de cole y yo vayamos al cyber a jugar el multi de age of empires. vale la pena? a mi punto de vista, si, para aquellos que no entraron nunca a la saga ? tambien, juegazo!!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"compaq presario uhh lala seor frances, esa era de los primos ricos, uno con su alaska batallando"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,que ms haga porfavor un remake del mitology
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"es age of empires iv un buen juego? s. si eres fan de los rts te va a gustar? lo ms probable es que s. es un buen age of empires? s juega en contra del mismo juego que es la continuacin de age of empires 2 definitive edition, que tambin gusta mucho por la nostalgia que se le tiene al dos original entonces uno puede llegar a pensar esto es lo mejor que se poda hacer despus de quince aos? probablemente se podra haber hecho algo mejor, cmo tambin es posible que hubiera resultado peor, es un buen juego, pero se nota que no quisieron arriesgarse, tal y cmo pas cuando intentaron innovar con el 3. con ste juego pesa demasiado el factor nostalgia, si eres seguidor de la saga te va a gustar, si la juegas por primera vez lo ms probable es que no te parezca la gran cosa y optes por elegir otro juego si eres ese ltimo tipo de jugador, te recomiendo que le des la oportunidad con game pass, y si no te gusta, igual tienes cmo 300 juegos ms, no hay pierde."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-23,"yo pens que tendra un modo historia como el 3, que la verdad me atrapo bastante y pens que al menos habra la continuacin o quiz otra historia interesante, pero solo trajeron documentales, que estn bien, pero es diferente a lo que me esperaba"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-06,"supero mis expectativas, el juego es sensacional, si lo puede comprar no lo dude, se divertira y aprendera de estrategia e historia."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"es cierto que tiene algunos detalles a mejorar, que se puede ir puliendo con updates, pero, ms que defectos, la mayora de las cosas negativas que mencionan parece una lista de deseos personal. muchas de las descripciones negativas que mencionaron son claves para distintas jugadas en modo competitivo, como lo del impedimento de los bosques."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-05-26,"amo age of empire, lo conoc por all del 2005 con mis hermanos jugarlo en mi infancia lo recuerdo como si fuera ayer. me da mucha nostalgia ver la evolucin de este juego."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,no puedo creer que no hayan notado que no incluye el editor de mapas
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-01,"perro, estaba con muchas dudas y me encontr con ste tremendo pedazo de video que tienes una total chulada! ha sido sper puntual, objetivo e informativo. y ni hablar de lo bien que le has narrado. muchas gracias!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"110 oye!!! eso me ofende. tambin puedo jugar f1 2020, pes, gta v, star wars jedi fallen order, the witcher y muchos ms con mi poderosa 1050, las 3090 son solo para ms fps"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-05,"quiero probar este juego, aunque siempre desear que avancen a la siguiente era despus del 3 algo as como 1800revolucin industrial y colonial hasta la primera mitad del siglo 20, quien sabe, quizs hagan otro juego."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"recuerdo cuando al iniciar campaas se te narraban historias de una manera pica y con mucha pasin, ahora parece documental de historia channerl xd"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-05,"una obra maestra , lo mejor es que volvi a su esencia"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-14,"lanceros contra caballera, caballera contra arqueros y arqueros contra lanceros ? en serio ? entonces hace 20 aos siempre lo jugu mal... jaja. en fin, los arietes, los caones y las catapultas nunca me dejaron caer en cuenta del error. bueno, mucha nostalgia de todas maneras, cuando muri el windows xp, muri todo eso, como en 2003."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-23,quien est aqu porque lo pusieron en xbox en game pass? mi corazn late con fuerza mientras se instala el juego!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,age of empire o el discovery tour de assassin's creed para aprender historia????...dejando fuera que en uno aprendes historia jugando y en el otro no juegas mientras aprendes historia.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-04,"te amo age siempre vas a ser el mejor juego de estrategiaaaaaa, desde que naci en 2001 hasta hoy solo un juego me enamoro y es el age of empires 2 y este es una carisia al alma a mis 20 aos"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,ojal se venga el remake de age of mytholohy
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,tambien en mi opinion pesa que la saga parecia que avanzaba de era conforme cada juego salia y sinceramente yo esperaba un aoe 4 con un enfoque en la primera y segunda guerra mundial y pues volver a la edad media donde el aoe 2 lo hizo de menera excelente me parece mas un refrito
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-30,"cuando saquen la espansin y aparezca el imperio espaol, lo probar. mientras sigo con el 2."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-13,el autor del video pero pudo ser mejor ... yo en mi pensamiento no mams lo quiero jugar!

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-27,"cuando se anuncio age 4 habia la discusion si llegaria hasta la segunda guerra mundial o vietnam, o que revolucionario o nuevo se introduciria...jajajaj como muchas en otras sagas juegos, peliculas o libros, incluso en moda la mentalidad y evaluaciones de las compaias del presente es una mierda, totalmente alejado de lo que quiere la gente, como que intencionalmente buscan el fracaso realmente una decepcion, pero como en muchas otras cosa en la vida, el pasado nunca volvera"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,las batallas parecen metro pantitln en hora pico jajajajaja
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-08-29,"si ves esto, en 15 minutos lo quitan de steam, est gratis. corre!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-02,jugaba mucho al aoe 2 cuando era nio... que pasada el 4
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-16,"volvieron atrs. 1, 2 y 3 iban avanzando en el tiempo. el 4 retrocedi antes del 3. yo esperaba que fuera ms parecido a una primera guerra mundial."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"se nota el cario por como se documentaron los desarrolladores al presentar la poca y los aspectos de dicho periodo, pero esa esttica tan caricaturesca y las animaciones tan amigables de las unidades se parecen ms a una pelea de almohadas que una lucha con armas blancas, me trae amargos recuerdos del aoe online. pero lo que ms echo en falta es que age of empires iba avanzando a lo largo de la historia blica humana, desde la edad antigua en el 1, la edad media en el 2 y la era colonial en el 3, este debera haber sido en la edad moderna, pero se limitaron a revivir las viejas glorias del 2, aprovechando su actual popularidad tras ms de 20 aos. me parece que no es digno de llevar ese 4, a lo mucho se lo recordar como esos juegos de esas franquicias que vuelven del pasado con esas ideas viejas en tiempos modernos, que ni siquiera se atrevi a ser un spin off distinto como lo hizo el age of mythology."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,parte de mi cultura general se la debo a aoe
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-08,"completamente enamorado del juego, espero con ansias mas civilizaciones!!! esapoles, italianos uff le queda mucho contenido a este juego."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-15,"tal vez sea una de las muy pocas personas menores 18 aos que les gusta esta saga, pero bueno a disfrutar aunque esperaba que la saga avance cronologicamente"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,este juego me gusta tanto que recuerdo haber descargado una version para los antiguos celulares cuando estos deban de instalarse con un archivo .jar de java.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"justo lo estoy jugando y la campaa es muy buena, lo recomiendo."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-03,"lo que me confunde es, en que tiempo est situado histricamente? ya que de aoe 2 a aoe 3 el salto es enorme, pero en este juego vuelven a los arcos y flechas, donde qued la plvora y los caones?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-02-20,"yo lo conoci hace 25 aos el juego y me sigue gustando, la parte que describes las batallas, como...metro pantitln a la hora pico ja ja ja!! vaya que si..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-11-07,no lo quiero.... no lo quiero.... lo necesitoooo!!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-13,"para ser sinceros, cuantas pcs se quedarian obsoletas si tuviesen que maniobrar decenas de unidades o hasta centenas, graficamente me parece hermoso, y de aspecto retro, que igual lo que se busca es la inmersin, y con tanta estrategia uno se queda muy pegado poniendole atencion a no morir y avanzar que los graficos dan igual."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-08-24,cmo fan de la saga siempre que tengo un compu y tiempo libre voy a un vdeo de hace mucho tiempo para descargar el age of empires 2 conqueros as que ver el cuatro con el modo un jugador es bastante gratificante aunque si espere un poco ms de la ltima entrega pero lleg una expansin espero que de mucho ms contenido y historia
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-06,"q hermoso el rodri , un gustazo volverlo a encontrar otra vez !!!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-16,no entiendo como decidieron hacerlo mas caricatura y no realista. se hubiera visto genial
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-12,alguien recuerda una imagen filtrada de una evolucin de aoe donde en el 4 vena un soldado moderno? eso siempre hizo que algunos fans esperramos una temtica moderna para el 4. pero supongo que aoe no est listo para ese estilo.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-02-14,hoy lo compre... pero mismo hoy jugue al red alert 2 jajaja que viejo me hace sentir
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"si actualmente no tienes ningn aoe vale ms la pena comprarse alguna de las remasterizaciones, que son ms completas y actualmente estn en descuento a precios de risa, y esperar a que el iv tenga expansiones para sentir ms novedad."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-04,"yo se que le falta a este juego... es la defensa esas murallas y edificios caen en muy rpido... en age 2 puedes jugar defensivo o ofensivo, aqu el en age 4 solo es ofensivo... y otra cosa que les cuesta poner la cmara alejada !!!! es 3d porfavor"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-10-28,pregunta age of empire es solo poca medieval o tambin evoluciona como en civilization? solamente jugu civilizatin v
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-18,"yo lo jugue en el ao 2001 tenia 13 aos, lo disfrute como nunca, ahora con 35 ya lo comprare. me trajo nostalgia comprar esto."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-21,"se qued muy corto este juego. prefiero jugar el 3, el 2 y el 1 as como el mythology. para sacar el age 4, hubieran tomado como referencia el empire earth que tiene una ia terrible, psima y mejorarlo obviamnete, porque ese abarca todas las edades, desde la edad de piedra hasta la nano edad, dcadas en el futuro. pudieron bien empezar con pocas edades y luego ir agregando ms y ms culturas o civilizaciones. por ejemplo, en la edad de cobre no podra haber facciones britnicas, pero habra sumerios y asirios, etc. las facciones britnicas solo se podran jugar a partir de la edad feudal."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-08-27,"dices que no asombra??? pues yo me quede maravillada, enamorada y felizota jajaja yo lo jugaba cuando tenia 8, ahora tengo casi 30"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-11,"se me hace muy listo que pusieran documentales, me acuerdo que fue gracias al aoe2 conoci a los freelancers en la enciclopediab fue muy buena idea"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-18,"a ver seores... quien no lo quiera admitir, age of empires es si bien un juego, tambin una herramienta pedaggica para la enseanza de la historia."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-10,"lo que no entiendo es el hecho de que no contine la lnea de tiempo de sus antecesores, se supone que debera ambientarse a mediados y finales del siglo xix..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-14,gracias a age of empires hoy soy historiador
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"se entiende que cuenta con campos mejorables, de eso no hay duda, pero teniendo en cuenta que viene de la mano de xbox estoy muy seguro de que el juego ser pulido tanto que dejar satisfechos a los jugadores ms exigentes  y eso es lo que yo espero"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-08,yo siempre e deseado un age of empire en poca moderna

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-29,"no lo he jugado, pero yo siempre quise que el age of empire tuviera su modo de conquista, a lo total war... uno elegirse a una nacin e ir por la conquista del mundo, amrica, etc."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-08-24,creo que le falt algo que se puede resumir en una sola palabra epicidad
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"en resumen, no es perfecto pero es un buen juego de age of empires."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-20,"juego altamente divertido, emocionante, competitivo y con un alto conocimiento de estrategia. buenisimo !"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-01,why does this guy always get so many dislikes? he sounds so nice and happy talking about the game and i always see his videos with loads of dislikes anyone knows what's up?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"as a long time aoe fan, for the most part i'm loving the game. the videos in campaign make me feel like a kid watching the history channel when it was good and showed actual history. the quality in those videos alone make getting the game on gamepass more than worth it for me personally. game wise, i'm pretty happy with the formula, and provided they continue to build on it, i see a great future for the game. some simple fixes i'd like to see would be a auto scout button being added to the scouts, treaty modes being included in the game, map mods and custom map making abilities, higher pop cap, why are we still stuck on 200? make the idle villies button more noticeable, and allow my to rotate buildings this may be a feature i just haven't worked out yet. the method from aoe3 of hitting shift and scrolling doesn't though, and i've yet to find any alternative."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-02,"i love your enthusiastic way of talking, really engaging"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-28,just started playing and i think this was what i needed.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-24,you start a new match! 200 of enemy archer and riders comin to get you
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"i have some constructive criticism if you are open to it. i think it would be worth noting how important distance of travel is to resouce gathering. in your video your villagers traveled much further than what is optimal. the problem with this is that your deer were likely producing food rates equal to berries or even farmland. it is wise to set up a mill in these situations. a seemingly small change in strategy such as that can really turn the tides for a new player which this tutorial is geared for. in addition, i think it cannot be understated just how important free sheep are. they can be returned to the base for optimal distance to resource gathering thereby freeing up wood resources which is crucial for someone who is starting out. be well."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-08,lost me when he sent villagers toward deer and not sheep.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,so... we learned not to gather food from far away without a mill nearby like you did. thanks.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-28,my best starting strategy is 6 on sheep close to the center and scouting and generating workers worker number 7 build house worker 8 build logging camp worker 9 mine from there ill send new half half to food and gold until age 2 and before progressing to age 2 upgrade all economic buildings
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-24,love this guy. thx btw it helped alot i just recently started playing the game.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-14,i wouldve also had mentioned and made use of the market in the feudal age. one of the most important buildings
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-10-12,thanks so much! i'm new to aoe and this was very helpful.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-06,my first ever time playing age of empires and the first video i click on first word you say is kia ora i must have been meant to play this game kia ora bro
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"great video! already knew everything in the video, just here impatiently waiting for the game to finish downloading"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-30,"based on your strategy, the ai on intermediate is going to send units within minutes during the feudal age and destroy your whole village. you have no military"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-17,"thanks man, new to the game, helped a lot."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"kia ora brother, keen to get into the game. thanks for the knowledgeable input!"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-23,hi dude how to start the game from the first plzz made a video for that start from the menu where to go im relly lost
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,i can play and 1v1 the hardest level ai in aoe3 but literally aoe4's intermediate and even easy are annoyingly difficult for their namesake. easy on aoe4 plays like moderate on aoe3. it's insanity. i have friends that have beaten extreme 1v1 in aoe3 that can't 1v1 hard on aoe4. it's insanity. it's going to take some getting used to.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-21,"newbie at the game, as in i just downloaded it for the first time ever. pray me well."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-19,041 what happened to jumbos voice over the last year!? a year ago it was less stewie griffin and more schwartzenegger!?

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-20,"you do know you can send the sheep back without the scout, right?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-16,i just picked up this game. thank you for the little simple instruction but man i never seen a game community this bad since league of legends people are so salty and toxic
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-22,not really up to spec for good start sorry. best to start new players off with solid advice on timing and being efficient.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,dude sounds like stewie griffin
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-04-09,i'm having a very hard time transitioning from aoe3 to aoe4. especially because i can't distinguish units and buildings
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-31,"i like your enthousiasm, but you have some strange intonation and sudden volume changes that makes it hard for me to listen without cringing a little."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-11,i really like the way you made this video by showing us step by step in real time.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,thanks for the help jumbo
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-29,"looks like i have the early game down, but in the mid game the intermediate new player here ai shows up with a way bigger military in the mid game and wipes me."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-02,nice advice. but there is no reason you shouldn't start farming your barries right away. the thing that bothered me
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-31,does age of empires 4 only have story mode or a free mode where i can battle ai 1v1? which mode are you playing?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-13,just staring. one question why am i gaining experience? do levels do anything? or is it just a display of how much of my life i'm wasting?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-09-07,what is a seekind or macking around?

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-10-29,"i was extremely excited for this game because i played aoe 1,2,3 and i loved them. aoe 4 left a sour taste in my mouth. i like to seat down, relax and enjoy building an empire but the ai as soon as i started my skirmish. i made 10 villagers and 4 farms and within 10 minutes in the game. i am getting battalions of enemies rushing my town when i barely started farming. lol ai is op! i am disappointed! don't buy this crap."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-16,why do you talk like that?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-01-05,"old school age player here, this game is amazing. the way they mix real footage with ingame footage is magical. its another level of immersion into the battles. a"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-19,"bruh i remember being like 7 or 8 and playing the first age of empires, watching the opening scene for the first time and falling absolutely in love with the game. i'm not a pc gamer at all but went and specifically got a gaming laptop when i heard aoe iv was coming out."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-07,"wow, absolutely amazing graphics for a more than a decadelong awaited video game! i never thought i will live the day that i will get to see age of empires iv released, but here it is, absolutely amazing! i just love this, thank you so much for sharing your experience with aoe iv. you're an amazing player, keep up the good work, all the best and much health indeed!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-05-15,really nice vid. cheers. 2 tips 1. select the villagers you want to garrison for their safety then click seek shelter and they go automatically. once defended you can click the return all to work button in the town centre. then every garrisoned villager from every building will auto go back to what they were doing. 2. build a windmill then to build the fields after clicking the build fields button multi click on the windmill itself and they will auto place around it. im sure there are loads more!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-07,i cant believe i just watched for an hour and a half...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-10-09,"never thought i would enjoy watching age of empires this much, but the way you play is absolutly brilliant and fun to watch"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-05-14,"i enjoy watching people play aoe nowadays rather than playing it myself since i easily panic when my stuff are being attack. but damn, the graphics are so much better now"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-08-04,war... war never changes
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-03-17,this was a really great game especially if you had the expansion pack and you love to play in scenario mode where you could set up a limited number of troops and get unlimited number of resources at just play out the scenario. it was really really cool because you could have all types of buildings and castles everywhere
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-08,"what he shouldve done was built walls around the sacred spots then built towers, then a gate and a military building to get more soliders. cuz you would keep some soliders inside the walls and then got a monk to capture them. keep some villagers as well to rebuild the towerswalls if they are damaged. then just defend. lose soliders you just get more. pretty simple. they havent changed much from aoe 12. just better graphics and game seems smoother. havent played but remember the mechanics of this game bc i played a lot of 1 and 2 in the past."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-02-10,lucky player. usually players attack at 6 minutes in . ai at 15 . you were able to just sit back economically because of that not happeneing. a rare occurrence in this game .
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-03,nice walls and keeps around sacred sites. game looks amazing!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-05,you could have build some barracks or archery range near sacred sites that would be really helped btw loved your strategy of playing
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-13,i really hope they add the option for a higher pop cap..
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-03,a 3 town centre opening is a strange strategy for sure with british. but it seemed to work out here.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-08-22,"this looks fun. how far can you advance your technology in this game? i swear someone told me about a game a few years ago that in skirmish mode, you start out at the lowest tech level, which was medievalish like this, but during the really long games you could upgrade your tech far enough that you could build modern units and even futuristic ones."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-09-04,"i know im 6 months late, but this video is really great, perfect format for build orders, you deserve way more subscribers"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,just getting into aoe4 and already bought it. trying to get my friends to get it too. people are crazy for saying it's too expensive... dlc is cheaper than a single skin in most of the games out there.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,shocking that sultans ascend is the same price as this since that came with a campaign and six factions. shows how great that dlc was
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,i just started playing about a month ago but coming from mostly fps games with 25 dollar singular weapon skins seeing people this up in arms about a 7 dollar dlc is honestly refreshing
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"coming from destiny 2 and its dlc prices, this is a steal xd"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"if you want the game to continue in development with only 10k average playerbase, buy the dlc. this supports the devs."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,people complaining about 13 dlc is crazy. the company needs to break even on these dlcs t keep the patches and new content rolling
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,prepurchased and ready to go! o7 i really hope support for the game can get us more of great content in the future.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"love the game, happy to buy the dlc and support the devsgame. can't wait for 8. april."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"i began to play aoe 4 after watching your channel. man this game is so beautiful, bgm is awesome. i am not gonna go back to starcraft lol. i even have tons of fun just playing with ai building a city"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,i bought it even tho i dont even play much aoe4. for the simple fact that i dont care for the money and i want to support the only rts that still gets actual content!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"by the way, some of these units in templar arsenal, you can see in the sultan campaign e.g. mission with assassins."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,maa in black clothing are probably knight hospitallers.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,"i live in brazil, here in reais it costs r46 reais converted from the value of the american dollar, that's like buying 2 hamburgers, i honestly found it cheap, but there are a lot of people complaining, but they waste money on a lot of junk. i believe that we should value those who are working to do this job, i honestly think it's a fair price for the time that producers spend on the computer and often sleeping badly to create something new for us players, my humble opinion! a brief observation even though i'm a newbie, but these variants are very beautiful and seem to be promising for new future civilizations!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,the last dlc was just a bargain price to breathe new life into the game. this is definitely a reasonable price.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"seems like a anti siege pao pao, which would make sense because why have a siege unit on a defensive building, and the ships seem to be shooting trebs as well and not bombardscannons"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"preordered already, 15 is a steal for how much we all play the game. you can buy 1 overwatch cash shop skin for 15 why are people that upset lol."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"imagine trying to devalue a 15 euro dlc, mate if any of you go out and spend 15 euro on anything edible, you poop it out in a few hours, money gone forever. the dlc aint leaving you bruv. i mean if you're broke you're broke though."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,ez purchase. thank you beasty. keep doing what youre doing!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,people are crazy for wanting civilisiation dlcs for 10 or less. sultans ascend was at least 10 cheaper than it should have been.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,this looks absolutely awesome! so psyched! i've preordered though i won't preorder the next one if it's also the same price for only 2 variants1.5 civs
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,its funny how they released everything live during beastys stream lol.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"to me who is from a poor country... well maybe i have to wait some more to get this dlc for sale, just like the sultan one... i've just bought the ultimate version 2 days ago tks to spring sale."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,poggers for twitch chat
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,15 dullars completely alright if we're looking at the price politic in games in general
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,"i salt  mald, but i do hope you  your loved ones stay safe  sound. take care"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"already bought it, excited af, ppl are broke in these comments"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,"has legs and walks around, haha, idk why i found that so funny. legendary content as usual though, keep it up"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"would like to know and more importantly see more details about the civs, before having to preorder for the 15 sale."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,he said 'its fine' 139 times in this video but i'm still not convinced.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,with the sale discount i got it for aud17 in australia. just under 10 euro. about right i think
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,its more than it 'should be' given that they will release another expansion this year that will also be 15 eurosusd etc. but the amount of time i play aoe4 it is easily worth the money.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"sultans ascend was grossly under priced, lets be honest. i'm personally happy to pay for dlc, i want aoe4 to survive and it will only survive if it makes money. there are games with mirco transactions, lootboxes, battle passes, gatcha mechanics like honestly to the people that are complaining here.... what are we even talking about? it's not a case that 1215 is expensive for this dlc, it's 1215 was a fucking steal for sultans ascend. plus these devs gave us malian and ottomans for free, they've been so good to us i think they are well within their right to ask for a bit more money here 4 years after the games come out."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,15 isn't bad
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,my opinion on the prizing take ma monneh an gimme that thang
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"finally, after buying this dlc i can play in the name of... powerwolf song during the matches! joke you can laugh."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,i'm really digging this dlc tbh.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,stier grand finals on hedgemaze when?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,obviously 15 is kinda rough when you look at the sultan's ascend dlc in comparison. that said its still not much for me and i will definitely buy it if i see something i like. so far idk....im one of those variant civ haters i guess.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,what we really need is the ability to connect walls to keeps
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,"7 for russia, keeping in mind that i bought it from reseller 1020 higher price than on steam. even like that its veeery cheap. going to local mcdonald's for one time i'll spend more money."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,42 dollars for me. with discount. well not really but basically is how it feels traslated to my currency.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,black man at arms are st john order
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,"perfect. new civs, new maps, 15 eur. comon guys. 2 beers are more expensive."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,knights templar so the knights' with the red cross on them teutonic knights the knights with the black cross and the the knights in black are the knights hospitaller so that covers the three major knight orders of the crusades and makes sense
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,willing to pay 15 because we want more future content. costs money to develop this stuff.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,lots of red units do have the debuff
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,not as good as sutans ascend but iam gonna buy it later in april. from all these civs they could add they choose to add the same variant civs we already had
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"if you get enough enjoyment from the game, 15 for a dlc is nothing. just dont eat a big mac meal for a day. the dlc is healthier for you."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"to pre order in north america its only 12.75, people spend more than that at taco bell. so in my eyes people are complaining just to complain. you y'all just love love and love to complain. what are you complaining about?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,15 is fina as long as the maps arent shit but the maps look shit lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,maybe when it goes on sale and even then it's a maybe
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"regarding the pricing, aoe is a specialist game, it's not like cod you can't put cheap prices knowing it's going to sell aoe needs to be pricier and all you aoe fans should support the game n help it grow"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-21,i would rather pay the price of this dlc versus spending double on a game i'll play for 10 minutes and regret
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,554 what is that moving tower thing? i've never seen that before...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-21,are we not getting a ptb before release?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,me as a south african and a south african steam account getting the dlc for r200 10 euros
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,the price is fair for a game that doesn't rely on microtransactions. i'd say we got a bargain on sultan ascend dlc.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"looks amazing, though. it'll be worth every penny"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,oh it's sima yeasty
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,don't think any of us can complain about the 15 price...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,ulala !
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,222 the reaction i want from my gf but don't deserve
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,as someone that is mostly interested in the singleplayer aspect of the game this dlc is really underwhelming. i wished for something completely new like the lithuanians or the spanish but just more central european knights... not that exciting
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"sultans ascend was way too underpriced that's the problem with this dlc. funny enough the new dlc is more expensive than sultans ascend in south africa. my only complaint is this dlc only have variant civs. i know i know the templars are almost a new civ, but but but just bring out masteries for variant civs please."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"they're selling themselves so short man, i think we could definitely pay a little more if it supports a game and franchise that we all love"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,it would seem walls connect to keeps now
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,im definitely not happy with the price but i will be playing it on 8th nonetheless
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,just bought 9 copies.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,yay
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,what is a sabaton?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,where's my gamers?!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,i love how beasty still can't read maps at all lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,its 6.37 for me lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,omg i don't get it. 15 euro is like nothing? i am not rich at all but what do people expect?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,is he trolling with the debuff talk?? its the poison arrows!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,i just hope they can improve the ai at some point. it is so brutally bad.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"devs simply need to understand that we dont give a single f u c k about the campaings and shit, civs is where the value of the dlc is and it should be priced accordingly"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,im shocked that people atill consider knights templars as a veriant and they dont understand that its called veriant only because it lowera the cost... they literally said it has nothing in common with french
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,naw wait for the other dlc dont do a subathon for this shit lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,15 is a coke and a sandwitch or 10 baguettes in france. this is a lot of content compared to some stupid 15 skin in a live service game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,this dlc is still a bargain
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,why are people crying about change?? 15 bucks is nothing....a subway sandwich fr
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,15 usd for 2 variant civ lmao
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"one more voice in the choir, but 15 dollars for 2 civs, a few replayable campaign missions, and no significant gameplay changes when they set the bar at about 3 bucks per civ and a massive free balance update with the last dlc is bonkers lmao. there are a billion ways to monetize content customizable announcers, unitmap skins, base cosmetics and doodads that wouldn't discourage casual players from reinstalling and they picked doubling down on making the new playable content the part where you have to break out the wallet."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,cant wait! the negative nancies can go play sc2 if they dont like paid dlcs
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"bruh its 7.49 regular price and 6.37 with the discount, this is indeed a robbery"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,damn
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-20,no gamerssss?! this shi lame as hell gtfohhhhhh
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,dafuq why does it cost more than the first dlc? heck ottoman and malians were free

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,i think this game is dead.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,fak variants
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-19,"sa is already 50 off, i'm only willing to buy the new dlc on such discounts"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-24,i find it insane how ootd right now has the best win rate in every single rank except for conq iv which is essentially pro level or close to it. but then in conq iv it has a really bad win rate in comparison. this shows you just how this is a totally different game in different ranks. i personally am a pleb who constantly dies to ootd because i can't help underestimating their army strength and lose my entire army due to the fact that they have high value units and i can't judge fights against them to save my life.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-09,"thanks for your videos! long time aoe player back in the day, coming back now and getting into aoe 4  love it so far!"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-25,i play delhi i really like how you have a narrative to follow get the sacred sites finish the job or go castle have at least 20 scholars before imperial and stuff like that it's like you always have side quests to follow which is very satisfying any suggestions on civs which may follow the same narrative ?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-24,i can't wait for the new civs

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-04,as february is already in can we get some news on the next dlc for aoe4?? do we have to wait till feb 12th the end of season 9??! we need info and a release date

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-24,literally an epidemic of maphacking in this game. not saying in solo but if you wanna chill and play 3v34v4 its rife
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-24,"we need the legendary heavy serbian knights in the ottoman army ! look at history, they play a big role."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-24,guaymers
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-24,"what civilization would you recommend for beginners, or stategy ?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-24,it's not  tier list i hte you
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-24,the comparison is false mongols are not like mosquitoes i never get killed by mosquitoes
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-24,i play the main menu civ because the game still crashes nonstop
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-08,i play on xbox so i dont stand a chance against pc players
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-24,why is ottoman not played by pro players?. because so slow to age iv and feudal fight so weak. and and and this important. all civs sources buff limits 100.000 sources limit. but the advantage of the ottomans was military schools that worked based on population and gave free soldiers. ottoman loses all buffs its features at 200 pop. why why why. why. no professional player chooses the ottoman in nomad mode.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-04,"video for new players, but new players lack context of 2 tc, castle rush, all in, for them it is unknown terminology. so i feel like video is not helpful for real newcomers."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-25,beasty aoe2 is so much better. time to switch over
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-24,we need new civs this game is so boring just with these civs
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-25,most boring rts game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-16,what does pro scouting mean?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-16,"playing almost everyday with friends, dont care wat peoplr say. matchmaking is within a minute anytime. sounds not dead to me."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-05,been playing it again over the past few days and i can't stop thinking about it. i just want to learn all the civilizations.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-30,this is the first strategy game i ever played.. just started a few days ago and i love it
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-19,"it launched with zero support for game settings, aoe 1 gave you more control over the lobby settings lmao"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-03,"i thought age of empire iv had a great launch and was much more focused on competitive multiplayer. a lot of the aoe2 pros moved to aoe4 due to the emphasis on competitive play. aoe2 remains popular because it's fantastic, has great gameplay and graphics, still getting new content, and 95 of players are extremely casual"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-27,the issue is most of aoe fans lack the computer to run it. so they stick with aoe2
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-29,"those stats are from steamdb, im assuming that doesnt account for game pass players, that probably make up the majority considering it has been free there since release?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-23,we need age of mythology retold
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-04,"wow, what is this unit? literaly the sipahi from age 3"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-05,age of empires 3 and heroes 3 might and magic will live in my heart.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-13,the king never was is dead. long live the king aoe2
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-18,i think they missed the opportunity to make a more realistic rather than cartoonized style. would be better to have more simple graphics but a dark atmosphere.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-24,do you know empire earth? master piece that forgoten by world
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-12,"given ai shenanigans at launch, it was the opposite. too much focus on competitive multiplayer in hopes it'll carry the game. but it's nice for the game to slowly make its niche... even if it gets weirder and weirder that each new aoe game has separate fanbase and they all exist simultaneously"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-06,i just like the old aoe2 just the whole game was great i dont like the 3d look or whatever it is
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-07,me who mains ottomans big cannon go boom to boat
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-21,"problem with age of empires 4 is it took them way too long to fix all those bugs, like the mongol tower rush, the springalds being spammed, water boats not working right list goes on. took them about a year to fix some of the most simple bugs and by then people went back to the more balanced games. it may have been all fixed now but the damage is done."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-13,boots up aoe2 hd 2013
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-26,i just started playing and i fell in love with how steep the difficulty curve is. i've never played rts games before so it's a lot all at once but that makes me more interested in it.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-24,2 newer civs and 4 variants with the expansion games great!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-24,age of empires 3 needs more recognition
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-08-15,the thing i find crazy about aoe games is that they are own fierce competition now
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-09,i just don't like how it look
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-18,"i wish it had more campaign missions. i love to play stories in every aoe. for me, aoe4 has the best voices and sound. i just love it."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-10-16,i think the missing thing about aoe4 to be more atractive is changing the hud and make the game more beauty in units and buildings icons and things like that
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-13,i think the best thing was the cutscenes but the balance and everything wasn't there. i mean aoe 2 still gets balancing to this day with the tweaking
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-26,aoe4 looks like so much cartooned to me
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-06,in vietnam aoe 1997 still as popular as when it came out
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-17,"wtf is this? a generic medieval warrior riding a generic medieval horse, wielding a generic medieval weapon."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-17,opening a game up to modders are always a positive thing for the gaming community
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-25,"i started playing aoe4 when mali launched. its been my favorite rts, but with retold launching soon i'll probably switch to retold"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-04,aoe4 is a masterpiece and at any given hour theres minimum 10k people on 247
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-03,this game is a ton of fun but aoe 2 is just better. of course my opinion. i wish aoe 4 would have been aoe 2 remade basically. the super cartoons appeal to it is weird.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-30,aoe 3 looks a lot better
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-04,the campaigns were and still are the worst of every aoe title in my opinion. aoe3 and mythology showed what good campaign are.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-04,"wtf, modding as dead as ded rat in the empty fridge. btw, they still cant fix building hotkey menu, why the hell you need four letters to build?!!?! why qwer?! sum up same shit as was with some balance changes in 1vs1"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-17,theres numerous servers at any time of day.. problem is people get used to the old stuff. ive played aoe 14 and ill pick the 3rd and 4th over the others any day.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-26,real problem is lack of immersion. soldiers are taller than barracks.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-23,"is a trap, nothing is changed, the game has movie graphics, no physics, very simple mechanics, siege is a joke and one dimensional, buildings are smaller than units, castle spam, hre is even more boring than release, barely unique units and the ones are boring"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-28,that's a man on a horse with shield and mace
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-13,"it is still on my steam wish list. lately i picked return of rome for aoe2, so this one has to wait a bit longer ."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-05,started playing about 3 months ago. played a fuck ton of aoe3 with my dad. finally got him into aoe4. its been fun as fuck lol showing my 56 year old dad mods has been hilarious and amazing lol
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-15,"lack of attention to competitive gameplay  no mate that was the focus, the campaign was also dog poo. it was just a flat out rubbishrushed release."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-09-02,to allow for endless bug fixes we need first endless bugs
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-10,"even aoe falled into the trend of drop now, fix later"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-10,they really need to fix up the stats at the end of a game. it's sad that i have to go to aoe4 world after every game to check the details i want to see.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-23,i still play aoe3 as my main in series.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-06,"i just played it for the first. campaign is amazing! playing against the computer is challenging but fun. multiplayer is stupid. it's the same game every time, doesn't matter what civ you are. just stack resources as fast as possible. reach stage 3 then ram spam"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-25,have 3 buddies playing it now all of us are new to this game and have been having a blast
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-06,"aoe4 is not made by ensembles anymore, if youre 5 years old and enjoy watching cartoons, absolutely no physics, no authenticity then go relic aoe4. such a shame in aoe series"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-28,still needs more work on the multiplayer. like the addition of alliances and declaration of war so traders arent just randomly attacked
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-02-28,"i would love to play it, if i had a stronger computer."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-01,"it is too bad that there is no korean civilization called the kingdom of bows, the kingdom of mercury that has prevented thousands of invasions in 5,000 years. there is a famous saying. china is spear japan is sword korea is bow"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-27,"if you guys remember when aoe 3 was launched, oh god. but with time they fixed it thank god"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-20,aoe 3 de is the best of the series.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-16,"i used to play aoe 2 with my friends years ago 4 came out and we all bought it and didnt like it , we started playing it like 3 months ago and i must say the game feels nice."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-07,makes two sequels that literally cant scratch aoe2
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-01-31,"i just want aoeo back officially man. it was awesome, i still play it from time to time thanks to project celeste but it just isnt the same."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-29,with this childish cartoonlike style they messed up bigtime
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-29,it's a shame what a bad launch can do to a game.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-23,i think yall forgot the meaning of dead ive played dead games and this game is far from dead
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-31,aoe iv was dead on release. generally liked is an interesting euphemism though. aoe iv development was the laziest of any aoe game. it's just a shitty remake of aoe2.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-07,playing it almost everyday with my buddy against ai mainly ridiculous and sometimes outrageous and we are playing the megarandom map generator . its fun everytime and very unpredcitable
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-01,its amazing this game will never die ! we need a new age of empire ! a empire earth modern!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-21,"age 4 needed to be this good on or very shortly after release to pull people away for aoe2. it's missed it's window, which is a shame because i think it's core is an excellent refinement of aoe2 and possibly superior."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-27,my buddies and i just got into the game a couple of weeks ago and we havent stopped playing  getting us prepared for age of mythology
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-29,this game feels so much better without the broken springalds spam
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-01,i abandoned aoe4 multiplayer because i was playing byzantines and there was litterally no way to defeat the ottoman free units forever strategy. plus the bombard was broken as hell. still havent checked if they fixed it.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-13,"bro aoe 4 needs more content updates. more civs, more and new units, new mechanics"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-31,aoe4 is a good game. it's what we've always wanted because it plays like aoe2. the main issue is the music sucks. and they didn't continue improving the game
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-09-04,i hate the minimalistic icons for units buildings and upgrades
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-19,aoe 4 in under 2 years have more update than aoe 1 de in their entire lifespan
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-04,if game is dead then why ranked queue is faster than in csgo?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-27,people don't play rts games mainly for the single player campaigns nowadays. the devs of aoe4 should've known better.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-14,"balance wasnt issue, it was some quality of life features were missing and most of the people who bought the game came from different age titles, they didnt like the game, so they went back to their original game"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-15,looks too cartoony and more like a mobile game. they really should of went with the late 19th century to 1950 instead!! we already have a medieval era age of empires already!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-17,"thats not why i went back to aoe 2, aoe 2 came out on console and cross play with the homies is unbeatable"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-08-21,i never played it because you can't place buildings wherever you want
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-10-08,"once i saw what it really looked like, i was so disappointed. it would be awesome if the guys who made company of heroes and the original blizzard guys did an aoe game."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-07,aoe iv is the best game of franchise actually
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-12,they just mixed castle seige with aoe2 de
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-06,gamers who base the quality of the game on its multiplayer are the underclass of the gaming world
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-29,"i honestly thought the game was a step backwards, compared to the previous installment.. when it came to the campaigns. and hella leap backwards compared to it's origin predecessor. i'm glad that they understood that when they made 'the sultan's ascend'.. just wished they did it from the beginning."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-09,we wanted ww1 and ww2 for aoe4.... actual aoe4 is aoe2 reimagined or remake
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-26,what is this bigger bombard in your video? why doesnt anyone use it?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-26,it would be wonderful if every faction from every aoe were present in aoe4
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-30,just got it and me and the boys love it. just wish i could scroll around the map faster on console
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-06-11,no save in multiplayer  suck
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-07-06,"even age of empires 3 de received more updates and new civs and content in less time than age 4. 2 civs in 2 years is just not enough to keep the game interesting for most players... especially after the game released with less civs, maps and other content than any other age at release..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-19,its super fun. just switched from 2 to 4 recently
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-08-28,"i think the timeline reset in aoe4 killed it more than the lack of civs and campaigns. in aoe2, we have a lot of campaigns and time killers. in aoe3, we had a step forward in the timeline. which split people either for or against it. the fact that aoe4 restarted the time line withput really bringing anything ground breaking. besides up dated game play an civs. really has hurt the title im sonstoked aoe 24 are on xbox wish 3 was as well. fingers crossed the age of mythology console port isnt a flop."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-07-24,hope this game is available for mac so that mac user can play it in steam
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-02-19,that is not an average of 16k on that graph
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-06-16,as a massive update comes out over 8k was using steam charts
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-04-11,"people stuck on aoe 2, and they hate aoe 4 because their pc specs"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-09-03,no balance for siege tho which is the biggest issue
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-28,i am a gamer in korea. what can i say among koreans? it felt like they were giving the game as a bonus if they purchased a medieval documentary.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-15,they need to do a mapscenario creator like back in the day. where you can build the landscape easily and copy paste as much stuff as you want on the map. the new stuff sucks.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-08-02,23 min ques play with bros everyday we love it
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-05-10,all they needed to do was keep the same game mechanics and upgrade graphics with civilizations. aoe2 was basically perfect
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-25,"a micro guide would be good, but mostly what interests me is your key bindings. as in how do you quickly split a blob of springalds into 4 to shoot at different mangonels or if you harass with cav, how do you split your formation into two bound groups quickly to go into opposite directions, etc"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-10-20,"i am new to rts and still don't have the confidence to play pvp, but your guides are really encouraging and gives me hope that some day i might win atleast 1 pvp game!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-25,"not a lot of micro guides out there, would much appreciate one. keep it it up beasty you da man!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-02-26,triangle formation is good for charging archers as the front units with get overkilled and allow you to get on top of the archer line
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-25,"a guide that could be super handy, is perhaps on how to attack into someone booming early. my biggest struggle would be say for example playing delhi against abassid, and they have 2nd tc up almost immediately, by the time i even get a raider to their base, and it becomes extremely difficult to disrupt them from that point. or perhaps get around knightarcher from french into answering their 2nd tc, there has to be a way to practically deal with this, unless its just 2tc myself and then work into rams. but there's probably different approaches for different civs."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,this game is just really advanced rock paper scissors
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-25,"beastyqt explains units strengths and weaknesses, how to counter specific army compositions and more. me, an hre main noob with my composition of pikemen, men at arms, landsknhechts and prelates, melting everything in my general direction i'mma pretend i didn't see that"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,the real guide is the gold players in the comment section
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-25,ty very helpful. but i came here because my army and base got ate by elephant.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,"micro guide would be awesome, please do make it beasty"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-25,"how about a guide to decision making? pointing out for every civ what the key scouting points are. example scout mongols at 400 and at 630. when you see no gold at 400 then expect a if you see 2 on gold then b etc... so telling us when its important to scout, what we might see and what our reaction should be. i struggle that when i scout at a random time and see a random barrack to know what the meening of that is. if its normal to have a barrack at that time ,if its so early that it shows intend to rush etc... hope you know what i mean. a how to scout and react against each race would be awesome. sorry from germany so my englisch sucks"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-25,"you could do a macro tips vid where you talk about how to minimize worker travel, how many vills to use to construct buildings. quick walling etc."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,man have i been waiting for this. thanks!!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-25,"very educational, im still very bad at aoe, thanks beasty!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-02,you're the best beasty!!! keep up the great work!!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,this is the content i need.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-26,amaaaziing!!! we needed it. thanks!!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-11-07,"ootd main here and in the silver elos my 10 men at arms, 5 crossbowmen, and 2 ram army comp has been wreaking havoc lol"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-09,"this is mildly off topic, but i just wanted to say how fun it is to command large numbers of units in this game. my friends in i like to play a custom gamemode we made called total war, where we get a short time to make our eco peacefully without rushing before all heck breaks loose. we also have the max pop limit at 10,000 much to our consoles dismay, so battles are massive in scale, this makes army composition far more important and positioning and formation just as much. once had a 600 v 600 battle and it was insane"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-23,ty so much beasty
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,basically the feudal rock paper scissor combos are cav spear  cav archer  archer spear and then the castle rock paper scissors goes knight horsemen  maa archer  crossbow spear. horsemen being interchangeable with mangonel and crossbow being interchangeable with hand cannoneers.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-12-09,can you do a guide on what tech should i be prioritizing in each age? esp as english. thanks
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,can you do a map guide? if not a map by map analysis at least a general strategy for the different play styles and civs.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-03-11,nice tutorial!

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-25,good guide.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,"beastyqt what kind of keyboard do you use? wanting to step up my ranked play but micro is lacking. using mini huntsman, finding it difficult to key bind micro battle with it. thinking of switching to full but not trying to invest into one if its not needed. thanks"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-25,"what about ram spam? my most sucessful strategy has been knightshorse archers rus into imperial ram spam from the high armory. i've notieced a large majority of people can't respond to it well due to how supply effecient rams are. they either focus on my knightshorse archers and i start to kitedistract while the rams lay waste to their base, or they go after my rams and they can barely even hurt the rams before my army gets rid of them. it's very wood dependent but i dump almost all my vills on wood and kinda just allin and it almost always works for me. but what is the counter? this comp wins me games against people that are way above my elo and i feel no other strategy comes close to feeling this op. i notice most people start spamming spears into this and try to micro into destroying rams while also fighting knights if they get close, but the horse archers punish them as soon as they focus on rams and it's really easy to just kite around if spears start trying to fight the cav. sometimes if the enemy has something ridiculous like really heavy gunpowder it fends me off but for the most part the rams are just overwhelming and overrun everything. i would like to know the official counters so i know what to look out for once i see people who really know the counterplay."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-24,i never understood aoe counters. knights are killing my infantry. infantry are killing my archers. and archers are killing my knights.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,you can basically counter every unit comb. knights and handcanoneers get countered by spears and mangos.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,"as an english player, i find it very hard to fight against knight civ like france generally, hosemanarchers, since micro of spearlongbow is much harder than bowsknights. france archers can just f2a the floor, although shooting spearman is better, but with low apm, shooting at longbows is still worth it. keep knights running between two forces can tank auto attack longbows but english should constantly moving spearman back and forth to protect both archers and spearmans, while targeting archers to shoot at enemy archers. and also the ratio between longbows and spearmans1 barrack or 2? you need to scout are hard to maintain, you should prepare enough spearman to prevent france knight rush, but also enough longbow to threaten france archers or knights will just hover around and keep his archers moving forward, which force you to retreat just wonder will it be better if i go with horsemanspear or horsemanless speara little longbows?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,i think it would be helpful if there was an input map on the screen showing what keys you press on the keyboard
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-30,according to this explanation if you don't have feudal maa then there is no counter to feudal longbow spear that's why i don't think it's entirely accurate. i believe the knight archer does counter archerlongbow spear.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-07,do you have a build order guide for feudalcastle?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-16,"yeah the question no one answered, how to counter horse archer. and i mean the whole strategy not just which unit counter the best"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-25,wait so if i a move horsemen and select enemy archers they will only attack archers? i thought they kill the unit you select and then attack whatevers closest
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,i wonder how to counter rus knights and cav archers? theoretically cav archers are countered by archers. but cav archers can simply run away from them. and spears are killed by cav archers.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-11-07,you missed a huge point. some civ have menatarm at feudal. and you don't have crossbow then. how do you counter that with abbasid for exemple ? i mean there are civ that have nor maa nor knight at feudal.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-26,but what to do vs mass firelancer handcannon from china?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,"i started with chinese when the game released, because i love defensive playstyle with walls and towers. but the civ felt kind of lacking in early game and lacks resources in late game. i also don't really like the tax collector system. lately i've been learning french but not a fan of how easily they get countered by spears. what would you recommend? i was thinking going maybe hre, or dehli or abbasid. but maybe with the new civs things will get better. i'm not convinced i want to give the devs any more money though the game was expensive af and they didn't deliver on a good map editor which was the main thing i was waiting for all along. the map editor we have is super laggy on my low specs and hard to use overall i just want something simple to paint landscape and chill not a full game studio tool... i hope the new maps will be good, i am all for more landscape tactics, i downvote all the flat maps lol. i also wish they would let people queue larger maps in multiplayer for instance large map in 1v1. ps with french i struggle to match my opponent in production speed vs strength of unit and very often my troops die a lot faster than my opponent's which keeps me on production timer while getting rolled over. it's not even a resources issue i play coc economy very well but i really fall short in battles and my 30k stone walls are useless against one lil trebuchet if i can't contest forever. the royal knights are really bad at multi targetting they get in the way of each other a lot i find playing with archers and siege a lot stronger. the micro guide would help me for sure. map specific main strategies overview and tips would be a nice series too."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,how to counter elephant?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-09-24,"if u get infinite amount of resources and like 100 production buildings fighting in a choke point, ottoman prob always win, cuz their infinite great bombards and they never die, they got infinite lancers to shield their bombards, infinite jannisary to repair their bambards, and infinite mangos  springs ribaus to combo with bombards. their seige combo kills everything. even chinese seige can't beat those infinite great bombard combo cuz chinese seige got heavily nerfed, chinese bambard range tech got replaced and health got halved. nest of bees only get 8 range which is shorter than mangos. when ottoman get infinites resources, they kill everything, it doesnt matter what u make. springs and antiseige cannot do anything when they got that mass. before u springs can do real damage, their great bombardsmangosribaus already killed hundreds. even u get like 40x srpings vs 30x great bombards or 40x mangos, same population, u will lose. and knights cannot even get pass their frontline, not to mention they have mether buffs."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-27,be curious how manually spreading the vills after the mill could improve it even more
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-17,the best is to make them build 2 by 2 but you have to be strong in micromanagement and in clicks per second for and be precise on your clicks
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-28,"by the time all 8 farms were built, my vills dropped 90 food, so this is a really good tip, thanks!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-07,what i do is since i mainly grab vils from my wood to transition into farms. i have my select 1 wood vill as ctrlw. create the blue print for the farm and just spam ctrlw and right click on each farm. every vill plants their own farm. and i have the last one do the mill
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-31,very tippitietop top of the crop tip
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-21,i thought it was still more effective due to having vills collecting food as more are being built?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-02-09,"thanks u, i havent idea of this"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-03,"yeah just like aoe 2, i assumed this would be faster. nice to get it confirmed."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-19,i'm learning just now why haven't i laid my food plots like that
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-17,i always send 1 to mill and 7 to build farms that way all farms complete and villagers gather food and once full the mill completes in time for drop off.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2024-12-28,"i'm not sure i got your explanation, so i had to test it. basically you do the same thing, building the mill then shift click to get the 8 farms and then, while having the 8 vills selected, you just right click on one of the farms. the vills will start building the farms and once a farm is built a vill will stay behind and start working on it."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-02-13,will this keep me from getting wiped in feudal before i even have a troop made?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-17,more like this please
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-17,this is helpful
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-05-04,but how does this work exactly? you put mill and all the farms in que queue with shift click and then you just right click on the mill?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-01-07,great tip

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,"curious about any factions in particular? i've got notes for them all, just planning my order of approach, so comment away and let me know. don't forget to check out the rest of the playlist  httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vbmavzwtbsqklistplwvfthdwadhnlpfz3buciez0tjsljspl to see what's already up. enjoy!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,"one of the most op things about rus are ... springalds. high armory has a unique upgade to their range. this allows players with good micro to outrange and kill enemy siege units before they can do anything. many top players already noted this practically uncounterable lategame composition mass streltsy, a couple of warrior monks with relics to chase off melee with convert and springalds to deal with enemy siege units, which in theory should have been a counter to that."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,"regarding overlapping hunting cabins, there's no reduction to the gold per minute gained unless the influence of a cabin overlaps with another cabin itself, not the cabin's influence  then it's reduced to 0. so long as you're not placing cabins too close to each other you're actually incentivised to overlap them to make the most of your forests"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-12,"the way you structure and organize your guides is the reason you are my goto. so concise, so logical, keep up the stellar work brother."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-22,this one is great! thank you!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-19,"also, as a rus player, i get up to 46 scouts on dark age for hunting and harass, 6 scouts can kill a villager that aint near the tc, you can deny resource collecting and even destroy some buildings, one match, i saw a english player trying to make a dock  lumbercamp oppening on a river map, he didnt seens intrested in sheeps after killing starting ones, so i got my scouts and started attacking his dock, forcing him taking villagers out of resources to counter, giving me more time to prepare for the longbow man rush, i got so much time more, that when i got to age 2 he just left."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-20,"this is some crazy russian trick, its not hunting cabin, they stamp coin inside."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-05-17,please continue this
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-16,don't know if its mentioned later in the video but while shiftclicking the deer with your scout is viable while eco'ing its certainly not optimal. you will want to use the cancel animation to quick fire the deer with your scouts or risk an enemy player taking more deer than you whether they are playing rus also or just trying to deny.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-07-25,"this civ is rated 2 star difficulty in game but it's harder to use than china because of how micromanagement intensive it is, very rewarding tho."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-08,honestly mass streltsy is extremely op. seriously they dont even need siege
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-05-24,"can you please cover the english faction next  especially for pvp play, thanks."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-02,so afaik saint's blessing gives your army the same bonus as camels do for the abbasids 11 armour and 2 damage 3 with the upgrade on top  though it excludes itself and only starts after their first attack though that could be against deer or sheep for the next 10 seconds 20 with upgrade. it should also affects allies so... that damage buff sounds great on units firing multiple low damage shots like zhuge nu or nest of bees potentially doubling their damage against heavily armoured units. does it affect buildings firing arrows too?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-11-08,"i love rus and strelcy. if only i can, i try to reach them as fast as possible and then i can make 24 kd."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-17,"spiff, i'm begging you, the next time you have an rts exploit with this level of busted for attack ranges, please use attack moves aclick usually so that your boys just sweep across the map like a glorious lawn mower."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-17,"little theory  if when you broke the game the range was 256, that is exactly 2 to the power of 8 , so probably an overflow problem. with 7 you were at 37.7, so 8 would be 65.4 and 9 would be 130.8. 10 would pass the 256 limit. soooo probably 9 is the max."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-17,"250 microwaves heat the water faster, so of course it's ok. yes it was thanks to the french we americans gained independence but it was also kind of the english military's own fault. they basically just walked around out in the open with bright easily spotted red coats, shooting them from cover was super easy barely an inconvenience."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-16,"312 and the brits would not had tea in the first place if the portuguese did not have traded that sad tea with china, plus the only reason tea is even popular in england is because of catarina de bragana a portuguese royalty who got married to king charles ii so welcome."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-17,"i have to say that this video was much better than the last one. this one has much more classic spiff with tea, mocking americans, and defeating the french."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-16,"love the aoe 4 content. keep breaking it's reality, i'm an american who drinks tea now."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-17,"sitting here with my cup of tea, except the tea was made in the microwave and the cup is actually a glass."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-16,when eastern europe is perfectly balanced with no exploits nor war crimes whatsoever?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-17,"apparently the 256x tech mod was so popular in aoe2 that relic decided to add it by default into aoe4. in all seriousness that fact that you can only pull this exploit off once for each tech adds an interesting possible dynamic for pvp. the more research buildings you can build the stronger a tech will be once you do research it, thus games would become about stalling getting each tech for as long a possible but if you wait too long you risk being overwhelmed by an opponent researching their techs earlier."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-16,super easy barely an inconvenience.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-16,i like that you're making these again.

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-17,"aoell is a beloved classic. aoelv is the one the rts genre needs. there's no path where comparing the two ends well, i'm sorry great tea lord, i beg of you to let me commit seppuku via invisible pointy stick bois."

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-16,"whilst watching this channel for over than a year ive noticed something irregular, not in the channel, but that society says that drugs aren't good for your health, some of them aren't even legal, and you know what, coffee is considered a drug, a stimulant, and everyone seems to turn a blind eye, unbeliavable, injustice, spiff is here so he can open your eyes, get you inspired by the queen and drop this addiction, so you can achieve it, something that is, well, completely balanced , trust me"

Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2022-02-03,the spiffing brut looking at spearmen ill make a ballistic missile out of you
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-17,when you just have finished a aoe4 game and the spiffing brit uploads a aoe4 exploit. you just made my day!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-16,watching you doubleclicking instead of pressing the upgrade key is something i would do as well.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-18,this man is so entertaining and likable. i have been bingewatching his videos for a week now!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-17,microwaving the water for tea sounds so much more convenient than using the stove top. thanks for the tip.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-16,american here. what's wrong with microwaving water for tea?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-17,the microwave tea part was funny lmfao
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-16,hahahah i'm literally drinking microwave tea as i watch this.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-17,"make sure the french can't make a team and be perpetualy angry at each others as french, this is perfectly and culturaly correct"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-16,"i use a kettle to boil water when making tea, but i drink coffee more often because i'm not british lol"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2021-12-17,"as an american, i laughed. vive la france! where is my microwave? oh no! spear boys in the next county are aiming for me!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2023-03-15,im sorry as an american i agree with you on the fact that microwaved tea is stupid
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"lol, drongo most excited about english variant civ, then proceeds to skip and not read the blog about the english variant civ"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"550 teuton knights on foot and something that looks like an italian footmen armed with a shield and an axe the guy of the red hat. 650 flags of france, kingdom of castille spain and kingdom of poland. horsemen with templar heraldy, jinetes spanish unique unit and some kind of husar polishhungarianlithuanian pseudo light cavalry. 730 what looks like spearmen wearing a late medieval halberd similar to the one used by hre variant landskecht common weapon during the 100 years war and the war of the roses, period of the lancaster house. in the center some kind of men at arms wearing a warhammer, common anti armor weapon during the late medieval period, again, period of the lancaster house, same than the guy of the dlcs art. better look at the hammer behind the gate at 740."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"odd not to go directly towards a desired civilization like celts or spanish, but go for niche fraternities."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,we got two french variant civs before gta 6!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"we better get vikings next. i.e. danes, swedes, or norwegians."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"no campaign is kinda disappointing tbh.... the aoe 4 campaigns are all amazing and historical... i'm probably one of few, but i really appreciated those."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,i was hoping for a new korean civilization or something fresh.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,they really added more english and french civs instead of adding portuguese and spanish ???
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,didn't they mention that they were going to release two dlc's this year? maybe they're giving themselves some more time to release new full civs later in the second dlc?
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,"i think it should have been the spanish civ included... it is very unfair to have all european major empires and not to have the spanish... we need to see conquistadors in action... historically, it could have been issabelle of castille or philip the second... spanish and vikings were my main 2 missing civs from the game"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"the ranged cav of the templars is from castile. they are mounted light javeline throwers, which the spaniards copied from the north africans during the reconquista."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"time to use my history degree and break down some of the units. the men at arms with the pointy curved helmets are teutonic knights, or at least a teutonic unit, as the helmets while a bit fantasized are associated with them. the french arbalester dont carry round their shields on their back, therefore those crossbowmen are most likely an italian unit called a paviser or genoese crossbowman. the unit on the horse with the javelin is a spanish unit, most likely called a genitour or jinete, mistakenly given to the berbers in aoe2, these were used as a counter by the spanish to the islamic horse archers."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,"lost potential could have added the vikings, or even mayans."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,one thing that is exciting is they say the knights templar get units from their kingdoms. that means some of their units may return when those kingdoms get added as their own civs. its like a whole civ of sneak peaks for other possible civs
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,"bro, you got excited for the english variant and nearly said what you hoped for with longbows, then proceeded to skip past the part where they said they have a volley ability"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"for me the most exciting part of aoe is the different civs and different cultures. this to me feels more like a couple variants. yes the templars are pretty different but at the same time it doesnt feel like a new civ. especially with so many other cultures not in the game yet like spain, vikings, aztecs etc. im still thankful for how much content weve gotten and the new stuff to come but i cant say im over the top excited"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,"thank you devs ill take any content, preferably what people are asking for tho lol"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,knights templar and house of lancaster??????!!!! now this is what should get me back into this game. i was waiting for some scandinavian civs but this sounds epic
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"seems to me that they could have had a separate civ of crusader states still historically accurate to reuse frenchenglishhre units and then added the english variant, keeping the status quo of 1 variant for each major civ. but it could be saving them dev time, who knows."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,sure seems to me drongo got the 2 mixed up. french blue and gold colors and english with their red cross on white.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"i absolutely love the idea of these variant cigs. it opens up the game to many different unique units such as those mounted javelin units. but now hear me out, considering the time since the last dlc, one or two brand new civilisations that introduced new areas of the world would have been super cool as well. alas, maybe this dlc is a bit cheaper and there will be another one later in the year to avoid overloading us like last time. either way, happy for fresh content!"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,there's gonna be parades for aoe4 soon. the hype is wild not gonna lie...
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,i think the knights templar will be more of a variant of the byzantines and their mercenary system that allows for units from all other civs.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,a little disappointing that its only 1 civ and 1 variant but excited to try out the new civs
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,"positive we're getting new civs negative they're from already covered regions devs weren't really listening to the people, were they?"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"sa was 15, this should be no more than 10"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,"i really dislike aoe 4's variant civs. i want real, fleshed out civilizations, not small obscure fraternities or even entirely fictional factions zhu xi's legacy, jeanne d'arc the person. and you know the main reason they are doing this is so they can pump the game with a bunch low effort variant civilizations in between full expansions and nickel and dime the playerbase for each one. you might think im being dramatic, but it really reminds me of things like kits from the sims 4. i really dont want aoe 4 to go down that route. dont accept mediocrity, people."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-15,"i'm guessing the focus on variant civs vs new unique civs is due to costs. new civs require new languages to be researched and dialogue to be recorded professional recording is fairly expensive, whereas making new models isn't terribly expensive, especially when you can recycle so many assets"
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,game does not need france or english variant.
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,"wait, there is no vikings?! no azteks?! yikes..."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,hyped for it!!!
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-10,i thought it would be more. i wanted a new civ
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,"india has had such great civilizations like the marathas, guptas, mauryas, cholas, etc. unfortunately they're not covering any of them."
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,only two new variant civilizations is a joke. them being english and french is just trolling from devs
Strategy,Age of Empires IV,2025-03-11,oh god youre a mod? do you look like doreen?
