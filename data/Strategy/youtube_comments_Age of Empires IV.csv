Age of Empires IV - Before You Buy,s_e1CMhmKoI,@tomservo75,"Okay so newbie question here: You mention this is the last ""mainline"" game. Does that mean AoE 3 is a separate standalone game while 2 and 4 are a series? Or is every game just completely different? I'm hoping to know the difference from 2, 3, and 4. Are they just different groups of civilizations or are there other fundamental differences? How does 2 & 4 compare, I hear they're basically the same and set in the same time period? I have AoE4 but AoE3 seems interesting too and I wonder if I shouldn't get it because it's already included in 4 or if it's completely separate.

Thanks for making these!",0
