How does 2 & 4 compare, I hear they're basically the same and set in the same time period? I have AoE4 but AoE3 seems interesting too and I wonder if I shouldn't get it because it's already included in 4 or if it's completely separate.

Also I'm confused by what I see on Steam.

s_e1CMhmKoI,@bobbyricigliano2799,"I've got a bit over 100 hours on the game,  mostly custom game skirmishes against A.I  I'll offer a few observations: 

1. Don't expect a lot of initial peace to build and advance.  Expect enemy scouts poking and harassing your villagers right away.
2. Concentrate on food production first.  It is the key to adding villagers and everything else.
3. Monitor and avoid idle villagers and uneven resource gathering.   When a resource is depleted, the villagers will just stand there until you move them.
4. Evening out your resources by buying and selling at the market is expensive and inefficient.
5. Don't buy every upgrade that becomes available.  Some are more useful and  / or a better value than others.
6. You don't need to ""control"" an area to take its' resources.  If there is a huge gold vein on the other side of the map,  I'll harvest that instead of what is near my town center.  Send enough villagers, build a mining camp next to it, and guard them with a few cavalry.  Sometimes you will deplete it before the enemy even knows you're there.  Otherwise, you still have all that gold, even if the camp gets discovered and overran. 
7. Your military formations should include religious units for healing, and a handful of villagers to repair siege weapons.
8. All siege weapons are costly and powerful, but very easy to destroy if left unguarded by infantry or cavalry.
9. Your assets will behave stupidly and march blindly into annihilation if you don't pay attention and command them what to do.
10.  The 200 population cap is awful.  You can reach that very quick and then have to start killing off villagers to allow your queued military units to spawn.",2022-11-02T22:51:36Z,3

Literally everything else is either missing so many features it's pointless or, flat our broken. Did you guys somehow miss the mountains of glitches while playing or did you just assume they'd be fixed? Because it's been almost a year now and they're all still there.

Even on easy the skirmish ai never stops building, attacking and, rebuilding forcing you to play every skirmish as if it were ranked PvP. You still can't change video settings independently from each other forcing my wife to either play a game that's very blurry or one that runs at 12 fps. Archers still like to shoot at the ground NEXT to targets. Walls are still your only option for blocking enemy movement but only sometimes actually do so. WE STILL DON'T HAVE MULTIPLAYER TAUNTS!

Would I assume correctly that the original, 2, 3, and 4 are not cumulative? Like does AOE4 include all the scenarios from 1-3? Or would there be countries/campaigns that are in 3 but not in 4 that I'd have to buy both? 
I'm also confused by what I see on Steam. Apparently there are ""Definitive Editions"" for I II and III and within those you can buy DLC for particular civilizations, but where does it say what comes with the game itself? For example III seems to include US Civilization, but in Steam, there's separate DLC for US saying that Definitive III is needed to play. Well if it comes with the base game why would I buy it again? Or could we just I just buy IV and load civilizations from III instead of buying multiple definitive editions? I'm really confused!",2022-12-27T03:06:55Z,0

However shift + number will add the units or buildings to a control group, without reseting the control group.
I haven't tested this one, but alt + number will likely remove the units or buildings selected from any other control group, and put them only to the control group selected. This also does not add units like shift does, it resets the control group that you binded them to.",2021-12-08T01:42:34Z,0

g22QzcMTAq0,@ArabianNights1,"Good content;

🔻 For those who don't know:
The House of Wisdom is real. It was built when Baghdad was the center of the world knowldege long after the holy Roman empire burnt the Great library of Alexandria. Where do you think Algebra, Algorithm,  Numbers, Chemistry, Astronomy, Astrolabes, Modern Medicine, Modern Hospital, The Scientific Method, Mechanics, Robotics etc.... came from? Ofc by the Will of Allah & the efforts & minds of Muslim scientists & many of them were appointed by the Caliph in the House of Wisdom, including Christian & Jewish translators & scientists who helped in handful of projects.


Althought the Abbasid era was deemed the Golden Age of Islam by Europeans, The Abbasids werent nearly as strong as the Umayyad Caliphate, the mongols wouldnt have stood a chance against them, the Umayyad ruled about 30m km^2 from western China to southern russia, turkey, ukrain, southern france, Spain, Portugal, & northern africa all the way to its middle, almost. Empires like China & Britain used to pay Jizya & produce coins that has ""la ilaha illa Allah"" written on them (Meaning There's No God but Allah). All By the Will of Allah All-Mighty All-Merciful All-Gracious &Allah knows best. ALHAMDULILLAH.

No wonder devs chose Abbasid over Umayyad or else no civ would stand a chance.

IMPORTANT: The devs choosing to utilize Camel units isnt acurate, it should be Arabian Horses 🐴 not Camels 🐫.",2024-02-26T23:14:39Z,0

Iran, which fought with Rome for 700 years, fought with Byzantium, which is in the game, for many years, and this war was between two great civilizations.

Most of the Roman emperors were killed in the war with Iran, while not a single Persian king was killed in the war with Rome. These governments are the two largest empires in the world (the Byzantine nation no longer exists, but the Persian nation with the same civilization, culture and language is still alive), but you are deleting the history of the Persian civilization.

I wish Iran was present in your game, I suggest you add the Sassanid or Safavid government from Iran to the game, the absence of Iran in the game is really sad.❤",2024-02-13T00:39:09Z,0

WtWP4Aky8SE,@nrg4285,"ALL TIPS:
1. Strategy/decision making is worth more than action per minute (apm) or being fast at anything
2. Use hotkeys like selecting all idle villagers, etc. to do mundane stuff easier
3. play intro tutorial (if not already done)
4. don't hoard resources - keep less than a few hundred each in early game, lower than 1k in mid-late game
5. don't idle your town center - keep producing villagers
6. make tons of villagers - up to half population (100 in a 200 pop game)
7. avoid idle villagers and idle military - villagers need to be gathering resources and military can patrol or defend resources and villagers
8. be careful with boars - requires 7 or more villagers to take down 1 boar comfortably
9. prioritize food sources - order of fastest to slowest: 1) shoreline fish 2) boars 3) deer 4) sheep/farms 5) berries
10. learn build orders - like openings in chess - can get you faster to feudal age if you execute them well
11. learn to garrison units - esp. villagers - can select villagers and click seek shelter button - then return to work button
12. first town center has significantly more HP than secondaries
13. use scouts efficiently, gather sheep, see what enemies are up to, never idle scouts
14. training a second scout early game
15. refresh lumber camps by building a second one closer to forest to decrease walk times
16. straighter and longer wall sections are cheaper than shorter and multiple section ones - fewer angles saves resources
17. know when to do economic upgrades to resource buildings
18. setup economy for army composition you are targeting
19. only siege units can attack stone walls (except elephants)
20. incomplete stone walls can be destroyed by non-siege units
21. stone gates actually have directions that matter - typically point gate outward from base
22. put thought into wall designs - do not just encircle your base with walls
23. utilize outposts for vision, defend your resources, deny resources to others - upgrade throughout each age
24. use keeps defensively and offensively - defend farms - deny areas of map - less important in imperial age though
25. avoid long production queues - queue units more efficiently
26. pick up relics - extra passive gold - pick up 2-3 relics on way to castle age
27. use attack move command, do by attacking and moving the ground nearest enemy and not specific enemy or building
28. focus fire and kite with range units by attacking and running away from melee range, repeat - good in early-mid game otherwise amass fire
29. don't forget about blacksmith upgrades - prioritize upgrades for units you have now or plan on having soon
30. know your unit counters - e.g. spearmen counters horsemen, etc.
31. understand Lanchester's Law - military units, dmg outputs, outnumbering is important and not linear
32. use springalds against siege units - insane range and dmg against other siege units - must have before imperial age
33. no friendly fire in aoe4 - use weapons against enemies near allies without consequences
34. units take up different amounts of population space - e.g. siege unit is not worth 1 villager etc.
35. heal wounded military units with religious units
36. obtain map control - learn when to gain control/relinquish control
37. build multiple production buildings - not uncommon to have 5-10 buildings of the unit you are training - can train units 5x faster
38. check minimap regularly - helps react faster
39. use market to balance economy when necessary
40. population efficiency matters in late game
41. use rally points - tell units to go somewhere immediately after they are trained
42. utilize fast building trick - example: build a mill and then spam click the mill with farms to auto place them around mill
43. use shift commands more - quickly queue 5 units with holding shift and clicking queue once, or instruct villager to do 2 different things in succession, tell monk to pickup relic and go to monastery immediately, etc.
44. use ctrl+click - selects all of the same unit immediately, helps separate units
45. use control groups - select units and press number or function key to assign units to a group, now those units become a hotkey selector
46. tweak centering options - when hitting hotkeys to select units or groups you can change whether camera follows or does not
47. consider panoramic zoom level - change camera mode setting from classic to panoramic
48. read post game stats - gather insights on what to improve on
49. watch replay of game to see how opponent won against you
50. watch pro tournaments",2024-06-10T05:36:08Z,2

2. Because I like to play as Rus I know that mine enemy played as English I focused on knights so I could counter his archers but I must make sure they wont counter mine cavalary with those spikes
3. I know that I must build hunting hut next to big forest that for now I wont cut. The bigger the better and sometimes I dont even got gold mine but I already got enought gold to make next era building. Usualy thats is Kreml for early def and bonus into collecting wood. 
4. Here I take army of early cavalary knights that make sure I can make even in feudal age rush or with mine monks take sacred sides and block them with reinforced wood walls and their towers.
5. As Rus you must know how to scout to make sure they find deer herds, sheeps, nice places for huts and on some closed maps where are the best chooke points to make some wood walls with some towers so mine def is easier. 
6. I know how to use mine resurces. Because you love Chinese and talk with them I talk as Rus. I make a lot of food and gold that I make from huts and upgrated villigers. I usualy make at least 4 stables to make sure mine line of knights is good. I also learned what kind of special building I should build next. If I see that enemy is more agresive then I build uniqie castle that alows me build stone walls so I have more defensive capabilities or build siege workshop so I can make unique techs and faster bombard cannons. No need for stronger monks? Then I get the big hunter hut that also gives me deer from time to time to make sure I got extra gold and food.

As one who has never followed builds and made my own china build that caried me like 14/0 against gold and plat players I felt really solid.

But I just got stomped.  HARD.  By an HRE player, and his tip at the end was “never ignore water.”

I have aways hated water and avoided it, but after that break in my win streak, I feel compelled to learn water.

And it is a lot harder for me to learn.

I’ve been a land China main since start, being only civ with full mastery.

I’ve considered myself a great player, almost always beating plat players (unranked usually) as china, but after being destroyed I really need to learn water.

Specifically the juggling of my land resources.  How early do I invest into boats?  How hard do I invest?  How many boats do I want?  How do I balance land military with navy??

I lost on Mediterranean.  Overwhelmed by landschnencs and Man At Arms.

I ALWAYS have the best economy in my games, so I never feel so helpless like I did in that game.

His economy was just way better than mine due to fishing.  To the point I know I have to learn water to improve.",2022-11-18T17:33:45Z,7

Турики, пусть и не с Вальвовским размахом, но проходят, недавно вот были отборы на турик за 20К евро, потом во второй половине года в Берлине будет турик на 100К евро и так далее. Норм игра живёт, если Релики не будут обсираться с правками баланса, то засчет киберспорта , пусть и нишевого, но серия возродится. Единственное, что калит, так это то, что релики в отличие от близзов никогда не делали киберспорт балансированных ртс и в итоге будут поначалу постоянно обкакиваться с баланс-правками и, например, в игре до сих пор нет ладдера и подбора ММ грамотного, но уже в ближайшем патче обещает ввести, (а ладдер и вовсе уже в бете есть и тестится). На выходе игра неплохо хайпанула в ртс-среде, так например, на твитче категория aoe4 обогнала по зрителям категорию sc2",2022-02-15T15:05:05Z,1

It's the sort of criticism that thinks Gears of War is the ultimate in aesthetic design, with grey and brown everywhere. It confuses what the speaker thinks is realistic for quality. If a medieval strategy game were realistic your soldiers would take days at the least to train: knights would take years, and battles would be over in a few hours. Sieges would be 90% sitting around and waiting, and most soldiers would die of natural diseases. The cartoony criticism always seems to come from self important over serious people who don't understand or care for good aesthetic design, and think everything they do has to be utterly po faced. Nevermind a grey and brown color palette would render the units and buildings nigh on impossible to see. That and I'm sick of the stupid ""bigger number always good,"" idea that fewer civs are automatically worse when they showed one of the most radical departures from AoE formula, with the Mongols, in that first reveal.

4sKdE5vjFbQ,@RainintheBrain,"I was always a big fan of AOE4 despite the flaws.
What I love the most
1. Diverse units and civs. In AOE2 every civ had the same medieval European looking units. Its super awkward playing as the Malians in AOE2 and my villagers don't really look African in the slightest.
2. Easier access to unique units. In AOE2 you often have to wait til Castle age and build a castle in order to 
3 Superior historicity in game play. AOE2 could get under my skin with the inaccuracies. Like with the Franks. Why are the medieval french fighting with throwing axe men?! I'm excited for a Celtic civ to come to AOE4. They will finally have some authentic Celtic units. I mean really blue woad raiders?! Was Mel Gibson AOE2's history consultant?
4. Landmarks when aging up. I love this feature. In AOE2 ageing up was  a tough choice because it would mean a period of time where I would be bared from training villagers due to my town center being occupied. Now in AOE4 I can pump out villagers and age up at the same time. I also love how the landmarks give me a reason to start in the dark ages and work my way up. If I just start in imperial I miss out on all the bonuses my landmarks provide. 
5. More complex gameplay. I love the new Byzantine civ. I get to build aqueduct systems that boost my economy and production. I can also recruit mercs from other civs using the olive oil resource. 
6. Markets. I love how almost all the maps have a market. In AOE2 you wouldn't have access to a market for trading unless you had allies. Thus if you are playing with no allies you had no reason to build a market and send up caravans. Thus if you had a civ with trading bonuses those bonuses became worthless. I love the random docks and markets that give me a reason to trade and also when I play Byzantines I can get even more mercs",2024-04-07T14:11:30Z,0

I guess this has always been the balancing act for any government  to subdue its citizens- keeping them busy, productive, and mentally occupied; so they would never associate for any productive power to make govt do better and maintain its simple mission.

GkbpMCONMKQ,@You-ul8qw,"With HRE you do actually want to get the prelate as the very first thing you build, 40% increase is defiantly worth it and I find myself getting faster age 2 than all of my opponents no matter what they play when I'm HRE.
All the HRE players I've seen also do this. 100% worth it.

The age 1 build I use is:
6 workers on sheep, prelate first.
First worker that's made be rallied towards gold, that worker builds a house when it comes out of the town center.
After the house is done send it to build the mining camp.
The second villager goes to mining gold, and all villagers after him do the same till you have enough to age up.
At around this point you want to send the prelate towards the gold to inspire gold villagers, sometimes sending it back to food as well.
Once you have enough gold to age up, use the villagers on gold to make the landmark of choice but leave 1 or 2 on gold still, to save up gold for a second prelate. (Make sure to return any gold the villagers might be carrying to the mining camp before you send them to construct the landmark)
When its producing, rally new villagers to gather wood, and the villagers constructing the landmark also gather wood when they finish, so you can make the next house.

Depending on how aggressive you want to be, decide carefully as to when you want to send the villagers on wood back on gold or food. 
If you wish to age to castle asap, after you have enough wood for a house leave 2 or 3 villagers on wood for houses and send the rest back to gold mining with new villagers on food.
If you want to be more aggressive, keep the villagers on wood for as long as nessicary so you can make the structures needed to produce your units of choice (keep them there indefinitely if you're gonna make battering rams)",2022-01-12T06:12:46Z,0

GkbpMCONMKQ,@superpantman,A very strong build order with English is to not create any extra archery range but get one-two racks and pump spearmen. Obviously you keep producing archers but the idea is that if you keep a few villagers on gold you can make a blacksmith and your spearmen can build a battering ram. Do not underestimate how strong this unit is early game and you can easily destroy some important buildings from your opponents and even if you don’t get to a building it takes soooo much damage to destroy in the early game it’s a cheap tank for hp.,2021-11-15T11:59:13Z,0

GkbpMCONMKQ,@MFARIGA,"It’s actually more efficient to send villager to move closest sheep as close as base as possible and kill it ASAP with villagers then produce villagers group base while you produce villagers click on scoot then click on map to where you wanna go. After that you want to rally it on the sheep and make sure there is a blue flag while your scoot still moving move sheep’s as close as base as possible to the base and the sheep you are harvesting so that your villagers can kill it and gather without losing time in travel time. Early game economy really matters a lot as a slight inefficiency has quite some impact to the mid/late game and good bases matters a lot.

I know it’s min maxing but sometimes having 1 extra unit earlier or be able to make wall few sec earlier can change the course of the game.

GkbpMCONMKQ,@forestcitytrivia9167,"With Abbasid, if you practice their opening, you can perfectly time a few nice plays early. House of Worship makes the push to II trickier than other factions. 

So 1. HoW before lumber mill (the 400f 200g wing cost will be in reach by the time it's built), then once you click Econ Wing to II...
2. Pull vills for mass wood, and replenish food with new vills or a few micro peels, by the time the wing is done (and they do take a while) you can get to 150+ wood and place an archery range on the exact second you actually hit II.
3. Then pull vills for food and go heavy food and wood
4. Go CA, CA (cost:180f 60 w./per) They can harass really well until you make more units, or make a stable. 

This build order gives the the option of early pressure, or a better defense from early pressure, rather than building HoW after mill. 

Also, 4 horseman, 2CA is a nice harasser squad for gimping enemy's gold or challenging early archer squad. (total cost: 760f  200w)",2021-11-11T01:22:48Z,3

GkbpMCONMKQ,@M1GHTYM4VS,"Chinese could be a high villager powerhouse and I think having farms early can have a bit of a slight advantage if you force drop their ressources as they are making rice farms instead of wheat so their gathering rate is slightly different. You can atleast have 3 main strategies I think, depending on what you're up against. Fast Castle is on the board as you described, you may have to go full turtle even or you can have advanced villager boom if you're either not getting early harassment or have some success to repell that. Going for the Tax Collectors early had given you a high surplus of gold that either means you can be slower on gathering from the mining camp and rather focus more on wood and farms or deer or berries. If you've a higher count on villagers has a higher success chance for boar which means even more food faster. So I think there's some versatility in the long run.",2021-11-10T18:47:47Z,1

If you're going against Abbassids and the Delhi Sultanate that means their boar is haram, so they cannot hunt it for food so they either have to just kill it off or you can use advantage of theirs instead.",2021-11-10T18:19:51Z,5

BTW the mongol Towers have the same Speed Buff Aura like the Deer Stones, but the Deer Stones grant u a improved Version directly what would normaly accessabel at Castle Age (Tier 3). The normal Aura only Speed Buffs Caverlarie and Traders. The improved Version everything. Thats why u should add some Towers to ur Tradeline to have even more ressources. Also there is a trade buff if u have more traders. If u have 10 u get also 10% in wood and at 15 its also 10% in Food (so if 1 Traders brings 50 Gold it will also bring 5 Food and 5 Wood).

The natural way to play ever since WarCraft 1/2/3, StarCraft 1, and other rts is to click everything with mouse. With left hand on arrow keys to move the screen around and control groups. That's it for keyboard. Produce unit = L-clicking the individual building and the unit with mouse. To build, click peasant, click building choice, and click location.

If you struggle in 1v1 matchmaking and you feel like your opponents are too experienced for your skill level, I woud recommand to go to custom games and join ""Beginners only"" or ""noob only"" lobbies. There is often custom lobbies with these titles but if there is not any, you can create one by just naming it ""1v1 - Beginner only"" and set it to public, wait a few seconds/minutes and someone will join your lobby!

You will only face new comers just like you and it will feel better to learn the game at your own pace.",2024-05-28T15:56:50Z,16

Simple example mongels with their network seige out runs inf even with HRE's movement speed to inf buff.

Due to the casual nature of the games and the massive size of the 4v4 maps (a deterrent to aggro play style), most players turtle until imperial age and by then the Chinese have the most unstoppable units in the Nest of Bees and Fire Lancers.

XNHywZF9MdA,@greenlamp9219,dont know if this has been said but this just does not feel like an aoe game. there is simply no love in the gameplay and structure of the civs i feel. if i could compare this game to a piece of furniture this is like a chair i bought at ikea vs one that was hand crafted. mongols are ridiculously op and its like this wasnt even a consideration when making the game. on top of that this game is just like an aoe2 clone -totally ignoring aoe3 and things like home city improvements as well as the amazing campaigns that those games had. i would have liked to see a totally different game than what we ended up getting at least one that takes a bit more risk i just feel like this will grow stale quickly and doesnt bring anything new to the table.,2022-01-15T16:04:55Z,0

The lack of sacred sites is less about not getting that small amount of gold, and more about not being able to force the opponent out of a boom.

All civs sources buff limits 100.000 sources limit. But The advantage of the Ottomans was Military Schools that worked based on population and gave free soldiers. Ottoman loses all buffs its features at 200 pop. Why why why. Why. No professional player chooses the Ottoman in Nomad mode.,2025-01-24T21:09:06Z,0

But then in CONQ IV it has a really bad win rate in comparison. This shows you just how this is a totally different game in different ranks. I personally am a pleb who constantly dies to OOTD because I can't help underestimating their army strength and lose my entire army due to the fact that they have high value units and I can't judge fights against them to save my life.,2025-01-24T17:25:03Z,48

In your video your villagers traveled much further than what is optimal. The problem with this is that your deer were likely producing food rates equal to berries or even farmland. It is wise to set up a mill in these situations. A seemingly small change in strategy such as that can really turn the tides for a new player which this tutorial is geared for. In addition, I think it cannot be understated just how important free sheep are. They can be returned to the base for optimal distance to resource gathering thereby freeing up wood resources which is crucial for someone who is starting out.

The videos in campaign make me feel like a kid watching the History Channel when it was good and showed actual history. The quality in those videos alone make getting the game on gamepass more than worth it for me personally. Game wise, I'm pretty happy with the formula, and provided they continue to build on it, I see a great future for the game. Some simple fixes I'd like to see would be: a auto scout button being added to the scouts, treaty modes being included in the game, map mods and custom map making abilities, higher pop cap, (why are we still stuck on 200?) Make the idle villies button more noticeable, and allow my to rotate buildings (this may be a feature I just haven't worked out yet.

Second, I am noob when it comes to online playing AOE, but I have been playing the game single player for some time and I have played previous instalments of this game. I have managed to organize my start and to generate resources. i play with English and everything is okay if I manage to win in the first 15-20 min. but after that, I start to lose momentum,and the enemy grows stronger, and has a stronger army. I don't know why. Is it because I focus too much on  fighting and I neglect base development such as building extra barracks and Archery range and siege . I still have a lot to learn. Can you help?

i48fgmmfXoM,@domalash,"i totally get what you're saying.. but we don't learn in a perfect linear way.. often people know there's a counter at the start so they don't bother with the early cheese plays.. so we often get to later stages.. and have questions about them.. 

we often see the point where units were lost.. sometimes it's because of something we did earlier sure.. but were not always blaming the civs.. sometimes it's just a question of what's best in your experience..

like for me it seems like once they get catas for long range siege i'm forced to move.. but should i have intercepted them.. should i rush them and then pull their army back into my defenses.. do i go cavalry first.. run around the enemy spears.. i'm looking for battle tactics.. do i go in with spears first.. then cavalry right behind or wait a few seconds or more.. 

if i'm up or down a few soldiers that can vary from game to game depending on start sure.. but once there i gotta know what to do right.. fact is we're getting to that point.. not that it doesn't make sense to learn the start as much as possible.. but have to leave room to learn the rest too no? .. i mean it's great advice but if I have an experts ear for a few minutes i want the secret sauce not the easy stuff i can learn myself.. 

like this attack move stuff i don't know if it's friggin working half the time.. it's not drawing red line and planting a flag like in your video.. have to check settings i guess.. maybe i should watch some micro tutorials i guess but maybe you have more insight.. and there's many questions that an expert can answer better than a tutorial..",2024-10-26T23:56:52Z,0

i48fgmmfXoM,@kingsgambit7098,"While I do appreciate the examples of different variations for optimization, I don't think this is a good approach for teaching those who are getting into rts games. Pro players have a habit of being too precise. What ppl are looking for is a practical way to play. After all, you really shouldn't lose in a strategy game for a single mistake. That would defeat the whole purpose in it being a strategy. You should only be at a disadvantage.
   This is like me explaining positional play in chess to a novice player. Even though it is the most accurate way to play the game, it is completely beyond their level of understanding. Even to a Grand Master the advantages are minor. Instead, you introduce them into tactics and checkmate patterns. We also have material value to show the reasonable trades of pieces. This is not an accurate description as the value of each piece changes based on the nature of the position, but it is the most common and very basic view.
      One example of this for rts games is the rock, paper, scissors mechanic. Even though dynamics would tell you that quantity beats quality and the resource advantage changes the intentions with trades. However, the most basic point of view is the interactions between each military unit. Another one would be ideal villager count within each age. Obviously, this wouldn't be an accurate description for many different reasons, but I'm willing to bet that there is a common number reached.
     I honestly don't believe pro players are that great at the game themselves because they don't seem to be able to break it down into some of the most basic concepts. How different would the game be if you mirrored your opponent's army? Would you talk about micro or would you refer players into positioning on the map and potential formations? Is it possible that micro in itself has limited the games potential? How high up on the ladder do you see players just play with one army with no micro? I'm willing to bet that this is an area that hasn't even begun development as pro gamers seem to get tunnel vision by their understanding of the game's mechanics.
     I hope that this helps. I would like to see some very practical advice. I am more of a chess player myself, but I do believe that rts games are the future of strategy games. Chess has dominated that field for centuries, but with a large number of improvements from the devs perspectives and the players I believe that rts games will take that title in a couple of decades.",2024-05-31T05:50:38Z,0

When I first got the game I played a bunch of ranked to learn, ended up at silver, then went on to playing nothing but Nomad FFA for months. It actually taught me a lot about how things work at the macro level, booming, late game, etc. I even won a few nomad games. HOWEVER, I felt actually afraid to go back to 1v1's because every mistake is so costly and nobody is there to save you (or of course ruin you too). This advice makes me want to really buckle down and learn and get to a high rank. Thanks",2024-05-20T09:24:17Z,5

At some point when i reach 200 pop, it seems like they have a huge advantage because they dont need as many villagers, they start spamming janissaries maa and great bombard i really dont understand why i lose even with twice the amount of villagers. Is there a good counter to this?  No matter if i try to eco boom or be more agressive at the start I can't figure out that matchup even if im ahead until imperial or when it reaches 200 pop. I don't have any issue against any other matchup, except maybe a bit malian which i feel like the 200 pop is also an issue because they dont need as many villagers.",2024-05-19T18:36:20Z,0

A guide on how to execute a BO is like giving other people a fish. But this video is to tell you how to fish yourself. The MINDSET on a certain situation of a pro player is truely what tells them apart from the amateurs .Why does not a pro player panic seeing a tower rush -- because 1. he saw it 1000 times already, it's like you see an egg on a breakfast menu, what's surprising? 2. Because he knows 3 ways to deal with it, all he needs to evaluate is which way is more effecient.
The summary of how all civs should deal with early barrack / tower rush is truely valuable. I would learn this same stuff after playing 200 games or watching 100 replays/vods, but this summary just casually explained it in 5 mins. I wish this channel shows more about the methodology or mindset on various situations. E.g. how to deal with trading for each civ etc.",2024-05-19T17:37:47Z,106

pW9qGY67GxQ,@hansky_vlr,"They messed up the history of Mongols and Ottomans because they based their historical knowledge on 18th century German and British historian writings about these nations. For example the whistling arrow is founded by Mete Han, in ancient Chinese ""Mòdú Chānyú"" which were the leader, khan of Turkics. Arch nemesis of Mongols (and Chinese). Not by Mongols. However, older European historians didn't know Mongolian, any Turkic language and most importantly, Chinese so they wrote accordingly to other European historians assumings such as historians from Byzantine etc which includes many, many errors and misunderstandings. (This is also why Early-European historians thought Turkics were Mongols/Mongoloid as well😅.) The developers worked with a really old historian so thats another reason for these wrong facts since his knowledge wasn't up to date. For Europeans it isn't important but you can understand why it made many native players from these nations or history fans mad. Many people just tried the game but gets fed up after coming across their culture is represented wrong. That's why not even Ottomans were didn't fulfilled the expectations for Microsoft. Unfortunately there is not fix for this because this problem have really deep roots. For anyone interested I'm a historian who knows both all Turkic languages even including Gagauz language, old Turkic, Mandarin, A few dialects of ancient Chinese (can do Hanyu Pinyin) and Mongolian. Age of empires games were always had issues regarding ""non European"" civilizations but since the games were old it was normal. But for AoE4, it's unacceptable.",2024-07-23T21:57:52Z,0

Klar, so ist es weniger anspruchsvoll was die benötigte Leistung des PCs angeht, aber es sieht halt einfach nicht einmal im Ansatz zeitgemäß aus. 

Sogar AoE 2 in der Definitive Edition sieht für mich besser aus, weil die Models einfach erwachsener aussehen. Und ich hab mir jetzt schon etliche Videos hier auf Youtube angesehen, kann mich aber einfach nicht mit dieser scheußlichen Grafik anfreunden.

a3wwbG3-oBM,@RealBro1,"Ich finde Age 4 hat noch ein ganz anderes, weit unterschätztes Problem, und zwar: keine Physik, keine Ballistik und kein Gewicht der Einheiten. Hört sich banal an, aber es ist mir beim tieferen Nachdenken deutlich aufgefallen. Es gibt keine Trägheit, alles ist zu direkt und das nimmt einem ein ganz bestimmtes Gefühl weg. Ich kann kaum erklären wie genau es wirkt. Aber dieses hektische hin und her tüddeln der Einheiten und das Flugverhalten von Katapulten und Pfeilen nimmt dem ganzen irgendwie total den spaß weg. Es wird irgendwo dieses kleine bisschen Immersion, was durch den Comicstil schon sehr gering ist, auch noch weg. Es fühlt sich alles so gewichtlos/ ja schon fast bedeutungslos an. Es geht einem auf ""gut Deutsch"" gesagt irgendwie keine ab wenn große Mengen Einheiten aufeinander preschen. Vergleicht das Gefühl was ihr dabei habt mal mit ner Total War Schlacht. Auf Katapulte und Ballisten bauen habe ich auch irgendwie null bock, da absolut keine Wucht dahinter steckt. Für mich macht das alles kaputt tatsächlich ^^ .. schwer zu beschreiben.

Mir ist das aber zu viel gerushe. Wenn ich ab der ersten Sekunde rein schwitzen will, dann spiele ich StarCraft 2. Age sollte sich dann doch etwas mehr Zeit lassen. Die Belagerungswaffen finde ich trotz nerf immer noch zu stark und dass kaum ein pro die Booster für die Dorfbewohner erforscht spricht schon Bände über den eigentlich wichtigen Aufbau und Wirtschaftsfaktor.
Was mich besonders gestört hat war der Kampf zu Wasser, da sind einige Völker einfach unbalanced. Und selbst wenn das nicht der Fall wäre, pumpt man einfach nur 20 Minuten lang Schiffe ohne Sinn und Verstand, nur um die Hoheit auf dem Wasser zu erreichen. Es gibt sogar Schiffe die meine Festung auf einem Berg auf einer Insel outrangen.
Man sollte eine Mechanik entwerfen die den Kampf zu Wasser schwieriger macht für den dominanten Part. Einmal das Wasser gewonnen, dann hat man automatisch gewonnen.

Das ist schon fast arglistige Täuschung.
Klar, ein Strategie-Spiel benötigt keine Top-Grafik, aber sie sollte zumindestens ein wenig ansehnlich sein, und nicht so ein matschiger Haufen Pixxelmüll. Die Definitive Edition von Age 2  ist 2D und sieht meilenweit besser aus.
Krasses aktuelles Gegenbeispiel : Panzer Corps 2 ist ein Runden-Taktikspiel und hat wesentlich, WESENTLICH bessere 3D-Grafik. Es geht also!

a3wwbG3-oBM,@boy_becauseofyou,"Interessante Review, wobei ich Dir bei der Kritik zur Darstellung der Kampagne widersprechen muss. Ich finde die Brücke zwischen heute und den historischen Gebieten interessant und empfand auch die Sprecherin nicht als unangenehm, sondern als passend.

a3wwbG3-oBM,@DezKaiZer,Sehr guter Test. Würde das nach Release jetzt auch noch so unterschreiben. Ich mochte allerdings den Dokumentations Aspekt von der Kampagne recht gern. Aber es stimmt schon die modernen Aufnahmen waren sehr Dissonanz und irgendwie befremdlich,2022-01-06T13:59:56Z,0

Ich stimme dir lediglich in einem Punkt nicht zu (wobei ich das Spiel selbst noch nicht gespielt habe und vielleicht ja eines besseren belehrt werde) die Doku Kampagnen und die heute/früher Sequenzen klingen für mich ziemlich gut.

Man wird dauernd und permanent vom Feind angegriffen und hat gar keine Zeit sich auf seine Sachen zu konzentrieren. Keine Ahnung warum ein einfacher Modus trotzdem so anfängerunfreundlich sein muss. Offensichtlich spielt man den, weil man noch keine AHnung hat. So habe ich überhaupt keine Gelegenheit mal in Ruhe alles zu entdecken. Ich bin ja permanent nur damit beschäftigt mich zu verteidigen, wobei ich dann am Ende trotzdem jedes Mal verloren habe. 

Scheint wohl ein Game zu sein, dass nicht davon ausgeht, dass auch Genre-Neulinge sich das angucken. Schade um mein Geld. Für Neulinge definitiv nicht zu empfehlen.",2021-12-09T14:39:31Z,1

In fremde Gebäude können sie einquartiert werden aber nicht in die eigenen, wo man sie ausbildet. Das könnte auch noch verbessert werden.

Manch einer Spielt AoE um online gegen andere zu spielen, für mich ist es ein Spiel mit epischen Geschichten die mich über hunderte Stunden geprägt haben...
Keine Portraits, keine eigenen Sprecher, keine Dialoge mehr zwischen den bedeutenden Charakteren. Keine epische Geschichtenerzählung sondern langweiliger, unnötiger Trashtalk. Die realen Videos die ich absolut nicht ausstehen kann, da sie mich jedes mal aus dem Spiel gerissen haben.

Abschließend kann man wohl nur sagen: Es kommt halt nicht von den alten Ensemble Studios - ob da nun ein paar Köpfe von damals dabei sind oder nicht.

Es kann natürlich im Laufe der nächsten Monate / Jahre durchaus noch zu genau dem Spiel werden, was wir alle haben wollen. Durch Mods evtl. ganze Kampagnen erstellt von Usern mit Hingabe inkl. Geschichte oder selbstgedrehten historisch angehauchten Videos? Wer weiß.",2021-11-30T00:55:05Z,0

Ideally once wall is built it should be near indestructable to catapults and the attacker is instead forced to actually fight the units on the walls.,2024-12-08T21:29:54Z,0
