--{ My Personal Opinion }--
This is literally the best game I have ever played.
Even after only playing it for a few hours, taking time to level up and enjoy the gameplay this game still gives me adrenaline after beating a boss. If I had the choice to change anything, I'd change nothing.

--{ Review }--
First of all, the game's visuals are incredible. And it's landscape is very interactive. See a giant with a battleaxe thousans of miles away? You are definitely fighting him soon.. see a massive cliff that looks impossible to climb? You most definitely can. Infact loads of cliffs like that have intense lore and precious items hiding right on them and behind is a whole new world you haven't seen before.
The game's lore is also very unique. Even if you might not get it's meaning the second you finish it, soon you'll realize how beautiful it is. 
Gameplay-wise it offers a classic Dark Souls system with a dodge, jump, attack, charged attack, consume and so so much more.
If I had to describe Elden Ring with one word, it would be customization. There is so many different things you can wear, consume, places you can explore and things you can kill it's hard to keep track of everything. It's soul upgrading system offers you so much freedom you may run any build out of thousands that exist.
Although it's a challenging videogame, you may also always come back. Stuck on a boss? Don't worry, with just exploring, you may uncover a whole quest line, that will make you find a piece of equipment or an upgrading material which will make the fight easier.
But don't rely only on weapons and level since since without skill you may not get far. Personally if you want elden ring to relax, use magic, if you want to have fun play tank.

--{ Two Last Tips If You Are Still Reading }--
If you are truly struggling at a boss, or a place or you are just lost, ask. If you have discord join the Elden Ring discord server and ask there. People there are very helpful and kind, if you dont have it, download it. 
I was thinking ER community is so kind as it's there on every piece of media, but i suggest staying away from it on media platforms such as TikTok or YT. Just warning you. - (Shout-out to ""Tyrone"" for literally carrying me in-game)

And if you are struggling deciding between buying it or not. Buy it, its so much fun.",True,342,43
"Throughout my years as a gamer, few adventures have truly left me in awe. Yet, stepping into the Lands Between reignited a sense of wonder I hadn’t felt since childhood.

The intricate lore, compelling characters, and masterfully crafted world drew me in completely. Every word spoken and every fragment of text unearthed felt like a piece of a vast, living puzzle.

The challenges weren’t punishing for the sake of it. They demanded adaptation, encouraged growth, and rewarded perseverance. Instead of frustration, I found myself inspired to refine my strategies and think creatively.

It reminded me how much I have missed truly open-world exploration, free from handholding or unnecessary distractions. Elden Ring is a masterpiece, a world that does not just ask to be played, but to be lived in, savored, and remembered long after the journey ends.

11/10 – An absolute masterpiece.",True,106,1
"My favorite game. It's not just a game but an incredible adventure and journey of exploration. Its open world was massive, encouraging me to visit and explore every region and corner. I was amazed by the variety of bosses, the diversity of weapons and armor, and the combat mechanics. Each build offers a completely different gaming experience. The different builds I tried —warrior, mage, and samurai— were all fantastic in their own way. Most players don't realize it, but the game's lore provides a deep and fascinating world. Moreover, the boss designs and music were absolutely stunning.

""The fallen leaves tell a story"" ♡",True,38,3
"""The fallen leaves tell a story.""

So... having started another run with a brand new (11th I think) character, I must confess that after all these years the beginning sequence still gives me goosebumps.
Don't know what more I can say, so let THIS be my review.

P.S. Have been playing ER on three different laptops with mouse+kb only. Never had problems with optimisation or controls.
P.P.S. There's no option to marry Millicent. It upsets me deeply.
P.P.P.S. Try finger but hole.",True,7,1
"Oh boy, where do I even start with Elden Ring? Imagine a game where the devs were like, ""Let's make every blade of grass deadly."" You step into this gorgeous world, thinking, ""This looks like a chill spot for a picnic,"" only to realize the picnic's actually your wake.

The graphics? Chef's kiss. It's like you're inside a Van Gogh painting, but every stroke wants to off you. The landscapes are so stunning, you'll forget to breathe – until you fall off a cliff.

Combat in Elden Ring isn't about skill; it's about how many times you can bash your head against a wall before you get it right. Every boss fight feels like they've got a personal beef with you. They're just there to mock your sad attempts at living. (git gud)

The lore? Man, it's deep. So deep you'd need a submarine to get to the bottom of it. And just when you think you've got it, some NPC comes along with a backstory that could be its own book. Good luck figuring out the story; it's like doing a puzzle blindfolded.

But here's the thing: despite all the pain, the frustration, the ""I'm uninstalling this"" moments, you can't help but love it. There's something about Elden Ring that pulls you back, like a moth to a flame, or a player to their doom.

Final Verdict: 10/10 - Would die over and over again. Elden Ring isn't just a game; it's a way of life. A life of pain, beauty, and the occasional scream into the abyss. If you want something that'll test your patience, your skill, and your swear-word collection, this is it.",True,4,2
"One of my favourite games. It really pushes the FromSoftware formula the next level, bringing the immersive and challenging combat into an open world setting with tons of interesting story, locations, characters and bosses with almost all the open space feeling purposeful. There is certainly no shortage of content, this game is very long.

It is probably the best introduction for a new player into these kinds of games, providing a fairly slow start with an actual tutorial for the first time. But don't get upset if you struggle, you always will at first, maybe for ages, but eventually you'll feel great as you turn impossible obstacles into a breeze. And don't let people tell you using items or character optimising is cheating, though summoning players can lead to them playing the game for you.",True,6,2
"This is the best game I've ever played and it has the most replay ability out of any RPG I've ever played. You might not like the game immediately due to it not holding your hand, but I promise you that you'll love this game if you simply ""get good"" and learn how to play the game. Most people who don't like this game is honestly due to a skill issue.",True,20,3
"Elden Ring, without question, is one of the greatest games ever made. More than any other FromSoft game, it grants it's player the feeling that their character, whether they be an esteemed warrior named ""Bardiun of the Blotted Age,"" or a punching man named ""bun,"" is the single most important person to ever exist, and has endured more than any other. The game is beautiful, horrifying, badass, and exhausting. I have no doubt that even if hundreds more incredible open world RPGs come out in the future, this one will never stop being remarkable.",True,3,0
"This is it people, this is the perfect game.

Elden ring has everything, an open world that feels full of life and surprises.
Tons of bosses,epic questlines,multiple endings,so many builds to try, and a Gameplay that is the result of all dark souls experience combined and made better
Some dungeons are more epic than full games.
Only thing i wish they added is the possibility to unlock fps, but that can be done using mods.
If you are hesitant to get this, please do yourself a favor and get it.",True,7,1
"An amazing game and the first fromsoft title i've beaten.

not as difficult as others make it out to be, people act like this game is super hard 100% of the time but while it can challenging this game gives you a lot of room to explore and level your character so anytime you feel like a boss is too hard you can just go explore or do one of the many side quests available and then return once your strong enough.",True,4,0

Aditionaly you may get lost in the begining but thats what makes fun live when we were younger and gamers didnt even understand the controls, Making us as gamers have to and plan & prepare our next move. That is some of the reasons this game is so replayable therefore i give this game a 10/10

no game has really sucked me in like this in a long time the gameplay is fucking fire the story is fire im not quite done with the game yet ive just beaten morgott but this game is amazing and i will say worth full price i love this game its peak,True,1,0
"I genuinely don't think any other open world game (except Breath of the Wild) gave me anything close to the feelings I got when playing this game. An open world always felt like the natural progression from the semi-linear world of dark souls 1, and felt incredible to actually go through and explore. I can keep gushing about the art direction, the graphics, the smoothness of the gameplay, and just how wide your options really are in defining your own playstyle. 

However, there is 1 thing that really bothered me that I must say even though I love this game to death. On PC specifically, even with quality specs I ran into lots of frame drops (even worse in DLC areas) that made the experience occassionally less than enjoyable. Since so much of this game relies on being able to react and dodge attacks, having frame drops and stuttering at key moments in fights leads to situations where you getting hit is completely out of your hands. I do hope they step up their optimization for elden ring Nightreign, but as of now I don't see any further updates to fix the framerate issues on PC for this game, so if you have an old setup I would recommend against buying this due to poor optimization.

But regardless of the performance, this is still one of the most expansive and beautiful games that i've played in my life 👍",True,1,0

"it took 135 hours until I reached the ending (Base game).
There's a lot of exploration, a very wide map, lots of characters and an epic story even though I had to look at the background story of each character on online forums, because what is explained in the game is not detailed.
I also missed some items because I took the wrong steps, and there was no way to get these items other than repeating the story again. actually it doesn't have much of an impact, because there are so many other builds that can still be used.
I am quite satisfied, overall this is a good game.

"As someone who has previously never thought about playing a Elden Ring or any other Soulslike games. For maybe fear of them being too difficult and not being able to enjoy them. 

Playing through Elden Ring has made me realise that overcoming many of the challenges in the game is not only fun but very rewarding.",True,1,0
"My first dive into the Soulslike genre, and while it felt pretty overwhelming at times, it was still an unforgettable adventure. It’s like being dropped into a stunning, mysterious world and then immediately getting slapped around by everything in it.

The graphics and soundtrack are absolutely breathtaking, but the movement can feel like trying to steer a shopping cart with a broken wheel sometimes.

The story can get a bit confusing, and some bosses might take hours (or even days haha) to beat, which can be frustrating — but also fun. That said, the game doesn’t demand that you take on the big bosses right away. Instead, it lets you wander aimlessly through its breathtaking world, explore to your heart’s content, or tackle easier bosses. This freedom makes overcoming the tougher challenges feel much more achievable.

Overall, it’s a great game in many aspects, though I think it’s a bit overhyped and has room for improvement.",True,2,0
"What is there to say? A whole genre of 'Souls-like' games has been condensed into this powerful, masterfully crafted experience. The lore, the gameplay, the art direction—everything in this game reflects the passion and commitment FromSoftware put into it. This game is not for every gamer, as it is indeed heavy and difficult, but the effort required to learn and adapt is more than worth it.",True,1,0
"Beautiful, lore rich world. Tons upon tons of content, some of the best gameplay I have ever experienced. Fantastic selection of weapons, spells, armors and so on. Just as skill-based as any previous From Soft game. 

I sincerely recommend picking this up because it's an unforgettable gaming experience filled to brim with things to fight, find and conquer.  And best of all, it has multiplayer, so you and your friends can choose to fight or cooperate with each other.

I have to warn you, it's a huge and often confusing game, with too much happening to keep track of, but that's how it's supposed to be, be prepared to be overwhelmed, be prepared to die a lot, things will take a while to learn and master. Another thing worth mentioning is that the game is stunning, while not having the best pure graphical fidelity, the artstyle is phenomenal and often will leave you breathless with it's varied and beautiful scenery.

Of the few games I think are actually worth the full price too, I recommend getting it with DLC because that too is really good and honestly you save quite a bit if you buy them bundled.

[b]10/10[/b] It's not perfect, but it's damn close.",True,1,0
"The game isn’t truly cooperative, despite how it may present itself. It's a single player game with multiplayer in the form of help or hindrance, but no actual co-op mode. Which is

If you’re looking for a fun gameplay experience with a friend - without having to essentially play the game twice, both of you having Torrent, dealing with location restrictions, or the frustration of grinding Erd flowers - I recommend the free mod [b]Seamless Co-op (Elden Ring)[/b] by Yui, available on nexusmods com. 
This isn’t an ad, just a positive experience. It fixes the disappointment of broken expectations when the game was initially bought for a two-player adventure.",True,1,0
"Bom, alerta de spoiler!


Muito bom, o jogo tem um arsenal avassalador de armas, arcos, cajados, e muitos tipos de coisas. O que mais se destaca no jogo é sua mecânica Soulslike que além de valorizar bastante cada boss que você derrota, além de começar a se ver como um oponente maior, já que cada boss derrotado vira um oponente normal, e o jogo tem um sistema interessante de inteligencia artificial que deixa alguns inimigos bem únicos, os graficos deixam um pouco a desejar, a nitidez também, mas é algo que não atrapalha, por instinto vou recomendar que comprei, o jogo é muito bom e se encaixa perfeitamente em perfil de um alguém que gosta de sofrer, porque Parkour e montanha não falta pra você morrer de queda.",True,1,0

"[h1] Put a Ring on it [/h1]

[hr][/hr]

[h2] An honest review from a non soulslike person [/h2]

[h3] World and atmosphere: 10/10 [/h3]
In Elden Ring, every step is a story, every landscape – a painting. The world created by FromSoftware is vast, but not just in size, but also in detail. Every corner of the map feels alive, full of history, even if that history often involves a boss who wants to destroy you in the most creative ways possible.

[h3] Gameplay and Difficulty: 15/10 [/h3]
It's hard. Very hard. But not in the way that makes you quit, but in the way that makes you say, ""Yeah, I want one more fight, because I'm a legend and nobody can stop me."" Each boss is a test of nerves, reflexes and the desire to see that little notification telling you that you've beaten him. [b] And yes, I finished the game with no cheesy tactics. So I'm officially the coolest man in the world. [/b]

[h3] Achievements: Hardcore/10 [/h3]
Since I'm a gamer who wants to complete every aspect of the game and get all the achievements regardless if it means selling my soul, I can clearly say that getting 100% completion is extremely difficult to impossible without one or more guides, items more hidden than some bosses, and let's not forget the end of the game where you have to choose between several endings and I had to go into the game files to make a backup so that I don't have to play the game again 3 times 💀

[h3] Story: WTF/10 [/h3]
Miyazaki knows how to tell a story, but he won't blow your mind. Everything is cryptic, fragmented, hidden in the description of objects and cryptic dialogues. So you'll feel lost, but in a nice way. It's the kind of story that makes you search youtube for explanations at 2am or something idk.

[h3] Conclusion: 11/10 – The legend continues [/h3]
[u] Elden Ring is not just a game [/u] - it's a test of endurance, an artistic masterpiece, and a story about how cool you are for finishing it. If you have the courage to enter this world and the determination not to give up after the 50th failure, you will have one of the most satisfying gaming experiences of your life.

But until then, remember: [b] I finished it. I am the legend. [/b]

"After 15 years of playing Fromsoftware games and beating and enjoying them all my thoughts are this: The games are enjoyable amazing even until they aren't anymore. Im so sick of spending hours to get a good enough run without dying in order to feel confident that continuing will deliver a sense of reward. Its a rather brutal cycle and I feel like these games set you up to have this experience almost every time, my advice: avoid playing if your bar is very high for enjoyment, or your time is limited. Also don't think even about playing if you have reward processing deficeits it will chew you up and spit you out in a way normal ""hardcore"" gamers dont understand. I feel so many people who are passionate about the franchise don't get to enjoy the game for what it asks of you and thats a big problem. Maybe Elden Ring - Nightreign will be different",False,11,7

These issues are often times something the entire PC gaming community as a whole blasts. You MUST use mods to get rid of the bad vignette, remove the black bars from the ultra-wide resolution and fix the camera for mouse and keyboard playing. 
That being said, I completely understand why a lot of people like the game.

"I got this game a month or two after it came out and my only regret is not purchasing it the day it came out. Since I bought it I have put over 800 hours into different characters and builds and there is still so many builds I haven't tried yet. The first playthrough you have of Elden Ring is a truly magic experience. I have played a lot of games in my life and very few have been able to do feel that same magic. Elden Ring was my first Souls Game and it was a brutal first playthrough. I spent somewhere in the range of 165-175 hours on my first playthrough, and I didn't even get a lot of the content that was there, and this was before the DLC. It was brutal learning to do these tough boss fights, but very few times I did not enjoy it. Most of the bosses are tough, but fair. And if you want to get into Soulsborne games, Elden Ring is the best first choice. While the dark souls games reward perseverance and determination, Elden Ring rewards exploring when you are stuck on a boss.

I'm not going to discuss the DLC specifically but the game as whole including the DLC. It is all beautiful. There are so many vistas in this game that will make your jaw drop to the floor. As always, FromSoftware also does an amazing job with environmental storytelling. There are so many unsettling moments that tell the player about the story. Elden Ring really feels like the culmination of all that they have learned from their past titles.

One bit of advice if you buy and play this game: just know that there is a specific way to respec your stats later, so don't be scared to play around with tons of different builds! My favorite part about Elden Ring is that almost every single build can be made to be viable in one way or another, so you really can play your own way and not be punished.",True,1,0

"Elden Ring: A Masterpiece of Challenge and Wonder
Elden Ring is nothing short of extraordinary. FromSoftware has crafted a game that blends punishing difficulty, breathtaking visuals, and a rich, enigmatic story into an unforgettable experience. It’s a game that demands patience, skill, and dedication, but rewards you with moments of triumph that feel earned and deeply satisfying.

Gameplay and Boss Fights
At the heart of Elden Ring is its combat and boss design. Each encounter feels like a battle of wits and skill, with every boss offering unique challenges that test your abilities. Yes, the bosses are hard—brutally so—but overcoming them is one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming. Grinding through the world to grow stronger adds depth to the journey, making every victory even sweeter.

A Stunning Open World
The landscape of Elden Ring is a work of art. From the haunting beauty of its castles to the eerie swamps and towering mountains, the game world feels alive and filled with mystery. Exploring every corner uncovers secrets, hidden dungeons, and awe-inspiring vistas that make the grind a joy rather than a chore. It’s a world you’ll lose yourself in for countless hours.

Lore and Storytelling
Elden Ring’s lore is captivating and layered. Written in collaboration with George R.R. Martin, the game’s story invites players to piece together its mysteries through cryptic dialogue, item descriptions, and environmental storytelling. It’s a world rich with history and intrigue, pulling you deeper into its mythos as you play.

DLC That Delivers
The DLC expands on an already incredible experience, offering more content, tougher challenges, and even deeper lore. Unlike many games, Elden Ring’s DLC feels like a true extension of the base game, packed with value and care.

Verdict
Elden Ring is a monumental achievement in gaming—a perfect blend of challenge, beauty, and depth. It’s a game that respects its players’ time and rewards their perseverance with unparalleled moments of triumph and discovery.

Coming straight out of Dark Souls 1 I was already used to certain mechanics, but the dodge timing and parrying was definitely challenging in the begging due to this game's fast paced combat with some of the enemies inflicting passive damage debuffs. It's not for everyone to say the least. 

One thing I wish this game had though that should be incorporated to more games with character customisation style mechanics is the ability to ""transmog"" armour sets or at the very least offer more options to alter all armour pieces. The altering mechanic is pretty useless in my opinion given the fact that 9/10 times it's just removing a cape, or a piece of cloth on a chest piece, or head, etc. and inevitably lowering stats as a result. The limitations of such a mechanic can be pretty frustrating also, since it's only a very small handful of chest and head armour that can be potentially altered. 

The combat becomes increasingly difficult in some scenarios forcing you to think carefully and outside the box on how to approach it, which makes for an exciting and rewarding experience when you do figure it out eventually. Death becomes a natural learning tool as it has for many ""Souls like"" game in the past. Ultimately a fantastic game throughout. Much like Sekiro, I'd highly recommend this game if you're up for a challenge.",True,1,0
