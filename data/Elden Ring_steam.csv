--{ My Personal Opinion }--
This is literally the best game I have ever played.
Even after only playing it for a few hours, taking time to level up and enjoy the gameplay this game still gives me adrenaline after beating a boss. If I had the choice to change anything, I'd change nothing.

--{ Review }--
First of all, the game's visuals are incredible. And it's landscape is very interactive. See a giant with a battleaxe thousans of miles away? You are definitely fighting him soon.. see a massive cliff that looks impossible to climb? You most definitely can. Infact loads of cliffs like that have intense lore and precious items hiding right on them and behind is a whole new world you haven't seen before.
The game's lore is also very unique. Even if you might not get it's meaning the second you finish it, soon you'll realize how beautiful it is. 
Gameplay-wise it offers a classic Dark Souls system with a dodge, jump, attack, charged attack, consume and so so much more.
If I had to describe Elden Ring with one word, it would be customization. There is so many different things you can wear, consume, places you can explore and things you can kill it's hard to keep track of everything. It's soul upgrading system offers you so much freedom you may run any build out of thousands that exist.
Although it's a challenging videogame, you may also always come back. Stuck on a boss? Don't worry, with just exploring, you may uncover a whole quest line, that will make you find a piece of equipment or an upgrading material which will make the fight easier.
But don't rely only on weapons and level since since without skill you may not get far. Personally if you want elden ring to relax, use magic, if you want to have fun play tank.

--{ Two Last Tips If You Are Still Reading }--
If you are truly struggling at a boss, or a place or you are just lost, ask. If you have discord join the Elden Ring discord server and ask there. People there are very helpful and kind, if you dont have it, download it. 
I was thinking ER community is so kind as it's there on every piece of media, but i suggest staying away from it on media platforms such as TikTok or YT. Just warning you. - (Shout-out to ""Tyrone"" for literally carrying me in-game)

And if you are struggling deciding between buying it or not. Buy it, its so much fun.",True,353,45
"Throughout my years as a gamer, few adventures have truly left me in awe. Yet, stepping into the Lands Between reignited a sense of wonder I hadn’t felt since childhood.

The intricate lore, compelling characters, and masterfully crafted world drew me in completely. Every word spoken and every fragment of text unearthed felt like a piece of a vast, living puzzle.

The challenges weren’t punishing for the sake of it. They demanded adaptation, encouraged growth, and rewarded perseverance. Instead of frustration, I found myself inspired to refine my strategies and think creatively.

It reminded me how much I have missed truly open-world exploration, free from handholding or unnecessary distractions. Elden Ring is a masterpiece, a world that does not just ask to be played, but to be lived in, savored, and remembered long after the journey ends.

11/10 – An absolute masterpiece.",True,108,1
"My favorite game. It's not just a game but an incredible adventure and journey of exploration. Its open world was massive, encouraging me to visit and explore every region and corner. I was amazed by the variety of bosses, the diversity of weapons and armor, and the combat mechanics. Each build offers a completely different gaming experience. The different builds I tried —warrior, mage, and samurai— were all fantastic in their own way. Most players don't realize it, but the game's lore provides a deep and fascinating world. Moreover, the boss designs and music were absolutely stunning.

""The fallen leaves tell a story"" ♡",True,38,3
"Oh boy, where do I even start with Elden Ring? Imagine a game where the devs were like, ""Let's make every blade of grass deadly."" You step into this gorgeous world, thinking, ""This looks like a chill spot for a picnic,"" only to realize the picnic's actually your wake.

The graphics? Chef's kiss. It's like you're inside a Van Gogh painting, but every stroke wants to off you. The landscapes are so stunning, you'll forget to breathe – until you fall off a cliff.

Combat in Elden Ring isn't about skill; it's about how many times you can bash your head against a wall before you get it right. Every boss fight feels like they've got a personal beef with you. They're just there to mock your sad attempts at living. (git gud)

The lore? Man, it's deep. So deep you'd need a submarine to get to the bottom of it. And just when you think you've got it, some NPC comes along with a backstory that could be its own book. Good luck figuring out the story; it's like doing a puzzle blindfolded.

But here's the thing: despite all the pain, the frustration, the ""I'm uninstalling this"" moments, you can't help but love it. There's something about Elden Ring that pulls you back, like a moth to a flame, or a player to their doom.

Final Verdict: 10/10 - Would die over and over again. Elden Ring isn't just a game; it's a way of life. A life of pain, beauty, and the occasional scream into the abyss. If you want something that'll test your patience, your skill, and your swear-word collection, this is it.",True,4,2
"One of my favourite games. It really pushes the FromSoftware formula the next level, bringing the immersive and challenging combat into an open world setting with tons of interesting story, locations, characters and bosses with almost all the open space feeling purposeful. There is certainly no shortage of content, this game is very long.

It is probably the best introduction for a new player into these kinds of games, providing a fairly slow start with an actual tutorial for the first time. But don't get upset if you struggle, you always will at first, maybe for ages, but eventually you'll feel great as you turn impossible obstacles into a breeze. And don't let people tell you using items or character optimising is cheating, though summoning players can lead to them playing the game for you.",True,6,2
"This is the best game I've ever played and it has the most replay ability out of any RPG I've ever played. You might not like the game immediately due to it not holding your hand, but I promise you that you'll love this game if you simply ""get good"" and learn how to play the game. Most people who don't like this game is honestly due to a skill issue.",True,20,3
"Elden Ring, without question, is one of the greatest games ever made. More than any other FromSoft game, it grants it's player the feeling that their character, whether they be an esteemed warrior named ""Bardiun of the Blotted Age,"" or a punching man named ""bun,"" is the single most important person to ever exist, and has endured more than any other. The game is beautiful, horrifying, badass, and exhausting. I have no doubt that even if hundreds more incredible open world RPGs come out in the future, this one will never stop being remarkable.",True,3,0
"This is it people, this is the perfect game.

Elden ring has everything, an open world that feels full of life and surprises.
Tons of bosses,epic questlines,multiple endings,so many builds to try, and a Gameplay that is the result of all dark souls experience combined and made better
Some dungeons are more epic than full games.
Only thing i wish they added is the possibility to unlock fps, but that can be done using mods.
If you are hesitant to get this, please do yourself a favor and get it.",True,7,1
"An amazing game and the first fromsoft title i've beaten.

not as difficult as others make it out to be, people act like this game is super hard 100% of the time but while it can challenging this game gives you a lot of room to explore and level your character so anytime you feel like a boss is too hard you can just go explore or do one of the many side quests available and then return once your strong enough.",True,4,0

"Elden ring a game which you are faced with many challenges but given the proper way to advance through the players choice. Aditionaly you may get lost in the begining but thats what makes fun live when we were younger and gamers didnt even understand the controls, Making us as gamers have to and plan & prepare our next move. That is some of the reasons this game is so replayable therefore i give this game a 10/10

no game has really sucked me in like this in a long time the gameplay is fucking fire the story is fire im not quite done with the game yet ive just beaten morgott but this game is amazing and i will say worth full price i love this game its peak,True,1,0
"I genuinely don't think any other open world game (except Breath of the Wild) gave me anything close to the feelings I got when playing this game. An open world always felt like the natural progression from the semi-linear world of dark souls 1, and felt incredible to actually go through and explore. I can keep gushing about the art direction, the graphics, the smoothness of the gameplay, and just how wide your options really are in defining your own playstyle. 

However, there is 1 thing that really bothered me that I must say even though I love this game to death. On PC specifically, even with quality specs I ran into lots of frame drops (even worse in DLC areas) that made the experience occassionally less than enjoyable. Since so much of this game relies on being able to react and dodge attacks, having frame drops and stuttering at key moments in fights leads to situations where you getting hit is completely out of your hands. I do hope they step up their optimization for elden ring Nightreign, but as of now I don't see any further updates to fix the framerate issues on PC for this game, so if you have an old setup I would recommend against buying this due to poor optimization.

But regardless of the performance, this is still one of the most expansive and beautiful games that i've played in my life 👍",True,1,0

"it took 135 hours until I reached the ending (Base game).
There's a lot of exploration, a very wide map, lots of characters and an epic story even though I had to look at the background story of each character on online forums, because what is explained in the game is not detailed.
I also missed some items because I took the wrong steps, and there was no way to get these items other than repeating the story again. actually it doesn't have much of an impact, because there are so many other builds that can still be used.
I am quite satisfied, overall this is a good game.

"As someone who has previously never thought about playing a Elden Ring or any other Soulslike games. For maybe fear of them being too difficult and not being able to enjoy them. 

Playing through Elden Ring has made me realise that overcoming many of the challenges in the game is not only fun but very rewarding.",True,1,0
"My first dive into the Soulslike genre, and while it felt pretty overwhelming at times, it was still an unforgettable adventure. It’s like being dropped into a stunning, mysterious world and then immediately getting slapped around by everything in it.

The graphics and soundtrack are absolutely breathtaking, but the movement can feel like trying to steer a shopping cart with a broken wheel sometimes.

The story can get a bit confusing, and some bosses might take hours (or even days haha) to beat, which can be frustrating — but also fun. That said, the game doesn’t demand that you take on the big bosses right away. Instead, it lets you wander aimlessly through its breathtaking world, explore to your heart’s content, or tackle easier bosses. This freedom makes overcoming the tougher challenges feel much more achievable.

Overall, it’s a great game in many aspects, though I think it’s a bit overhyped and has room for improvement.",True,2,0
"What is there to say? A whole genre of 'Souls-like' games has been condensed into this powerful, masterfully crafted experience. The lore, the gameplay, the art direction—everything in this game reflects the passion and commitment FromSoftware put into it. This game is not for every gamer, as it is indeed heavy and difficult, but the effort required to learn and adapt is more than worth it.",True,1,0
"Beautiful, lore rich world. Tons upon tons of content, some of the best gameplay I have ever experienced. Fantastic selection of weapons, spells, armors and so on. Just as skill-based as any previous From Soft game. 

I sincerely recommend picking this up because it's an unforgettable gaming experience filled to brim with things to fight, find and conquer.  And best of all, it has multiplayer, so you and your friends can choose to fight or cooperate with each other.

I have to warn you, it's a huge and often confusing game, with too much happening to keep track of, but that's how it's supposed to be, be prepared to be overwhelmed, be prepared to die a lot, things will take a while to learn and master. Another thing worth mentioning is that the game is stunning, while not having the best pure graphical fidelity, the artstyle is phenomenal and often will leave you breathless with it's varied and beautiful scenery.

Of the few games I think are actually worth the full price too, I recommend getting it with DLC because that too is really good and honestly you save quite a bit if you buy them bundled.

[b]10/10[/b] It's not perfect, but it's damn close.",True,1,0
"The game isn’t truly cooperative, despite how it may present itself. It's a single player game with multiplayer in the form of help or hindrance, but no actual co-op mode. Which is

If you’re looking for a fun gameplay experience with a friend - without having to essentially play the game twice, both of you having Torrent, dealing with location restrictions, or the frustration of grinding Erd flowers - I recommend the free mod [b]Seamless Co-op (Elden Ring)[/b] by Yui, available on nexusmods com. 
This isn’t an ad, just a positive experience. It fixes the disappointment of broken expectations when the game was initially bought for a two-player adventure.",True,1,0
"Bom, alerta de spoiler!


Muito bom, o jogo tem um arsenal avassalador de armas, arcos, cajados, e muitos tipos de coisas. O que mais se destaca no jogo é sua mecânica Soulslike que além de valorizar bastante cada boss que você derrota, além de começar a se ver como um oponente maior, já que cada boss derrotado vira um oponente normal, e o jogo tem um sistema interessante de inteligencia artificial que deixa alguns inimigos bem únicos, os graficos deixam um pouco a desejar, a nitidez também, mas é algo que não atrapalha, por instinto vou recomendar que comprei, o jogo é muito bom e se encaixa perfeitamente em perfil de um alguém que gosta de sofrer, porque Parkour e montanha não falta pra você morrer de queda.",True,1,0

"[h1] Put a Ring on it [/h1]

[hr][/hr]

[h2] An honest review from a non soulslike person [/h2]

[h3] World and atmosphere: 10/10 [/h3]
In Elden Ring, every step is a story, every landscape – a painting. The world created by FromSoftware is vast, but not just in size, but also in detail. Every corner of the map feels alive, full of history, even if that history often involves a boss who wants to destroy you in the most creative ways possible.

[h3] Gameplay and Difficulty: 15/10 [/h3]
It's hard. Very hard. But not in the way that makes you quit, but in the way that makes you say, ""Yeah, I want one more fight, because I'm a legend and nobody can stop me."" Each boss is a test of nerves, reflexes and the desire to see that little notification telling you that you've beaten him. [b] And yes, I finished the game with no cheesy tactics. So I'm officially the coolest man in the world. [/b]

[h3] Achievements: Hardcore/10 [/h3]
Since I'm a gamer who wants to complete every aspect of the game and get all the achievements regardless if it means selling my soul, I can clearly say that getting 100% completion is extremely difficult to impossible without one or more guides, items more hidden than some bosses, and let's not forget the end of the game where you have to choose between several endings and I had to go into the game files to make a backup so that I don't have to play the game again 3 times 💀

[h3] Story: WTF/10 [/h3]
Miyazaki knows how to tell a story, but he won't blow your mind. Everything is cryptic, fragmented, hidden in the description of objects and cryptic dialogues. So you'll feel lost, but in a nice way. It's the kind of story that makes you search youtube for explanations at 2am or something idk.

[h3] Conclusion: 11/10 – The legend continues [/h3]
[u] Elden Ring is not just a game [/u] - it's a test of endurance, an artistic masterpiece, and a story about how cool you are for finishing it. If you have the courage to enter this world and the determination not to give up after the 50th failure, you will have one of the most satisfying gaming experiences of your life.

But until then, remember: [b] I finished it. I am the legend. [/b]

"After 15 years of playing Fromsoftware games and beating and enjoying them all my thoughts are this: The games are enjoyable amazing even until they aren't anymore. Im so sick of spending hours to get a good enough run without dying in order to feel confident that continuing will deliver a sense of reward. Its a rather brutal cycle and I feel like these games set you up to have this experience almost every time, my advice: avoid playing if your bar is very high for enjoyment, or your time is limited. Also don't think even about playing if you have reward processing deficeits it will chew you up and spit you out in a way normal ""hardcore"" gamers dont understand. I feel so many people who are passionate about the franchise don't get to enjoy the game for what it asks of you and thats a big problem. Maybe Elden Ring - Nightreign will be different",False,13,7

These issues are often times something the entire PC gaming community as a whole blasts. You MUST use mods to get rid of the bad vignette, remove the black bars from the ultra-wide resolution and fix the camera for mouse and keyboard playing. 
That being said, I completely understand why a lot of people like the game.

"I got this game a month or two after it came out and my only regret is not purchasing it the day it came out. Since I bought it I have put over 800 hours into different characters and builds and there is still so many builds I haven't tried yet. The first playthrough you have of Elden Ring is a truly magic experience. I have played a lot of games in my life and very few have been able to do feel that same magic. Elden Ring was my first Souls Game and it was a brutal first playthrough. I spent somewhere in the range of 165-175 hours on my first playthrough, and I didn't even get a lot of the content that was there, and this was before the DLC. It was brutal learning to do these tough boss fights, but very few times I did not enjoy it. Most of the bosses are tough, but fair. And if you want to get into Soulsborne games, Elden Ring is the best first choice. While the dark souls games reward perseverance and determination, Elden Ring rewards exploring when you are stuck on a boss.

I'm not going to discuss the DLC specifically but the game as whole including the DLC. It is all beautiful. There are so many vistas in this game that will make your jaw drop to the floor. As always, FromSoftware also does an amazing job with environmental storytelling. There are so many unsettling moments that tell the player about the story. Elden Ring really feels like the culmination of all that they have learned from their past titles.

One bit of advice if you buy and play this game: just know that there is a specific way to respec your stats later, so don't be scared to play around with tons of different builds! My favorite part about Elden Ring is that almost every single build can be made to be viable in one way or another, so you really can play your own way and not be punished.",True,1,0

"Elden Ring: A Masterpiece of Challenge and Wonder
Elden Ring is nothing short of extraordinary. FromSoftware has crafted a game that blends punishing difficulty, breathtaking visuals, and a rich, enigmatic story into an unforgettable experience. It’s a game that demands patience, skill, and dedication, but rewards you with moments of triumph that feel earned and deeply satisfying.

Gameplay and Boss Fights
At the heart of Elden Ring is its combat and boss design. Each encounter feels like a battle of wits and skill, with every boss offering unique challenges that test your abilities. Yes, the bosses are hard—brutally so—but overcoming them is one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming. Grinding through the world to grow stronger adds depth to the journey, making every victory even sweeter.

A Stunning Open World
The landscape of Elden Ring is a work of art. From the haunting beauty of its castles to the eerie swamps and towering mountains, the game world feels alive and filled with mystery. Exploring every corner uncovers secrets, hidden dungeons, and awe-inspiring vistas that make the grind a joy rather than a chore. It’s a world you’ll lose yourself in for countless hours.

Lore and Storytelling
Elden Ring’s lore is captivating and layered. Written in collaboration with George R.R. Martin, the game’s story invites players to piece together its mysteries through cryptic dialogue, item descriptions, and environmental storytelling. It’s a world rich with history and intrigue, pulling you deeper into its mythos as you play.

DLC That Delivers
The DLC expands on an already incredible experience, offering more content, tougher challenges, and even deeper lore. Unlike many games, Elden Ring’s DLC feels like a true extension of the base game, packed with value and care.

Verdict
Elden Ring is a monumental achievement in gaming—a perfect blend of challenge, beauty, and depth. It’s a game that respects its players’ time and rewards their perseverance with unparalleled moments of triumph and discovery.

"Elden Ring definitely has a bit of a learning curve to get past. But ultimately a fun and rewarding experience. Coming straight out of Dark Souls 1 I was already used to certain mechanics, but the dodge timing and parrying was definitely challenging in the begging due to this game's fast paced combat with some of the enemies inflicting passive damage debuffs. It's not for everyone to say the least. 

One thing I wish this game had though that should be incorporated to more games with character customisation style mechanics is the ability to ""transmog"" armour sets or at the very least offer more options to alter all armour pieces. The altering mechanic is pretty useless in my opinion given the fact that 9/10 times it's just removing a cape, or a piece of cloth on a chest piece, or head, etc. and inevitably lowering stats as a result. The limitations of such a mechanic can be pretty frustrating also, since it's only a very small handful of chest and head armour that can be potentially altered. 

The combat becomes increasingly difficult in some scenarios forcing you to think carefully and outside the box on how to approach it, which makes for an exciting and rewarding experience when you do figure it out eventually. Death becomes a natural learning tool as it has for many ""Souls like"" game in the past. Ultimately a fantastic game throughout. Much like Sekiro, I'd highly recommend this game if you're up for a challenge.",True,1,0

"Everyone has hyped this game up since it launched and never understood why nor did I give it a chance. I recently saw so many clips and shorts on YouTube about the game and slowly built a strong pull to play the game. I now have 20 hours in and I have been itching to play it more. It is one of the most exciting games I have played in a long time and if you're on the fence about playing the game, do it. Its worth it. The game starts off challenging but gets easier as you explore and defeat enemies around the map. Do it. Commit. It is worth it and I am exciting to continue my play through.",True,1,0

"My very first souls game. I had friends try to introduce me to the previous titles, specifically Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1. I only played with friends and never gave them a fair chance on my own. I, like many people, had the biased belief that these games were unnecessarily difficult and I didn't think I'd enjoy the worlds. Elden Ring proved me very wrong. 

The gameplay can be difficult but it is absolutely necessary. It is simply a challenge, and they give you many tools and methods to get over said challenge. Trial and error. The world and lore/story is beautiful and wonderful to explore and learn about. Many people say Elden Ring does not have a story, and I find that wildly insane. It has a very rich and engaging story, it's just told to you in a different way. It's easy to ignore the details and just try and run quickly through areas, but really taking a moment and analyzing the sounds and your surroundings can tell you so much about the area you're in and the people that inhabited it. But so much of the plot I feel is told directly to you. The dialogue can be confusing since they use almost a Shakespearean type dialogue. But I feel like it's pretty easy to figure out what they mean, and there's always google. 

I get how people don't like how co-op and PVP is integrated. It does take a lot of extra steps that other games stream line. Personally I think the extra steps are cool, because it applies lore reasons to how/why this is possible. But at the same time, that cool factor diminishes frequentlly. My same criticism applies for how you respec your character. Having a finite amount of the item required to respec is kinda silly. I get why they do it, but it was kind of a headache to go find all of them just so I could try this really cool weapon/spell/incantation I just got. 

All in all Elden Ring is one of the very few games I would say is a 10/10.

softcaps are too steep of a dropoff. going from ~30-50 hp gained per vigor from level 10-60, and then 60-61 giving 6hp is criminal. its very obvious what the softcaps are if you pay attention to how much they improve your character, and that makes builds a lot more cookie-cutter than you might otherwise want. yeah i think that if you invest 89 levels into health you should have a lot more health than someone who only invested 50, but those extra 39 levels only translate to 200 health.

softcap nitpicking aside, 9/10 game, 10/10 dlc.

"It's game of the year, I don't think I need to sell anyone on this. 

At times haunting, sad, thrilling, or funny, Elden ring is a game of truly impressive scale, that still manages a neat balance of level design and scope. The most beginner friendly of the soulslike games, I would encourage players to remember the point of games is to have fun. Play the game how you enjoy it, despite what the internet may say, in a single-player game, there is no wrong way to have fun.",True,0,0

"Ah Elden Ring, a beautiful game that I can't help but have conflicted feelings on. I have 200ish hours on console and recently purchased on Steam. It is a game that has some fantastic moments, beautiful vistas, and extremely refined mechanics, but I cannot call the best From Software title. Many of the enemies have long combos and delayed attacks designed to catch the Soulsborne veteran off guard. Some of the level design also falls short due to the scale and open nature of the game so it does not have the same perfectionism found in other titles. Overall I highly recommend, but feel it is still only their third best game I have played, behind Bloodborne and Dark Souls 2.",True,0,0
"Fans of souls games will love it, and its open world with a fresh story make it a great place for new players to start.

"Definitely a really good game, but probably not what I would consider the best of the souls games. FromSoft have evolved their design so much from Demon Souls and there are definitely bosses on display that show that best in this game. I know it's a design choice to not have a journal, or mark dungeons you've cleared, but it's pretty annoying that it isn't a feature in the game.

"After beating the game almost 155 hours later, I am simply speechless. For a game to have such minimal instruction, dialogue, and assistance, it is by far one of the best truly open world games I've ever played. This was my first ""souls"" game so I did not know what exactly to expect, but man I was not disappointed in the slightest. First game I would genuinely mean 11/10.

Do not get me wrong - It is not an easy game especially for your first play-through. I 100% understand why so many people quit without completion. You can and probably will spend hours in one area, and the occasional rage quit might happen. But after having a forte in single player open world games, completing Elden Ring has got to be the absolute most rewarding. 

I strongly recommend this to anyone still living in a cave or to anyone who has given up on their play-through. I myself debated on spending the money ""if ill probably rage quit in a few weeks"" - Just make the jump and maybe follow a guide if needed. Ill be preparing myself to now make the jump to the Erdtree DLC.

"Elden Ring is undeniably a good game, but I can’t help but feel it’s a bit overrated. While it has its strengths, it falls short of the universal praise it often receives.
At its core, Elden Ring is a Souls-like RPG with challenging combat, amazing open-world exploration, and a focus on cryptic storytelling. Unfortunately, the main story left me cold—it’s one of the most unengaging narratives I’ve encountered in a game of this scale. Surprisingly, the side quests were far more compelling, adding layers of intrigue and adventure that the main plot lacked.
The visuals? They’re decent for a game released in 2022 but far from the groundbreaking masterpiece many claim them to be. While the world design is imaginative, the technical graphics didn’t blow me away.
One of the most annoying aspects of the game is the messages left by other players. While the idea behind this system is unique and occasionally helpful, in practice, 90% of the messages are either pointless or placed in the worst spots. It’s frustrating to see them blocking levers or items I need to collect, and during fights, I’d often accidentally read a message instead of focusing on combat. Only a small fraction of these messages are genuinely useful or funny, making the whole system feel more like a distraction than a benefit.
My biggest frustrations, however, come from the game's lack of proper guidance and its pre-boss enemy encounters. Without clear direction, I spent about 20% of my playtime consulting YouTube or online guides just to figure out where to go or what to do. The game doesn’t make it easy to care about its story or even understand it, which only made me more disengaged. And those enemies before the bosses? Often more of a tedious slog than an enjoyable challenge.
That said, Elden Ring does have its moments of brilliance. The combat, though occasionally frustrating, can be immensely satisfying, especially with the variety of weapons and playstyles available. PvP adds a fun, chaotic layer to the game for those who enjoy battling other players.
In the end, Elden Ring is good, but not the untouchable masterpiece it’s often made out to be. If it weren’t for the game’s reputation, I might not recommend it. However, because it’s Elden Ring, it’s worth experiencing at least once—flaws and all.
(Oh, and as a side note: if you check out Elden Ring videos on YouTube, you’ll notice the creators tend to fit a certain ""geek"" stereotype—beards, long hair, glasses, nerdy voice. It’s just something I couldn’t help but notice.)",True,0,0

"Fromsoftware released the first ""Soulslike"" game in 2009.  They spent the next 13 years releasing sequels and learning.  Elden Ring is the result of all of that experience and hard work.  I have now bought the game twice; once PS4/PS5 and now on PC so I could play with some Mods.

The world is vast and offers the most rewarding exploration I have ever experienced in a video game.  The combat is challenging but incredibly satisfying to master. The story is deep with a ton of incredible lore however, you can ignore all of that if you want and just go kill some bosses. (Warning: You will miss out on some boss fights and cool loot if you go this route!)  The different playstyles and builds you can incorporate, as well as the satisfaction of now being able to bully bosses that gave you problems the first go around, makes this game endlessly replayable. 

A note about the difficulty.  Do not let the hype around the difficulty of Souls games dissuade you.  In the end these games are designed to be beaten.  Every attack can be dodged.  Every boss has a weakness.  The only thing that makes this game difficult is it forces you to learn it  and seek out answers. Nothing is spoon fed to you. If you are still struggling, the game gives you a ton of tools to make things easier on yourself like the ability to summon NPCs to help you fight.

There's a reason why this game was most people's game of the year in 2022 and it's excellent DLC ""Shadow of the Erdtree"" was nominated for game of the year in 2024.  Why not find out why?  I believe this is a must play for anyone who appreciates games as creative works of art.",True,0,0

I would recommend Elden Ring for it's fluid combat, extreme highs, complex and layered world building, impactful soundtrack, and gorgeous visuals even on my very bad 1060. It's difficult and it can be a chore at times, but I recommend the experience all the same <3",True,0,0
"my first souls game ever and im loving it. most people I know who dont really like the game or just stopped playing is because they say the game is super hard. i see why, the game is very hard and i love it about it. every mistake you make will get you punished, leaving no room for imperfection, having to repeat a battle over and over again until you learn how to not be greedy with attacks, what weapon is the best, what ashes of war, affinities or incantations to use. this game can be played in so many different ways. you can play casually by getting yourself a bit overleveled. you can travel the beautiful world, enjoy the views and beat the bosses slowly. you can even just go and fight bosses relying only on skill and repetition, using only casual weapons. there are so many builds you can make, if you want you can cast spells and incantations, or you can use brute force with a strength build and a heavy weapon. thus I would recommend this game if you want to enter the souls genre, but be aware that you will die, and you will get mad, so take the game slow, learn the bosses properly and enjoy it, dont rush to the end.",True,0,0
"I had no idea how great this game was. I have only played 1 other souls-like game ""lords of the fallen"" which was simply mid. Didn't have high hopes for the game because of my last experience and wow, what a difference. This game covers just about every single aspect of what truly makes a video game remarkable. The graphics are beautiful, controls are very similar to any other souls game, easily 200-300+ hours of gameplay in the base game alone. This game has completely changed the way I look at souls games and I am now a huge fan. Well done FromSoft it's truly incredible",True,0,0
"This is a really good game. The graphics are amazing and the gameplay is intense and challenging but its fair (the game is not as hard as people say). The story is interesting.

"Its a great experience, especially if you go about it with the mindset that death is part of the process of overcoming bosses and enemies. Challenge yourself and your frustration tolerance and approach each encounter like a puzzle the game is beckoning you to solve.

Its a pretty euphoric experience to watch yourself slowly getting better and finally crushing that boss or enemy that seemed impossible 40ish attempts before! >:3

"elden ring is amazing! its not my #1 favorite souls game, but its probably #2 the only times it started to feel a tad stale is what is all explore-able. (not as in how big the map is, the amount that you can explore is insane and awesome!) but what i mean is when they would recycle a boss for the end of a dungeon to use in a different one, (it doesnt happen a lot but it's noticeable) the game has lots of diverse weapon play styles and types for everyone, though unlike the last couple it does feel a little faith heavy when it come to the DLC WHICH IS ALSO INCREADIBLE! anyway, if you like a good challenge and Epic lore (provided by VaatiVidya) you'll love this game! i enjoyed it, and still play it regulalry even after 100+ hours. its really fun and an overall good experiance, esspecially when getting to play with friends (even though they could have made the unmodded co-op a little better) Thats my ted talk, thanks for coming (please excuse my horrid spelling)

"So there are some extremely poor game design errors, but that doesn't keep this from being a great game.

I recommend not playing with a browser open, with a few exceptions I'll note - because of poor game design.

1) Some weapons are absolute garbage, and if you upgrade them your materials are wasted.
2) You must upgrade your weapons (spell foci included) to be relevant.
3) While the weapons are /fairly/ diverse with mildly varied move sets, there's no way to test many different weapon types early in the game so your first weapon isn't likely to be of a type you'll actually want to use - so maybe pick the Samurai.
3b) Drop rates for some of the better weapons are terrible, and their upgrade paths hidden, so when you find a weapon you like go ahead and look up the best version of it and then go get it.
4) Unless you start with a magic class, it'll be inaccessible for a while.
4b) The Demi-human staff is a trap, it's only good on an Int dabbler not an Int main.  Go ahead and look up the meteorite staff and go get it.
5) Attributes have soft caps, so look that up before you level any stat past 20 or 40.  And you're going to want to limit your stat points to your few key Attributes - whatever they may be.
6) Parrying with a shield means you can't really use an ash of war, and that basically means parrying is irrelevant in PvE.

Dark Souls is one of the best games of the past 30 years and this is a fairly worthy successor (We won't talk about 2 & 3).   Make no mistake, this is a game about boss battles and game skill.  The game will attempt to trick you into thinking it's about fighting groups of peons, but it's not.  Timing is important.

Spirit ashes are a great addition to the Genre, because playing with random people on the internet is not fun - and it's good that while it was designed to be played multi-player there's a viable way not to do so.

At some point you'll be able to respec, which is great, but this ability should've been granted earlier in the story or outside it and upgrade materials should be refundable.

So it's basically a great game if you like exploring, skill, and challenge.",True,0,0
"This game is a masterpiece. First time playing on PC and was even more impressed than when I played it on the PS5. I recommend this game to everyone, it's a user friendly challenge that keeps you engaged the whole way through, with many different ways to tackle the numerous bosses. The many different build types make this easily the most replayable souls game for me. The only thing that isn't perfect in this game is the amount of time it takes for you to reach some of the best bosses in the game (Midra), but there are loads of community-made mods for this game which helps with that. Overall, I can't stress enough how much fun I have playing Elden Ring, and I hope that many others can pick the game up and have as much fun with it as I have.",True,0,0
This game is punishingly difficult at first but as you progress along the learning curve it becomes better and better.

"Currently about to finish my first play through, and Elden RIng has quickly become one of my favorite games in only a matter of weeks. No game has sucked me in like this since Skyrim. The game rewards curiosity and exploration greatly, has stunning visuals, satisfying combat, intricate and thought-provoking lore, and incredible flexibility in building your character. 

That said, it's not free from its issues. I can ignore a lot of the problems other reviewers will list, but the one thing that the game is sorely lacking in is detail. Limgrave and Liurnia are some of the most well-designed areas in any open world game I've played, with plenty of things to find, but after those the regions begin to feel shallow. Caelid is the only other one that comes close to the first two, which is really sad given how great they were. Altus feels like a watered-down Limgrave, Gelmir is great to look at but has very little depth, Mountaintops of the Giants is cool but feels empty (but perhaps that lends itself to the overall experience of the region), same with the Consecrated Snowfield. While all of them were fun to explore, I can't help but wish there was more present in most of them. Even the underground regions that were so beautifully designed and have the feeling that they're harboring some ancient secrets and power are relegated to simple fetch quests most of the time with pretty uninspiring bosses. There was so much potential in these areas but I'm left being a little unsatisfied with them.

But, despite this overarching flaw, I've had no problem regularly sinking in dozens of hours into this game because it's just *that fun*. Solid 9/10, could even bump to 9.5/10 after I play SOTET, but until then, a recommendation will have to suffice.",True,0,0

"This is my favorite Fromsoft game. Played through this game about 5 times and each play through discovered at least one new part of the world. The combat here feels the most refined and smooth in the series. There are so many weapon and spell choices here and each feels like you can make it viable with the right build. It also makes it feel way more friendly to new people coming into the series, with the open-world nature where you can redirect yourself if you find an area too challenging. The spirit ashes are great for use early and getting comfortable on until you feel ready to solo areas and bosses. The bosses here are all unique in presentation, scale, and combat flow and are exceptionally a joy to learn and overcome. The Npc’s in this game I think are some of the most memorable in the series and I enjoy going through all their questlines and where they lead to. As usual, there is so much rich lore to get lost in and it makes the exploration of the world even better. The level designs here also feel like they’re at their peak. This whole game only got better with the DLC and just expanded upon all the best parts of the base.",True,0,0

"After 300 hours, I feel ready enough to properly say how I feel about this game. 

The design (level / environments) is off the charts. On multiple occasions I've found myself being absolutely awe-struck by certain landscapes and areas. There is absolutely nothing wrong with any of the designs when it comes to the environments. BUT, the level design is the only time where I might have slight issues, but with that being said, THIS GAME IS AN OPEN WORLD EXPERIENCE, if a certain level design seems unfair you can always leave and level up / get more prepped for the area. So with both these ideas in mind I will give the level design and environmental designs a 9/10.

The game-play (including bosses). The main bosses in this game are absolutely peak. Especially standouts like Godrick, Godfrey, Radagon, Morgott, The Duo (separately), and many of the other bosses. MY absolute favorite bosses in the game is between Hoarah Lux, Messmer, Radahn (both base game and DLC), and Midra. And the only lows are Fire Giant (love the design just not the arena), Godskin Duo (self explanatory I'm sorry), The Putrescent Knight (love the design but some of his moves are just ridiculous) and my least favorite boss in the entire game is Commander Gaius. These are all main game bosses that you will most likely fight, the only lows with bosses come with the repetitiveness of certain boss types in dungeons. They put a lot of bosses in this game and the ones you remember you will never forget, but some NPC you fight in the DLC that has annoying moves just becomes more draining than anything. This ties into the gameplay, I found myself playing the, run in with a big sword and do my best strategy. In some cases I found bosses very strong but depending on ur build some bosses can be extremely frustrating, and I feel like it's by design so it doesn't particularly bother me. Overall dodging seemed pretty forgiving. This was my first souls game and even though overall it's seemed as one of the easier ones, It was a pretty large learning curve for me, I had never played a game THIS hard before, the game at first feels unfair, you feel as if the game is working against you, but as soon as you figure out timings and when to attack and how to make nice builds it becomes a challenge that draws you in. You want to keep playing, You find yourself wanting to go back and fight bosses because u are ashamed of not winning, you want to succeed, and when you do it FEELS SO GOOD. Overall, other than a few (more like many) deaths I felt where unfair and the occasional bug, I think the gameplay is extraordinary. I will give this category a 9.5/10 (the good heavily heavily outweighs the bad.)

Performance? I see alot of reviews on here that complain about this games performance on PC's. And I'll say, I didn't run into a single issue until I started modding and adding additions to files. So as for the base game it ran as a smooth 60 frames and when it comes to running it at a bit of a higher resolution, in certain areas the FPS would drop but the game was so beautiful I didn't really notice it. Overall, 9.5/10 again.

Replay-ability. I 100% the game, so I can say this game is somewhat re-playable lol. I found it really fun getting this game to one-hundred percent. When i got into some of the higher NG+'s I found myself getting slightly bored with the continuation of running through the exact same areas, but that was just about my only complaint. 10/10.

Overall, this game has provided me alot of wonderful memories, playing seamless with buddies was an absolute joy, getting the game to a hundred percent was for the most part extremely satisfying, and not only that I still play modded with friends till this day. As for the base game, It is close to perfect, every game has its flaws, but you can tell this game takes pride into being stunning, thrilling, and just overall an absolutely amazing experience. Play this game.

"I know I might be far too late to the party but yeah. . here's my take on Fromsoft's masterpiece of a souls-like game, Elden Ring™

After spending about a month and a half, I finished the first playthrough of Elden Ring™. Having played Darksouls 3 and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice before, I adapt to Elden Ring's gameplay rather quickly.

Elden Ring is a culmination of mostly good things from the previous games Fromsoft had pushed out. The graphic is jaw-dropping. The scenery is cinematic, to say the least. Items that resemble the previous games have made their way into the lands in between.

Even after losing a save file to corruption, 96 hours of gameplay, and the items I had gathered, I'm still thirsting for more of Ranni's doll sweat and Mohg's Nihil. I'm aiming to play it all over again just because it is that fun.

But seriously please. . the only thing I wanted for Christmas was for my first playthrough save file to be repaired. (I tried to fix it but all to no avail)

Would gladly suffer, and to be Ranni's consort once again,

I also think this game does lore and story perfectly. You don't get twenty minute information dump cut scenes. You exist in a well-crafted world and the lore is there for you to explore as you see fit.

"Good game but with some missed potential. The general mechanics and moment to moment gameplay is amazing and has a great feel, the build variety is good too which makes me wanna do another run. 
My main gripes are with exploration and the excessive amount of copy pasted catacombs/mines/ruins etc which often have copy pasted bosses too, it just gets very monotonous. 
While they are side content it isnt too good of an idea to just ignore it as a lot of them do have unique talismans/weapons etc, alongside decent rune payouts which are needed for leveling and buying/upgrading gear.
The world though is among the prettiest ive ever seen but the games lore and story delivery is so abysmally trash that it doesnt really elevate much past being pretty scenery unless you want to sit for hours going through every tidbit of info from item descriptions with a spreadsheet.
Still tho the main game captivated me for like 90 hours, its still great and worth your time.",True,0,1

"What is there to say really? It is a Fromsoft game and an ""evolution"" of their Dark Souls series. It is probably the most approachable Souls game for new time players. Gives you freedom to explore and die or not explore and die or even collect thousands of runes to die and lose them all. So peak Souls experience. Jokes aside it is a phenomenal game and is a great introduction to the Souls games. If you want to try it out be prepared to get frustrated or mad at it. Just comes with the territory of the Souls games. But, if you keep pushing through you really will have a one of a kind experience playing this game for the first time.

"What can I say about Elden Ring. 

I love this game, in many ways its one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. But the difficulty feels at times cruel and inconsistent. Don't get me wrong, I know what souls likes are about, I wasn't expecting an easy ride, but every now and again I'd encounter a boss or area that ruins my time. bosses and enemies spamming moves that are almost impossible to react to. I know what some will say, ""Get good"". Well. I have a life, I don't have countless hours to pour into games, but i still want a rich challenging experience. 80% of this game is exactly that, 20% is the most mind numbing brutally unfair nonsense I have ever endured in a game. I wish the difficulty were a little more consistent. Some bosses go down effortlessly, some are a good fun fight, others are obnoxious, joyless slogs. 

This is especially the case in the DLC. I am loving my time with this game, but my joy and momentum are occasionally shattered by an experience that doesn't feel challenging, it feels mean. If that's what you like, this is your game, if not... it's still worth a try. 9/10",True,0,0
"I've never played a game in the ""Souls-Like"" category and I loved Elden Ring. My brother and I started playing around the same time and we both had completely different experiences of the game due to the build system. He went around annihilating everything with dual greatswords and ""got gud""if you will at learning enemy and boss attack patterns. When he plays, it's like watching someone play exactly what you'd expect from a souls-like. I on the other hand, knowing that I am terrible at timing for dodging and other survival skills in this type of game, went down a different path. I played an intelligence/dexterity build and spent the entire game skulking for every advantage so I would never have to give my enemies a fair fight. I used sorcery to kill enemies at extreme ranges, hit-and-run tactics to kill field bosses, and poison and scarlet rot to kill giant enemies I was too cowardly to face. For boss fights, I used spirit ashes to distract and fight my enemies while I bombarded them with magic. I have been utterly merciless in exploiting my enemies every weakness. And I am just as much of an Elden Lord as the players who ""git gud"". Definitely would recommend. If you are having trouble, use the amazing wiki.

Game is very fair there but it has a learning curve. You can make it as easy or hard as you want on your first play through. It's like an expensive scotch dilute it as much you want or drink neat.

Has a large issue with explaining almost none of the *super* major mechanics, or even key ways to get to areas, like the lifts that are required to beat the game, either by finding a way around that you're never told about, or finding medallians that you're never told about.

I understand that open world is ""Fuck around find out just explore and do fuckin' whatever"", but things required to BEAT THE GAME I feel should be explained decently clearly.

"Elden Ring is a game where every moment feels like a dream teetering on the edge of a nightmare. The world is breathtaking. Vast landscapes and eerie ruins full of secrets, danger, and just enough Lovecraftian horror to make you second guess turning the next corner. Even on a Steam Deck, it looks and runs beautifully

Combat is smooth and deeply satisfying, even if it can feel a bit old fashioned at times . Bosses are punishing but fair, making every victory feel like a genuine accomplishment. And then there’s the voice acting. Each character sounds like they’re reciting poetry from the depths of despair. Half the time, you’ll have no idea what they’re talking about, but it’ll sound cool enough to impress you anyway

The multiplayer? It’s as weird and awkward as it is rewarding. Summoning a friend involves cryptic rituals and strange items, which fits the vibe but makes things more complicated than they need to be. And then, when you finally beat a boss together, the game promptly kicks you apart. It’s oddly charming in its own way.

Elden Ring doesn’t hold your hand, doesn’t explain much, and definitely doesn’t care if you’re ready for what’s coming. But if you’re up for the challenge, it’s a beautiful, brutal adventure you won’t forget. Just don’t expect it to go easy on you",True,0,0
"Pretty good. The only real issue is the overwhelming amount of enemies with delayed attacks. Foes who raise their sword high in the sky, wait 4.3 seconds, then begin to swing it down, only to stop for another .5 seconds and then finally attack. It makes the game harder for no reason, because you've to learn the delays of each enemy you fight. If you hate that sort of stuff, this game will drive you up the wall. If you see every enemy as a puzzle meant to be understood, then you'll have no issue.

Also, the open world can feel a bit empty at times. I recommend playing this game in small doses. A few hours every week, so that it doesn't get boring.

"Well, nothing to be said really - play this game if you can...

My only recommendation for you going into this game is to NOT follow any guides and resist the temptation to look things up. Just get fully lost and immersed in this world, explore, find what you can and try to think differently then you do while playing other titles. The messages from other players in-game are more than enough to guide you forward, and there many hints scattered around. At maximum I would look at some ""Beginners tips"" video if you are struggling even with the basics. Then when you finish an area, you can look up all the things you missed and come back for the stuff you need.

I found that looking things up and following guide videos before experiencing the area for yourself really diminishes the experience.

As this is my first souls game and had no expectations going into it, I discovered that feeling of struggle while fighting singleplayer bosses for the first time in a long time, which left me with an amazing feeling after killing the boss. I might be going to deep into it, but it reflects the self of accomplishment after achieving something in real life too, which is one of the best feelings you can feel in general i think.

ive been playing video games all my life and i consider myself an avid artist of the craft. a connoisseur of the medium, if you will. in all my tenure of being a masterclass ambassador of the trade, never has a video game made me feel as sick as this one. 

there is absolutely nothing good to be said about any ""Souls-like"" game on the market. they are simply too hard, and ruin what video games are supposed to be. they are supposed to be easy, accessible to all, and this is a game that is just plain too difficult. i cant play it, therefore its not a good game, because as aforementioned, i am a savant of the force. i am video games.

"Elden Ring all on its own is truly an adventure the first time around. This isn't my first souls game, but its the first time i actually beat one. The game does a very good job of fucking you over and then letting you feel powerful, only to fuck you over again when you fight the next big boss.

Unfortunately...The 80+ hour playtime of this game is not going to be anywhere close to as long on subsequent play throughs as you realize that a lot of the content is repeat content. I have probably fought a hundred Magma Wyrms at this point. It was such a good boss, they had to also throw it into the DLC! It was never a question of if, only how many. Your experience will soon streamline to only include the actually interesting battles, and those necessary for progression.

Elden Ring says that its multiplayer, but the few times I tried to use the multiplayer, the servers refused to let me stay connected for a long enough time to actually complete the sewers in one go with my buddy, with a 1 minute wait time every time it went wrong. The coop experience is absolutely garbage. I can't say much about the PvP since I never engaged with it after seeing someone spam some of the most unfun and lame strategies during an invasion.

Where the game really shines is, and say it with me, the mods! WOOOOO YEAHHHH. How does this happen for every game? Thank you Seamless Coop for allowing me to actually enjoy playing Elden Ring alongside my friends. It conveniently doesn't use anticheat so you can use all the cheats you want to skip all of the holding forward you've already done a dozen times to get to the fun parts of the game! You can also skip the shitty convoluted quests you would likely never complete without aid of the wiki! You can start off as a level 1 character with any gear you want right off the bat so you can use that cool sword you got for beating the final boss!

The coop mod combined with the Elden Ring Debug Tool has made the experience something thats worth replaying again and again. Would have stopped about 400 hours ago without it.

[h3]Personal thoughts:[/h3]

If you're searching for a game that delivers an intense challenge rather than a gripping narrative, this title is a fantastic pick. FromSoftware's games have carved out a niche in the gaming world, and this entry is no exception. While it may not cater to those who crave a heavily integrated storytelling experience, it shines in delivering a satisfying and skill-based journey.

The game does have a story, but it unfolds in a unique way—requiring players to piece together lore by collecting items in-game. Alternatively, you can dive into YouTube videos for a more straightforward explanation. For some, this storytelling method might be a downside. A friend of mine, for example, didn't enjoy the game for this very reason. However, if you're here for the thrill of a tough, uncompromising challenge, this game (and likely the entire FromSoftware Soulslike lineup) is a safe and rewarding choice.

That said, it’s not without its flaws. Some bosses in the catacombs feel repetitive, which might dull the excitement for seasoned players. And, of course, we need to talk about the catacombs—the stone golem imps are an absolute nightmare. Seriously, why am I dying the 20th time to the same f****** imp... I should probable get therapy after this...

the game’s atmosphere, combat mechanics, and overall design are a testament to why FromSoftware continues to dominate the genre. Whether you're a seasoned Soulsborne veteran or new to the series, there's something here to appreciate.

This game isn’t for everyone, but for those who revel in overcoming challenging gameplay, it’s an experience you won’t soon forget. Grab your weapon of choice, steel your resolve, and prepare to die—over and over again.

Well and if you can kill everything without dying... good work I guess?",True,0,0
"It's an amazing game! I do still like the Dark Souls III storyline over ER, but ER is master piece too! considering it's open world experince and vast majority of locations with different foes and stuff to do!",True,0,0
"While at times this feels like a slog coming from Dark Souls 3, the underlying DNA is there. The overall scope can feel overwhelming at times, exploration starts to become rewarding as you start discovering previously unknown locations that are breathtakingly beautiful and your build slowly but surely starts coming together.",True,0,0
its just the best game ever the multiplayer system is kinda hard to do but 10/10 game nothing is wrong with it,True,0,0
"This game is worth modding! If you're too lazy or don't have friends, that's okay! We still have stuff like Graceborne and Convergence. Though, playing with seamless coop is more fun!

10/10 Would Elden Ring again",True,0,0
I find this game fun because it gives you the ability to explore on your and go into places that you not be ready but yet you can explore. What i dislike is falling off the edge sometimes and loosing all of the runes i've collected.,True,0,0
"I thought i would comment on the base game since i reviewed the dlc, shadow of the erdtree. Elden Ring as a base game is the pinnacle of design, story, and gameplay that anything fromsoftware came up with ever. Explorable massive world with a map is an amazing add on that DS series lacked. Story is very much engaging and totally makes sense even if you aren't spending hours reading item description or watching lore videos online. Developers made the coop mode much easier than before and much more streamlined compared to DS, one thing i would ask is why does summon disappear after boss kill? Doesn't make sense... Moreover, intractable NPCs and decision making to continue with story is much more defined compared to previous titles. Did i mention the massive world? It deserves to be mentioned a second time as not only it is vast but also diverse with many different terrain and npc to be interacted with. Adds depth to the story and overall excitement the game brings. AAA and no wonder why it won the GOTY award.",True,0,0
"encounter a boss --> get killed --> man f*** this game --> 20 minutes later --> ooh I understand it now --> nice game

This is pretty much the cycle I have been in the whole game. This game is one of the best games ever made. You get more and more addicted whenever you achieve something good. It has a nice gameplay, mechanics, perfect designs and most importantly ""wonderful"" artistic buildings. Well, what can I say? It's a must-play!",True,0,0
Insanely good. Really allows you to immerse in the story and learn combat properly because of the length of the game.,True,0,0

"Elden Ring blew me away. It’s not just a game—it’s an adventure that pulls you into a beautiful, dangerous, and mysterious world. From the moment you step into the Lands Between, it’s clear you’re in for something special.

What I Loved:
#The World: The open-world design is incredible. Every area feels unique, with so many hidden secrets that exploring never gets old.
#The Combat: It’s tough but fair. Every victory feels earned, especially after taking down one of the insane bosses.
#Customization: Whether you want to be a sword-wielding knight, a spell-slinging mage, or something in between, the game gives you so much freedom to play your way.
#The Lore: The story is deep and mysterious, and while it doesn’t hold your hand, piecing it together through dialogue and exploration is super satisfying.

Some Advice:
#Take your time! Rushing through means you’ll miss out on so much cool stuff.
#Don’t be afraid to die—it’s part of the process. Learn from each fight and come back stronger.
#Use co-op if you’re stuck. The community is surprisingly helpful!

Final Thoughts:
Elden Ring is challenging, yes, but it’s also one of the most rewarding games I’ve ever played. It’s perfect for fans of FromSoftware games, but even if you’re new, it’s worth giving a shot. Just be ready for a journey like no other.

"To confront Midra is to face the abyss of chaos itself, where survival demands not just strength but an unyielding resolve against the pull of madness. Triumph over this relentless lord is a rare feat, a testament to one's endurance and mastery over the consuming fire of frenzy.

Midra represents the harrowing allure of forbidden power, a force that tempts the weary and desperate with promises of liberation but threatens to unravel the very essence of those who embrace it. He embodies the delicate balance between enlightenment and insanity, a living testament to the perils of venturing too close to the flames that burn beyond mortal comprehension, shaping the Lands Between with both awe and dread.

"7.5 / 10

It's a good game with big flaws that barely get talked about. 
Like in almost all FromSoft games, the quality is front-loaded (Limgrave); the problem is that it's also a very, very long game with a a ton of copy pasted content (nioh is also guilty of this... but they have a way more interesting/deep combat system to keep you interested) and the game doesn't feel nearly as good in the end. Elden ring still has this simplistic fromsoft combat but it feels less precise (many bosses are flashy/fast and not really well tuned), easier to brute force (all these stupid overpowered weapon arts, etc) but if you break the combat and you have a game with zero story, what is left? Beauty. It's very beautiful. It's not enough.

Peak FromSoft is still Dark souls 3.",True,0,0
"Very fun open world. First souls-born game, had high expectations and they were met. great replay-ability, great weapon diversity, all around very well made game.

"Dark Souls 2 2.


Elden Ring is a great game. If you don't think you like ""these kinds"" of games, this one is the most open and accessible. Use whatever you find, make a cool character, and ignore what everyone tells you is the ""right"" way to play.

Now, the part for those who, like me, were From fans before Elden Ring made the genre explode:

Elden Ring is, at least for me, the least memorable ARPG FromSoft has released since Demon's Souls. The open world format allows for hours and hours of exploring and dicking about, but the asset/boss/enemy reuse and the sheer AMOUNT of content makes everything you find feel just a little less special. The variety of armour and weapons is really fun from a gameplay standpoint, but makes it hard to mix and match and find your own combos that don't clash visually. 

In DeS, Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro, every item you find feels special and important because there are just less of them. The artstyles are more cohesive and defined, and so while everything might look a little same-y, they all adhere to the game's theme and, personally, that's what I prefer.

I prefer the tight, cohesive, intentional level design and artstyles of From's previous ARPGs. What can I say, I like the games that defined the genre the most. If you enjoyed any of the Dark Souls games then of course you're going to like Elden Ring. But every second I play just makes me miss what made me fall in love with Dark Souls.

"Elden Ring did for me something no other game could.

I could start many places with this game but I think it's most fitting to start with what YOU will experience first off, which is confusion. You open the game, spend hours on making your character (which you'll only see the face of like twice.) spend hours researching builds (don't stress so much there is ways to mix it up about halfway through the game) then watch a crazy opening video. Then you die. and die. and die. and die. but fret not, there are many online guides on how to level up with rune farms. Or if you don't like that, you'll fight your way south and level up properly. Then you'll slowly realize how MASSIVE the map is. Every time I unlocked something new it amazed me just how much love and detail was in this game. If you take your time, and use torrent more than fast travel, I promise you the immersion and encounters you will have will be amazing! Go investigate those pillars of smoke, or the screaming you hear. Talk to the bush asking for help or find a secret ledge leading the the most aesthetic and intense boss fight of your life. No matter what you do its okay because NG+ awaits, begging for a new ending and story. This game truly made me feel challenged and made me love the souls games. 

Expect a challenge, expect to suffer, and overcome it.

 Since this is my first Souls game, I might not be as accurate as someone else who is more experienced with these types of games. The lore behind the game is excellent and most aspects are wonderful, however, so many bugs or inconsistencies can and have completely ruined my and other players' experiences. When I say this, I refer to features such as how the game will automatically chain your next move when you press the key while the first move is still happening, leading the player to be stuck in an animation or use a move despite not knowing how the enemy will next attack. Most of the bosses or regular enemies are extremely inconsistent, with a random one that ends up being harder than most of the final bosses in the game. These issues have arisen from the crappy controller to keyboard port, albeit with most of the audience of Elden Ring being controller players, this is much less of an issue for console players. Overall, the gameplay for me has varied at times, but I still recommend that if you are an enjoyer of RPGs or Soulslikes, you pick this game up. Even though I'm halfway through the game it has felt relieving to kill that one boss you've been struggling with, make a big jump in your progression and even just enjoy most of the story.",True,0,0

"Playing Elden Ring is like challenging a rich kid to a Yu-Gi-Oh! duel. Just when you think you’re making progress, they slap down the same overpowered cards again, making you go, 'Ugh, this again?'

"This game is without doubt a masterpiece! I am in my 30s and never been a big gamer, but this game made me feel like a kid again anticipating my next play and thinking about the game even when I am not playing!

However, there are two things that that make this game short of flawless: 

1. The targeting and controls (at least on PC) are awful. No matter the camera/mouse settings targets switch by themselves, the character stops facing the targeted enemy on random occasions, and sideways movements feel unnatural. This is very frustrating especially in boss fights when you die because of targeting glitches or by your character doing something completely different than what you wanted. Also, I think you should be able to have better key binding options for PC (e.g. one should be able to bind a certain key to a certain skill/item). I know the game was designed to be played with a joystick, but those issues make the game nearly unplayable on keyboard/mouse.

2. The UI is absolutely disgusting. Looks like it was done for a game released in the 90s. It's not just ugly, it's confusing and slows the game down on many occasions. You can't even see your runes in certain menus, and need to switch menus just to view them - this can become very annoying the longer you play. Having to access the inventory and equipment screens from the escape menu is laughable. You should be able to bind a key for inventory at least on keyboard. Honestly, I don't understand how such a game was released with this abomination of an UI. 

All and all amazing game, but the above issues need a fix so this game can get where it really should be.",True,0,0

Don't feel like you have to play a certain way just do whatever you enjoy the most, and most of all never give up because the boss has to keep killing you, you only need to kill them once.",True,0,0

"To be brief, like recent masterpieces such as Doom Eternal, Cyberpunk 2077, RD2, etc, this is a game that everyone simply must play. Even if you aren't a dedicated fan of From Software, this is a mandatory piece of gaming history. 

I want to start with the things that are bad: 
1. I have no concrete idea of how far of a fall is too far of a fall. The game is wildly inconsistent with what is lethal damage and what isn't. Sometimes the same jump can kill or not kill you depending on if the horse's tail touches a rock on the way down with seemingly no impact on velocity. 
2. I love the cryptic questing in the game, I love an NPC telling me to do a task and having to figure out what it is. The thing I don't love is some quests kill other quests (fine) and there isn't a clear marker that this will happen nor is it easy to figure out from the NPC dialogue. Other quests can't be progressed until certain main story beats are satisfied. Unfortunately, this simply leads to using the Ole Google Machine to figure out what to do, which isn't very fun. The game isn't clear on what quests you need to give priority to and which ones are slow burns or which side quests will be cut off if you advance a certain quest. The most obvious example is helping Ranni eliminates all her allied NPC questlines. This makes sense at the conclusion of the questline, but prior to that it really doesn't and you don't realize until it's too late. 

That's it. That's the bad stuff. The positives, I'll omit the obvious things every talks about and just focus on what this game does that really makes it a masterpiece. 
1. Elden Ring isn't a single game, it is two games blended into one masterpiece and how you engage with both halves of the game determines how easy or hard your experience is. A common critique is the open world somewhat repeats itself, the non-story bosses repeat and get dull, the game offers you lots of dungeons and exploration with the same rewards, but that's the whole point... 

The main story of this game is probably a typical 10-20 hour affair depending on skill and experience. The entire Elden Ring experience is 70+ hours. That's the beauty, it's a From Software basically ""Dark Souls 4"" but the outside every ""legacy dungeon"" (typical Souls level) is an RPG experience like your first Oblivion or Skyrim playthrough. 

I saw the repeat bosses, Tree Sentinels, Tree Spirits/Guardians, Crucible Knights, Night's Calvery, Dragons, Kindreds, etc not as From Software being lazy and  reusing content to fill out a world they over imagined, but rather them providing the players who complain about difficulty a difficulty slider that isn't checked in a menu, but done so by investing time. 

I've seen a lot of people complain, ""The side content is just the same 20 bosses over and over and the rewards aren't worth it."" Ok, then don't do it. The point, from what I gather is players can fight these enemies multiple times to learn how to deal with them and to measure how their character is progressing. It is actually pure genius because the kinds of players who like to speed or challenge run typically trim as much fat from the game as they can and Elden Ring makes it very clear what the fat is. Conversely, the more RPG players tend to not mind repeat tasks like gathering, crafting, dungeon crawling, and their player progression is always moving forward as they play the game how they naturally would. 

I think the real complaint people have is that the game introduces a boss like Malenia and also provides a path to avoid it or make it a joke and that pisses of the people who think the point of a game is to make it as hard as you can. You can still do that. But the game doesn't prevent everyone from passing the roadblock unless they learn the fight perfectly. 

TL;DR the game has two loops, one is the typical Souls legacy dungeon capped with epic and difficult bosses and the other is an open world RPG littered with rewards and power through semi-repetitive content. The more you engage with the RPG loop the easier the Souls loop becomes. In essence, the game takes the time investment you would normally have to put into learning a boss and gives you a second place to invest it to make the experience less frustrating. That is the true genius of the game.",True,0,0

The map is insanely huge and the lack of a formal quest line is a little daunting at times, but embrace the exploration aspect and you'll be fine.",True,0,0

Combat feels like a spectrum between “rage quit” and “I will die better next time”. It’s not about winning easily, it’s about learning patterns and earn every little win through relentless pain and death.

"To be upfront, the only Soulsborne game that I liked less than this one is Dark Souls 2. That said, this is still a very solid game especially on a first playthrough. I'll try to limit this review to a few important aspects of the game.

Combat: This is where the game truly shines. The combat is fun and rewarding. This is also by far the most accessible Soulsborne game since you can usually just go do something else when you hit a wall and come back once you're at a higher level.

Bosses: There are some good bosses, but overall this is one of the weaker entries in the series. A lot of the bosses feel very similar and a lot of them get reused a lot, mostly in the random caves you can explore. 

Level design: Again, this is a mixed bag. The legacy dungeons, which are similar to the levels from the previous games, are all quite good and fun to navigate through. Most of the things you can find to explore are random caves and these feel like a better implented, yet still repetitive, version of the chalice dungeons from Bloodborne. Most of them look the same and you fight the same bosses repeatedly. They're fun the first time through, but become a chore on subsequent playthroughs.

Replayability: This is by far the worst game in the series replayability due to its sheer size. I purchased the expansion when it came out and I still can't work up the motivation to play through the game again. Exploring the world is fun the first time through, but once you've seen it all the novelty wears off and the world's size starts to drag down the experience. The final 1/3 of the game is also a slog. It's not as bad as finding the lord souls in Dark Souls 1, but it's the closest any of the other games have come to making me feel the same way.


Overall, this is a good game that's worth the price, but I don't think it lives up to the hype surrounding it.

Anyone looking to buy this should definitely look at other reviews, both good and bad, to get a better idea of whether this game is for you",True,0,0

"Obviously, an amazing game.

The only thing I would say that sucks is that the carry-over of ""Quests"" from Souls games makes it really easy to miss side story. There is way, way too much ""just running around"" if you want to see everything. I mean, how would you know that certain characters, like Millicent, would happen to spawn overlooking the Altus Plateau unless you get lucky and run into her?

Other negative: you get stuck using one type of weapon as there are not enough smithing stones (especially somber for legend weapons) to upgrade multiple ones.  It really sucks how much your player attributes can only focus on int, fai, str, str/dex, dec, etc. I feel like I am missing out on so much stuff in the game, and really don't want to do a 2nd playthrough as it is so long.

Aside from those 2 cons, the ambiance, variety of enemies, combat, intensity are just incredible. There is so much beauty in a world like this, and it does not require the latest and greatest PC hardware to see it in its full form.

Love FromSoftware! Cannot wait for Nightreign!",True,0,0
"This game is absolutely fantastic in so many ways. Everything feels well done, but I have a slight issue with the storytelling. Some players might enjoy the challenge of uncovering the lore on their own, but personally, it wasn’t my cup of tea. On top of that, the side quests require a lot of interpretation, which sometimes made me miss things. That said, it’s not necessarily a bad thing—it actually adds to the feeling of being fully immersed in the game world.

It’s definitely a game that leans towards hardcore players. But if you’re curious about why it’s considered Game of the Year material, I’d recommend playing as a Mage and farming some runes early on. It makes things much more manageable and lets you enjoy the experience without too much frustration. Just be prepared for some rage moments with tricky puzzles or random mobs that jump-scare you out of nowhere. Haha!

My rating: 94/100",True,0,0

"not that good on reviews ,but here we go : 
my first time playing a ""Souls Like "" game ,and oh my god , in less than a 3 months I've played more than 200 hours !!!, with taking my whole time on exploring the world of the game and doing side quests along with slowly and carefully progressing the main story so I don't miss anything ,and yet I missed few things 😅 , the game was so addictive and challenging ,and despite being an Entertaining and fun game ,it was really frustrating when it comes to bosses fight and keep dieing multiple times even with help of summoning , and sometimes player's help .
I'm currently at level 228 ,still at my first playthrough , and will start the new DLC in few days .",True,0,0

" The Game is a Challenge...I've never played the Souls Games so This was a blind beginning for me...You need to think before reacting to Everything..Any enemy...They give a super Tutorial, I've even watched the Streams from more experienced Players...bottom line is I am committed to learning EldenRing and its Lore...Good Luck! and read the messages in game...",True,0,0
"Following along with the Dark Souls games Elden Ring adds a lot more exploration and depth into the lands. With more viablity with different weapon builds, and multiple powerups as ash of wars the game keeps staying interesting while offering a extensive amount of content, if a bit repetative.",True,0,0
"Elden Ring is an absolute masterpiece. The lore and world-building are some of the best I’ve ever experienced in any game. Every corner of the world feels rich with history and mystery, making it such a rewarding place to explore. I went all in and 100% completed it on Steam, and it was definitely worth every moment. If you’re up for a challenge and want to dive deep into an incredible world, I highly recommend going for all the achievements. It’s an experience you won’t forget!",True,0,0
"The first time that I tried I was really confused I just followed a tutorial and stopped playing because it was ""boring"" after a year I tried this game again and after beating the first boss I was amazed and started playing a lot followed tutorials had many builds and finished the game. Currently in ng+ definitely recommended. 10/10",True,0,0
"Great Game with HUGE map, HUGE amount of different enemies, and great arts. 
The only problem is that it is too lonely to play. I installed a mod that can constantly keeps the summoned NPC by my side while exploring the world and had a really good time.",True,0,0
"Very good and worth it, I like that they went into a more open world route, instead of the original linear path like in dark souls, the seperate endings are also very cool, but the ending scenes might be the same other then some talk and armor, bosses are also a lot of fun. Story is relative sad as always but there are happier endings.",True,0,0

"One of the few open world games I really enjoy, there's a lot of content to explore and its done in such a lovely way making now area feel empty, would definitely recommend for anyone trying to get into souls games.",True,0,0
"this game is amazing. as a huge DS 1-3 fan at first I didn't like it, but after the first boss and first big area it really opens up and there is just so much. like wow. amazing. my mind is blown.

it's like the original dark souls except I can go everywhere in the lore and see all the mountains and sorcerery they talk about.

I'm really loving the mid game alot. it's way better than I originally thought. I'm not a fan of open world games but I am really liking this one and cyberpunk and find myself excited to sit down and play. I'm constantly going to myself ""aw man this is awesome"" and ""oh yeah this is what I'm talking about"". ""man they really did it""",True,0,0
Very hard game. Challenging for sure but once you die a million times it starts to get better. Practice makes perfect! I still have yet to beat the game but exploring the map and slowly progressing in the game has been fun. Beautiful world and well made game 9/10 from me.,True,0,0

If I had to pick one style of game to play for the rest of my life it would be souls-like. These games have grown up with me and seeing all FromSoftware has learned over the years culminate into such an incredible game that is Elden Ring I can't express how much love I have and will always have for this game. It seems each of their games hits me right at the moment in life I most need them and Elden Ring deserves to be my number 1 game of all time.,True,0,0
"When i first started this game, it made me want to throw my PC to my wall and then grab the nearest bomb and eat it.
But when i started to explore more and more of Elden ring, getting new weapons and spells, seeing new bosses and new NPCs, this is when it actually started to click for me. Every boss started to become like a another great challenge for me to triumph, every weapon started to become unique and better, and every NPC started to feel like it's own person and soul. And most importantly, the game itself started to become my absolute favorite out of any other game I've tried on steam and ps5, pretty much became my holy grail. 
to anybody reading this and still hasn't bought the game yet, PLEASE buy it right now, it will change the way you see games forever.",True,0,0

"Haven't played the DLC yet, so this review will be based off me playing through the base game and getting all achievements to 100% it. 

This game's double edged sword is how open world this game is. It's amazing to explore but also easy to get lost or not sure where to go next. There is so many optional bosses though that you will stumble into from just exploring though, so take it with a grain a salt as it is sometimes not a bad thing to get lost. That being said, it can also get a tad frustrating when you don't want to get spoiled by a guide video. So yeah, YouTube guide videos can help you if you truly are lost with a simple search and helped me a handful of times especially with my achievements such as getting all 3 endings to this game.

Overall though this game's story, atmosphere, combat, and even the soundtrack all play a crucial role in making this game feel amazing to play whilst also humbling the player on how much time the dev team probably took to get everything just right. This is one of another masterpieces from FROMSOFTWARE.

10/10 this game earned its game of the year",True,0,0
"Absolutely peak. Story is amazing but convoluted. Killings things is satisfying. Getting stronger is extremely satisfying. Being able to one shot a mob that troubled you in the earlier sections and then spitting on its body for all the pain it gave you is quite satisfying. Bosses are decently hard if you aren't leveled enough to face them but you are able to learn their patterns over time and become stronger by being over leveled if all else fails. Graphics are great even while all low. It can not be considered a hard souls-like though as I never really experienced a sense of dread, its really easy going back to a place you died to get all your progress back unlike the other dark-souls games from the insane amount of checkpoints provided and the fast mount given. You will break your right bumper while playing this game. It is worth full price.",True,0,0

"First-time playing Souls-like genre, Elden Ring is very recommended for non-gamers: easy to learn, and easy to destroy the entire world, also bosses are great.
