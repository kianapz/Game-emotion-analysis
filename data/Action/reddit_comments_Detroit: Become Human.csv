m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Don't look behind you.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Wow, that IS strange! One pillow on a queen size mattress?"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Rug: Become Real
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"I had to double check, but I knew I recognized that [rug from my bedroom](https://imgur.com/E9NO2Wo) hahaha

Edit: Most definitely a rug, not carpet."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The rug really ties the room together.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Goddamn the Ps5 is huge.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"PS3 fat, cheers."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Rug? I thought we were all gonna talk about how the PS5 is taller than the tv stand.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Yes that horrible speaker placement
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,They stole your carpet. That's a lawsuit right there.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That is concrete proof that the government is spying on us!! They want our decorating tips!!!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,5 minutes... 5 long-long minutes I was sitting there and looking at this image... first time I really had to go to comments for the explanation
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Anyone worried about the tv legs off the aide of the table...
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Next question: Are you a human?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,After I saw the rug. I had to check the television stand to make sure they were not the same
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Nice try, David Cage."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Imagine of the game somehow took a photo of your room and on subsequent plays just adjusted the game world slightly. Different rugs, shelving, etc till your 5th play through it's just completely different."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Is the bed levitating?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Hover bed!
Edit: realized it’s the carpet you were pointing out"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Jesus I thought this was a screenshot of the game with them showing demon souls in-game with a ps3. I'm dumb
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Gamer realises there are carpets in real life too
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,It took me far too long to figure out why you’d frame a shot of your tv like this.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Damn your PlayStation is like half the size of your entertainment center. That is crazy, good post op"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Same carpet. Spent way too long trying to find that
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,For a second I thought that it was that Kara and the PS5 look the same....took me a minute to see the rug.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"That is so bizarre. Cool, but bizarre."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Yeah.  That bed has no leg on the left side.   It’s floating above that heinous carpet.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That launch model PS3 looks like a baby beside that PS5.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Good lord the PS5 is monstrous. I keep thinking I'm going to try to get knew but I literally have no place near either of my TVS that would fit it.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Took me a minute to get it, now tell me who copies who here? 

Also wish could give +1 for the for the Demon Souls."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,holy crap the PS5 is as tall as your Entertainment center? I always thought the Memes exaggerated.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,KRK’s in a poor monitoring position.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,IKEA is the base code the holds the multiverse/simulation together.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,ITS THE RUGS. Took me way longer than it should’ve and no one in the comments said it either but I did it. I figured it out
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Kara is kinda dressed like a PS5...
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,KRK Speakers too
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,No way! I'm pretty sure I used to have this exact same rug quite some time ago
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,kallax shelf and rokits in the background too
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Little do you know that the game simulated your reality to make it seem that you have the same rug
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Those speakers are supposed to be KRKs I think. I've got a set of KRK 5 in red, but the yellow speaker cone really gives away that they look like the standard ones."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"PS5 is like fuck your ""entertainment center"" I cannot be put in a box."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Jesus christ. The rug matches OPs own. I had to scroll way to far for someone to explain this, even after being told ""it's the rug"""
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Jesus. The ps5 is really big. I haven’t seen it next to anything to give it scale before.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I will never get over how massive and asymmetrical the PS5 is. I wonder how many casual adult gamers passed on it due to it's extreme gamer aesthetic and huge size.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That is strange. A console on the floor? Insanity!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Put your hands up for Detroit
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,a glitch in the matrix
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Detroit: Become You, Man"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Ha ha, this is surreal - this is [the rug in front of me right now](http://imgur.com/gallery/ur50wp9)"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Sometimes I forget how fuckin massive the PS5 is.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The placement of those 2 speakers in the bookshelf is killing me.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,There are so many carpets in the matrix.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Yes... the bed has no legs
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Matrix has been shown
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,How big the ps5 is?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,Dude seriously the ps5 is fuc*ing HUGE!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,I studied this for way too long before scrolling down enough to see your carpet.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,Bro is that for real how big a fucking PS5 is?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,I give up. What am I looking for?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,Weird flex but okay
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,"i thought the ps5 was looking at yu with ""eyes"" then i saw the rug"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,The bed do be floatin doe
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,Damn you got one of the ten PS5’s they released??
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,Same mat 🤣
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,Took me way to long to see it
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,"Hey, I have that exact same carpet at home!"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,After I saw the rug. I had to check the television stand to make sure they were not the same
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,Carpetdiem
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,"I'm sick of people showing off there ps5 like ""I have ps5 me pre order you not me am superior"""
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,Those speakers. My insides hurt
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-21,Even reality gets its assets from the unreal store
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-22,Anyone else notice the bed missing a leg first?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-24,"Here I was thinking the bed undersheet does look a little like a giant penis. But it is a bit of a stretch


Then was like... oh it’s the rug."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Good gawd P$5 is ungodly huge
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Bugsnax!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"For anyone who hasn’t seen it yet, the rug in the game and the rug irl are the same.

It took we a while to notice lol"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Ahhh a man of class
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The Ps5 is fucking massive and atrocious..
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Wouldn't it be cool if games implemented textures or things from your room into some game levels, so to another player this carpet would be their's."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Thats one hell of a coincidence!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Why did I have to go the comments to see what you were referring to... I’m going back to sleep
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The giant Wifi router next to your tv cabinet. God is that thing huge.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Wonder if you bought that rug after playing the game and it influenced you in some ways to buy the rug?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"##oh god it’s starting

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The size of the ps5 makes me laugh
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,what psycho only sleeps with one pillow
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Awwww shit.... you’re a android? Do you feel yourself going deviant with this revelation?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Monolith ps5 watches you.

Don’t anger it"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Ikea can sue for infringing on their rug - I know because I have the same one
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,You are in a simulation morty
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Ah a man of culture i see
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"That is a bizarre coincidence! Just an fyi, you shouldn't have your ps5 so close to the stand. It needs at least 4 inches of space all around it for proper ventilation!"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Just gotta say the ps5 looks awful.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That TV is not safe on that stand. Better wall mount or get a bigger stand or something before you’re sharing shattered TV pics on that carpet
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,You might have actually just found a copyright infringement lol A lot of people scan things into games without giving credit to the maker or asking permission.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Get your ps5 off the floor you fucking savage. The disrespect...
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Yea ur ps5 is on the floor. That’s disrespectful and also ur gonna get a lot of dust in it.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,You forgot to show us the drapes.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The rug.. Also.. THE PS5 IS HUGE HOLY FUCK
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,That you have a game that's not shit to play instead
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Shouldn't you get royalties?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Nice ps5 flex...
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Wow dude exactly the same it's awesome
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"A better game?

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"This person bought a whole rug just to post this picture.

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,They're not identical though.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,What’d you notice?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Okay but your PS4 is on and your ps5 is off and you're playing on the only generation 😧 wanna give that ps5 to me 👌
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Ugh. Stop standing there and pick up some trash, or do some dishes! That game sucks."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Nice screenshot dude. Can't see the funny
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,who gives a fuck

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Why would you even play it once ??

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,What am I supposed to look at?

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Is that really how big the ps5 is? I didn’t know it was that large
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"For the longest time I was all like ""what is it... I can tell if there's supposed to be something wrong with her ass or- oh, it's the RUG."""

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,r/audiophile will be in an uproar over the poor Kallax speaker placement.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That your PlayStation is as tall as your entertainment center
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That its a mediocre game at best?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,No way.

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Didn't notice that the bed looks like it's floating.

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I need to wait until the PS5 slim comes out. I just don’t have the space for it.

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Is that a ps5 ? If so , fuck u"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,LEAVE HER ALONE TODD!!!!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Great game.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,This entire image is a colossal flex
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Maybe someone is playing you and it's all just a game!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Then I guess you have become human
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Man that game is so good!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Wow. Why would you not set up those speakers as symmetrical. Gaming devs quality really has dropped
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I thought this was a joke about how big the PS5 is
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Really the same rug gets 6k up votes are yall fucking stupid?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I mean I don't know why you needed to play Dettoid: Become Human to notice that the PS5 is an absolut unit the size of your TV table.... But oksy
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Hahaha, I got the exact same rug. Tripple inception"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I have that same rug in my house!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,y'know I have that same stereo amplifier from years back - maybe OP is just a game....a game I got bored with and shut off before it played out...
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,How is this game? Worth it or nah?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Neat rug! Also wow, the PS5 is massive."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Terrible speaker placement!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Oh hey, nice air purifier by your entertainment center."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The simulation is glitching
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That monitor placement though
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The PS5 on the floor like that gives me anxiety. So much crazy shit goes on at that level. I have 2 cats so this person probably doesn’t have pets.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Fun fact: that happens to everyone. While playing Detroit: Become Human, your ps5 scans your carpet, and perfectly places it into a single random lactation in the game. It's the only time the ps5's hyper realistic object scanner has been used up until this point."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Where's the red circle so I can see what's going on? /s
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The first thing I wsaw was dark souls
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Okay but what about your bed
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Anyone else completely oblivious about the rug and instead sees the stain under the bed and assumes that the bed was moved to hide the bloodstain of the father's now dead wife after he killed her and was too lazy to buy a new rug? Just me? Ok...
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Please don't fuck the PlayStation.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,You sir are now human
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,David Cage has done it again
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Oh no... You're Todd...
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Bro they know too much.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,OH CRAP I JUST SAW IT
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,We are in a simulation 🙌
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Weird PS5 flex but okay
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,[deleted]
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,So your PS5 might be sentient and biding to strike?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Wow the PS5 really is big.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Holy guacamole, the Ps5 is monstrous. Where the hell would I even put that if I was some how able to get my hands on one."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Holy shit I knew the ps5 was big but didn't realize it was desktop tower big.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Maybe you're a robot
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That rug really tied the room together
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The stain thar creep is trying to hide under his bed?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Unrelated but is that the ps5?? That’s fucking huge
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,This game is so engaging. Legit probably the only game I feel like replaying end to end again.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Wut is it
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"When you decorate in the game, you decorate for real."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That your PS5 is as big as your tv stand?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I know right!? PS5's are Yuge!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,How much more development would be needed to add 1 more pillow?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Simulation confirmed
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Nice Rug
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Immersion
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Did you check the corner of the room and find a camera?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Damn the ps5 is big lol
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Yeah, yeah you have a PS5 good for you..."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I LOVE THIS GAMES
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,We have the same rug as well :)
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,It really ties the room together.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I thought u were talking about the same colour scheme of ps5 and the game character
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,This made me realize that the PlayStation 5 is an absolute unit! Holy!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Rug: "" I wanna be a real boy!"""
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Unplayable uninstalling the game right now
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Whoa! You have a PS5?!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"This took me a lil while, not gonna lie hahha"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"The black of the PS5 is shiny, almost too shiny, probably would of looked better in Matt"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Took me a second to notice the TV lol
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Lol
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Objective complete: blend in with the humans
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Really ties the room together
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Didn’t realise the Rugs were matching, but stared so long, I discovered that the bed is missing a leg :)"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Bruh that PS5 is taller than the TV stand wtf
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Why the speakers on different levels.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,is your name todd?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Floating bed
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Holy crap the rugs are identical
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,A glitch in matrix.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I had a similar experience watching Breaking Bad where they featured our couch...in a meth house.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Boi do I love that game.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Nice carpet 😂
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,OP why even still have your ps4? I'm selling mine when I can find a ps5. Ps4 becomes irrelevant with the ps5.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"""Dang, where'd this PS5 come from?"""
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"I see, she's cosplaying as a PS5"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Im trying to figure out how the fuck Ikea is still in business in that time period.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Glitch in the simmy.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Makes it more immersive
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Say goodbye to your onkyo stereo receiver putting the ps3 on top of it, the heat gotta go somewhere man"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I spent way too long looking for a penis
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,If anybody hasn’t played this game go play it it’s amazing
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Wow, that Demon Souls PS5 remake really DOES make it look like a whole new game"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,You're just showing off your PS5.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Onkyo put off a ton of heat you need to move that PS3.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Confirmed, you’re living in a simulation"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"😏

Edit : I stood still when he told me not to come upstairs. I was not disappointed"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The call is coming from inside the thread
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,As a music producer I recognize the Krk speakers!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Bro i legit thought your room was the game and the game had a ps5 easter egg, smh, im so stupid lol"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Well.. the bed is floating and they have the same rug

For those who are confused"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The bed has no legs?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,No PS2 make me sad :(
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The first thing I noticed is the PS 5.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The game is coming from... Inside the house!!!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,It really ties the room together
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,OH my god the bed is fliying!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Yeh I noticed the demons souls disk

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,God that story arc is so fuckin stressful
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Launch PS3, a PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Switch all on the same TV stand. That's crazy, the PS4 is redundant now that you've got the PS5"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The rug is literally real
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The bed is flying!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Nice rug
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,This took me way to long to realize what this whole post was about lol
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Took me a minute
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,top 5 how to showoff your ps5
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,YOU NEVER CONSTRUCT FROM MEMORY!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"ikea sketchup models, its probably paid advertising."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I don’t get it ;-;
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,you have a similar-but-not-the-same rug? ok? it’s a bit annoying that they stretched it
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That the PS5 looks enormous?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I noticed how massive the ps5 is holy crap
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,RIP Onkyo
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,We live in a simulation! :0

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Nice tower fan mate
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Side note, I still hate the physical design of the PS5.  Aside from being just too damn big, it looks like they gave blank sheet of paper to a 12 year old and just said make something “futuristic”"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That took me too long lol
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"It's the exact same pattern? That's crazy. I think you're being watched, OP."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Am I dumb?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Oh, I thought it was the blood stain under the bed."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Look behind you, at the vent above the bed. That's where the camera is mounted"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Rug

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Guys I'm legally blind could you help me out?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,It really brings the room together Dude
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"I have this rug.... oddly enough I was hanging out at Jason Lee’s (pro skater, My Name is Earl) house a few years back and he had the same one. Popular IKEA style for sure, hahaha..."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The speakers being at uneven heights for absolutely no reason is making my eye twitch
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,the game is becoming human
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"you have the same carpet as one of the designers. You know they are lazy and were just like. ""Ill just use my living room carpet as reference"""

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Pro tip - You can play this on your ps5, you don't need that ps4 pro anymore"

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Alright mate we get it you got a PS5.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I'm more Impressed by the fact you still have an original PS3

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Ugh the player character has directional speakers in their room (krk rokits it looks like) well below ear level and not even aligned with each other. Dispicable
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That PS3 tho
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,holy shit I have the same rug too.

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Reverse Artificial Reality!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,It took so long for me to figure this out it’s embarrassing. First I was like is it because what kind of psychopath sleeps in a bed that big with only one pillow?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,We live in a simulation!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"I stared at this photo for 5 min, then read comments about how rugs are similar. Starting to think Reddit might be a waste of time."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Bought a rug just to flex your ps5 FOR SHAME
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17, I thought the demon souls cover there was in the game.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,There's a few strange things in this picture it was hard to tell what he meant

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,How's that bed floating like that?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I’m assuming that’s the ps5 but I legitimately can’t tell if it’s an air refresher
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Same carpet!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,What that your TV is too big for your stand?

* OP Has a PS5 on the carpet, which regardless if it's short fibres or has a stand, is usually a no-no
* PS5 next to a potted plant. Water spillage nightmare potential. 10/10 would relocate either or"

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Monitoring speakers RoKiT ?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Yes!  Finally in VR!!!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Didn't know what I was looking st until the comments haha. Thought that was a blood stain under the bed!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I'll be honest. Took me more than one look to see it.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I also have that carpet in my living room
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That’s a nice Air purifier.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,you became human!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,nice
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I just got it yesterday
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Someone wanna send CPS to this guys house?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Well did you become a human or not????
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,What kind of *animal* puts their exposed PS5 on the **ground**
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The bed is missing a leg?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Oh shit
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Why are the speakers like that
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Become game
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I thought it was about the bed floating in the air... I noticed the carpet a few seconds later LOL
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Let that poor AVR breath.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Man you need a bigger tv stand
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I thought it was the placement of those speakers. KRK Rockits are pretty good... I couldn't imagine having them set up like that...
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Is this means we all living in a simulation! Oh god, this is a simulation!!!?!?"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Is that knack 2?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Why you have the ps5 on the ground
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I dont get it
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Is no one going to mention that red crate has a face...
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I had no idea the ps5 was THAT big.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,First thing I saw:  you're really fucking up the sound stage of those stereo speakers.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,For the longest time I just thought it was a PS5 flex
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I thought it was a screenshot from inside the game and theres an easter egg of a ps5 being in it.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The fact that the speakers are at two different heights in that shelf is making me irrationally uncomfortable
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I wish.  There was a second DBH. Favorite game ever
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I love this game!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"PS5 owners, just buy a fucking PC. That thing is the same fucking size, and will inevitably need to be entirely replaced sooner than most of the parts are worn out."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Holy shit that playstation is massive
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Looks like a rug my Romanian grandma had.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,What is it?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,You still keep your ps3 plugged in?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"I'll be honest, I didn't much enjoy this ""game"" but as it goes, it's understandably not a style for everyone.  


That is certainly a neat coincidence though."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I don't see it
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That took me way to long
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"The PS5 has been out now for a while, but every single time when seeing a picture of it in any kind of tv setup I keep going ""damn its big!"" Every. single. time."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Whoa that's insane. It's exactly the same
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,This happens when devs use models from the ikea website guys.

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Does life imitate art, or does art come from IKEA?"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,It really tied the room together did it not
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The ps5 is frickin’ huge!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I see it as well! Mate forgot to get another pillow for his bed. But I'll let it slide.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Yep, that sure does look like a carpet. Doesn't look like there's anything else interesting in the picture though."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"They took the carpet cant have shit in detroit XD, hope you like it, il wait till i play it someday. 

Edit: it is a rug not a carpet"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Its a simulation...
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,If only you also had a couple of KRK Rokit 5's. Now that would have been surreal.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Does the carpet match the drapes?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Wow that took me a while.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Nice. Is the game good? I played the demo on PC and it seemed worth buying, but I haven’t gotten round to it yet."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Wow, the rug really ties your reality together!"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,When you have the same taste as the wife and child beater. 😭

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I thought it was the bed floating
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Hey she has the same KRK studio monitors that I do.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,It took me way too long to figure out what I was supposed to see 😅

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,What there was no leg on the left of the bed?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"What’s happening in this photo, someone please explain."

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Right? It's like a motel 6 in hell.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,is that weird? asking for a friend...
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"My Wife couldn't get by with less than 8, 4 that I am apparently not to use ""under any circumstance"" because they are fancy."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,And speakers on two different shelf heights??
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The carpet is similar lol
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,And the rug isn't centered.  Literally unplayable.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"I've got 1 pillow on my queen size, but its because I'm lonely"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"No silly, OP clearly means that one of the legs on the bed is missing."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,/r/toomanypillows has entered the chat
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Hey, some of us can afford a nice bed, but are also awkward, lonely losers.

Given this is reddit,  I thought that this would be more common."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Bruh...and I’m here asking why them speaker not in line with each other...killing my OCD...
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Yeah and also how the ps5 is almost as big as the person on screen? This is so wild!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"His wife left him because he is a junky POS. He then proceeds to beat on the android girl he bought to have a child with his wife (who left him).

Detroit has some fucked up storylines.  Anyway, he sleeps alone hence one pillow."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I only have one pillow on my queen size mattress. I say its because I only like to sleep with one pillow. Others would say it's because I'm lonely.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,i use one pillow with a queen size mattress :(
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Also, what dumbass puts speakers in a shelf at different heights?"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Based on the character that is living in this house I don't see the one pillow as weird at all. Just good character consistency from the devs I would say.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Well when you’re a violent drug addict pillows don’t matter
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,No. Same rug hawk eye.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,So what? I like to spread my shit out.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I have like 7 on a twin
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,For some reason it screams lonelyness even more than regular-sized bed
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Something is definitely messed up right there. My queen size has 4 pillows not counting 3 waifu body pillows. It is painful to even think about having to sleep with only one pillow.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,I do that. I don't need 2 pillows.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"I didn't realise they had the same rug, I was looking at the bed and wondering where the left leg was."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Thank you, I was completely lost without this comment"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Wow. I thought this was a ""lol Kara looks like a PS5"" post."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Ahh ok, I knew I was missing something"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"OHHH Yeah the rug.

I thought it was because the bed was floating."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Thanks for explaining what I was supposed to notice lol
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"That is a rug, and this is a hill I'm willing to die on."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I have it as well! Bought if from Ikea.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Ikea?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Why yall buying this ugly Christmas rug?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Lol it took me like 5 minutes to realize it was the rug. I was looking for some crazy ps5 teaser or something
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Dude.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"But that's just, like, your opinion, man."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Fuckin A
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Agreed.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,damn i came to say this.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Lmao I thought he was referring to the girl matching the PS5. Thought maybe they took some of the design from the game in mind when building it. 🤦‍♂️
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"I just want to understand this, sir. Every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the owner?"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,tied
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That's just like... Your opinion man...
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,AND HE PISSED ON IT DUDE

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"This is what I noticed first. I thought is was some modern furniture at first, then realized it was a console."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I really haven't seen a picture of it with normal furniture to scale and holy crap.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Literally came here to comment that.

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I'm waiting for the slim model before buying one.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I thought the same thing. My Series X is relatively tiny by comparison.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,[deleted]
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Is that the VHS model?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Owning the first gen ps3 made me think that is a huge console. 2 generations later it’s not true anymore
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Literally every thread
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,It's almost like they have to fit PC hardware inside it /s
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"I feel like it's kinda about time, really.  This isn't 1990, where the SNES had a CPU that ran around 10% as fast as a modern CPU for the era.  They're cramming real hardware in these boxes now, and I really don't want to see a repeat of the Xbox 360's Red Ring of Death fiasco, simply because marketing told engineering that consoles have to be tiny and cute.  It's not like I need the thing to be portable.  If a bit of junk-in-the-trunk is what it takes to keep the power up and price down, then I say embrace the thicc."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Its the backwards compatible model too, hope he fixed the thermal issues."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"PS3, fat cheers."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,And the huge fucker is smaller than the PS5! Hot damn!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,And the TV doesn't fit on the TV stand.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,First thing I noticed! The space above the right speaker is open too. Why do this?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Where’s the speaker? I can’t find it
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Fuckers stole my carpet. Can't have shit in detroit
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"That's a rug, not carpet.  A carpet would cover the entire floor.

Both pictured objects are rugs.  They stole his rug."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That's a paddlin'.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,If that's true the government buildings are going to be plastered with coloured light strips lmao
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Im lost too. What am i looking at?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I'm more worried about the power brick on top of the Xbox. Seems like a recipe for hot.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Came here to say this
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,We are RA9.

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,It's held together with a cam lock and some wooden dowels.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Oh my god. I thought it was about the PS5 looking like the android’s legs and lower back with the white and black color scheme lollll
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,As someone that used to repair consoles. People that put electronics on the floor don’t care about them.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"it's been entirely too long since I've listened to that track. Thanks for the reminder lol.

Classic jam."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I think the bed is floating too.

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Bro the fuckin thing is so big you can't put it anywhere else man just spent 500 bucks now he's gotta go get a dedicated table to gtfoh
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,Detroit is fun
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I doubt it
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,He has the same carpet as the in game charachter.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Same carpet, pretty lame"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Carpets match
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Yeah if your into role playing games stuff like walking dead but this is better
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Same carpet. Op did a horrible job of explaining
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,The rug in and out of the game on screen

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,*it hurts my brain* because there's a place right there to move the right one up
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Are you sure it's not similar rofl? I'm thinking maybe it's more similar omfg, but that's just me."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I was looking at the terrible placement of the monitor speakers
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I was looking at the PlayStation thinking it looks like bad connor 🤦🏻‍♀️

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I was staring at that stain below the bed questioning if it was blood or a body or something else.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Seriously, it was like one of those ""spot the difference"" pictures only I had no idea what the point was"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Maybe OP should’ve added a non useless r/uselessredcircle
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,But if it was magical it would be a magic carpet right?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Most languages use the same word for both. A rug is just a portable carpet
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,[removed]
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Yes, purchased it almost a decade ago."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Yep, just got rid of the same rug.  My fringes were ... not anything remotely close to white anymore."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I thought it was that the bed had no front legs
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"It's just a weird ""look at my ps5"" flex"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"By including the game name, OP left an unintentional red herring. I spent like 2 minutes looking for something about robots before coming to see comments about the rug lol"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,You’re being very un-dude
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Shut the f*ck up Donny! you’re out of you’re element!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,His wife goes out and owes money all over town and they pee on my rug?
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,It looks like an air purifier or something lol.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I had to come to the comments to figure out what he was talking about lol. I was so distracted by the size of the PS5 compared to the TV stand I couldn’t concentrate on looking for what OP was talking about I kept going back to that part of the pic.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,There is no way you didn't know that was a ps5.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"I came here to comment that, but only figuratively. In fact I'm not even here at all."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Tell me more of your life.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"I even have my yacht which could fit under that TV. Twice. 

Those gaming consoles are just ridiculous."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,What case do you have? I’m in the market for a small form factor gaming pc.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Are you all thinking the stereo receiver under the PS is part of it or something?

ediy: nevermind. Totally missed the mini air purifier to the left."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Whats making the noise? The discdrive or the fans?

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"I would argue that the PS5 isn't really all that loud, though.  Definitely louder than most PCs but miles quieter that, say, the PS4."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,That’s an odd coupling. 5600x and 3090 XD
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Not like there's any stock anyways :v
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Lol, that's what I've been doing since PS2. I got in at almost end of ps2 cycle so I got the super thin (like game case thin) ps2 for super cheap(like $100?). Then PS3 fat boy came out and I was like nah, I just got the PS2. Then later the slim PS3 came out, got that for $200. I still have it and use it. Then the big ish PS4 came out. Nice shape but I got this PS3 with all the games for cheap (to be honest, even today I have ps3 backlog, lol). Then the slim PS4 came out for like $199 so I got that. Absolutelt no interest in giant and unobtainium PS5. Maybe never. Since I still have PS3 and 4 and Switch backlog that'll last me rest of my life. Sony should make a really cool shaped slim model ps5 this time. Like an [orb/sphere shape](http://1.images.southparkstudios.com/blogs/southparkstudios.com/files/2014/04/0508_BTS_09_BringTowel.jpg), or something like [this](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/10/intel-9th-gen-core-13-100775938-large.jpg). Then even though I have a minimal interest, I may get it for a novelty sake lol."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Me too. I can’t get over the size of this thing and personally I hate the color white. Hated it back when the 360 and wii came out too. Seems weird they launched the base model in white.

Hoping for a slim one soon"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Even now I look over at my Series X and I'm like ""huh, that's smaller than I expected"". Whenever you see a picture of it on its own it looks enormous."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"It really does look like what I would have ***loved*** as a 12 year old seeing fake mockups on GameFAQs next to a concept of Super Saiyan 8 Goku. 

It's just so gaudy and ostentatious."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,I have one and my wife says it looks like Dracula. Can't unsee.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Looks fantastic in mine, matches perfectly with my rooms aesthetic"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"> Wont look good in any of my rooms

Oh no, the thing you don't even look at most of the time is ugly..."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"I mean it’s pretty shockingly huge, I’m not surprised that there would be at least one person in every thread who hadn’t really seen one in a real environment yet. What’s crazy is that in person they look even bigger than"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Just out of curiosity, what do you mean by fixing the thermal issues? I replaced the thermal paste on mine, then installed custom firmware so that I could modify the fan curve. It's much louder, but now my CPU and GPU stay at or under 65°C. From what I can tell, Sony's stock fan curve prioritizes quiet over cool, to the point where I think it would be pretty difficult to keep it running long term on stock firmware"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,i can't see the all of them ports with the image quality.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Or how the shelf has been removed from the stand, placed on top of it, and now the TV is precariously balanced on top of that."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,And how to onkyo receiver is venting hot air directly into the ps3.
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Because asymmetric aesthetic choices are often more interesting, and I think they made the right choice here.  Most people don’t care about ultimate sound fidelity, they wouldn’t be putting the speakers in that shelf in the first place if they did."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Thanks, I never knew there's a difference. We don't have the difference in my language, we have one word for both. I actually wanted to say rug, but then I went with carpet, but I didn't think anyone would mind this much."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"This is pedantic and also varies from place to place. The definition of carpet is ""thick material used for covering floors"". Definitions may mention it's usually the whole floor, but never explicitly.

In South Africa we don't even say rug. It's not a word we use. We use carpet to refer to any fabric covering for floors. So while in the American context this may be accurate, ""Persian rugs"" for example would be called Persian carpets here.

I'm very anti prescriptionism so maybe this is just me but carpet in this context is perfectly valid."

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Well I have not heard of solving it through firmware before but I was more active years ago. The main problem is the thermal paste used between the die’s and heat spreader. To adres this both the GPU and CPU have to be de-litted. Since everything is aluminium you could upgrade to liquid metal but normal thermal paste will do wonders. Then replacing the thermal paste between the heat spreader and cooler is also critical. Furthermore, I forgot which is which but Sony upped the fan blade count in later phat models from (i think) 19-21 so one of those fans will further help cooling. Lastly, upgrading to the last production phats PSU also drastically decreases the temperature within the systems since they got way more efficient and leak far less heat."

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Honestly, if you aren’t going to de-lid, the benefit will be negligible. The (by now also dried out) low quality thermal paste between your die’s and heat spreader, are now for a lack of better word your thermal bottleneck. 
My early 2007 ps3 is functioning and quiet (on stock firmware) primarily because of this repair. I used a small pallet knife to delid, it is extremely easy, and the pressure of the cooler doesn’t require you to re-glue the heat spreader after. 

As far as I have experienced, the last gen-phat model’s parts share basically all plugs with the earlier models. The difference indeed was efficiency in production and the removal of the physical psx and ps2 hardware from the main logic board. The efficiency rating of the psu is better with the later models but the wattage was the same. Again this has been 5-6 years when I last spend time on researching and doing these mods."

Mine was crazy loud a couple of days back, extremely loud buzzing noise whenever it tries to read a disk.

Specifically the edge of the long side, just above the disk drive.

Probably was just the vibrations from the disk drive causing the somewhat loose panel to vibrate and produce the noise."

m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"It's better. (But Beyond was kinda bad, even if you otherwise tolerate David Cage writing like me.) Not talking about the overall quality of the game, just how 'gamey' it is - Detroit is much ahead of Beyond, ahead of Heavy Rain and somewhat behind Until Dawn.
            
You still need the correct mindset to enjoy the game, but the QTEs are engaging. I don't think there are useless mechanics, there are probably gimmicks that only appear for one chapter though."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,Detroit is easily one of the best video games of all time
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Remember how every conflict in Kara's story started with the little girl, >!who already knew she was a robot, pretending to be cold, hungry, and tired? Or how the final twist of the game is you learn that all of the androids were never self aware to begin with and deviancy was just another programmed behavior by the manufacturer so everyone would have to throw out their androids and buy a new one? !<"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Well... there are many other options to fuck up before that.  


So if you went that far without killing him (which apparently most people do anyway) - don't fuck up?  


Also he lost his job because of androids, his family left him, started doing drugs, bought 2 not cheap robots+repair and these 2 left him too. Bad doesn't seem to be the word to describe him."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"I also have the Series S! I was bummed about my storage untill I did some tests with an external SSD. Just in my experience, plugging in an external SSD only results in a few extra seconds of loading times. Also to my surprise, all of the X|S optimized games I have can be played straight from it. Quick Resume also works perfectly. It's a nice little console."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Real talk, my PS5 hasn't made a sound aside from the startup beep but I don't use the disc drive."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-18,JUST SAY „I KILLED HIM“!
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"Agreed! Loved the story. Really loved it. I also like Heavy Rain and Until Dawn very much. Played Man of Medan, liked that as well. Still have to play Little Hope. Can't really get into Beyond tho... it is a genre you have to get used to tho. It's more of a cinematic experience"
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,at least there wasn't a scene where David cage makes you piss in this one
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"That startup beep is my fucking enemy, though. It's loud, it's late, and I am trying not to wake anyone else up, damnit."
m6z2xi,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,"He did make sure to include his trademark ""female protagonist about to be sexually assaulted"" scene though"
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,It's by the same people who made Heavy Rain so if you enjoyed that you will probably enjoy the game. I enjoy it but its very much narrative first gameplay second so if you are looking for that type of game Detroit would be perfect.
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"The focus of Detroit: Become Human is the story. You are either wandering around an area interacting with objects and people, or you are performing QTEs (Quick Time Events) in dynamic action sequences.

The games you listed play very differently to D:BH. For example, BG3 has a great storyline but also has an in-depth combat system. Stardew Valley is relaxing but also has dungeons with combat and the general strategy and planning associated with management games.

D:BH is absolutely worth $15 but it plays exactly like Heavy Rain (same devs). If you enjoyed Heavy Rain's gameplay and like sci-fi storylines that explores the nature of humanity, then you'll love D:BH."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"It’s like an interactive movie. Think TellTale, Heavy Rain, The Dark Pictures series. Stuff like that, except in a Sci-fi setting. It’s pretty good and I would say it is worth $15."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,It's an awesome interactive movie. I played it with my ex and we went through it non stop the entire day.
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"I really enjoyed the game. It was played like a movie and I actually felt for some of the characters. 

I was sad when it ended and would totally play a second one if it came out"
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,A lot of people enjoy it. I found it was just a lot of pressing buttons on glowing objects and then reading the text. I found it prescriptive and boring.
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"Heavy rain is comparable, but less meme worthy content. I played it at launch and liked it for the most part, but burned through it pretty quick for a full price. $15 is well worth it in my opinion (if you like that genre)"
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,I usually hate these types of games with minimal gameplay but really enjoyed this and Heavy Rain by the same dev.
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,It’s a game for people who prefer movies over games.
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"Highly, highly recommend this game— totally worth $15! Definitely improves upon titles that came before it like Heavy Rain"
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"It's split between 3 stories and only 1 of them is any good in my opinion, It consistently attempts to be profound and deep with its story but is the most forced and cliched efforts imaginable, it's about as David Cage as David Cage games go just worse because it's being straight faced the entire time"
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"Same problem I have with most of the studio's games really: while they're ambitious and have some neat ideas, the execution leaves something to be desired. Think Heavy Rain, but sci-fi, better branching events, but also worse overall writing (I was really hot and cold on this one, insert a Fahrenheit joke here)."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,The best part of the game is Mr Krabs.
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,They made robots sit in the back of the bus. If you want to understand how subtle the metaphor is. Also David Cage is a piece of shit.
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"Very sophisticated game with multiple endings and really good story. IF that's what you're expecting (good story about androids/robots), go for it"
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"Laughably bad. Every character is tropey and a caricature for some idea or character done better in other sci-fi.

If you have ever heard of Tommy Wiseau's The Room, I put all of David Cage's games on the same level.

I guess at least it's better than Beyond: Two Souls I guess....."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"It's an interesting experience but I almost don't even want to call it a game, more of an interactive movie where you get to make some of the decisions. Still pretty cool, looks great, definitely worth the $15. 

Plus you can find naked pictures of the android lady on the internet."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,Meh. The Malcom X-Bot aka Jessie Williams was the most annoying character. I let him die at his stupid “Robot Rights” march. Rest of the game was alright.
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"It's a very sophisticated and interesting game. Throughout Detroit: Become Human, you play as different bots and almost feel like you are them. There are interactive dialogue parts; whatever you choose, the outcomes are different. The choices you make sometimes depend on your life and death. The story is composed of bots named Kara, Connor, and Markus. (Please tell me if I missed any) The game is a third-person view and takes place in 2038.

Overall, it is an entertaining game to play. Worth it."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,It's an amazing game 
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"it's an interactive movie with QTE gameplay and a lot of options for minor choices. For example there is a chase scene and you decide which routes to take and you have QTE events to make hurdles, avoid obstacles, etc.

of the three main stories that are interwoven, 2 are meh and lacking, while the other one is actually pretty awesome.

Overall it's incredibly hard to tell which choices actually matter, and failing/succeeding most QTE's don't actually change any outcome, very few will make a difference but it's hard to tell which ones specifically alter the story or lead you to what you want to happen. It's definitely not as good as Heavy Rain, but if you like that style of game you might enjoy it."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"It's very intense and rewarding, I loved it. If you like highly charged emotional melodrama then you're good to go. If characters expressing intense feelings annoys you, then maybe think twice. Much of the criticism leveled at these games is from gamers who don't like intense drama in their video games - they think it's corny and over the top."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"It's the same studio who did heavy rain so there are gameplay similaritiea. 

But even if you don't love the gameplay, the story and replayability makes it 100% worth it."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"10/10, easily the best ""choose your own adventure/telltale"" type game. Go now, before anyone ruins it."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"Interactive movie game with very good presentation that masks some nonsensical but admittedly effective storytelling. If you like that sort of thing, you'll enjoy it."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"Great deal at fifteen dollars. I’ll admit that I only played it once, but it was a great game and had a very compelling story and characters you become very attached to."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,Typical decision making game
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,totaly worth 15 bucks. it has a lot to appreciate.
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"I completed it 3 times. It was awesome. It has nice story with good vs evil choices. I d say worth the money. Eventually, since you have ps5 you can get ps plus with that money and play it and if it is not for you you can jump in any other game available on subscription."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"Amazing if you like story. It's basically playing a scifi movie with QTE.

I fucking loved it."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,It's good
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"Played the whole game and defintly worth the play! I like how your choises actually affect the game, and I think the story on its own is also very nice, recommend!"
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"Absolutely.  I loved it, and if you didn't mind Heavy Rain then the purchase is a no-brainer at that price.

It's worth a few playthroughs for the different choices, so you'll get good value for money at $15."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"For $15 I'd say it's a steal.  It's somewhere between a game and a movie, like many others have said with the likes of heavy rain etc.

Personally I found out absolutely stellar.  The story is great,  characters are great, it looks great and the story arcs are meaningful, powerful and pretty emotive.  I just thought it was perfectly paced and written.

I don't think it's the universal opinion but I'd give it a solid 9/10."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,Just like Cage's other games it's heavy handed while simultaneously being inadvertently daft.
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-13,"You like story, so you'll like Detroit. Narrative choice game with impactful choices/reactions.

Play it. Good game."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-14,"It’s $15 now? Wow, I’d say get it. It gets interesting pretty fast. It’s futuristic but also “political” if those are things that turn you off in games. The story and graphics are interesting tho. It actually feels like choices matter towards the outcome in that game"
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,Like say a visual novel? I do play some of those.  No combat at all?
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,I noticed on the demo the conversations are timed (QTEs).  Are most dialogues like that?
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"Same. Was a good time. Though, we had to play it twice to get different endings, because my play through didn't end so well"
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,Wolf Among Us for the win.
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"More like QTE's, which typically have an effect on the story whether you pass or fail."
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"Just Quick Time Events (QTEs), you have to press a button in like 1 second so that the character does something, but otherwise it plays very much like a visual novel"
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,It's like a choose your own adventure in motion.
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,Watch someone “play” the first hour or something. It’s basically a movie if you watch a let’s play on YouTube. I did that and I LOVED it.
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,"No. Most dialogues give you time to answer, although there are some (few) that are QTEs"
194h10u,2024-01-12,2024-01-12,I may or may not have laughed my ass off at all the times you can make Connor die horribly lol. My ending was not ideal either
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Connor me boy the robots are stealing my formula
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,And the drill sergeant in starship troopers

Surtur in Thor: Ragnorak.

Uka Uka in Crash Bandicoot

Savage Opress in Star Wars the Clone Wars

Hades in God of War 3

Not to mention a lot of live action appearances"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,There can be only ONE! 😝
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I know him from a bunch of great movies but my mind is blown that he’s mr krabs
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,You know you're old when you identify him as the Kurgan before Mr Krabs.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Lex mother fucking Luther. The one and only.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,And Red Death.

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Just found out my niece platinumed it, got every ending.   She put some serious hours into it."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Is this game any good?
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Mr Krabs, yes, but for us 80s kids he’s forever The Kurgan."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"""Medic!"" -Sergeant Zim"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Wait Clancy Brown voiced Mr Krabs?! 

His most famous role is as the prison guard in Shawshank Redemption but he also pops up in various movies/tv shows from time to time. Off the top of my head he's also played recurring roles in Flash and he was also in John Wick 4."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"The Kurgan*

Dude has a stupid amount of voice acting credits. Surtr in Thor Rag was one of my favorites."

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Him and Decharts is the best thing that comes out of the game
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"That’s The Kurgan, child."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I actually recognized him from Shawshank Redemption.

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Fun fact: The German dub’s VA for Mr Krabs was the same as Benjamin Blümchen, an elephant from a popular cartoon in Germany.

There is an [episode](https://youtu.be/6752P9ApfNo) where the flying dutchman is looking for mr krabs at the hospital and says “Your time has come, Eugene Krabs” And mr krabs answers “No, I’m… Benjamin! Benjamin Blümchen”. What makes it so funny is that he looks at the flowers on his nightstand and Blümchen is the cute form of Blume which means flower. Such a good gag"

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,He was a character on Dexter New Blood. I’d never seen what he looked like before but shouted out “That’s Mr. Crabs!” when I heard him speak. Needless to say we were making “Dexter me boy” and similar jokes the whole series.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Dexter free fell but I liked him in that, too."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,This is literally a YouTube comment chain I saw yesterday... Now it's a post on gaming. Wtf

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I want a movie where he and Ron Pearlman play brothers .
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Watching John Wick 4 I imagined Mr Crabs doing everything Harbinger did.

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I recognized him from Shawshank Redemption first. I’m always shocked when he isn’t playing a villain because he’s so good at it.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Also the guard from Shawshank redemption

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Dilf. Deffinate Dilf.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I would love a procedural show starting Hank and Connor
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Clancy Brown do be in stuff
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I realize I'm getting old, but it saddens that Clancy Brown is now more known for playing a cartoon crab instead of the Kurgan."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Another time, MacLeod!"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,He'll always be The Kurgan to me. But he always makes me happy whoever he shows up as.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,So... The Kurgen? To me he's the bad guy in Highlander.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I thought this was Dante
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,My favorite part of this game is the interview where Clancy Brown calls out David Cage for being an untalented writer
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,He'll always be The Kurgen to me.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Yup we was in John wick 4 too
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,His biggest impression on me was as Captain Byron T. Hadley on The Shawshank Redemption. His portrayal as a villainous superior is among the best I’ve seen and only eclipsed by R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Hartman imo.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,That's Sergeant Zim
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-11,"I know him from daredevil, the flash etc. HE VOICES MR FUCKIN KRABS!? How tf I not know"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,My biggest issue with this game is as a detroiter it makes it hard to create better game with Detroit in the name.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"“Wow an extremely popular voice actor provided his voice to a game published by a major company”

This is the dumbest type of post"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I found John Wick 4 difficult to take seriously in some places since Mr Krabs keeps telling people to shoot each other.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Underrated game in my opinion.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Why does this post have so many upvotes, it's no secret, dude is a famous actor and the game is hella old.. weird."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,You sure it's not Dante from DMC
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Oh yes, I didn’t see it at first, but he bares a striking resemblance to mr.krabs🦀🦀🦀"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Ha, you got it! That's Clancy Brown alright, the same voice as Mr. Krabs, playing the snarky detective in Detroit Become Human. Funny how voices can pop up in the least expected places!"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,This was a great game played it more  then just once
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Clancy Brown is one of my favorite voice actors. The man is just so talented. He’s also Savage in Clone Wars and Surtr in Thor Ragnorok
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Aww man, imagine being Clancy Brown and the main role you're remembered for is Mr Krabs..."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I'm probably the only one who remembers him as Gorrath from Megas XLR.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,There can be only one!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,One of my all-time favourite games. And I didn't pick up that he voiced him!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Connors theme 🔥

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,Wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world?
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,The best Lex Luthor.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,Clancy Brown is a prolific voice actor. His IMDB credits are insane. Dude is everywhere.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,I love this game so much and I havnt played it. My brother was and I notice he had no hair on his arms. Told my brother he must be diabetic. Turns out he is in the game. Super awesome detail
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,There can only be one

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,"well this game is forever ruined in my head, thanks."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,"Clancy will always be the definitive Lex Luthor.

Also Hank is the best character in the game."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,Looks like Jeff Bridges as the Dude if he had to go to court
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,How good is this game? I am planning to play it after Control. Love the Synth SciFi stuff like Fallout 4 and West World
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,I have something to say! It's better to burn out than to fade away! Ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,This game was damn near perfect!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,He's also lex Luther in dcau

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Hold the fuck on a second...Clancy Brown voices Mr. Krabs?!?!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"On my first playthrough of DBC, I was thinking to myself, ""Why does hank sounds like Mr.Krabs?"" lol. Paused the game, looked it up and yup! Clancy Brown!"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I LOVE this game
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Dante fell on hard times
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I've been a fan of his since the original Highlander movie. Great actor, great career 👏!"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,And Byron Hadley in Shawshank. Dude has incredible acting range. He was also in Lost for a bit.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Dante
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Clancy Brown is my spirit animal.

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,You mean Lex Luthor
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Devil May Cry 6 looks insane

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"He's the best thing about that game. Good game too. Quantic's best. The ""Two Best Friends Play"" playthroughs of it are legendary."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I gotta replay that
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,he also voiced baron praxis in jak 2 :)
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I always wanted to play this game but never got around to it, I loved Heavy Rain"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,That game was WAY better than I thought.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I didn’t know he’s Mister Krabs! Seen him in Dexter and John Wick 4 recently
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,For me it Shawshank
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I'll always want a detective game starring Hank and Connor. They're the best characters and their chemistry is just perfect for a duo!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"He's great in this! Everything he's in, really!"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Lex Luthor did not fight Superman and the justice league to be referred to as Mr. Krabs!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Ngl he looks like Dante
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I think you mean John Danzinger!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I heard he started sobbing like a little girl when they took him away
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Also Byron Hadley in the Shawshank Redemption. He's wonderfully hateful in the role.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Most recently played the harbinger (the guy with the hour glass) in John wick 4
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,The real Lex Luthor.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Dante role playing as normal human XD.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"The sections with him and Connor are easily the best parts.

Detroit has a lot of issues but it's probably the best Quantic Dream game."

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Nonsense, he doesn't look like Mr Krabs at all."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,How is Detroit Become Human?

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,One of the greatest voice actors ever.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Streamer I watch started this game last night after playing Heavy Rain a couple weeks ago. Chat is keeping a list of things David Cage has clearly never done. I don't know what it ended up as after this first DBH stream, but after HR we had:

* Met a child  
* done laundry  
* been to a park  
* thrown a boomerang  
* read  
* used an inhaler  
* owned blinds  
* been to a mechanic  
* heard the word ""origami"" spoken aloud  
* been in a motel  
* been to a party  
* been in a power station  
* been prescribed antibiotics  
* treated wounds  
* seen an unconscious man  
* played a piano  
* gone through withdrawal  
* overdosed  
* destroyed evidence  
* shot a gun"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,This is such a good game. hope you enjoy it!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Detroit Become Human is an amazing game, and CB adds a ton to the story. I hope you get the canonical ending (the “best” ending). You’ll understand when you get there.

I met CB on the set of Starship Troopers during filming at Hell’s Half Acre in Wyoming (I was an extra - played a medic, played a soldier, briefly played an officer). Like Casper Van Dien, he was really friendly and approachable. I’d only known him as the Kurgan up to that point. It’s been awesome seeing his career flourish over the years."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,And [Jer from Donut Media](https://imgur.com/a/Jlx00dN) for some reason.

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,You will address Dr. Neo Cortex with the correct title!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I mean I think it's safe to say he's never done poorly in a role. Such an underestimated actor.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,MONEY!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,AKA a thousand other roles
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,It's kinda crazy how good graphics are getting. I just recognized Clancy Brown in John Wick 4 but the only reason I knew what he looked like was because I saw him in Detroit Become Human.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"My favorite character in that game, love Clancy Brown"

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I didn’t think much of him as an actor until I played Detroit: Become Human. I think it’s because I always saw him in roles where he played the same punchible asshole. This game gave him range and made him room to grow. I actually wished I could have had more with him and Connor.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I really enjoyed the game, OP. Hope you do too!"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Wish I could find the interview where Clancy is talking about how big of a douche David Cage is (director of the game)
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I stopped playing this game after carrying Lance Hendrickson to take a shit.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Whattttt! I played this game years ago and never knew he was mr. Krabs. It makes so much sense tho
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Nah, that's Lex Luthor!"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,He looks like he has something to say...
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Honestly I wish I could erase my memory of this game to just play it again
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Hank is my favorite character. He was so well written
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Needs a side mission to find his secret formuler...
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Really loved his performance in this game!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,The best Lex Luthor.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,In case your interested the guy who Twitches/YouTubes as DeChart games is the voice of Connor. Nice folks.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"This is honestly one of the beat games I've ever played, hands down!  Not a whole lot of action, but the storytelling and character development is absolutely flawless!"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Looks like Roadkill from twisted metal

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Man, I worked with him on a couple of shows way back-and I ADORE HIM, he’s a gentleman, upfront and completely understanding of what he wants in a Costume without being all about looking “attractive” -nothing but the character matters-and just appreciative and kind as frick! I would say he’s got that “big guy forced to fight” thing going on-he’s gentle to anyone who he thinks may need that, but takes no sh** and no prisoners-you give respect, you get respect, you don’t….he’s got NO TIME FOR YA"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Maybe my favorite Clancy brown performance. I love hank as a character so much.

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Recognizing voice actors in games is fun. Especially when it catches you off guard. I think my favorite was playing FF7 remake and immediately recognizing Heideggar as “Jake the Dog”. Then looking it up and realizing that’s also the man who voices:

-Marcus in gears of war

-Bender in Futurama

-Wakka in FF10

And way more."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,so did I

He's the detective demon in Invincible and I noticed they altered the demon to look a little bit more like him, versus the original comic book version.

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,The acting and music in this game is top notch. I learned a while back that each character has their own composer.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Looks just like him too. He’ll always be Lex Luthor to me tho

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,We watched The Following recently and seeing Kara and seeing her as a terrible person was both interesting and creepy
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"He also plays a very bad guy in an old HBO show called Carnivale. Its wildly underrated, one of my favorite ever shows with a fantastic ending.  He is wonderful in it.

Go watch it, you will not be disappointed."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,He has a few moments where the krabs comes out

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I had the pleasure of meeting the voice/model actor for Connor (Bryan Dechart) and he was absolutely wonderful in person! Would love to meet Clancy Brown as well (should have got my hard copy signed)
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I like dogs
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Good voice in the game sounds nothing like Krabs though. No way you'd be able to tell just by listening. Even knowing it's him still isn't very convincing because he did a great job with Krabs.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,He's great!  I just saw him in John Wick Chapter 4.  Great character and he had some good lines too.  Keanu also kicked mucho ass...
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Fuuuuck i forgot about this game for like 3 years no I wanna play it again so bad
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,He also the Elder in John Wick 4

Get back on the grill

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,The only thing enjoyable in that game was the buddy cop routine. Everything else was cliche as hell
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Yeah, he's a voice actor for other things too. And an actor too. Jack of all trades. Still surprised so many people didn't know he voiced Mr. Krabs."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Holy shit. I was today years old when I realized the guard from Shawshank Redemption was the voice of Mr. Krabs. That blows my mind!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"In the latin-spanish dub the guy who voices Mr. Krabs, also is the same guy who voices Hank in the latin-spanish version"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,He put on a great performance as well. I love that game
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I've been a Brown fan since forever, and I had no idea he was a major Sponge Bob voice actor until last night.

It is somehow tragic to me more people know him as Mr. Crabs than The Kurgan"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Jeez, Leon Kennedy really hasn't aged well, has he?"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I think you can tell how old someone is by who they associate Clancy Brown with. 

For me its Lex Luther and Sgt. Zim. I did don't think I saw the first Highlander movie until later."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Fantastic actor. He doesn't get enough attention in Hollywood. I'm looking forward to what he brings in Yhe Penguin show.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"He's such an asshole, even if you do everything right he kills you for basically nothing"

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I always see him with safety pins holding his head on! even when i watch shawshank lol.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,It's better to burn out than to fade away!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I still never understand how he would be known more as Mr Krabs or Alan Rickman as Snape.

Small parts of very large careers."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,AKA Mr. Crabs!?!  That’s the motherfricking KURGAN!!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"This game was absurdly fun as it was cheesy at times, and posited some deep questions."

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I guess it's a sign of the times that the OP tied Clancy Brown to Mr Krabs. Most of the people of my generation would probably immediately say Lex Luthor.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Surly Joe the gambler / he will gamble never more
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I want to play this game in future
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Yes.  Actors usually have more than one role in their career.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Sorry your son died Mr. Krabs, but we have a job to do"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Hell yeah. He was in Dexter:znew Blood as well.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Connor and Hank should've been the whole game, honestly. Just my two boys, solving robot mysteries."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Yeah I recently watched John wick 4 and was surprised to see him in it
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Pet cemetery he was wild! Great actor
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Sgt. Zim did not bust his own ass down to Private so he could fight on the front lines and capture the first brain bug for humanity just to be called Mr. Krabs
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I love being able to recognize actors in shows and movies from their videogame appearances, and vice versa.

Some fun examples:

Michael Mando in Spider-Man: Homecoming (Vaas in Far Cry 3)    
Pasha Lychnikoff in Stranger Things season 4 (Dima in Battlefield 4)    
Glenn Morshower in Battlefield 3 (4 out of 5 of the Bayformer films, and like a shit-ton of other military/government agency/law enforcement roles... dude's kinda been typecast)"

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I so wish that series received a proper ending. Such a great show.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Glad I didn't have to scroll *too* far down to see this.

He was so good in that role."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I vaguely do . I watched it when it first aired but it seems like it got canceled in short order .
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I loved that show, really wish they kept it going"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Watched it every week, barely remember it"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,As you should.. every ending is fantastic and adds to the allegory.. one of the best films I've ever played..
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"It's actually fantastic how small variations in choice can lead to very different stories.

I genuinely loved that game and recommend it highly."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Platinum is pretty easy. Took me and my wife 30-ish hours I think. We had so much fun, worth every minute.

After the first playthrough it was a little too much, but we broke that barrier pretty quickly.

Our highlight was of doing the Connor dying on every opportunity trophy. We called this run ""Conor the stupid, and Markus the terrible"". Couldn't bring ourselves to do Kara the bot"", maybe sometime in the future, game still installed just for that.

Amazing game"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"It is compelling and gorgeous looking. Writing can be a little funky and hamfisted, but that’s David Cage for you."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"It's a choose your own adventure story game. You walk a character around and occasionally need to do a quick action like tap a button several times to get someone.off you or push X and turn the left stick a few times. 

Each action has its own branch of the story. For example, if you push someone off of you but get stabbed getting up and survive, that can take the story in a different direction than pushing someone off and not getting stabbed. 

It's weird, beautiful and intriguing but if you feel like driving, shooting, flying and or combo punches, this isn't the game for that. I play this for a few hours a day for a few days at a time then put it down for weeks but keep coming back. I'm about 50% complete."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,It's the best Quantic Dream game for what that's worth.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Yea it’s pretty good, story is great and there’s three different stories you play in that are connected, and of course it’s a interactive game so the story depends on what you choose"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Well worth a play. It has a great story with many different endings depending on your choices.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,It's a good movie.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Eh. It's better than the other games David Cage has made, but that's not saying a lot. It's better than the others because they're less surreal and have less creepy scenes.

(And creepy as in a dream sequence where a woman is chased through her apartment, wearing only her underwear, by two masked men. Which adds nothing to the overall story. I also believe it's the only cage game without a weird shower scene, so it's got that going for it too.)  

The storyline is easy to follow and it very obviously draws inspiration from real world events, which at times becomes painfully obvious. (The robots sit in the back to the bus) David Cage's stories tend to take themselves super seriously, but are very superficial. If you don't know about his old games or all the creepy thing he has done, then it's probably a lot easier to enjoy."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"It's interesting that Ferndale is the place where the outcasts feel safe.

Also, that game takes a lot of liberties with ""Detroit""

Terrific game."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"It depends what you like in games. I hate playing story based games. I like game mechanics and hate downtime. This game is all about the story and the game mechanics are very uninteresting, but are very much tied into creating an immersive cinematic experience. Not everyone loved the story, but I did, I thought it was very cool and that it actually branches into very interesting and unique endings from your actions and decisions in the game. Now again, I don't like it as a game, I would get bored by playing it, but I watched a let's play of it, so to me it was more like a movie, and I really enjoyed that experience. I think it's one of the better story heavy games I've seen. So I would recommend it, but it's up to you if you wanna play or watch it"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"It's one of the best choose-your-own adventure story-based games. Your choices actually matter for once and affect the story, which branches out in many directions depending on the choices you make."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Bought it for like $20 last week and already beat it once. Strongly recommend, especially if you can get a good deal on it. I won’t replay it any time soon, but I absolutely will replay it multiple times in the future once it’s not as fresh in my mind. Great characters and very compelling story."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I will say, the choices actually matter in Detroit which is really nice. Many choose your own adventure style games only give the illusion of choice. 

Like I did two playthroughs of Until Dawn, one where i played ""correctly"", tried to get everyone out alive, made natural decisions, etc. Then I did a playthrough where I tried to kill everyone and was an asshole to everyone. The game was basically the same all the way through except for one or two little bits.

But in Detroit, your decisions actually change the story a lot, and early choices often come back around later. 

That includes the main characters being able to die at many points of the game."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"One of the best I've ever played.  Not much in the way of action, but the storytelling is phenomenal, and literally every decision you make has consequences, leading to multiple endings."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"It is very pretty and has rather specific idea as a setting. You are basically forced to replay it several times, because playing it blind and making logical decisions will inevitably lead to the ""bad"" ending, because there are way too many dumb but critical decision points. Like for example running through an industrial looking corridor and end at the T intersection where you need to go left or right, and that influences end result a lot. And there dozens of such obscure and illogical choices.  

Also please consider that PC port of this game is the worst piece of software garbage I have seen in the past decade. It is likely that it won't even start on your PC, regardless if it's old or modern top of the line rig. And developers have abandoned it right after the release. It is easy to check - go to Steam page of the game and check news, there are no patches for this junk whatsoever."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Yeah it's amazing, really good story."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Definitely worth checking out, as are David Cage's previous games Beyond Two Souls and Heavy Rain"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I don't understand how people think it's good. There's no gameplay besides quick time events and the story is horrendous. I cracked up laughing at what was supposed to be an emotional finale because it was just so absurd

Even besides the ending the writing is just horrible all around"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,No

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"To be fair, depending on OP's age, it could have been his first exposure to him. My own first exposure was him as Lex Luthor is Superman: TAS. And Spongebob defined a generation."

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,He IS the definitive Lex to me.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,GIVE ME ONE GGOD REASON NOT TO THROUGH OFF THIS ROOF!!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Like the actual Lex?  From the Batman cartoons?
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,And the step dad in Pet Cemetery 2 where he gets his throat ripped out by a resurrected dog.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Flex Luthor to those who should bow before his glory.

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,EXCEPT for Mr Krabs.  He does a ton of voice over work for TV and video games and its almost always just his normal voice (which is fine... he's an awesome voice actor with a great voice).  But for Mr Krabs he sounds so different.  I'd never know it was him without being told.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Once you notice it you'll start hearing him everywhere, the man's had a very prolific career."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Seriously how do you say he played Uka Uka and NOT Neo Cortex first?
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,And Baron Praxis from Jak 2!

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Yes and he is sent to find his brother: Maul Oppress
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Favorite here! 
His delivery of 
“Patience, commander… we play helpless.. we train them to eat from our hand… and then…”

During the baron tower sequence is great!"

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"To be fair, he’s been Mr. Krabs since 1997, and a pretty prolific voice actor since even before that."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Yes I can't believe he'd sink down to the likes of Tom Kenny
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Actually sir, it's Private."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Also Rawhide in Buckaroo Banzai. And the lead in Earth 2 (unsuccessful but cool TV show).
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Saw that one as a kid. Bad choice.

He has such a great delivery of that line, he really cemented that role. The pure contempt he has for Superman just drips from that."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Voiced by Giancarlo Esposito!

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,that could have been the greatest show of all time
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I dunno, the creator himself has gone on record claiming the game is not an allegory for slavery lol

Don’t get me wrong, enjoy the game all you like, David Cage’s head is just so far up his own ass he has no idea what’s a good decision and what’s not."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Playing this with my son, such a great bonding experience as we shout at the screen when we make a bad choice and have to deal with the consequences."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I lost focus before I got every ending but I loved the game, I wish there were more like it."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Always shocks me to learn that people like David Cage games. Reminds me that I'm too plugged into certain echo chambers sometimes.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"And somehow the most cliche part of it(the buddy cop part), is the most compelling.


Connor and Hank are great. They make the game worth it for sure."

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,">but if you feel like driving, shooting, flying and or combo punches, this isn't the game for that. 

That being said, the action sequences are fukin awesome cause they can actually choreograph the fights unlike most games, all you have to do is hit x at the right time. And since all the characters you play are robots they can pull off some dope stuff."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Sounds like a nice break from grinding open world games. It’s been on my Steam wishlist for a while now so I’ll pick it up and give it a shot.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Do you press ‘X’ to Jason much in this one?
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,heavy rain ❤️
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Nice. I just built a new system so I might make this game my first test drive.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Yeah I see the price went back up again.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"They did a pretty good job, but it's still easy to break the story if you combine choices the developers didn't anticipate."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I’m on Steam right now and will go check it out. I am looking for a game to test my new system and it doesn’t sound like this one is it, but I’ll still try it out to see what it’s all about."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Thanks for the tip! I’ll try this one first and check the others out later assuming they aren’t linked to one another of course.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,It was important to illustrate to the other recruits how buttons/hands work.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,That's the most famous *character* he's played by a longshot but I don't imagine many people know it's him
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Sorry, forgot he busted his ass back to Private in order to catch a brain bug."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I was surprised too tbh.

He spends a lot of his time around prisons for some reason."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,And before that he voiced Savage Opress in Clone Wars and Ryder Azadi in Rebels. Dude's got a wild Star Wars resume alone
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I liked him in the series Lost! Probably only thing holding together Desmond’s backstory..
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Was the main baddy in dexter new blood also. His character was fucking crazy
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I feel like he has played or voiced like five characters in the star wars universe
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,And he was Ryder in Star Wars Rebels

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,THE best voice actor for Lex Luthor.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,Even more obscure (I think) Wild Bill Hickock in Legend of Calamity Jane. That show had an amazing voice cast.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Carry on, private!"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Sonny!
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Those freaky trumpets on the soundtrack still haunt me.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,I didn't look at is as being about slavery as much as a definition of what sentience and life really is.. Its truly a study on the human condition.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Creators can be wrong about their own creation.  It's absolutely an allegory for slavery.  It's also an examination of sentience.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"The creator may be a dick but the game is still amazing. I don’t care what he says about it, it’s an incredible experience and it’s quality blows away a lot of what we get nowadays which is both amazing, and kinda sad."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I'm not entirely sure the authors intent even matters really. If the audience sees it as an allegory, then it is one imho."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Cage's demonstrably false statements about his own games just make the experience better
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"He's a hack with no real spine creatively. He wants the imagery that's associated with slavery and civil rights, because it looks good on the back of boxes and in trailers. But he doesn't want to actually engage with those themes on a deep level. That would require good writing, and Detroit definitely doesn't have that lol."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"The first time I played, I managed to get Connor killed in the very first mission. My girlfriend still claims that was the loudest I have screamed"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,This game made my feel literally every emotion that exists at some point.. You two will be talking about it for years.. Core memory material. I played it new and when my wife got into streaming I insisted she play it.. She went for every possible outcome and still will jump in from time to time.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Heavy rain and Beyond Two Souls where similar games from the same developer. Both very good
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,The internet is full of bandwagon opinions.. Dude is not the best writer in the world but Detroit is a standout gem.. When people try to pick it apart I tend to just laugh it off because I honestly enjoyed it and thats what matters.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Their actors are great.  I hear they got to do some improv on the roles, maybe that's why they're so good despite being in a David Cage game."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,“Least rapey David Cage game”
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"If you don't analyze every scene and pick it apart like the internet loves, it's a perfectly fine story. It's not a masterpiece but most things aren't, doesn't mean it isn't worth your time"
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Definitely stick with your choices and don't reload saves! You might feel compelled to but it's worth seeing the story through to the end. After you finish you can always go back to specific chapters and replay them anyway you'd like
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Enjoy, it's been such a fun ride, like playing an interactive movie with an interesting and deep plot. Hope you enjoy it."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Heavy Rain is good, but none of the choices matter at all."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"David Cage games are basically interactive movies using quick time events. You might either love this or hate it. But I fully David Cage's writing compelling despite the way he handles things sometimes. But I always platinum his games (which says a lot because I don't normally care about platinum trophies). Cube it a crack, I don't think you'll regret it."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Do it. Such a different experience than other games. And it plays well with old and young who can make the choices together like I'm doing with my son. I look forward to seeing where we take the story. So fun.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Summer sale is in a couple of weeks! Odds are it’ll be on discount again.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Just a heads up - 1) it may well work fine from the start on your PC, it's a possibility. 2) keep in mind 2 hours of gameplay time and 14 days since purchase, Steam limits for the refund, don't exceed 2 hours it the game is crashing every time and refund. 3) if the game does launch, try to play quickly through the first mission to the after mission menu. In one of my attempts to make it work I got game running but the menu had been stuttering horribly and game eventually crashed. 4) try different video drivers if the game is running badly. Important - after every driver change you need to delete compiled shaders from the game directory (unfortunately I don't remember correct path) to force their recompilation. Eventually after several driver changes and shader recompilations, this game stopped crashing and I've managed to complete it."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,None are connected to each other in anyway so you're all good on that front
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,Stabs speak louder than words
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-09,"I really really enjoyed the game too, even if other people didn’t."

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I was working the box at a theater when he came in to watch a movie.  He's very recognizable.  I'd say the best word to describe his stature is ""goon"".  I can't speak to his demeanor as he just bought a ticket and went in, but he definitely gives off the vibe as someone who would be good at busting skulls and getting people to fall in line, even IRL in normal clothes."
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,He also got thrown in prison as Long Feng in avatar.
1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,He also played Ryder who escaped an imperial prison in Rebels

1444z6m,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"I really liked New Blood. Wasn't as good as the OG days but walks all over seasons 5,6 & 8 (I have a soft spot for 7)."

I enjoyed Detroit: Become Human specifically for the dynamic between Hank and Connor. Should have cut the game down into just them and had it be more character-driven. Every other part felt like uninteresting filler even when it's dealing with ideas and scenes that should be more compelling. I have to imagine the actors brought a lot to the Hank and Connor scenes; I remember hearing they pushed back on the script in a lot of places and did enough improv that it apparently perturbed Cage at times."

I did kind of the same but with my stove; I moved in to an apartment with one of those funky modern electric stoves and all the numbers were scrubbed off over the years. These new electrics, they are simple, you don’t turn them clockwise and start at low. On some burners you do, on some ‘high’ is at the bottom and medium is halfway on both sides. So long story short I googled the manual and printed out a picture of what the knobs said when new and taped it to the backsplash. 2 and a half, almost three, years later and I still can’t use my stove without it."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"It's Easy man! All you need to remember is: 

X is on the bottom on Playstation, and X is on the left on Xbox, where Playstation has the box where XBox has the X. But it's switched on the Nintendo Switch, X is on top, not the bottom of the Box- that's Playstation 
Just remember the X is next to the bottom right of the Box, unlike Xbox where the X is on the left because it's switched places with the Switch, which has the X on the top (above and to the right of the Box if we're referencing from Playsation)"

One thing that happens to me personally is that whenever I play only Nintendo games for too long I get used to pressing the A button to confirm so when I get back to playing Playstation I end up pressing the O button instead of the X button a lot, resulting in the opposite action.  

I think you'll get used to it quickly so no worries. Have fun!"

I’ve never had an Xbox, only PlayStation, and every time I play a game on PC with my PS4 controller the controls are usually in Xbox layout and I don’t know wtf to press while playing. Game says “press Y to interact” and I’m like which freaking button is Y again???? Hence the post it."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I should’ve thought of this when I went from Wii U to PS4. That was a rough transition.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I played that game recently. (It is awesome, hope you enjoy it!!) I was also a new PlayStation gamer and had a really hard time remembering which button to push, especially during the fast action sequences. Who knows why, but I found I could remember the keys better if I associated them with a number. If you think about them in order of number of strokes you need to make with a pen to draw them, circle is 1, X is 2, triangle is 3, square is 4. Also, your finger kind of moves from right to left in a zigzag in the order of the numbers. 1 on the right, 2 down, 3 up, 4 further left. So instead of thinking 'mash the circle!!!', I thought, '1! 1! 1!', and my finger would automatically go to the right button. Maybe this will work for you, maybe not. . . but as someone with a mathematical mind, the numbers worked way better than the symbols. Good luck!"
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,If console companies would just put X in the same god damn place every time I wouldn't have trust issues tbh.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,The Switch controller fucks me up completely as an Xbox player. It's exactly the opposite (A<->B and X<->Y). I have to just completely ignore the button icons they put on screen and learn it using Xbox buttons.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,But are you sent by cyberlife?
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I feel your pain, 90% of my failed quicktime events on games is due to the way Sony has their controller set up. I went from Nintendo (SNES) up to Gamecube and then over to the Xbox, that A-B, X-Y setup feels natural, still getting used to the shapes instead."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,As a long time PlayStation fan I have them all memorized to heart....but I recently added an Xbone to my collection and could certainly use this idea!
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,My gf bought that but I didnt play it yet (stuck on witcher and not much time). Is it worth it?

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Hah that will come in very handy as the game goes on, the QTE's speed up quite a bit - I also suggest paying attention to the difference between the icons for 'moving the analog stick to the left or right' and 'shaking the control to the left or right'.. that screwed me over several times.   
  
It's a really fucking awesome game, one of the few ones my non-gamer wife enjoyed watching enough to sit through my entire playthrough."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Ugh jesus - that's a great idea.  I went through the SAME thing with this game.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Clever! I always have difficulty transitioning between consoles. I need to adopt this
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I bought an Xbox One X just to play Red Dead 2 when it came out. I've been a PC gamer my entire life and that was my first console. I could not get used to using a controller for aiming and ended up buying this thing called Xim Apex which lets you plug in a mouse and keyboard and bind your own controls. I think it works for Playstation also.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Yep.  Being a PC gamer with an Xbox One controller and also a Switch owner is KILLING ME.

I think that might even be worse because at least with Xbox and PS4, the bottom button is generally the GO/ACCEPT button.  On the Switch, it's the A button on the right.  FML."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Oh man! I love this game. The story holds up against anything in all of fiction. Get ready for some agonising decisions, and some absolute gut punches"
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Xbox is the only controller I can play with. It's the only controller not made for toddler hands.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I can't get the PlayStation button set up out of my head. It's really the best one once you get used to them.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I played them all as a kid, so trying to translate for my friends was always interesting."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I was a PS3 player for years and now I play on the computer with the Xbox controller. I would never think of such an unnecessary solution. It's so simple that you don't even need an hour to memorize it.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"lol similar issue here. lifelong playstation user who will never, ever get used to Nintendo's button orientation. Failing a Quick Time Event then looking down at the buttons before re-doing it has become the norm.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"lol.

I've got the opposite problem. We got a Switch (Have a Wii but other than that I haven't owned a non-PlayStation console since Genesis), so I'm telling my wife ""Press Triangle! Square! R2!"" and she's like ""Huh?"". It's been months and I still don't have it down. I only know locations and I still call them by their PS names."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Oh man. You shoulda seen me struggle to play Sekiro on my pc, with the button prompt actually properly aligned to the labeled button in a switch pro controller. I was having some serious issues for a while."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I played on a PS2 when I was little then had a 360 for my teen years. I know before pretty well, haha. Now, 3DS buttons? Forget about it. :P"
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I use a PS4 controller with my PC and I sometimes tell my friends controls in PS4 terms, but most games on PC use Xbox buttons so it gets awkward sometimes.

Me: *looks at controller* ""... I meant A ..."""

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"When Sony designed the controllers for the original PS1, they came up with this.
-Circle means, accept or correct, and is used as enter for Japanese games. 
-Cross means, cancel or wrong, and is used to go back in Japanese games.
-Square means, menu, cause menus are usually square. :P
-Triangle means something like change,(POV)"

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,This is a good idea for this game if you don’t know the controls. Plenty of importantly times button presses throughout so you don’t want to make the wrong choice.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I guess I’ve just played enough consoles that button placement doesn’t really affect me spent many many hours on both PlayStation Xbox and Nintendo so I rarely get mixed up unless I’m like using a PlayStation controller on my computer and it prompts me with Xbox commands even then I don’t struggle that much but that’s just me I think lol

I've had a Switch for few months now and it's all a mess. A and B are exactly where I remember them. X has been moved up, and outta nowhere I have to deal with a Y button that I haven't seen before ever. I still have no idea what the triggers are called."

    ⃞
 
 ⃞: This is on the squared side of the controller where the buttons are, the left.

          O
O: This is one the rounded side of the controller where the buttons are, the far right.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"The damn switch uses the same buttons as the Xbox but rotated 90 degrees.  WTF Nintendo, why!?!  Use something else or keep it the same, don't do the same thing a different way and confuse the fuck out of everyone."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,The PS4 is my first PlayStation ever. First game I would play was PaRapper the Rapper. The fact that square and circle almost have the same colour and look a like from a distance is something that still annoys me.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Man, is it bad that this has never been a problem for me? Was I so spoiled as a kid it's always been natural for me to pickup a controller and go?

I don't think I have ever had that ""look down at the controller"" moment for anything I have ever played. I barely count Metal Gear Solid swapping O and X as confirmation buttons. I grew up Nintendo for some time. SNES, Gameboy, and N64. Being an only child, and having grandparents whose other grandchildren were 3000 miles away, Playstation, Gamecube, and Xbox all came soon after. I've had every iteration of those consoles since."

X is X the main button :)"

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I feel like this might be a tough game for learning controls.  Each button needs to be pressed quickly and there isn't a specific corresponding reaction.  Where as an action game for example where X is jump, O is dodge, Square is attack etc. you look at the controls and now know every time I hit this button it attacks and since square is attack when playing future games that old ""attack"" button must be square.  Not sure if that make sense but it seems to me while this game is not a difficult one, a game like Rayman Legends or something like that might be better for learning the Controller."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I need this for when I play Xbox. I find myself looking down at my controller almost every time a button prompt comes up. And then, this further complicates things when I play on my Switch, since it has the same buttons as the Xbox, but in different positions."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I've played PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo all my life. I still can't remember the button layout on any Nintendo controller from the N64 onwards and I've never known why?!"
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I have been playing Switch almost exclusively the last few months. Switched back to playstation this week and I was all kinds of messed up at first.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Very smart tho
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Hi Daniel !
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I feel your pain, I've been a ps player ever since the release of the original console and I've recently got a switch and I keep quiting menus instead of accepting."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"* Square is on the left, close to the middle part of the controller. The middle part of the controller is rectangular.
* Triangle is on the top. It points up.
* Circle is on the right, close to the right side of the controller. The right side of the controller is rounded.
* X is the other one. (Or: X marks the spot where you dig in the ground. It's on the bottom.)"
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,This is brilliant. I can’t get into Red Dead because of this problem. I lose the game in looking for buttons.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I did that when i remaped the controls for kh3, because fuck jumping with O"
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Same thing with me but on Xbox Controller RT/RB, LT/LB were the most confusing buttons to remember for me. But I mainly play on PlayStation so I remember the buttons perfectly."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"X is easy, triangle looks like an arrow pointing up, circle is to the curved side, and square is to the side with the square in between."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Or you can look at your controller??
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"That's adorable. I still have trouble switching mindsets between Switch, PS4 and Xbox controllers."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,You can just look down at your controller..

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,When I switched to PC and bought a 360 controller it didn't take too long to get used to it so don't worry you be button mashing like a pro in no time
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Nice gamecube
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I would buy a 4 now but the 5 is right around the corner
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Wow man that’s a good idea, I have not played with any console other then PlayStation since the ps1 and now with my switch in like totally screwed."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Or you could look down lol
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Could also use it as an option randomizer  and just throw something sticky and pick the option it lands on
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"This entire thread is driving me insane. I refuse to believe so many people have THIS much trouble remembering 4 buttons, even WITH muscle memory coming from another console."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,My S.O. likes to remind me how on our first date 9 years ago I couldn't walk across the bridge in the opening of AC 2. Like walk in a straight line. It comes fast though! Good luck on your journey. :)

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"This is part of the reason I think the gamecube controller layout is the best.  The shape of the button pops up on the screen and you know which one to press immediately, it doesn't matter what letter or symbol it is."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I play some games (Dark Souls for example) with a controller on PC, but i have a PS3 controller and some program that tricks Windows into thinking a PS controller is an XBox controller...so I keep getting prompts with XBox buttons. Cheap life is tough."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I had a 3xbox and 360 for years, got a ps4 in 2015, I still have a hard time with it lol. I also prefer the xbone controllers, although the dualshock 4 is much better than the dualshock 3."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Jesus I can't even remember when I learned this. Was like 10 back then so it probably didn't even take that long to memorize. What took me a while to get rid of is tilting the controller into the direction your moving ingame.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,headassss
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I was like that when I started Xbox tho too XD
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Honestly, I have never even played anything but Nintendo systems for this reason.  Sounds dumb, sounds childish, but I grew up with the abxyrl buttons and it's difficult to learn a new system and the games on Nintendo were enough for me."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Good solution! Done of the hardest times i had was when i was playing both PS3 and 360 regularly, then Heavy Rain asked me to press X..."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I've always been loyal to Playstation so when I bought an Xbox years ago it was like trying to write with my non-dominant hand.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I've switched to an xbox one after playing playstation for 10 years to play with my roommate and coworkers and its been 2 years and I still call out playstation commands
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I feel this, every time I switch between playing my Switch consistently and then try to play Xbox it's a real struggle 😂😂"
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,You can't just look down at your controller? I'm mean it's more interactive that way after all.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Why do you need to know where the buttons are for a walking simulator?
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I need to get this game.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Play it as much as you can, new ps4’s like to break easily, I just got mine back from being “fixed” for the second time and it still doesn’t work, only had a ps4 for 4 month, bad rep."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Not gonna lie, when PS1 first came out I made a similar chart but with the SNES buttons mapped to the PS1 shapes."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Oh god, i remember that back on ps2 playing god of war with those cut scene battles where you had to quickly mash the correct button.  Took me like 20 times to get through the zeus battle because i either hit the wrong one or was too slow because i looked down at the buttons first.  Thanks for bringing back those memories."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,This is hilarious and ingenious.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"That was the first game I played on the PS4 as well! The quick time events are really tough for noobs!

But it is well worth it, it's a great game. And there are so many more on PS4. May I recommend God of War and Horizon: Zero Dawn, if you like RPGs? They are both fantastic."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I'm going to start doing this for game specific controls for games I play infrequently.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I think old games were a bit harder in this aspect, many games that were ""localized"" so X is attack/action and SQUARE is run/block, but then tons of Japanese games or games not ""completely"" localized we had the opposite actions for the same buttons."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Like everytime I play mlb the show I forget the throw to base buttons are not from my POV. I end up throwing to second when I want to get somebody out at home. The commentators get so confused.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,You could just look down at your controller
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"lmao, this reminds me when I got my first PlayStation with Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets...  The potion classes were so hard for me at the time because I couldn't remember the button positions!"

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Always hated those shape buttons.  I played PlayStation for years and I still don’t know which button is which.  They just had to be different from everyone else using ABCs

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Fun fact: The PlayStation buttons emulate Nintendo’s ABXY button set up. X is actually supposed to be the second button: circle corresponds to A, select/yes, while X corresponds B, go back/no. 

The order of the buttons is based on the number of lines, as well: Circle, X, Triangle, Square are in the same positions as A, B, X, and Y, respectively"
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,lol
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Enjoy the game!!!
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Better than my method of mashing all the buttons until I hit the one I need.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Lol. Seriously?

Anyway, I can’t blame you. That was the same cheat sheet method I used to learn touch typing. In a week or two you will master the position of those buttons.

You did well. I will recommend the same to a friend."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Aw that's cool
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Oh my, that made me smile from ear to ear!!!!

My boyfriend recently got a ps4 and we played Detroit together, except I'm not used to the buttons either, so anytime I got the gamepad, I would quickly say ""carré à gauche, rond à droite"" (square on the left, circle on the right, in French). And anytime a stressful / rapid scene started building up and I knew I'd have to be quick, I kept mumbling it haha. You made my day, thank you!"
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,That's a life hack right there
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I see a few Nintendo consoles there. Every time I play BoTW on switch Nintendo's layout kills me and gets me killed.That's why I play BoTW only on Cemu now(1440p @ 75FPS helps too). With Cemu I can use my xbox one controller and remap the buttons as they SHOULD be. The only thing I want for the next gen is that all consoles unite under one controller layout :/
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I have a switch, a PS4 and use a Xbox one controller on PC and I don't have many problems switching from one platform to other, but still piss me off when in PS4 in Japanese games O is OK but in american games X is OK, like WTF"

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,There was an underrated but odd game called Venetica. It actually put the required button prompt in the relevant side and even added a color effect. That made life easier as I'd play mostly on Ps4 but play pc games with an xbox controller.

Combat in the PS4 GoW is really good."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I did not like this solution. Cinematically, all of the important bits of action will be focused near the center of the screen. On a big enough television, it becomes difficult to notice the button prompts on the far fringes of the screen. Especially when the game is as immersive as God of War 3."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I’ve also seen where they’ll always have the four circles representing the four buttons but only the one(s) representing the one to press has the button on it while the others are just empty circles. This is especially useful in QTEs where you have to do several prompts in quick succession.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I play NBA 2k on switch and PS4. It's horrible seeing the X icon and the fact that A isnt the button on the bottom pisses me off more.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Shit I've been playing Xbox since the days it was just a Halo Adapter and a quicktime event could prompt with a green A and I'd still hesitate and maybe press Y.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I used to have the same problem, but I whenever I struggle I think of the buttons in pairs that have their spots switched. 

For example, I pair up X/Y and A/B. On xbox, the layout is as below:
 ` Y`
`X   B`
 ` A`

On the switch, the buttons are:
  
   `X`
`Y    A`
   `B`

The buttons swap spots with their pair. The X and Y switch, and the A and B switch. 

This might seem more complicated but its how I got used to it.

EDIT: Fuck it, I can't figure out the formatting. I hope you understand what I'm saying"

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Its actually more similar to the switch layout than you might realise. The playstation face buttons were designed not to be letters, and O and X were chosen as abstract symbols for (broadly) Yes and No, Circle for Yes, X for No. Nintendo use A and B for the same concepts, A is yes, B is no. O is in the same location Nintendo puts A, X is in the same location Nintendo puts B. It was meant to provide nearly perfect muscle-memory matching.

Problem was Western developers either didn't get the memo or didn't care, and flipped the way X and O were treated."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Its best qualities are the art direction, Connor storyline, and the sheer scope of choice and variant endings are bigger than any other game I’ve seen. 

However, it has extremely heavy-handed symbolism and drags in a few of its Markus and Kara chapters making it fun for a couple of playthroughs but maybe not more than that. Gameplay itself is very minimal besides choices and QuickTime events. 

A really good option is actually watching Connor’s actor Bryan Dechart stream the game on his Twitch channel."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I paid full price and felt it was totally worth it, but if you want to try before you buy, the game has a demo, which is essentially the first chapter of the game.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"It depends. It tends to appeal to the masses a lot, because David Cage is great at making things seem super dramatic and emotional and impactful. But if you're one of the types to remove yourself from the story immersion wise or your immersion breaks easily, or you think about the game more deeply than surface level, you shouldn't buy it because you'll find it super corny. The game is about Androids being oppressed, and in one scene they literally make Androids sit at the back of the bus. To me, it feels like it was written by someone who just learned that racism exists.

If you're still considering, watch a playthrough of Heavy Rain sometime. It was really similar. Really quite popular with good critical reviews, I even enjoyed it myself, but looking at it today so much of it makes me question how we enjoyed it so much lol."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"The problem is the muscle memory coming from another system. If an Xbox player picks up a PS4 controller and tries to play a game they will be pressing ""square"" instead of ""X"" whenever it shows up, so it can cause issues for a bit. 

I personally play on PC and I'm mainly used to Xbox button prompts, but I use a PS4 controller most of the time. I can freely switch back and forth between controllers easily because I regularly use both. But when a friend tries to play on my setup they'll get confused, especially if the prompts don't match the buttons to press."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"It's not learning it, it's baking it into muscle memory, and ensuring that you're constantly aware that this is the scheme during the more crucial parts of the game.

Not sure if you've played Detroit or not, but pressing the wrong button (or taking too long) could lead to a dramatic unintended consequence for the rest of your entire playthrough, and it can take 30 minutes to an hour in order to replay a scene in order to fix a bad button press. 

It's not a demanding or hard game by any means, but the game is reliant on QTEs and is about the permanence of your choices. Given that the buttons map to different choices for each interaction (because it's a narrative game), it never really trains your muscle memory, and it can get tricky for inexperienced players to keep track of which button is which in the moment. My SO occasionally had trouble with the button layout even once we were decently far into the game, so I get it. 

When the three major consoles have slightly different button layouts and pressing a wrong button has significant consequence, something like this certainly makes sense."

I will say without spoiling that such heavy-handed beating me with the message made me convert from Markus being my favorite to Connor being my favorite (Markus' storyline has basically *no* subtlety after a certain point, and it unfortunately robs his character of any depth he had), which was a shame since I adored Markus at the start of the game and he seemed like he could be a fantastically nuanced character.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"You know what's super fun? Dark Souls on switch. Specifically name creation. 

Dark Souls on Switch tries to keep the same physical button layout of the ps4/xbox version, meaning where A is on Xbox(X on ps4), is the accept button. Only this is where B is on the Switch controller, which on Switch is back...but wait, it gets better. When making a Character in Dark Souls on Switch, you navigate ingame menus for class, hair, etc. This uses B-accept, A-cancel. But then you have to enter a name, which opens up the native Switch on screen keyboard, which uses A-accept B-cancel. So the actions of A and B literally swap from one screen to the next. 

I've played about 1,000 hours of Dark Souls on various platforms, and the Switch version melts my brain every time."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"What’s fun is when developers also keep the same action on the same letter.

B=Back

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"The secret is deflect. You'll break his posture very quickly, if you do go back that is. I'd definitely recommend giving it another go though, some of the later parts of the game are amazing"
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Let’s put it like this.

Genichiro is one of the easier bosses."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Once you figure out genichiro the game becomes much easier and very fun.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I would recommend that you watch someone else fight the boss so you can focus on learning his combos. I too was stuck on Genichiro for days and didnt understand how I couldn't get past him after all the time I spent getting my ass beat. Then I watched a few videos of someone else fighting him, and I started to recognize his combos and the deflect timing that the streamer was using by listening to the clangs of the blades. It's a lot harder for me to pick up on combos and learn a bosses moveset while in the heat of it because I'm focused on not dieing and HOW DO I KEEP DIEING?!?

It was much easier once that aspect was removed. Hopefully it helps you too, because the feeling of finally beating him, along with other Sekiro bosses that I struggled with for days, was more than I felt overcoming any obstacle in a SoulsBourne game.


I'm sure you can find videos rather easily but if you would like a suggestion, I watched Distortion2's videos on YouTube. He speed runs the game and his deflect timing is perfect every time. Just make sure not to watch past where you are or pay much attention to the twitch chat on screen if you dont want any spoilers."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,I saw some reviews (at least on Amazon) say it was borderline unfair. I've played DS1 DS3 and BB and they were punishing but generally fair or at least you understood what you could have done better to not get killed. Thoughts?
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"that was frustrating at first, but now I just recognize that X corresponds to A; square, X; triangle, Y; and circle, B. becomes muscle memory after a while. just like how you don’t need to look at the Playstation controller to know you’re pressing X"
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Lol I would love to spend a day in your mind.
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"That's fascinating and not even close to something I would ever think. X-axis is horizontal, Y-axis is vertical, so X should be on the side and Y on the top, in my mind."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Yup! Japanese systems (and culture in general) use circle for yes or accept and an X for no or cancel.

R1, R2, R3 are arbitrary. Off the top of my head, I’m pretty sure R2 is the bumper, because it’s in the middle, but without looking at a controller I couldn’t tell you if R1 is the bumper or stick, and vice versa for R3.

I’m sure that once you’re used to the 1-2-3 system you have better recall for it, but I bet 99 out of a hundred people who’ve never used a controller before would be able to figure out the trigger-bumper-stick system faster."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Aye. 

Worked for every age. Parents were never into gaming & all that but gamecube + Wii were the only exceptions.

Wii for obvious reasons. They only ever faced it at parties mostly for the kids then but the whole interactive part was fun.

Gamecube? Well, you sit down touch a bit around, look at the colors and after a few minutes it works nearly smoothly. I doubt so many Nintendo games would have worked with an xbox layout."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I think a large portion of what makes sekiro seem so difficult to soulsborne veterans is the fact that it takes the muscle memory from previous soulsborne games and completely throws it out the window. Combat in bloodborne rewards pure aggression and dodge timing. Dark souls rewards patient play with a hefty focus on blocking and dodging, waiting for that singular moment to get some hits in, and shift back to patience.

Sekiro smacks bloodborne players in the face by making the i-frames on dodge miniscule. The JUMP has more I-frames than the dodge. It tricks Dark souls players by making early enemies seem like they have very clear windows of weakness, while later enemies don't seem to. (Which isn't technically accurate, but you basically have to force the openings against most bosses)

That's the real secret to Sekiro, you have to create openings by playing a completely reactionary game to your opponents. The bosses and minibosses have healthbars, sure.  But in most situations killing a miniboss or boss by taking their healthbar to 0 is an inefficient and risky means of defeating them. Combat comes down to learning the best way to strip your opponents defenses/posture, masterfully countering their attacks and forcing your aggression equally with your defense. Your defense is your greatest offensive tool in the game. Deflecting does more damage to your opponents' posture than yours, and as long as you perfectly deflect, there is no attack that can break your posture(except lethal attacks, but those have specific countermeasures), even if your gauge is full.

Combat at its peak in Sekiro feels like a dance where you and your opponent perform against one another."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Definitely not unfair in my opinion. I’ve beat all the DS games and Bloodborne... I do think Sekiro was a little harder, especially the boss fights, but not unfair.

There’s definitely times you’ll think it’s unfair, but with enough practice you learn exactly what you need to do and how to time everything, and something just clicks and it’s the most satisfying feeling. It’s all about timing, and most of the powerful attacks enemies use can actually be used against them once you figure out how and get the rhythm down."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"You know its really weird reading through this thread because I was essentially born with a mouse and keyboard / N64 controller in hand.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Yup. It's all in the timing. If you're burning posture deflecting then you're just doing the basic ""block"" deflection and not the true parry. Doing the parry deflect doesn't consume your posture and does damage your opponent's posture. Also there's a brighter flash and a different tone to the sound. Once you do a few of them you'll be able to recognize them."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I didn't realise this until halfway through the game, but holding down the block button refills your posture. Do it every now and then when you have an opening to avoid getting stunned."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Is this a childhood memory? If so, I love that you remember details of game manuals from 20 years ago. The only ones I've got are the Baldur's Gate II manual (which served as a DnD sourcebook all through middle school) and that the Doom 2 manual called the Spider Mastermind an S.O.B., which I didn't realize was profane until I said it to my sister at dinner."

- B = Back = Bottom

Playstation games in japan use the same positions for their positive (circle) and negative (cross) buttons."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"US game developers flipped it, not Xbox/Playstation.

In Japan, a circle is used as an affirmative like a check mark. And an X is used as a negative. Japanese Playstation games have the same button placement as Nintendo does. Playing FFVII on the original Playstation was always tough to get used to the buttons being flipped because they kept the Japanese buttons in the original localization.

When the Xbox came out they used the American standard instead of the Japanese standard."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Sega Dreamcast is actually responsible for flipping the AB / XY buttons.

I guess from the SNES era.

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,Cage's ideas are good framework but goddamn does he need a better editor to get him on track (or whatever the video game equivalent is). Using actual actors has brought the games some quality and I hope they continue getting better.

But it was also very comfortable to press. I remember some games requiring you to either barely press the triggers or almost press them all the way for different functions.

It really is incredible how the triggers feel better than many controllers today. Great feedback on those bad boys."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Yeah, the fact that no one, not even Nintendo themselves, have replicated the way the analog triggers on the Gamecube registered a new input when pressed all the way past that *click* (Steam controller doesn't count, let's be real) is just baffling to me!"
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"Don't get me wrong. It is really great having analogs like that for niche situations (racing games come to mind and of course SM Sunshine), but I mainly use mine for smash these days, and have L bound as a jump. Unfortunately, the travel time makes it a pretty frustrating input over something with a bit more action. My issues with the Z button may just be hand shape, but I find it hard to press."

bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I haven't been able to explain why new triggers feel worse than the GC controller, but that's it! Thank you!"
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"The Steam controller does count, but it'd be nice if other controllers had that feature.

&#x200B;

Actually, I feel the Steam controller implemented it far better than the Gamecube did. The Gamecube trigger's long linear travel feel kinda weird to press down, and it doesn't feel great with large hands. A larger cutaway would've helped, but just adding a button to the bottom of a modern hinged trigger pull is a much more natural feeling solution."
bptrg3,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,"I can see you having an issue with smash if you use it like that but at the same time that's more of a small personal problem. Not everyone rebinds their buttons for smash. Only the really competitive people and that's a small percentage compared to everyone else who plays it casually. I personally still use the same control scheme but I just disable jumping with the stick. 

In the grand scheme of things, like you mentioned racing and sunshine, there's so many cool things to do with having the triggers be analog and digital at the same time. Maybe if they added a left bumper to it then you would have a better jump button."

Anything in that realm and I eat that shit up. But this story did nothing for me, and I got all three characters to the end. Maybe it's that the story didn't try to do anything new with an established trope, but I've loved plenty of other derivative things. I don't know. 

Maybe it's the game genre, I'd played Heavy Rain and LA Noire and sort of felt the same, just a sort of content-""meh"" feeling. Didn't dislike the experience, just didn't love it either."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"That is legit. Now if you'll excuse me, just gonna sort by controversial to see the reddit moment comments"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I almost couldn't tell which one was the game, ngl."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,i thought the left was from the game for a second
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Which one is the cosplay?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,The one on the left just looks like an 4k edition fuckin amazing
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I loved this game, it also taught me I instinctively make bad decisions, I had to cheat on my second playthrough to get the good endings"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Women are really nice. Sometimes I see them passing by.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Very good almost couodnt teel
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,this was such a good fucking game.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,This is good. At first I thought it was just a graphics upgrade but then I read the title.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I'm so high I thought you were a better render than the original
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"> Move to Detroit

Nah, I don’ mind"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,All I can hear when seeing this picture is Alice saying Kara with that annoying voice...
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Synths
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,My name is Car
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Lol as if i wouldn't notice the 2 are just the same pics, nice try"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,damn she really did
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I had to do a double take to see which was real and the game
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,when ps5 is out you won't be able to tell who is a videogame and who isnt
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Where is the cosplay? Its the same picture
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Bring me a beer, Kara."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Danm this looks like Kara with top of the line graphics.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I don't like detroit but damnn cool cosplay though.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Why is the dress glossy?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Holy hell, missed the title and thought this was an ""e3 vs actual"" post.

Fucking great job."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I hate to admit this, but I’m playing this game right now for the first time. It’s absolutely AMAZING. I got it a couple of months back when PSN gave it away for free, and since last Sunday haven’t been able to put it down"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,So.. Which one is the cosplay?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Wasnt even sure which one was irl at first!
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I miss this game. Let a coworker borrow it, he moved to a different state and refuses to reply to any of my messages to return it to me."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Which one's which?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"how did you light up the led in the head? That's attention to detail, I would've cheaped out, and made the ""post going rougue"" version"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Never played the game, but the costume is on point."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I thought it said Karen
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Same picture
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Nice
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,No joke I wouldn’t know which one was the cosplay if it weren’t for alice being in the right one. This is extremely good cosplay
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Fun fact: hanks VO is the same VO as Mr. Krabs
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,[removed]
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Which one is the cosplay ? x)
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Took me a while to figure which one was the game and which one was the cosplay. This is amazing
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,They should make another
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I thought the left one was the game version when I first looked ngl
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Great job looks almost like a carbon copy.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"You have just reminded me I need to play this game. Avoiding the comments, for spoilers in the form of funny quotes. Just saying thanks for the memory jig"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Didn't they modeled it after you
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I always felt Kara was the heart of the game. Out of all the other crazy stuff that happened I just wanted those 2, to be okay."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,That’s amazing! Well done
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,detroit become uncrackable.

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Does the title of his game make sense in Franglais?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Thats an incredible cosplay omg
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,cage is a pedophile
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Hands down this was a beautiful game

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I started playing a few weeks ago for the first time. I fucked up so bad with her storyline, I still feel bad about it."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Cosplay - better than Netflix casting.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Is this a Sony exclusive?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I didn't saw the difference a few seconds there TBH
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"All that attention to detail and you put a blue bar where it says ""how may i help you?"""
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I like the glowy parts:-)
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"If not for Alice in the background and the skin, I'd still be confused which one the cosplay is. It is absolutely perfect!"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Eat! I need to eat! It’s been a crazy long time since I’ve eaten! I don’t know what to do! I’m going really crazy! I think i’m turning into gho... gollum gollum

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Never played it, so it took a sec longer to figure out which one was real. Awesome cosplay"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I couldn't tell which one is from the game until I looked closely, well done"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Can anyone tell me how she did the blue lighting affect? Is it post, or a really thin LED style light. I think I figured it out in my head, I just can't find anything with a quick internet search.

Really nice work."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,This is dooooooope
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Where can I buy you?

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I haven't seen this before but now I'm kind of distracted by ow untextured and flat her clothes look compared to the rest of the scene.  Weird.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,You reminded me of Eva Elfie
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"RTX : on

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,This isn't cosplay. This is excellent.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Iv e never played that game but that cosplay is spot on
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I wanna be Connor and carry around a blue drink that I just keep dipping my fingers in
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"wait, you are Kara!"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Human become Detroit
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Amazing! And such a great game too
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,6/10
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Do we feel that cosplayers ever choose a costume based solely on ease of cos and play with expected high rate of up and door?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Literally took a second for me to tell which is real and which is the game
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Hairdryer and weight to get the wrinkles out of the plastic
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I feel like her Face suits North more and could pull off a good cosplay of her.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,It's the same picture!
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,The girl on the left looks like cgi too though. Anybody?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Detroit: Become Android
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,2 screen shots?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Your dress is too wrinkled.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,i thought it was Williams Racing new outfit lol. Ah too much F1 2019 i guess
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Everyone gangsta till someone stab you 28 times
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,You really look like her.... hmmmm.....

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Wow!
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Huh. She's wearing a clear waterproof apron. Never noticed that.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I have this game but haven't started it, is it any good?"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,got almost everything right except the words under her name
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,She became human :0
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Stop it
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Look realistic..
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Waw, the real one looks much better 😍"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I wanna know how they pulled off the little light on her head is it wired?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Even the real person looks like a video game character, I guess that means it's a very good cosplay because she's dressing up as an android."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Let me see her tooth brush if it’s not legit
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Game was sick. And I got the best ending so yeah...
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"What a coincidence, just started playing this a few hours ago :)

Still don't know who to root for. Connor vs Kara chase was a weird one for me, since i wanted both to succeed 😂😂😂"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Damn, you look practically identical."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"This has no intention of calling out anything wrong with the costume, how would you manage to get that smooth sheen, is that like some sort of leather or plastic?"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Low effort
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Is it bad that it took me a good few seconds before I realized that the one on the left was the cosplay. They look so similar
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I honestly thought the left one was the game first. Never played it, just thought it looked like that."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Bro why does that look like some official promotional stuff
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,[deleted]
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Which one is the cosplay

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,but then you realize that you can customize Kira in a ton of different ways and only some people keep base Kara
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Dang the girl on the right is Really Killing That Costume!
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I wish they would discount this game, I'd like to play it on my PC, but not @60 AUD :/"

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,For a second I didn’t know which one was the game
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"First thought without reading ""Oh, Detroit gets a next gen remake."""
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Wow
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,When you though the pic on the left was the reference shot for a second.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,This is incredibly well done! I need to pick that game back up and finish.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I was honestly really confused on which one was real. This is why I can’t wait for next gen
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,That game changed me
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Now you get a girl to be Alice or a boy to be Luther
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I hate being rude, but what the fuck man. This isn’t even you. Hell, most of your content isn’t yours. People put hard work into these things only for little fuckers like you to take all the credit."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,That is spot on! Very pretty
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Is this image computer generated ?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I think I'm blind because I spent some time figuring out who is the cosplayer.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,They’re the same picture.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Fuckin nailed it!
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Good enough, but it’s as if I’m missing something in the face"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Unpopular opinion: this game is shit, and what saved it is the game only looked good."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Whenever I see Kara I can’t help but see Jennifer Lawrence
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Her face kinda looks like Rashida Jones
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,which ones a cosplay?

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Man that's so well done I thought you were the game character
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Are they both computer animated? It certainly looks so.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,holy shit. hope to see more of you work. great job.

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-25,Okay but which one is the cosplay?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-25,Spoiler! So I ended up in the camp for microwaving. My friend told me how he was at the border trying to cross at the bus station and getting through cause he was doing a  passive run. We both had no idea those endings
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-25,First i chould not tell the diffence
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-25,Noice

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Ok🤯

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Everything is very similar except where you decided to part your hair. It could go a little more to the right.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Damn at first glance I can't tell which one is from game which one is real.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Wow that ps5 unreal engine going to town.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Which one is the footage from the game?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,[deleted]
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Awesome. Looks like her dress in the game is latex. Would have been soooo hot ans uncomfy ! Good choice in material you've made.

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,[removed]
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Cosplay done right. Portraying the character perfectly without having to rely on making them sexy.

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Does the one on the right have a dick?

Edit: I'll take all the downvotes as a no. It was a legitimate question. I've never played the game I don't know what type of shit it offers, and the reflection looks a lot like an erection"

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Is it cosplay to just wear a dress?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,So damn average

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Wtf, there's actual cosplay? I thought it only counted if you increased your bust size to twice of the original character, halved their clothes and ensured shirts, tops and bras are far too small for the model's breasts."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,the only difference is how shiny and figure-defining the white parts of the suit tho
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,How hard would it have been to use actual latex and make it almost perfect? The fabrics kinda ruins it.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I'm really disappointed we didn't get a fully interactive robo sex scene with different positions and pp sizes. So mad

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,You do great work then!
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,It looks so accurate.... Could be like a ps5 remaster of the game XD
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,You did a great job!
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,This is so good that I thought the left one was a demonstration for RTX or something. Amazing cosplay!
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Wow it’s not even as latex-y fake gamer girl - obvious sarcasm is obvious, love it, very good"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Well it’s spot on
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I couldn't tell the difference between your cosplay and the game for a good thirty seconds. You're amazing at cosplaying
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,This is a great cosplay
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,You're quite good. u/ProKirie
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Your cosplay look a lot better than the in-game character, imo!"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I’ve just realized how beautiful you and Kara are. You’re born to be her...
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Impressive cosplay. You look identical to Kara.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,You did a great job!
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Yo fantastic cosplay. Not oversexualized or anything of the sort. Stuck to the character completley. 10/10

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,You look much better than the game holy shit.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"This cosplay is so good that I now want to buy you...

Edit: It was a joke meant to be a compliment. Cause, you know, Kara is an android that you can buy in the universe of the game. And the cosplay is really good. Yeah, I'll see myself out."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,How did you do the light? Photoshopped?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Amazing job!
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Did you sew the dress?

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,What makes this cosplay and not just a costume?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Don't worry ma'am. I just downvoted every one of his posts *tips fedora*

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Kara best girl
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Well in that case you nailed it! When I played the game I felt her choices were the easiest to make because I’m a dad and I hated seeing the kid treated that way
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,this is the second time i see this get reposted
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Well, instead of commenting on the post, I'll drop my comment where the OC can see it: That cosplay actually looks like if Kara was in TLOU Part 2, that's how good it is"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"It's very cool! I'm impressed by the LED integration in the outfit, it's something I'm very interested in. Was it difficult?"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I don’t k ow who this character is. I would die for Kara.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Looks like you chose a fabric with a coating instead of latex/pleather?

Probably a good cost effective decision."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,So sorry people so shit like this. Your work is amazing! I love DBH so it is awesome to see people cosplay it!
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"i cant do much but i upvoted your posts, your cosplay is very good!"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,This is so cool! How did you make the glowing bits?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Question, one the cosplay. 
The lit portions of the cosplay, are those reflectors or are they actually glowing in the picture?"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,no
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,godamn this is amaze

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,This is awesome! Nice work!!
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"And yet, 48.0k karma..."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Went to upvote most of your posts. Damn I'm a hero
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Why is this comment highlighted Orange?

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I like the work, was curious if there’s any reason you didn’t go with like latex or something like it to get the smoothness? My guess would be heat but if it was just for a photo shoot I don’t know how much it would matter."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Here you go. One million credits!

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-26,You look more like that character than the character itself does
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Damn sucks that OP didn’t give credit
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Thought I remembered seeing this within the last week already.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Why not petition the admin to remove the post or credit you instead of blindly to pandering the public that consists solely of individuals that both read comments and scroll down?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,You did real goodly
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I have to say two things:

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I recommend it. It's very story driven with basically only QTE's but it's still really good.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Such A Good game

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Thank you. I was wondering the same thing
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,She was pretty good in The Following.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,North is the actress who plays Dove in Titans.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Valerie Curry or something like that, right? Been awhile since I've played the game."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"The ""Harriet Tubman"" of Detroit is in an episode of Superstore, and I when I got to that part of the game I had that same brain itch of, ""where do I know this person from?""

Sadly now when I watch anything at home, my wife and I miss huge portions of things because we end up IMDBing every actor without pressing pause."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,What's her name
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I watched an episode of Grey's Anatomy once and I kept thinking I'VE SEEN THAT ACTOR SOMEWHERE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE. It honestly took my like an entire day of thinking, since I wasn't thinking of a video game."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Came here to say this, basically.

Unreal Engine 5 vs Unreal Engine 4"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I have never been more stressed out playing a game than when the police officer was searching the house. Had to go play something else after that chapter just to calm my heart rate.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Yeah
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I wonder if any of the cosplay posts here are actually done by the OP

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I kind of feel the same way. I enjoyed the game for the most part - it was definitely the most intense game done in this style that I’ve ever played, and it was a beautiful and impressive technical achievement. But I feel like the themes were a little too heavy-handed without saying anything new. I love existential sci-fi, and I want to see a game like this making an attempt to define consciousness, and really dive deep into what makes these androids different and similar to humans. Instead this was just an on-the-nose parallel to the Civil Rights movement. Which is also important, but not necessarily on-topic."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I've only watched other people play David Cage's games, but from what I've seen there's always this conspiciously artificial feeling in the storytelling, with its transparently deliberate attempts at trying to tug at your heartstrings. Yahtzee Croshaw's tongue in cheek description of Cage as an ""android trying to learn human emotions"" always seems pretty apt when his games start going ""I SHALL NOW EVOKE IN YOU THE HUMAN EMOTION OF PITY"". 

It doesn't feel like he wants to tell an organic story, but instead he's mapped a bunch of emotions he wants people to feel, and then hammers the story around them, no matter how heavy handed he has to be."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I loved the world and world building. And I honestly enjoyed the game. But it felt pretty predictable story wise for really all of the characters. I think Conners choices were the only ones for me that were difficult. Where do you draw the line, is there loyalty, or how do you bridge the gap between humans and androids? But the other two, it seemed clear where the choices would take you, or at least that there would be some level of self preservation. I had been so inspired by the beginnings that I had hoped for something at least slightly more complex. Maybe Kara in multiple households, or assigned to Alice through multiple fosters upon her dads death, with Kara eventually somehow managing to pass as human for a long time as her mother when something happens in a foster home. Each of them eventually find the secret society of androids, but it's more like a support group than a haven. Maybe it has human sympathizers but one human ends up being a mole. Then they are spurred to action."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Played it a few weeks ago. Always had mixed feelings about Cage’s games, but Detroit was by far his best. You can see where this is going, and I am getting that genre now. Curious what they’ll do with the PS5, if any game can push Unreal 5 engines, it’s these ones."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"It's one of those games where everyone is hyped about it, then play it. And then it's forgotten after a few months."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Same, it was a good game they should make another"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Theres a pc version.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"So did I.. really a great game. A bit slow as heavy rain and beyond two souls obviously, but it’s climax is way better and the story overall is just great. Can’t wait till 2-3 years time when I will replay it."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Seconded, and just go with your choices regardless, all the way through your first play, like the game recommends!"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I play it with my 14 year old daughter. Best bonding experience. She’ll take a chapter and I’ll do the next. Our first run thought was

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Same. I love that it had such a beautiful new breath of fresh air breathed into it. The cartoon's a classic, I really like Patrick Warburton, but the combination of sheer whimsy meeting stark realities of people actively facing consequences for living in a world of *sheer whimsy* was sooo weeell dooone.

Best iteration yet. Damn shame - I love Peter TOO LONG STARTS WITH S THE GUY FROM GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY AND SPY  and Griff Newman"

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I can't help but think that the game stretched itself too thin. I think it's a top tier game, but, if it was focused on one of the sets of characters I think it would have hit home better. 

Basically, at the end of every chapter I was disappointed to switch to a different character set. I loved them all but I wanted more focus. I would also forget a little bit about what happened with the others.

Give me a full game about Conner, Kara, or Markus type character and it would be an instant buy for me. They did a great job with this game."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Cage's games have always been like watching someone try to build a house of cards. They get so far and they're amazing, and then they catastrophically fall apart. But even after that, you're so looking forward to what the next one's going to look like. Then they do the same thing, but they get that much farther and the cycle repeats.

There are two kinds of people in the world: People who will always appreciate David Cage's work, no matter what he does; and people who will never appreciate David Cage's work, no matter what he does."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Could you imagine being fucking motivated by internet points like this? Like what joy do you get our of reposting someone else's work without context?
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Nah, he actually stole and reposted those posts too. Give them a look and the top comment is someone calling out this douche for stealing someones content as well. 100% reposts...

I really wish Reddit would just permaban karma farming accounts. It's probably someone bot farming karma to sell the reddit account(s) to other people. 

Just imagine some propaganda people (Eg: China) buying high karma accounts to spread more bs propaganda.

That being said; Great cosplay! ProKirie the OP is beautiful!"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,all he does is repost other peoples stuff and i don't see where any credit is given to OP either.  Even the marijuana stuff.

Back before a phone called the OnePlus One came out, he was so certain it would fail that he was an incredible jerk to me when I said it would probably sell well. As part of that, he told me twice that he would buy me gold if it passed a particular sales metric. When it smashed through that standard, he shifted the goal posts and told me a third time he would give me gold. When it beat his new threshold, he started backpedaling and claimed he was only joking about the gold, even though he had previously been nothing but serious."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,[This trailer](https://youtu.be/jzw8rqI4dxU) explains it better than anyone could with words.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,[have a read at this. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit:_Become_Human)
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Here's the [prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-pF56-ZYkY) (YouTube link) from when they had the idea back in 2012.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,https://youtu.be/vF5TVjTC56E
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I find myself in the middle. I don’t love it but I respect the vision and I definitely can see the progress he’s making with each game. The fact the guy is a bit of an assole doesn’t help his case either in the industry.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Nah, I enjoyed the games just think there are better attempts at what he's trying to do (like Life is Strange 1)"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I actually quite liked heavy rain. But as you can tell from my recent comments despised detroit. I think there is a place for David's story telling, but when he fucks up? boy does it all fall apart."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I don't really know about being on one end of the spectrum or another.but I really, REALLY hated every game he made except for detroit. I couldn't even push myself to get that far into beyond two souls before I just threw the game away. Detroit has something special about that for some reasons that actually made me get out of the ""imma rip this game apart"" mindset after the first few chapters.

Yes the themes of the game are incredibly unsubtle and ham-fisted, but honestly, as someone who never cared about subtlety and grew up in an environment where everyone had enough trouble on their minds, I didn't even know about the details of the Civil rights movement until I started talking about the game with people after finishing it multiple times. The way I see it, if you can get behind the unsubtlty of the game and an oof in the writing every now and then, you'll have a decent time with it"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Your house of cards analogy is good, and explains my experience with his games well. They always have a solid premise and build up well, then they go to shit in the third act, every time."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Don't give him more attention, he lives for that"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Big number go up

But they also sell accounts with high karma"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Apparently they get the points nice and high, and then sell the account"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,They sell the accounts.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I looked up how much you can sell Reddit accounts can be sold for, and it explains why karma farmers can think it's worth it. My account is probably worth around 150€ and has very little karma, so imagine one with 200,000 karma and a couple of years of existence."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Is it sad I've been on reddit for a decent amount of time and am now just understanding karma. Guess I just don't care like most people.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Because at some point, those numbers make the account worth actual money when they sell it so one of the Chinese or Russian troll farms, assuming it's not already a troll farmer just trying to make the account look legit."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Dopamine rush from all of the notifications probably is the motive
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"As someone with a whole slew of friends who make cosplay stuff custom order to fit, this will not be the first time someone steals your work. I have 3 different friends whose designs are now on dollskill without credit and they're all in the process of jointly sueing them for damages because cosplay designs they didn't offer for sale but had photos of on the internet were cloned cheaply and at lower quality than the custom ones they made. It won't just be images if your work is good enough. My personal opinion is your work is at that mark, so well done there, I hope you the best"
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"They are trying to help you with a very important tip when posting original content online. Don’t need to be defensive.

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"It is so refreshing looking back at a reveal trailer years before the game came out and seeing that yup, it is EXACTLY like that in the game."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Honestly, I believe that this is due to a bit different approach of Quantic Dream vs. Life is Strange games. LiS is much more linear, there may be some choices but they don't have lasting impact. This leads to much stronger narrative, because you can work out the tiny details. I felt absolutely attached to Max and Chloe, as most of people, I bet. They tried to increase the impact of choices in LiS2, but that definitely impacted the quality of story-telling when compared with previous two installments. Combined with a story that is generally much less relatable, it didn't work in their favor.

Quantic Dream goes quite further in terms of choices. This has an impact on the narrative, but it's generally worth it. Interactions throughout Heavy Rain and Detroit can have long-lasting effects throughout the entire game. But this can be seen as more demanding on the player's side, you have to focus so much on the choices that you stop paying attention to the story. Beyond: Two Souls is a bit different from those two, it operated on very similar principle to LiS, but the lack of expansive influence of choices kinda exposed the narrative as mildly lacking (at least imho).

So no, I don't think LiS is anywhere in the ballpark of what Quantic Dream is trying to do. LiS falls absolutely flat where Detroit excels (choices). But Detroit is also mildly less successful where LiS succeeded (creating personal attachment to the characters), because that just wasn't the focus. Despite being in a similar genre, both companies have their authentic style. And that's how it should be."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I believe the user experience stood out a LOT compared to many other games.

The exquisite detail in mapping out (LITERALLY, with a flowchart!) every single choice that the player made or can make to create their running narrative, was what appealed to a lot of people. Whether each choice contributes to the linear narrative of each chapter (or feeding into subsequent ones), or is part of a cluster of related ones which result in a unique outcome (shown as a shaded box containing boxes, sometimes further-nested clusters, in the flowchart), you see them all in the flowchart, even if they seem trivial at first.

And after each chapter play-through and during subsequent ones of the same chapter - which are encouraged for reasons I'll address soon - the choices you've made are clearly marked, so you can deliberately try to avoid them in favor of others in the future to get the maximum value (again, literally; more on that shortly) out of the chapter. I think also (can't remember fully; need to continue play at some point, been on the backlog for a while) that you are given the meta-choice to make your decisions in a new play-through of a completed chapter ""canon"" or make them count in the story, or to discard them if you liked your first play-through's outcome better.

QuanticDream didn't HAVE to do this, but they did. And on top of that, they assigned each choice and step through the chapters a point value towards unlocking extras such as character profiles, artwork and promotional videos, giving quite high replay incentive.

I think Until Dawn did this too, but I've never played it. Other than that I'm not sure how many other games present choices in such detail."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Honestly I wouldn't compare this game to life is strange. The themes and metaphors of life is strange are practically citizen kane compared to the almost absurdly ham fisted nature of detroit become human. I can turn my roomba off with my phone, the idea of fucking robot concentration camps is so stupid it boggles the mind."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I really love this kind of games. I enjoyed Life is Strange, how it made me feel like the choices I make matter, even though they didn't change that much. You can save a plant, a bird's nest, the peak is saving Kate Marsh.

Detroit brings this to the next level. It wasn't anymore that I thought that the choices matter, they DID matter throughout the entirety of the game. The weight of the choices you have to make in a flash is absurd, at points I felt discouraged from picking up the game again because of the sheer burden of living with the choices I have to make. Would you steal if it means your child is safe? Would you kill to protect those close to you? Would you sacrifice someone close to you to survive? It's absolutely insane.

Detroit is absolutely next fucking level, can't wait for whatever they are working on now. And now I absolutely want to play it again."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Also ianal. But as another armchair lawyer...

Fashion is indeed not copyrightable. However character designs are. But cosplay is already a derivative of the character design which belongs to whatever they're cosplaying. So the original copyright belongs to the original character creator, not the cosplayer. The original also holds the [copyright of the character](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_protection_for_fictional_characters) which would include its designs. 

The cosplayer/photographer would have the copyright on the photo itself, but selling a knockoff of it is not selling the photo. So that's also doesn't apply.

Cosplayer really doesnt get much copyright protection because the design isn't theirs to begin with. 

So I would think their claim is super weak or virtually nonexistent. Regardless of what law says, reality of bothering them enough legally to take it down still exists."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Until Dawn did something very similar. Entire chunks of the story can disappear if you let the wrong person die, and some decisions that seem tiny at the beginning really inform upon your ending. Like for example: shooting a squirrel at the beginning determines whether certain wild animals are aggressive or passive toward you later on.

Basically, Until Dawn is a great game, and I really wish the developers had continued more along those lines if gameplay and storytelling; the ""sequel"" Man of Medan was okay but nowhere nearly as gripping for me."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,Until Dawn is a really good comparison. I wonder what other games are out there like that. Those are two of my favorites.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"It's great, but I also see value in not doing this. For example, Life is Strange doesn't show you the flowchart it has in the background, and on my second playthrough there were some decisions that I wanted to reverse to see what happens, only to find out that they weren't actually decisions and had I not went that way the game would have forced my hand.

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,I would highly suggest Heavy Rain if you haven’t played.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Oh my gosh yes... I think that as far as an adventure game like that goes, Life is Strange was one of the most emotional experiences for me in the end as well. I do feel I appreciated it more when I was left in the dark about the behind-the-scenes machinations of the story, as well.

Oddly, though I do like this storytelling style, I have not been able to get attached to Before the Storm in the same way (haven't even finished the first episode, just started the final ""scene"" of it, I think, and have left it on the backlog for months, and haven't started on 2, nor Captain Spirit."
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"I mean it's overall a bit plump and ""on the nose"" storytelling that much I admit, it's a nice story with some highs and lows but not quite the brutal hard hitter that is LiS. Though still quite good. But also looking at the insane soundtrack that LiS got, the mood it can set, personally no other storyteller quite reaches that.

What seperates the great from the amazing is that LiS is more ambiguous, it's not dark to be dark. With Detroit Become Human or Heavy Rain it sometimes feels like it's dark because it has to be dark. It's why the one part of these games are nice to play and great storyteller but some others take a legit toll on you. LiS or Last Of Us (which I honestly wouldn't even count as storyteller but still mostly lives off the story) might actually have you stop playing because it's emotionally difficult.

That's just a quality difference over ""segregation bad"" even if the theme is important.

And yeah that Daughter soundtrack makes the game twice as good anyway."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,**obviously**. How could you not make the connection? It's literally beaten into your face every second of every scene. Did you miss the allusions to the holocaust? Hey they only had an entire chapter set in a nonsensical robot concentration camp so it was probably pretty easy to miss compared to the rest of the game.
gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Because people praise it as some high art masterpiece when very clearly the idea was ""jewish robots in nazi america"" with zero thought as to how to make that happen besides ""we just do the thing they did to the people"". The sheer unbelievable lack of creativity and unwillingness to portray these tired tropes in ways that make sense to the actual subject matter has me baffled as to how people can talk about this game like it's an artistic masterpiece. They couldn't even be bothered to pick one oppressed people to allegory, they literally just chose ""all of them"".

There are tons of interesting angles to take with something like AI gaining sentience. Taking one that's simultaneously overdone, boring and ham fisted is just the perfect trifecta of garbage storytelling. Couple that with gameplay that's basically all the worst parts of your average 2005 adventure game and I am absolutely fucking boggled that a majority of this subreddit thinks it's some sort of must play experience."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Personally I find it significantly more egregious than that. There are ways you could play these tropes that don't attempt to just pull the same strings as movies like Selma and Remember the Titans. There are so many interesting ideas surrounding AI coming to life that just resorting to ""Holocaust but with robots"" is extremely frustrating, especially when they do it with so little subtly."

gplzc8,2020-05-24,2020-05-24,"Before the Storm was awesome IMO. The beginning is cringe ground zero, but it gets progressively better and by the end of the first episode it's great. And it still gets better in the later episodes, I just couldn't stop smiling for most of it. Except for when it tried to hurt... it does pose some interesting questions, but it's not as traumatizing as the original. (Not sure if I should be thankful for that.) Also, I friggin loved the backtalk challenges.

The second game though... I don't think it should have been called Life is Strange 2. It doesn't feel anything like the first game, and while it's in the same universe, it's a completely different storyline (like Iron Man 2 and Thor instead of Iron Man and Iron Man 2). I also had massive issues with its own story, the main characters, Sean and Daniel just don't have the same charm as Max and Chloe, and the story is very episodic, meaning it resets the entire cast of supporting characters every. damn. episode. The rest of the game is executed masterfully, but it just has some issues that render it as a pale imitation of Life is Strange.

Captain Spirit is nice though, but it's more like an optional Life is Strange 2 Episode 1.5. Chris is one of the better characters in LIS 2 but like all side characters in that game he just doesn't get enough time to shine."

I don't really agree that the idea of a concentration camp is ridiculous though. If we look at history and even what's happening today.. concentration camps/internment camps aren't a trope of storytelling they are a trope of reality. So it doesn't make sense to knock its creativity for just extrapolating what happens to every marginalized and unwanted group.

I'm also sure that a lot of younger gamers aren't going to have been overexposed to that kind of story so it will probably work better for them.

*My* biggest complaint is that they undercut Kara's storyline with their little unnecessary twist at the end. It was supposed to prove to the audience that they could care for androids by pulling a fast one on them but it actually just disproved the in-game premise that androids and humans could care for each other. With no human-android relationships left it actually reinforces the critique that the androids are just mimicking emotions."

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"So many spoilers in this thread but I’m super happy to see a bunch of positivity toward Detroit. I’ve been a Quantic Dream fan since Omicron on the Dreamcast but so many people can’t get past the heavy handedness and clunky bits. Detroit is their best overall work IMO and it’s heartening that more people are seeing what makes a QD game special.

Honestly, I kind of dislike the way the game shows all the branching paths at the end of each chapter but I really think it has helped people wrap their heads around how much story variation there can be. Previously, the only way to understand that someone’s playtgrough might be completely different from yours was to actually talk to someone else who had played the game."

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Makes me sad there was no advanced machine ending where you do just stay in the car. Similar to what happens to Kara if you don't help Alice in the scene with her vs. Todd.

Looking forward to seeing you in your next big thing"
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Really hope you’ll be in a Detroit sequel or some Connor spinoff in the future. You played the most badass character in the game. You and everyone else did such an outstanding job. 
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-29,"Hi Bryan!

Thank you so much for involving all of us in your streams. I can see that you truly enjoy it - even Overwatch! I've always been too shy to play, but I'm inspired by you - you were able to get so good in such a small amount of time!

Also, thank you for putting so much of your heart and soul into Connor. He means so much to me. I experience disassociation disorder and often have to view my life as a mission, inserting myself into work/school/relationships. He gives me hope that someday I'll be able to break down the walls surrounding me so that I can be in the world as myself. 

Congratulations on your upcoming wedding (send all my love to Amelia too - I adore her Traci and my wife does too), and I hope you had a fabulous time at your bachelor's party! All the best wishes to you both!

Take care!

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"The guy in front of the screen is Bryan Dechart, actor for Connor in Detroit: Become Human. He's recently been streaming this game on Twitch, thus the picture; someone just put a bunch of Connors on the screen, because he's widely considered to be the best part of the game. Hope that helps!

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,The latter.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,It's the actor - Bryan Dechart.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Almost!
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"It's like a TellTale game but unlike TellTale games, your decisions actualy impact the story. A lot, in fact."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,You can try out one of this games predecessors for free on ps plus in July.  Heavy rain is the game.  That will let you know if David Cage’s style is for you.  Although Detroit is definitely the better story heavy rain is still good.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"If you're unsure about that style of gameplay and you have PS+, heavy rain is one of the free games next month, and that's *preeeetttty dang similar*."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,it is a very good story but not much action at all. Mostly a choose-your-own-adventure movie. 
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"All action is done by quick time events only. The game basically has two modes, either quick time events or walk and explore, where the exploring can change what dialogue and quick time choices are available to you. So yeah it is mostly an interactive movie. There was a free demo of the first chapter of this game a while back but I'm not sure if it's still available."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"literally all the action is QTE, just like every david cage game, no sarcasm."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Sumo is awesome haha
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Story (obviously) is really good, kind of topical, really fun in regards to the choose your own adventure style. It literally has flowcharts to show your progression, what you missed, and what % of players did what. Gameplay itself is quite minimal, just QTEs and moving around choosing dialogue trees. One of the best stories for games this year IMO. "
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,But the Dafoe goblin isn't even canon anymore- ah forget it.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I haven’t seen any of those ads, but the voice acting in the game itself is stellar."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"His name is Bryan Dechart - he actually did a play through of the game on Twitch and dressed up as Connor at E3, so I’d say he’s pretty proud!"
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,How so?
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Almost every realistic human in video games is based on a real person, especially when you think that these people are essentially now playing themselves with all of the advents in mocap and facial capture tech."

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"So you just claim the city is for black people only? No such thing as a ""black city"". As far as I know, black people don't own it exclusively."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I live in the metro Detroit area and have been blown away every time I go down for a tigers game. The city is so beautiful and I’m really happy they’ve been working to make it better. However, Detroit is a city for everyone alike, and we won’t get rid of racism by saying it’s a black city."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,found the racist.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Detroit is not what’s supposed to become human - it’s the androids. In the game, this guy is an android, so technically not a white guy at all, though there are also black androids. The game actually has more black characters than most other games I can think of, and is faithful to Detroit in its representation of the city, futurized as it is.

The game itself is awesome if you enjoy choice-based games like Telltale’s, which it far exceeds in my opinion."

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Detroit:Become Human is the game being referenced. This is apparently the guy whose appearance Connor (the character on screen) was meant to mimic.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Yeah, so full of himself. Being in a picture? Weirdo"
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Ah, yes, how could one forget that Bryan Dechart is from the famed British isle of Utah."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Don't know what you're talking about rip Conners 1-4 and you can loose quite a bit of story characters by messing up.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"As bad as the story can be, this game is by far the best in actual branching paths and consequences in the story lmao. Obviously the game cuts some corners and is not gonna murder the main character on every missed QTE."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,why are you still watching it then?
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Er... The choices you make have massive knock on consequences throughout the entire game... One little thing completely changes your story...
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Seriously what’s the deal with this dude? His face makes me question my whole life :/ 
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Hank go up

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Yeah, got a selfie with him. 

Funny thing was that I actually saw him the day before when he wasnt in costume and could’ve sworn this random dude I was next to looked and sounded like him. But I thought “Nah, no way I just randomly happened across the guy who played Connor.” Next day, turns out he was."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,I have a video on my phone of him walking right past me towards the PlayStation wing on his stream. I was like why the hell are all these people- oh hey it’s that guy lol
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,got the vid of it?
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,I think Brian Cranston was Walter White a while back.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-29,apparently once johnny depp went to comic con or something in a cheap dimestore jack sparrow costume.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Have you even tried staying in the car for hours?
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,I immediately fucked that up because i went to take a piss and didn't realize a cutscene started.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"The overlying ""investigate deviant cases"" is considered that for Connor, so being told by Hank to wait isn't followed."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,What happens? I knew there was Todd dying and you escaping with Todd alive. 
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I chose to wait with Kara and the basterd did... I cant even. She was completly locked off after. Whole host of timelines I never explored. I fucked up big time in this game, but I loved it. "
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Oh man, that scene... I initially did not help out, thinking ""Well she was told to stay, so she's a robot, so she'd stay.""  
  
Then I like nudged my control stick forward a bit after things ramped up a bit in that scene, and suddenly YOU HAVE BECOME DEVIANT and there was no going back. Oh, okay then."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Definitely a flaw in the game. Should at least get a trophy for your efforts.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Far Cry 4 spoiled us all. But I guess expecting something more from David Cage was the real mistake.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"""Don't stick anymore evidence in your mouth""

Sticks more evidence in his mouth."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Legit question, isnt that just a stylistic choice? Is there any reason why that would actually be ""fixed""? I'm an ESL speaker but I've had contact with English all my life, and can't see an issue there. "
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Sumo too

It's not as consistently David Cage as his other games, but when it is, it's just as David Cage as the rest"

Sure, he's cute and has a killer voice, but he's just so appreciative of the fans as well  and in genuine awe of how well-received Connor has been. It was really heartwarming seeing him get a little emotional at the end of his Twitch playthrough because he was overwhelmed by how many people came together to watch him play this game he'd spent years working on."

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I've waited about 5 minutes, but that was too much.  Maybe one of these days I'll leave it on, but the game prompts you to get out, so I don't think it'll keep moving unless you follow."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"> Have you even tried staying in the car for hours?

I left him there, went downstairs to get a drink, read a book to my kids and came back and he was still in the car. If you hold R2 you get detective mode view where you can see Hank just staring into space contemplating what life choices led him to wandering around with an android before it hits him like a lightning bolt. He needs Connor. Connor is his redemption and without him he's nothing. So while he stares at the empty hole in his life which is the murder house he sends out a subliminal subconscious message to Connor asking him to get out the car.

You see, really he wanted him to get out the car all along but was just seeing whether Connor would follow orders or whether he could be relied upon to make the best choice given the situation.

That's really what Detroit: Become Human is all about isn't it? Choices and the merging of human and android lives. Connor and Hank are the perfect personification of that and leaving Connor in the car ends in an eternal loop of sorrow and regret that you just can't break without stepping out the car.

So to answer your question no, I waited around 15 minutes."

-After the previous game, the man is shit because he butchers his own premises.

-New Game is announced, people get excited at the premise and the idea and the setting, but it's still Cage so skepticism floats in the air.

-Gameplay demo, trailers, release nears. This game will be the BEST GAME EVER and actually Cage isn't that bad you guys. We're excited about the game ""because"" it's his, too.

-Game comes out. For six hours, the game is legit ""one of the best storytelling experiences ever released blah blah blah"", while everyone is going through the basic worldbuilding and the plot hasn't picked up yet.

-People finish the game. A day after, folk everywhere sit on their toilets thinking ""well that was kinda fucking underwhelming, wasn't it? is it just me? am i some kind of philistine?"". Then folk go on the internet as verify that indeed, That Was Kinda Fucking Underwhelming.

-A month after release, Cage is shit because he butchers his own premises.

Rinse, repeat."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I think the other 'style' would be ""Immediately gets out of the car"". I believe his needs commas: ""Gets, immediately, out of the car."" The core sentence is ""gets out of the car"". I believe interrupting with an adverb like that needs a comma.

For example: ""Angrily glares at his friend"", ""Glares at his friend angrily"", or ""Glares, angrily, at his friend"".

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I’d wanna see Connor have to pass the police academy and exams first to be fair, and just absolutely smash them."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I'm assuming that if they do make a sequel to it, Hank and Connor's ending where they're almost father and son would probably be canon.

It's the best part of the game by far, most people agree with that.

I'd assume it'd be based off of the end of game surveys and what was the most common outcome of each character's stories.

But then again, I'd be wrong considering 53% of people chose to save Arcadia Bay in LiS, but the sequel has fucking Chloe still alive. That ones on the fucking devs though, they wanted people to pick Chloe but she's so overwhelmingly dull and acts like what a 50 year believes 15 year olds do that you just end up disliking her at the end of the game."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Sounds dope but I'd suck at is seeing as Hank killed himself in my play through 
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,My first play through they hated each other. Conner got shot alot. Hank got shot once. 
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I think the other characters could have been just as compelling, but Markus was just expressionless/emotionless and the “twist” in Alice and Kara’s storyline was a poor choice. Overall awesome game in my opinion, but Hank and Connor are the definite stars and Kara and Markus have some wasted potential. I still very much enjoyed their story lines, but they could have been just as awesome as Hank and Connor’s."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Those two were awesome because they threw away the hacky script. 
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"because David Cage is a hack and didn't want them to be as good of characters as they turned out to be. Seriously, Connors actor and Clancy brown were improvising a lot and David Cage hated it. "
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,i liked markus and north. but i've heard some people had...less positive experiences with north. 
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Kara was my favourite character for 90% of the game right up until *that moment* and then I was just completely disinterested. It gave me a lot of thoughts on dysfunctional families, and what it means to be a parent and setting an example and then the moment comes and I just don't care. 

But yeah Marcus just felt kind of obligatory I suppose. Like it's a story about oppressed robots so of course there's a robot uprising and like the hackiest examples o these kinds of stories we manage to go from thinking they're not human to granting them full rights in less than a year. I feel like if he'd set up the robot underground railroad or he was an android that had somehow managed to live as a human for years before starting the revolution or something that would have been more interesting."

And when I first saw gifs of Connor winking, my heart legit skipped a beat.   

I guess that's what they were taking about when they said that people would rather have an android partner than a real human partner in the game. haha "

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Him and Hank - Hank is an important part of the equation.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"TBF I think it's because these Blade Runner type stories have been told the same way long enough for us to guess the outcomes of some archetypes.

You have the Markus Revolutionary whose desperate to free his people.

You have the hard line cop/detective who is likely drunk or hungover .- Hank.

You have the other robot whose character lies heavily on Empathy. -The female Android and the girl Android

This time the audience got to see more of the Synthetic whose having the existential crisis between duty and possible morality.

Not only that, but *Detroit become human* is a choose your own adventure game; meaning that the path that the character takes depends on your choices, and the audience doesn't already know what happens later on in the story because of what clues/hints/cues/messages/ conversations that happend earlier on. "
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,I actually prefer Kara and her storyline over Connor's but I actually love all three sections of the game. Bryan Dechart is just wonderful though. I loved his stream.

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,So you're telling me a part of why Connor's story is better is because Bryan and Clancy did unscripted stuff? LOOOOL imagine what Connor's story would be like if they had taken away the improv stuff...
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,I'm so glad you're not getting down voted for loving this game. I agree. I liked it even more than God of War and I adored that game. But something keeps me coming back to Detroit.

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"well i watched a playthrough aswell because it's not my kind of game, but I found the story really cool. With the different endings and choices that really impact the outcome of the development, not like other games that give you just an illusion of choice.

And I really like the ""philosofical"" problem of what is a person, so it's just really interesting to me. But hey, if you don't find it a nice story, I don't see why you should keep watching"
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"And killing off everyone gets the worst possible ending xD I've seen that ending and it is terrible in the sense of you feel like a complete shithead for getting everyone killed. Saving everyone is a huge accomplishment and not easy to pull off. I don't think I've seen anyone get the perfect ending yet... Actually... No, I think Ohmwrecker did it? I loved watching his playthrough. Didn't fuck around for views and laughs, he chose what his own morals matched and I can respect players who do that. Fucking up on purpose isn't funny or entertaining. The only person I know who does that is Swingpoynt and he's only doing it to show all possible outcomes of each chapter.

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,F. Realizing what he tried to commit suicide was really depressing

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I really liked Kara and Alice and Luther. The ""twist"" actually did make me think for a second, although the choice afterwards felt fairly obvious. I wonder what would have happened if I [chose not to accept Alice after finding out she was an android](/spoiler). 

Markus' evolution was interesting to me, but he was definitely the weakest character. It did have a nice payoff if you chose to play the piano for Carl at the beginning, because he later plays the same song before the big decision. "
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I hated the Alice twist, it made no sense and actually made the story worse for it. Kara protecting and loving a human was interesting. "
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I don't think you can place the blame solely on Markus. I think the success of Connor and Hank was despite the material and direction they received.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVERl0OYjc&t=0s) really goes into a ton of the flaws with the writing and direction."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,I agree. After seeing the first initial trailer for Kara (the prototype where the developer finds out she has emotion) I thought that would be such a cool concept. Instead they went with some matronly role and basically threw her into the “generic female storyline” role. =\
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Is there somewhere the actors talk about improvising and Cage not liking it? I’m curious now.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I guess spoilers but I think I'm far enough in a chain it would be safe???

[I did that at first thinking Hank would want a super Anti-Deviant cleaning up androids, but realized he fucking hated me for it so by the time we reached the creator's house I completely changed Connor's motives, broke free, and eventually in my last possible sequence became ""Neutral"" with Hank where he said he'd miss me.

Spoilers below:

-

When you watch playthroughs where the two have a good relationship and Connor gets killed, Hank calling him son makes it a thousand times more heartbreaking, and even in the playthrough where they are friends but Connor doesn't die the same way, you know it was in Hank's head anyway and that he thinks it. Having a grumpy suicidal hard boiled android hating cop suddenly feel protective of a naive and dorky android is what makes it the most heart warming. Connor alone can be pleasant, but his link to Hank when positive is sweet beyond belief (without even feeling forced since you need to work hard for it)."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"[well, the main thing that stood out to me watching some people play the game was that unless you actively go out of your way to piss her off, you're probably going to end up with North accidentally. All of the sensible options (not massacring humans at every opportunity, basically) piss her off, but as long as you make the occasional rational decision that doesn't make her mad, you'll end up lovers, even though the things that make her happy to make her mad are outnumbered 10:1. ](/spoiler) it's not really a forced love interest, I suppose, but just really clunky and it doesn't make a ton of sense."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Not the person you're replying to but for me it's his backstory. He had a pretty good life and saw the best of the human (Carl). Sure he was framed and had to crawl out of the ditch, but it was the son who's the jerk and all of a sudden he was like ""Fuck human!"" instead of ""Fuck Leo!"". Story-wise, his personal motivation behind becoming the leader of the revolution is a bit weak IMO. "
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,The best/worst part about it having so much replayability is that it shows you a flowchart of where your different choices have led you and once you get past the first couple of chapter it's basically a screen with 60 different options and you only got to see ~15 of them. Even within each specific tree there are so many different ways you can react/behave.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,It sounds like you have a crush on this creepy guy. Sure are defending him hard. Maybe ask for his number or for tickets to a meet and greet?

i kinda knew there had to be something."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"it just forgives entirely too much for the way the story diverges, a game like this should be chock full of decisions where there is no right choice and even the most minor mistakes can cost you dearly, but it's just not interested in that.

i feel like this game really isn't designed for players who will play it a second time, despite the divergence."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"what i mean about connor is the lying, i've yet to ever once see the person playing play him in character, for the others i agree some ambiguity is ok, but for connor becoming a deviant should literally be either suicide or subverting markus as the leader if the person constantly and clearly tries to make connor choose deviant options."

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I think that's only if you're on good terms with Hank.

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Connor throwing Hank off the roof after mocking his son's death is the coldest scene in the whole game. 
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I think I might fault the actor/character model for that. Markus is just too serious and broody - maybe it’s more suited to a violent revolution, but I haven’t played that way yet. Connor feels way more alive, and I think Dechart is a big part of that."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"i dunno, i felt that markus was really stressed with the peaceful revolution decision. like all these people are looking to me...and it seems like this isn't working. "
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-29,"I think it is a testament that even Kara, an android, was disheartened to find out that Alice was an android. They were making a statement that if this twist made you think less of Alice then it truly reveals how you value androids. For you, it seems you would keep them defined as non-sentient machines, which is a fine opinion as this is a piece of fiction after all."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"The weird thing is that in her biography (in the Extras menu), its implied she *is* the Kara from the tech demo, and that Alice didn't name her - Kara whispered the name to Alice. So why create this amazing backstory about an android becoming sentient *while it's being born* and not do something with that? "

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"[Hmm, yeah. In my first playthrough, I played the (probably) mainstream storyline with being peaceful and all but in my second playthrough I massacred my way through the game and we ended up being companions but no love story here.](/spoiler)

But as I said, I agree with most of the things you said. It wasn't an innovative story but the way you could play it and the massive amount of different story paths made it enjoyable for me. I don't expect a game to always have a super innovative story if gameplay, immersion and other things hit the right tune with me."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"He is indeed attractive, but I don't think I'd ever bother going to a meet and great "
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,No it doesn't. People like different things.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Bro, it doesn't take a brainwashed person to see that the game stands out from a branching narrative standpoint (compared to previous QD and Telltale games). I hate Telltale and all David Cage games and even I can give them props on that."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"if it wasn't as forgiving it wouldn't be as fun and as interesting I suppose.

the replayability is in the choices you make I guess, and experiencing the ramifications. I don't think you have to play multiple times to see the multiple outcomes, you can go to the specific decision points, and decide something else. But I'm not sure"
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Or... The game doesn't tell you how to play and they're playing how they want to and what they would do if they were Connor? You clearly don't understand what deviancy is in Detroit: Become Human despite it being very obvious within the first couple of chapters of both Markus and Kara...
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Yeah, if you wait long enough, Hank should come across the deviant in the attic and get injured by him. That then contributes to a negative Hank and Connor relationship, but a positive machine Connor stat."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"You'd think that, but it's a David Cage game. [They can be kinda self-steering.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9JxTlKm2KU)."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,At least Kingdom Hearts lets you do both.

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"So, he is Bruce banner, but drunk version"
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,I didn't find out about the Mr. Krabs thing until after that scene and I couldn't for the life of me make him sound like Krabs. I heard it now that I rewatched that scene. Still blows my mind.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Did not know he did that voice along with soo many others.

I have a serious respect for voice actors."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,There's so many fucking memes of it as well. [This one made me laugh way too much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoXW6DcGsN8)
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Honestly, the massive slap is hilarious and the fact that Hank barely reacts to it is even better. Not even an 'Ouch', he just wakes up"
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-29,"That's half the game, though.  It's a movie with buttons to press.  Gaming 2018."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I haven’t played this one, but I played Heavy Rain which is similar, and I felt like the input was actually fantastic for immersion. They basically make you act out the scene, and when done right it gets you much more invested. It feels weird and slow to watch, but I think it plays a lot better than just a cutscene. "
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Connor, attack!

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,My first playthrough was pacifist Markus/deviant Connor. It was such a nice wrapped up story. I guess I would call it a 'good ending'? Not excited at all to finish my Violent Markus/Machine Connor. At least Kara's can always be better than my ending I got. 
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"I liked the personality of Markus better during the violent revolution, but I didn't really understand how to win the violent revolution QTE-wise and my Markus got shot in the face by Connor, so I triggered the bomb. "
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,I agree with you.  I honestly think Connor is so likeable because Bryan's kindness and personality somehow came through in the motion capture. 
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Wait he streams? Link?

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"now you are what is broken here, it doesn't matter what you want, pandering endlessly tells a worthwhile story to precisely no one, you have to be willing to tell people things they don't want to hear to tell a good story."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"i wish i could agree, i really do, but let's be honest, david cage is chasing that completion percentage and fudging people who should be getting game over screens to be allowed to continue."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,deviancy is literally defined as having emotions and going against programming.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"In the scene, you actually see Connor evaluate priorities, and his programming says the investigation is more important than obeying Hank. So to stay in the car would actually be the deviant option."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Sorry I'm curious but why is this listed as hidden? I guess its a patron kind of thing but the guy has 116k subs...
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,I mean this game was a lot better about it than other games

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,...also works for those quicktime decisions where you need to furiously google consequences before making your decision
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"mr. krabs’ persona has always alluded to sex

“are ya feeling it mr. krabs? are ya feelin it?”

“oh i can feel it”"
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Sure.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"My favorite of his roles is the antagonist in the second Jak and Daxter game, Baron Praxis. I can't not hear him as Mr. Krabs, and it makes all his scenes hilarious. "
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,He's still my favorite Lex Luthor! 
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Yeah, I've noticed a lot of people pick Deviant Connor over Machine Connor when given the option. Kara's ending massively changes based on whether you take the tickets or not"
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"You were in the concentration camp, werent you?

I learned you can get them hit by cars in the first mission after escape. Then it’s just over."

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Buddy just go play it on whatever difficulty you want. You're bitching about something that in no way shape or form even comes close to effecting you if you don't want it to. 
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,> EVERYBODY HAS TO LIKE THINGS EXACTLY THE WAY I LIKE THEM OR THEY’RE WRONG BAD PEOPLE AND I HATE THEM NYAH
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"So you're saying that people shouldn't be allowed to choose? Hmm seems like someone just wants their life to live out like a movie on rails.

Fortunately you too have a choice! You can watch someone else play it! Or not watch it at all. I mean that's up to you, unless you just HAVE to see this ONE person's playthrough because, as you've implied, you hate choice."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Lol, ok then."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Ow no, he wants people to complete his game, what an evil, evil man."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Yes, it is. You clearly missed the point of Connor though and the point of this game. You play as the characters and you make the decision of what you would do in their shoes. If people are playing to become deviant as Connor, why is that bad? It's their playthrough. They can do what they want. Deviancy isn't even suicide either. Look at Markus and Kara. Both escape and survive becoming a deviant if you play it right... Same could happen for Connor. Deviant does not mean death."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Fair point. I've only watched Let's Plays and reviews cos I have no games console atm. Must have missed that detail.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"No clue why it's unlisted. Never even noticed, actually. Maybe it's to avoid coypright strikes from Sony."

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Convenient how Hank accompanies Connor to a crime scene in an android sex club after that scene where he's wasted too
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Its rather itchy
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,I did not take the tickets. It did not end well at all. 
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Yea, I was in the very low &#37; of people that picked Machine Connor in the end.  Kinda sucked as an ending, especially after I got Kara through and it was all lovely dovey lol.  
"
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-07-03,Makes sense since the stakes are higher for the deviants so people want to help them.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"No, we tried to get across the river in the boat and got gunned down.

Turns out...it can get worse. I didn't know about the concentration camp one. "
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,I'm considering doing this on my next playthrough just because Kara's sections kind of bore me in comparison to Connor and Markus.

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"i will never ""play"" a glorified movie of a game, sorry david cage."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"no one said that, just this game needs to give weight to the choices or not bother presenting them in the first place.

if you had a choice between two brands of bubblegum, say big league chew and joe bazooka, they both taste exactly the same, they both are pretty good gum, they both blow pretty good bubbles and they both turn into the same flavorless (okay fine, the flavor after they've lost the added flavor is.... i can only describe it as ""grey"", i know, but yeah) mass after a while that has that weirdly processed taste to it.

so what does it matter which you pick?

it doesn't, but at least in that case it's not as if the entire situation has been created as a contrivance meant to give you meaningful choices."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"no of course not, i never once said that and you have it totally backwards.

choosing should actually have an effect, lying as connor should actually make it much more likely amanda will permanently deactivate you for every single time you do it.

i mean his entire reason to have been constructed (or whatever) is to investigate the case of why androids turn into deviants with hank, so why does the game reward him for being the most subversive and (amazingly) unsuspected deviant in the game?"
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"agreed, artificially making games easier is the main reason i almost never actually buy them anymore, they simply aren't worth money these days."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,because it's literally the polar opposite of the entire reason connor even exists in the first place? duh.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Yeah no worries, but damn that was actually really interesting to watch. They masquerade the game pretty good."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Take the tickets, the woman is one of the people who beat up Markus in the beginning."
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Oh dear... I'm guessing you either got only Alice survived or everyone died?

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,Markus’ story is the worst one for me.
8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"If you don't enjoy Kara's story, you can get her killed in the scene where she (normally) escapes from Todd, and then she won't show up ever again. Just don't take the gun and then fail all your QTE's. "

8ui6kh,2018-06-28,2018-06-28,"Oh my god, you must suck at playing RPGs then. Detroit: Become Human, like other Quantic Dream titles, has RPG elements to it. You take on the role of the characters, you choose their story, you become them. The entire fucking point of the game is are androids equal to humans or are they a mistake? Connor becoming a deviant is him becoming human. Fuck me, how hard is it to figure this out?"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,She rly did become human.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Great cosplay. I liked all the characters in the game but I think Connor is my favorite... playing through his existential crisis was pretty amazing.

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"I also got a bad ending. Was not a happy ending for most, but was very emotionally heavy-hitting. Huge props to the writers of this game who made even the sad endings satisfying."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Man, Im not even sure if one picture is just a better render like from a cinematic and the other is from gameplay."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Cosplay is great :)

Hank of course. And Hank+Connor line.  
And Todd. He is certainly more of a negative hero, but he is filled with undeservedly undisclosed drama."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Wow you did awesome!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Valorie Curry did an amazing job with the voice acting. People love Connor in Detroit Become Human, he was basicly the star of the game right with Hank. Kara story line is my favourite, mainly because of how vulnerable she is, emotionaly and physically. In two other scenarios you have androids that can dismantle their oponents in seconds. Kara cant do that and thats why i like her missions. I think one of the best moments in the game are with her on the screen, like Connor chasing Kara and Alice on the highway. The composer, Philip Sheppard did insane work for Kara main theme. It tells everthing about her: desperation, emotion, desire to be more. To be human.

Amazing cosplay. Best wishes from Poland."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Sumo. Good sumo.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Great work! The outfit looks awesome and very accurate.

In my first playthrough Kara died at the border too but I did another one where I managed to save her.  
Such a great game. I really didn't like Heavy Rain und Beyond Two Souls, but Detroit really struck a nerve with me."

look there are wrinkles in the dress because she is not standing perfectly straight and the dress doesn't have the shine of molten plastic wrapped around her body! If this is the effort you put in then next time just draw on a paper bag and put that on! 

(This is a sarcastic shit post you did a great job)"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Is the glow armband a photoshop or does it actually glow?
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Spoilers:

What gets me is, to my knowledge, the only way to get all three characters on her story-line to make it safely is by fucking over the people with the ticket and basically stealing it. I guess it shows better storytelling but it was still a little disheartening to not be able to ""win"" by being nice and honest."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Great Cosplay!

I think Conner is my favorite; the evolution of his relationship with Hank really spoke to me. Don't get me wrong, I like Kara and Marcus, but both of them went rogue early on, so I felt like their story was just expressing what I already knew. In contrast, Conner's rebellion takes much longer to reach (if at all!), so I found that more compelling."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,How did you do the little head button light?  I ask cause it's a really low profile widget to fit an led and battery into.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,My favorite character was Markus and Connor👌

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,You look freaking awesome!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Oooooh. Kara. Carer. I get it now.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Before reading the title I really thought it's a new texture in the game
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Kara is probably my favorite of the bunch as well. 
She's really great overall.

I did one playthrough and it was just heavyhanded brutal fascist overlord Markus with Connor playing dutiful bodyguard to the Vanguard. Kara made it to the gate and could've had her pass if I didn't make Markus a total lunatic, plus I had other options but ultimately she decided she's fine with sacrificing herself for her would be husband and child. The androids it seems would have their own nation and sovereign and internationally recognized rights at the end and so didn't regret any outcomes. Good game I guess."

Great work!"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I don't know if this is clever advertising or you really just look like the character so I'll let you take that as a compliment if it's real.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Ridiculously good. Couldn't tell which was real for a good 10 seconds
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"You nailed this one, you transformed yourself into Kara come to life.  Kara was my favourite storyline too, I played the game through about seven times until I got the ending where everybody lives.  One time, Kara got caught trying to save Luther right before the bus station...that ending went badly and really hit me hard."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-21,"Very well done, you look exactly like Kara now all you need is an Alice. I myself prefer Connor’s machine storyline, but I definitely find Kara’s story most compelling"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-21,I have a huge crush on Valorie Curry
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-21,Wow that is spot on fantastic job
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"You actually look, in some ways, better than the in game model."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Very nice job!  I'm currently playing the game.  I feel like I'm probably about half way through and really enjoying it, especially Kara's story."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Cool, but which one's the cosplay?"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I like Connor
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"You look like the character but, with way more pixels. Lol."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Replay the chapter where she died. You'll have to finish the game, but the ending is worth it.

My Kara also died >!at the tanker. if you play dead you'll survive. don't get up.!<"

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Very nice! Kara’s story was my second favorite, I have to give the top spot to Connor, mostly because of Clancy Brown’s amazing performance as Detective Anderson."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,ps4 vs ps3 graphics
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Amazing
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Damn, that is spot on! I had to do a double take to recognize the human!"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I got a kind of interesting ending for Kara. I chose to not become deviant and let Todd beat Alice to death. Game over for Kara and you only switch between Markus and Connor for the rest of the game.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Level of detail is wild. Even the god damn stitching is pretty much the same.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Incredible cosplay
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,She putting 2 pictures of Kara like we wouldn't notice
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Kara is my absolute favorite, you did a great job!"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"First cosplay I've seen where the original looks like a worse version of the cosplay. Great job, really."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Which is which wtf
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,For those who are wondering the right one is the cosplay.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,My favorite is Hank ! Because he is perfect neo noir detective ! Plus he's funny !
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"damn, that's a good fucking cosplay dude!"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"I can’t believe your real fabric has wrinkles and stuff, unlike the original! /s

Seriously, nice cosplay. :D"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Genuinely couldn’t tell at first which was real! Really good job!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Hank & Connor & whatever Karl’s android was named
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I felt Conner was the best
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,CONNOR!!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,You look more like her than she does lol
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I’ve never played the game - so I hope you take it as a compliment when I say that on first glance I couldn’t figure out which one was the in game picture and which was real.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Stellar job!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"My favorite character is Markus. He was pretty much a son to Carl, and is imo the main character- his choices impact the story the most. I’ve only seen the Peaceful Protest/Everyone lives/Deviant Connor ending, and man was it deep. It’s really terrible how the police are pretty much Nazis- with execution camps, attacking unarmed protesters, etc. DBH is one of my favorite games. The replay ability of it is huge."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Spot on! Great job!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I didn't even realize the pic on the left wasn't rendered until i read the post
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"First I went ""Which one's the human? Oh.... Oh... I see now. Yea, I knew that the whole time"""
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,At first I thought this was a PC graphics mod or something. Nice work!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,This looks really good. Respect
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I didnt know it was a cosplay I thought they upgraded the graphics wow it looks that good
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Holy crap. Your cosplay is so good it took me a good few seconds to figure out which one was you.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Damn I thought the right was the cosplay for a second and the left was the screen shot good cosplay
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I swear I had to look twice to see which was the cosplay.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"SHEOOT That’s actually perfect and spot on, nicely done 👍"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,That’s one of the best cosplays I’ve seen. Great work!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I literally said omg wow out loud when I say this good job!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Spoilers...Not a gamer but watched my 17 year old play the whole game. He likes Luther (went back and fixed ending because so sad) and I love Hank. Need a Connor and Hank buddy cop movie!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Kara is cosplaying you
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,How these cosplayers make their cosplays is something that I feel that I can never understand it genuinely bewilders me and amazes me every single time
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"That's amazing. Not only the outfit, but the makeup. 💕

I really enjoyed the investigation parts with Connor and Hank. (Even with the annoying Eden Club part 😆)"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Damn, it took a moment for me to realise that the left one is a cosplay. Graphics can get creepy realistic."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,That's amazing
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Kara is my favorite character and I say you nailed her perfectly hair outfit and all
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Well it’s got be Conor
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I never played the game. But oh boy that is some awesome cosplay! Great work
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Wow. Insanely well done. I've never played the game so at first glance I actually couldn't tell which was which haha
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Never played this game and don't know the character, but I looked at the left pic first and assumed it was the original cgi for a sec.  gj"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I love this! Kara definitely had my favorite story.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"That's scarily accurate, are you sure you're not an android?"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Awesome! One of my top five favorite games and you pulled the character off incredibly well!!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,you look amazing
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Connor, obvs! I did really like Kara's until that twist at the end, then it felt kinda toothless. Liked it overall, wish it had ended differently.

Cosplay is great though!"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Wonderfully done
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"I actually just played through this game for the first time a couple of months ago, coincidentally enough! Connor was definitely my favorite from the start, and for the most part, I actually got a decent ending despite making a few bad choices here and there (I ended up with both Connor and Markus dead, both due to choices I literally made at the very end of their routes, but the overall ending was still good, as they still achieved their goals in the process).

I just want to take a minute to rant (and obvious spoilers ahead, though this thread already seems to be full of 'em) about how I find it really dumb that, because I chose the sacrifice option for Markus at the end instead of singing, everyone there died. Like, how would that choice somehow make the police shoot when they otherwise wouldn't? You'd think a ""sacrifice"" option would mean that he's sacrificing himself to save everyone, but noooo, the opposite happens!"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Amazing! I love the game, literally playing it for the first time right now. You nailed it."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,This is so awesome! I love it!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"As I was scrolling down, I thought this was a side-by-side picture of Kara at different parts of the game. Incredibly job!"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"I feel like I'm in a heavy minority when I say that kara is my favorite, I liked the bromance between hank and connor but I liked him the least"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Holy shit. You look like the real life incarnation of her. The costume, face and figure match perfectly."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,killer cosplay. i think my favorite was connor. such an amazing game.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Good attention to detail
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Wow! That's so awesome!!!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Dude that’s a amazing cosplay
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-21,For an second I though the right picture was the real one
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-21,"Great cosplay! One of my absolute favorite games. I got a good ending with her and an amazing scene with the dad. I think she was also my favorite. My brother is currently playing for the first time, really excited."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-21,"It’s uncanny. Like you even nailed the uncanny expression, good job lol"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-21,"This will die in the comments but what ever

Roses are red

Todd has no wife

My name is Connor

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-07-03,"wow, that's really awesome! You've made a gorgerous cosplay!"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"That is great, every detail is spot on!"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Best female cosplay I’ve ever seen.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"I just started this game recently, and her story is the only one I'm actually invested in so far."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,The one on the left clearly has better textures and polygon count :D
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,character DLC download ??  :)

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"I thought left was video game until I looked right. Pretty cool. It's more cool the longer I look at it. Cleavage cosplay, Lara crofts, and all that jazz has lost my interest. Ya look ready to play a character in a sci fi."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,The kid is also an Android
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Which one is you?
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Of course its Kara, she went through so much shit and fought so damn hard!"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,how did you do the glowing circle on the side of your head? is it emitting/glowing or photoshop?
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Awesome use of EL Tape & wire, would love to hear about your experience working with it if you have any comments."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,how did you make the arm bands and the triangle on the chest?
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,[removed]
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,It took  me some time to realize who is cosplay and who is the real character.

#My name's Connor, I'm the android sent by Cyber-life"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Damn u hot af
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I am always so impressed by the craftsmenship of some of the clothes cosplayers hand-make. You did a fabulous job with that dress! Great job! You look great!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Out fucking standing!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Hank because he reminds me of Trevor Moore from the WKUK
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"My sweet baby boy, Connor the Android sent by cyber life"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Kara got ran over by a Kara and is in a Kara
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,My favourite character was 28 STAB WOUND
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,The good ending of the game is where you get the synth holocaust to happen change my mind
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Well that is amazing.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Conner the Android sent by Cyber Life
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Nicely done with the cosplay, I’m partially blind without my glasses and contacts. So in this instance, the fact that I couldn’t tell which is real was a good thing."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Wow! This reminds me of Re:Creators
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I lost her in the creepy guy's house because i'm terrible at quick time events.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Which one is the game which one is real?
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Why does every detroit cosplayer have that same glowy ring? Ive only seen one cosplay who had a different one, and his was hot glue painted blue."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"I'm Connor, the android sent by Cyberlife!"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"What did you use for the lighting? Is it EL wire and panels, or something else entirely?"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Detroit: Become Human isnt a game, its movie sold at $60"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I like Connor but if there was an Android that look and sounded like Adam Jensen even saying the iconic “I never asked for this” line as a reference to deus ex human revolution he would steal my heart
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,See this is a cosplay I can stand behind
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Connor because he gains his humanity through interacting with the detective.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Kara, 100%. That or Hank."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I thought they were both in-game screenshots wtf just noticed one is a cosplay🤣
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,My name is Connor
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Hi I'm Connor the androit send by Cyberlife.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,You nailed the dress even if you don't resemble her.

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I don't think any of her endings are good.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Lady.Syel? Syel is my word...
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,She kinda looks like a ps5 updated version
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"I still haven't played this but own a PS4, is it something I could finish in a weekend?"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"I just finished plaything through this game for the first time and it was amazing, I think I got a decent ending (Didn't end well for Kara or Hank sadly) But all else went pretty well"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Can we just start casting for a limited run series beginning with you cast as Kara, because this is just too perfect. The way you translated this over a live adaptation of the character is fabulous."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Ma quello è il romics?
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I thought it was the other way around
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Lmao someone liked this game?
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Damnnn! Took me sec to realize which was the real photo. Well done!
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,PC vs console graphics
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,You look really plasticky
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,For a second I had a hard time which one was in the video game
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Really great costume. It took me a while to figure out which was which (If not for the background on the digital one, it would be hard to tell.)"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,She looks more like cara than the actual kara herself
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"How did your story end, I ended up getting shot at the end and was very sad"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,*doesnt go deviant*
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Wow, really cool, I just started playing this. Wanted to for a while but finally just got it on sale. So I don't think I have a fav character yet :P"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I want to see a cosplay of David Cage himself.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I was intrigued when I saw the trailer for that game and never got into it. Can anyone give me a short rundown of the basic concept and gameplay?
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"ngl, i thought both images were game renders"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,damn that's hella neat
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,A heat gun and we would have 100% cosplay
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Connor because he can either be an idiot or goddamn robo John Wick
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,whose who?
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I almost couldn’t tell which was the cosplay
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Wow, nice cosplay. I've heard a lot about the game, still waiting for it to drop on PC though."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,This is awesome! btw what products did you use in your hair?

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I never played this game but my friends say it’s their favourite game. Idk if I should buy single player story games aren’t rlly my things anymore last one I remember is fallout 4 which was good

Cutscene broke my heart. Reloaded a save while baling my eyes out, and fortunatly got a good ending. But man that first playtrough not knowing how any action would play out, is witthout a doubt one of my most intense playtroughs of any game ever. Love it :)"

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"What really got me is the little double entendre when you discover Alice's true origins and you're told that the signs were in front of you the whole time, you just chose not to see them.

Then you think back on it and holy shit, the signs really *were* there.  Think back to all the times when Todd beat Alice... and she never bruised or bled.  Think back to all the times she said she was hungry and you tried to get her something to eat... only you never did and you never actually see her eat anything.  Think back to when she and Kara were on the run and she said she was cold... and never had any visible breath come from her mouth.  Plain as day, yet you likely never noticed it until then.  Smooth, QD.  Real smooth."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I'm not gonna lie I thought it was a new game coming out or showing better graphics
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Good job :)
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"The EL looks gorgeous.  Are you over driving it for brightness?  I once burnt through an unreasonable amount of EL wire in a single night to get it at the brightness I wanted.  Only needed it to work for that night, but still."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I uhhh accidentally let Todd kill Alice so never got to play much of Kara's story. All I wanted to do was see if the game would really let that happen. Most fucked up thing I think I've done in a game tbh lol
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,It took me several minutes to figure out which one was the cosplay and which one was on the game
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,My ending was good because I peacefully protested so the guy at the border let me through instead of shooting me.

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-21,"Great cosplay and likeness!

I completely hated Kara's story and the 'twist' deception that came along with it. I think my favorite character was actually Hank because I like the actor and the character reminded me of my bitter old grandpa. Overall though I was disappointed in Quantic Dream's inability to do something outside their comfort zone."

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-21,"Connor, because he stayed a loyal machine until the end in my playthrough.

Damn Cylons need to obey their human overlords! >:O"

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Easily Connor. His internal fight throughout the game is amazing. In the end if you get that ending he will fight his own security program and that’s my favourite scene in the game.

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"This is a random thing, but the question at the end of picture posts really irks me. Look through nearly every ""influencer's"" account on any social media and you'll see every. single. picture. has a question stapled to the end. It's a really cheap way to try to force user interaction with your posts that otherwise might get a nod and a scroll by, and it irks me more that it's leaked through onto someone's Reddit crosspost."

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,All the acting/mocap in that game was excellent but Connor was just so-so good. Detroit is criminally under-rated.

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20," I came here to say this. That was the first time a video game made me feel bad. And when the robot on the main screen said something like how could you let Alice die, I felt so guilty. On my second playthrough, I made sure not to make that mistake again"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"That's what happened my second playthrough as well. I fought Todd off the first time and thought ""Well let's just see what happens if I obey and just sit here."" 

Her storyline just fucking ends right there and then. Made the 2nd playthrough go *way* faster though lol."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"I didn’t even know she could die at that moment, wtf!"
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"I mean, to be honest, we had several clues throughout the day foreshadowing the outcome i. e. Todd's random anger burst, drug abuse, plus the drawing of what happened to Kara the first time, her need of repairs, and Todd's own threat about leaving Kara worse than he did last time.

As soon as he threatened Alice and Kara in my playthrough, I ran after his ass and got the gun lol."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Same! While it made my first playthrough *very* short it served as a thematic example of what happens when the androids are obedient.

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Agreed. Especially until she gets her ""makeover"", as her whole appearance with the miniskirt and the clear apron (for cooking/cleaning duties) imo gives the best impression that she really is a ""tool"" that woke up."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"I hold my breath every time I watch the 'crossing the highway' scene in a youtube playthrough, Alice's screams are heartwrenching."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-21,I looked her up and found out she was the one who played Kara in that playstation 3 short from 2012. I never connected that to this game before. I'm probably just a little slow but hey I'm here now.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I liked Heavy Rain and I didn't like Beyond. I think Detroit is the quantic dream masterpiece

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,I think the lady you steal the tickets from was part of the mob that attacked Markus at the beginning so don't feel too bad for her. Also if you choose the peaceful protest route then the couple won't be in any danger.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"You can win by being nice and honest. (Spoilers) Their stories are all kinda connected. For example, I peacefully demonstrated with Marcus, so when Kara got to the border I decided to not take help from anyone. The border guard realizes you are a robot, but you sort of silently beg him to let you though and he looks up at the TV and sees robots being peaceful he'll let you through.

I might be a bit fuzzy on the details, it's been a little while since I played."

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Well, you steal tickets from humans. They can walk home, drink some tea, watch TV and try to leave Detroit on the next day.No one will shoot them just because they are humans. They have nothing to fear.

Stealing their tickets was an easy decision for me."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,"Yeah, but you take it from humans who are ultimately not the ones in real danger in this game...unless you blow up the city...which I didn't...so it's cool!"

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-21,"Don't necessarily tell me what they are, but are there more varied choices you can make for Kara? I've only played through once, but I found myself liking Kara's story least. Markus & Connor had such clear and highly variable story choices that felt like you could change their priorities and personality. I felt like no matter what I did Kara got pushed towards a motherhood story and never really felt ""deviant"" like the other two."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Perhaps because her level of detail is higher

I also had to cover the blue fabric to make it similiar to the original one because I didn't like the basic one. I had to tighten the dress of two sizes and cut it to insert the LEDs. I had to do 50 color passes on my black boots to make them totally white. And second thing, fuck you, asshole."

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Agreed. People harp on it because of the gameplay but to me it's more of an interactive story experience and I wish more people would embrace that.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-07-01,Seeing all this Connor love has got me worried I let him get decommissioned. Which apparently only 2% of people did in last chance Connor

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,You and me both brother.  I need to replay this game.  I wanted the peaceful ending where humans and androids came together as one.  Apparently this was not the way

I thought when I stole the tickets I basically killed the family.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Yeah but you had to steal tickets to get on the bus to the border.  That’s why people are saying you can’t get the good ending by being nice and honest
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Yeah that happens. I didnt play but saw RTGames youtube series on it.
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-20,Yeah you also had to be completely peaceful with Marcus to pass at the border.

c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-21,Idk but there's this one videos compiling Connor's intro and since then I always see that intro. But seems like it's during the game release it was popular.

Honestly, maybe play heavy rain first to get accustomed to the style, and then play Detroit to see how much they improved upon in terms of story and characters. Enjoy when you do get to it!! AC Odyssey is taking all my spare time."
c2v7cf,2019-06-20,2019-06-21,"Ellen page was fantastic in it. The game doesn't suffer in anyway because of her. The story is bonkers and none of the choices ever seem to matter. Like I remember a scene where a guy asks me something at a party and she responds with something along the lines that plays into the ending I dont want to spoil. The guy just says okay, want a drink? Like you just didn't say the most ludicrous thing in the world. The endings were bland as hell. Gah. Detroit just did everything better."

8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,"Agreed, just finished playing it myself last night. There are actually some bonus videos you can unlock in the menus that show a lot of the ""making of"" behind the scenes stuff. Its incredible. "
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-06,"> and the amount of work that must've gone in to it is mind blowing. Just looking at the flowcharts, there's so many different outcomes and your choices actually influence the story heavily

Have you unlocked and watched some of the making of videos in the extras? The amount of mocap (On literally everything I believe) and the amount and sheer volume of the scripts is insane.

I'd love to watch just a big whole 'making of' documentary of this to be honest. 

It's certainly - so far as of June - my GOTY"
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,"I would say the same, but I wish there was a plot twist or maybe I missed that, ra9, Amanda, some conspiracy. "
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-06,While telltale deserves some criticism to be sure their choice flow charts are roughly on par with Detroit. You'll note that many flow charts flow into a very limited number of outcomes for most of the story. It's exactly what telltale does.  The reason tell tale games are lackluster by comparison is realistically budget. They make 30$ games. Detroit will easily have twice the length and more permutations as a result of being a $60 game. 
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,How do they have little replay value? There's multiple paths in every chapter that change the ending you get.

8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,"TF2 is near perfect execution of how a developer should handle their games. Release>Buy>Play>Add free content over time. They do have paid cosmetic bundles, but you know exactly what you are getting. I just hope that EA doesn't fuck Respawn to death."
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,well it's not *not* content...
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,You're wrong.

8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,"Dude, it's EA and Bioware we are talking about. I don't remember the time they did not have DLC (after they start making them). It's pre Battlefail 2 we are talking about here."
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,Depends on your definition of content.
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-06,The ME2 Day 1 DLC was free.
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-06,"Anything made by Cage will be considered ""bad writing"" because it's easier than having to actually play games that your friends on the internet say they don't like.

It's not perfect by any stretch of imagination, but it's a really good game. One of the best in it's genre. If you don't like games that focus on narrative though, you probably won't like it."
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,"People have accused it of having bad writing? Really? Probably the same people that fucked up a ton of decisions and threw their story out of whack, making it a complete mess..."
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,"It definitely has some ""Come on David..."" moments but it was miles better than any of the previous entries"
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,Bad criticism comes from game critics who rush the game to get their reviews out first. 
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,"rA9 *is* explained if you get certain scenes. Amanda is too if you take a look around Kamski's place. While rA9 is not given an actual name, it's explained that rA9 was the first android to become deviant and thus began the spread of the software instability that allowed deviancy to become a thing. If you get the best possible ending where everyone survives, that instability is not fixed. It's left alone and androids are recognised as people too by the president. If you go a bad route, rA9 is basically never explained and thus is essentially hidden from the player.

Amanda on the other hand is a more simple thing. She was one of the founders of CyberLife Industries and eventually passed away. She's a part of the system that all the RK900 androids are on a.k.a Connor. She's a computer program basically but sentient in a way and was created by Kamski to honor her memory."
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,"The beauty of Detroit is that the twists only make themselves known if you happen down that narrative path. If you're seeking them out, you'll find them."
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,"I really wanted ra9 to be alice, actualy thought it was going there for a bit. We dont know how old she is or how long kara and her where in that horrible house. But id also be happy if it was the employee number of the guy who assembled kara in the original short."
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,"And only a few are actually worth replaying to watch the different paths.... But after you've seen all the options it's not exactly the type of game that holds any real long term play. It's not really open world, nothing left to do after unlocking all the cinematics,etc. 

Beautiful but without real depth. "

8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,"You're sorta right, It'll have no lootboxes and no premium pass. So maps are going to be released like titanfall 2, for free. 

Honestly they probably are trying to follow titanfall 2's way of paid content, and mainly focus on cosmetic items which is probably why the tanks and stuff in the trailer looked so crazy, because it's meant to show how many cosmetic items you can buy"

8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-06,"One of the complaints I saw before the game was even out was about the demo. They thought it was unfair that you weren't allowed to save Daniel and the usual ""my choices don't matter!!!!"" whining. Daniel was cornered by the police after killing someone and holding a little girl hostage. What did you *think* was going to happen? You had several choices in the matter however, including the potential death of at least 2\-3 other characters in the scene. But after that, people were already convinced it was a bad game because it didn't play out how they wanted. Thus, ""bad writing."""
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,"Oh yeah I know that, but they didn't give ra9 and Amanda more depth. Regardless the game is a masterpiece. "
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Kamski say rA9 was the first ""sentient"" android. That doesn't necessarily mean deviant as I'd argue Connor is sentient even when he's not deviant."
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,I mean yeah if you 100% a game there isn’t much you can do besides reset progress and do the same things over again.
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-06,"You say that as if open world games are guaranteed to have replay value. How many people have done a collectible quest in a game and enjoyed it the second or third time? Assassin's Creed (feathers and so on), Batman (Riddler trophies), etc? Open world does not guarantee you long term play that is particularly enjoyable. Many people have not mastered the formula, and a lot of the quests for open world games lead to pretty much busy work with no real added value to the story."

8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,"No lies at all. EA made 0 cents on AWO, in fact they likely lost money due to all of the support they gave us.

The core of the EA Origins program is that EA will fund independent development studios, and will only make their money back. They decided themselves that they will not make money from this.

This was conceptualized, designed and created with the sole purpose of helping studios out."
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-06,It helps solidify Origin as a viable platform.

It's an interactive movie but one you really aren't compelled to rewatch since it's pretty but not particularly great story since it's pretty ham handed with its message. "

8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-06,Where were you captured?
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,Well you have to [kill Chloe to be able to ask the question](/spoiler) which you don't need to be full machine.
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-06,"Potential for what? To me, a game where you stretch out menial tasks with no real side story or any story progression where you're just going around killing things and collecting items isn't really that interesting to me. Just because a game has an open world doesn't mean it has a longer story either. It just means it could take longer to complete. But unless you have meaningful stories within that open world that contribute to what you're already doing, the world is still pretty lifeless. 

I would prefer a good game with a sizeable chunk of both story and narrative exploration over some of the games marked ""open world"" these days. And I would much prefer a story that is completely narrative to one that is completely open world with no real plot (see: No Man's Sky). I think GTA is a good example, but for me, GTA is not a series that's great because it's open world. It's great because of the way it uses its open world to tell the story. 

Amount of quality narrative will always be better than size of open world to me. There are great games that have pretty small individual maps but they work because the narrative that goes with it makes it enjoyable to play (Dragon Age: Origins, for example)."
8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-06,"well right out of the gate you called me a dense bitch. the first words you ever typed to me. then after you made sure i wouldn't listen to your idiocy, you complained about the plight of the small child who somehow has access to a credit card and some bullshit about how the games are raping them or something.  
  
all of this led me to believe that you must be some kind of 8 year old with a foul mouth and no parental oversight.  
until you prove otherwise with some form of identification, this will continue to be my assumption."

8oowrk,2018-06-05,2018-06-06,"Agreed, I think my biggest gripe about modern gaming is games that are open world for open world's sake. Open world does not inherently make your game more rich, interesting, or re-playable. I understand that it is different strokes for different folks, but I for one value an interesting narrative over quality of gameplay. I am absolutely positive that is something that has changed as I've gotten older.

I do like me some open world games (Witcher 3, GTA series), but my completionist attitude combined with the typically menial and repetitive tasks associated with many open world format titles means that I am done playing them well before I ever get through the story. Jim Sterling said something along the lines of ""Ubisoft games are the games I play while waiting to play other games"" and that sentiment tends to resonate with me. They are fun games, but nothing about them is iconic."

That makes it almost objectively bad. I don't know why you are trying to offend me here, since you also said it was stupid. You should understand that something so out of place and so absurd would have that kind of reaction, which is an understandable reaction, since it's just bad. I don't understand why you get so defensive either. Someone called you out on a joke being bad and while (you pretty much spelt it yourself now) you knew it was bad you kept on defending it.

Agreed so hard with this. I look at some of the games I would play over and over again when I was younger and think ""why the hell did I play that so much? It's so repetitive."" I think once you get a taste of how good narrative and good gameplay can be, it sort of opens your eyes and you begin to see the flaws in games where the story is eehhhh but maybe the gameplay is varied and the maps are relatively big for the time. A lot of the Rare (company) games like DK64 I used to play are fun for the gameplay aspect, but I get tired of them quickly because I don't feel attached to any world. I just feel like im literally playing a game to pass time until I can think of something else to do. I don't like to feel like that when I'm playing a game, I want to enjoy games because I like playing games."

I wasn't acting like an authority. I was simply stating that you made a bad joke and that it was dumb trying to defend it. It was just bad. You tell me that I'm pathetic, but you are the one who got defensive first, tried to insult me then, threw around self importance and then more slurs and then decided to block me. All of that because I said your joke was bad. I think you might have gone way too far with your defensiveness. It's almost as if you identified yourself with your joke.                            "

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I am seriously digging this returning popularity of cyberpunk/tech-noir games. Can't wait to see more of Cyberpunk 2077 (even if I wasn't a fan of CDPR's last game).
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Every game this guy makes sounds interesting to me, but what's with the inane tasks, QTEs, and whatever else cluttering these games?  "
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Great, now I gotta go buy another PS4. "
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"""Connor, do you dream of electronic sheep?"" X = Yes, O = No"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I really hope this doesn't end up like Hitman where it looks like an amazing game and then you find out there's only 6 levels total or some shit and they just want you to replay the same 6 levels a hundred different ways.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I saw this and it looks interesting, but I'm not entirely up to speed. The way this was presented makes it seem like the entire game is this ONE scenario and the path leading up to it, rather than just a part of the story.

Like, I'm kinda hoping you'll have to deal with more than one situation, rather than collect evidence and then always end up in the hostage situation shown."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Who is voicing Connor? Kinda sounds like Keanu Reeves.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I just came.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"But what happend to Kara? I thought this game was to be about her? Judging from this trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEPzofGKSNE
"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,This game was a surprise to me! I thought it was going to be a beautiful game and a good story....this is fucking amazing looking! I can't wait to try it out. 
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Apparently David Cage took a step back on this one, and let other writers have more influence with the story and ideas. This is a good thing. Cage always seemed to have a bunch of ideas that he wanted to incorporate into his games, and he'd do it even if it didn't really make much sense.

Quantic Dream games are different, i'll give them that. They're not always well executed and have a number of problems, but I do give credit for trying something that nobody else seems to be doing much of. If I find this on sale, I may pick it up, unless the reviews are absolutely glowing."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"well that looks cool as fuck, hope it lives up to the trailer"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,313 Baby!
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I am always confused by the connection with Androids/robots and the city of Detroit that seems to occur a lot in popular culture. Detroit was never a technology city. It was a mass production industry city. It cant all be because of Robcop right? because that wasnt really a robot movie..it was more of a, geezus crist Detroit is a hell hole, we cant police it with just mere men, we need military grade robots to try to police these animals type movie."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,What about Kara???
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,E3 just isn't fair this year. I can't download a PS4!
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Im getting really tired of all these games that push great graphics and fantastic storylines. Its like every single PS4 exclusive just takes itself way too seriously. Not saying that Xbox exclusives are any better, but I just get so tired of people thinking these walk through movies should pass as games"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Don't trust David Cage, he will always let you down."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,This game seriously blew me away.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Way too intense. Seems like the kind of game where i feel like i have a 2nd job. Looks really awesome though.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,This is the first game like this that's even remotely interested me.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"So long as there's a ""robocop flies in with a jetpack and saves the day"" ending I'll be happy."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,iPhone is better
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,There will be more than just that one thing right?
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Very Indigo Prophecy-esque but with tons more variability. Love it!
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Video games are the dumping ground for failed Hollywood directors.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"cant wait to see how Kara fits into this. That first CGI test video where the factory was basically going to reject her and dismantle her felt so wrong, I cant wait to see how this game deals with artificial intelligence. "
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,The sequel to Heavy Rain I've always wanted.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-08-04,"I want to play this so bad, like no other game ever. I don't know why"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,The entire game is actually played out on that roof
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,This would be a great movie. Hmmmm. If only....
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Neat.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,blade runner the game
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,This looks dope as fuck
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Not exactly digging the voice acting. I think in a game like this, they should spare no expense on that.
"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Really hope it's more than this one standoff case. No other footage was shown.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Why are all protagonists white males?
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Is this going to be the only mission? Probably not, but nothing else was shown..."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Hello, I am Connor. An android based on the voice and acting style of 27yr old Keanu Reeves. "
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"To anyone getting hyped: Quantic Dream games always look awesome before release, but they have terrible execution. The company has yet to put out a single game without at least one enormous flaw."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Since it is a David Cage game, I am wondering what the time-to-rape (or sexual assault) will be this time around... And it also probably be terribly written and have an awful, insulting twist."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Hate these Lame ass decision based""games"""

>become human

heh, I like the subtle racism. Maybe I'll play it."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I always have a hard time taking these ""sentient robots treated like shit"" stories. 

First off, there don't seem to be rules in place in how you treat a sentient being. 

Second, why build androids with so much free will and whatnot, and then force them to obey humans. Instead of, say, just programming them to do it."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I was really looking forward to this game back when it was first showcased with Kara, but now this trailer has caused me quickly drop interest."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"No PC port, no thanks."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Don't get me wrong this looks cool and I hate to be a downer but I am just really disappointed with the path modern gaming is going. I really wish we would use all of this amazing technology to create amazing, complex and deep gaming experiences. Instead we are creating interactive movies. The possibilities to create incredible immersive game experiences are there but it kind of seems like games are becoming more simple and are like ""rides"" you get on for 6 hours."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"man this game just looks like dog shit, I want to like it but David Cage just is terrible at making games"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"cant wait for every voice actor to be fucking french.

David Cage games are usually a wild ride of some of the most unlikable characters in video game history. 

to fix that issue he tried to make the characters as unrelateable as possible by making them fucking robots. at least that kindof hides his shit dialogue"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Gee another gay ass walking simulator, headed right for the 5 dollar dump bin because people are too busy playing games that include FUN"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"It will be a game that you play full once and get sick of like Until Dawn, I dunno if i will get this.."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I hate these kinds of games. I don't want to react to stuff during a cut scene. And I don't want the game to be mostly cutscenes. Dumb
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Being from Windsor I'm excited for this game solely on the fact that the Windsor skyline isn't copied/pasted high rises like in every other Detroit-based video game. 
"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"check out Deus Ex: HR's skyline if you haven't already. I always liked how spot-on the city looked in that game.

"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Ren Cen employees are going to be pissed that somebody built a skyscraper over their parking garage.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I wanna be able to go to the Joe in this damn game, either that or little caesars arena (yes its a god awful name)"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,So nice to see an accurate skyline
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,The original trailer had a scene from the River Rouge bridge on I-75 northbound driving toward the city.  I drove over that every morning to work and loved that view of the skyline.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I can actually see my apartment in the trailer. Freaky.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Kid loses body part cut scene. 
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Looked like there were a bunch of different endings. Whether or not it will be the same for every choice is hard to determine.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"It's from Quantic Dream. 

Heavy Rain.....so MANY endings, Killer gets away scott free, Killer gets killed by victims mother, killer gets killed by cop but reporter father and son all die, killer gets killed by cop and reporter lives but father and son die, etc. Each character has 3+ possible out come the story focuses on 4 characters.

Beyond Two souls, Everyone dies, Everyone lives, MC protects kid, MC protect lover, Everyone dies you die, etc for total of 11 endings"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,hmm...Looks like that was the exact point the trailer was demonstrating. Looks awesome.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,There are 180 hours of gameplay.  Unfortunately a single playthrough only takes 2.5 hours.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"This is similar to what I heard the IGN guys say in the post show: ""how do you fix David Cage's wooden dialogue? Make everyone an android!"""
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,It's not stupid if it works.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Its a signature of QuanticDream's games
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"When I first Saw the Teasers for Tron and Young Flynn totally CG'd, i was really hoping that all the Programs would be CG'd like that, and the users would be real. But nah, they just cg'd Clu, and he looked terrible for it. "
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I think that was the entire point of the very unorthodox trailer: to exhibit to you that this is a game where decisions actually alter outcome, depending on what direction you want to go with it. "
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Have you ever played a quanticdream game?
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Sadly, David Cage has never managed that."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,If it's anything close to Heavy Rain I will enjoy it greatly.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Bloodborne ™
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"We the gamers want a platform with attitude. It's edgy, it's ""in your face."" You've heard the expression, ""let's get busy""? Well, this is a console who gets ""biz-zay!"" Consistently and thoroughly."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Seriously, wish Sony didn't hog them as exclusives."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Maybe compared to the Xbone but I wouldn't say that compared to PC.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I don't know that I agree with that.

Deus Ex. Cyberpunk. Prey. Even Overwatch has the whole ""No androids hoo-rah!"" thing going on.

Seems to be a pretty common theme nowadays."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Tbh, if you're paying to get exclusives made, it's pretty dumb to just get the ones that are available on other platforms. "
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I'm excited for the Best Friends to play it 
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Simply because it's the only option, this looks like it'd be a purchase if it were available on PC but alas."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I feel like I already did.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Already preordered.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I have never been one to get into ""story based"" games, but this looks pretty well done."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,It's a pitty watching let's plays though if there's such an elaborate choice system. Will probably rent a copy and surprise-move-in to my best friend's living room for a day or two 
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,I hope the Super Beard Bros play it like they did with L.A. Noire.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"These things can hardly be called games. They aren't without merit though. More like interactive stories. Beyond two souls was worth playing through, but I wouldn't call it action packed or thrilling and I definitely wish I'd waited and avoided paying for the full triple a price tag."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,LA Noir meets Bladerunner. Sign me up.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Can I get you a cup of coffee?  
STOP LYING TO ME YOU FUCKING WHORE!"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,With Cyberpunk 2077 coming soon(ish) it will be interesting to see how these play out.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,If this game is anything like Until Dawn it'll be a fun (albeit short) game. 
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Man, LA Noire had so much potential, but FUCK was it in dire need of a more cohesive overarching plot. Like, there'd be a significant murder and I'd think ""later in the game, this will come around again and I'll find out what REALLY happened"", but....nope. It's like they couldn't decide if they wanted it to be a simulation of playing the life of a 1940s police detective, or tell a cohesive story...so they did neither. They locked you into these little sub-plots that really went nowhere, but never quite gave you a true sense of freedom. 

Also, it introduced me to my hatred of open world games that do absolutely nothing worthwhile with their open world. You could drive all over a massive map of LA...but there was no compelling reason to do so, really. It was, in the misuse-of-the-term-ironic sense, like a giant movie set."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,The helicopter will definitely remember him sending it away
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,He didn't ask for this
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"In the announce trailer, it showed humans protesting against androids. If its like Heavy Rain, there will probably be multiple playable characters each with their own story that all connect together towards the end

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Beyond is interesting but no where near as good. Short, choices that don't matter at all, and tutorials for things that are used once men story. I loved heavy rain but the games don't compare at all."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Beyond is dissapointing because the concept alone could be used to make a much more enjoyable action based game. Co-op would also be sick(and by that I mean controlling both characters at the same time not just switching instead of just giving the controller to your buddy), but it is by no means a bad game"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Sounds like the same guy who voiced Norman Jaden from Heavy Rain, though with less of an accent. "
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I guess the new tactic is to hide shitty voice work under the guise that everyone is an android.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I've heard that Connor is last minute replacement for a female protagonist, that they've removed for unknown reasons. She was featured in the original teaser/trailer.  "
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Maybe the in-universe voice actor that voices that model is bad.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Oh this is the same studio? Whelp abandon all hope of getting a good game. Although this time you actually have to push buttons unlike the other pieces of garbage.

[LINK](https://youtu.be/gSxDNGbPFcY?t=2m39s) . You'll play as different characters over the coarse of the story."

Yep, im not the only one"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,That still gives me chills
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Kara turned into the hit release Ex Machina.
"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"On the IGN livestream they speculated that maybe the game will be an anthology of sorts, with separate stories all set in Detroit and all focusing on the same themes. I think I'd actually prefer that to the usual route."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I hope that means there'll be multiple player characters.

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Brother, you have no idea. BILLIONS being poured into the city right now. 

Plus I'm sure game designers are tired of working with New York, LA, Chicago, and Miami. "
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Delta City. The Future Has a Silver Lining.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"pretty sure they are both going to be playable. at the end of karas trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pelrr__9qx8 she says my name is kara and this is our story, just like how connor goes my name is connor and this is my story.

If i were to take a guess they are both going to be playable characters one thats looking from the perspective of working for the law while the other is breaking the rules and being free"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,">I never played Beyond but I heard it wasn't as good as HR.

I liked both HR and BTS. BTS more because I intensely relate to the underlying subject matter that it's talking about. My one problem with BTS was the jumpy timeline. But with the ps4 version, you can play it chronologically. Could be worth a shot for you. Just my 2 cents. "
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"I personally wouldn't bother with beyond. Such a good concept, but executed horribly with little to no choices that matter"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"> will probably just reset you to just before the conversation takes place

I kinda doubt that myself. This is from the guys who made Heavy Rain, which was well known for its ability to progress the story even if you fucked up and let Player Characters die. It's already been confirmed that you play as multiple characters in Detroit so I'm expecting something similar."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"That's what I got from it. It's really killed all excitement I had for the game, as I was hoping for a game with a lot of depth in story and exposition. I was really looking forward to a game that would focus upon such interesting themes as AI sentience, but this just looks like it encourages players to reload the game over and over in order to engineer a world in which these problems aren't of any real consequence."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"You should check out Fahrenheit Indigo Prophecy then, it's another game made by David Cage"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Yeah! Got that Until Dawn/Heavy Rain thing going on.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Sony killed it with the exclusives at E3. This game, Spider-Man and one other I can't remember. Pretty smart move to advertise some games that seem different and then making them exclusive. It's like they give these studios tons of money because recouping the investment in the game isn't as important as the game selling more consoles for them."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"this preview could be the prologue of the story, as they usually have a temporary character to set the tone of the story. Kara may appear in the rest of the story."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Pretty sure they said in an interview that you play as both Connor and Kara, similar to how Heavy Rain had multiple protagonists. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more than 2, also."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I suspect the game will be a series of vignettes following several different android characters. Each of their stories works individually, but their narratives intertwine to tell the larger story. 

Think *Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels* or *Snatch* or *Magnolia*"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Came here to the comments to ask the same question. I saw that video...what was it, last year? I believe it was supposed to be some kind of test footage or something but I thought the story concept of it was really good and was looking forward to more news on the potential game. Seeing **this** trailer leaves me hopeful, but I am still curious about Kara's story being a stand-alone game."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,[LINK](https://youtu.be/gSxDNGbPFcY?t=2m39s) . The developer says you'll play as different characters so I assume Kara is still in the game and it's just a different section of it. So have no fear! Kara is still here...or there.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"I do remember, that's one of the reasons I'm hyped. People love to shit on him but I loved Heavy Rain and Beyond was good too."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Found one of the shit voice actors.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,This reads like such a weird question to me. Do you also think the footage from Days Gone or Horizon is the only part of the game? They were just demoing how the game will work rather than showing the entire game...
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I feel like that's what would make or break this game. There could be tons of different scenes with different outcomes and an overall story-arc. Or they could just Stanley Parable it, players complete like three separate endings and get their fill and grow tired of the game."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"The vague idea that one of the IGN announcers had was my favorite; that the game itself is only 2-3 hours long, like a movie, but there's so many different endings. So you can sit down and control a ""movie"" in a single sitting, but then start over and create a completely different movie over and over. That's a game I'd play"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Yeah I feel like they just ruined the whole game there and gave away all the endings.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I'm pretty sure you'll be able to play as Kara as well. This is just one part of the game.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,That's sad
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,i loved that show. It should of continued.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,My thoughts as well.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,How many black androids are there in Detroit?
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,He's a fucking android. Implied super-human strength.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I think he might not be a normal human or something? I don't know!
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,maybe both will be there at some point
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-16,A game can feature multiple characters.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I'm getting tired of people like you who whinge because a game doesn't appeal to your expectations.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,It is a movie. It's called Blade Runner. 
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Do you seriously think the whole game would be that one incident and they would give away the endings of the entire game in the trailer? 
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I can't believe I've seen multiple people think this... 
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Trailers from earlier this year showed a completely different character. I think it will have a larger robot Vs people story, rather than just being on case"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"By all the protagonists, you mean the 1 protagonist shown in the video?

Or by all protagonists you mean the antagonist and protagonist in this video?

Or by all protagonists you mean the Connor guy in this video and the pretty distinctly female but white protagonist from the other trailer?

Considering all mentioned characters are androids. Yeah, they should be white. Want to bet the line for white androids would be much longer than for the ethnic minority ones? Hur dur racist. But it would also be called racist if you bought an ethnic minority one. Hur dur"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Because there are no black people in detroit /s
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Because we want Detroit to Become Human
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Yeah but their always somewhat interesting.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Ah, yes, flaws. Those things that only some developers make. /s

I'm just, how to say... 'messinwitcha'.

But seriously, Quantic Dream's games are amazing imho. You're entitled to your opinion, though. Just be aware that a puppy dies whenever someone disagrees with me on this."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Yeah, because Heavy Rain isn't one of the most highly praised games in existence. Like an average reviewer score of 89.23%. Totally isn't. Also ""TOTALLY"" didn't win multiple game of the year awards. Never happened. 

Fahrenheit, well it is highly reviewed too, but the off the rails ending kinda makes the excellent early-mid game kinda mute. Still loved it. Only game from them with an enormous flaw.

Beyond Two Souls is okay. No major flaws, just okay.

Those are the only 3 games they released in the last 15 years."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Wasn't Kara(?)a sex-bot? So, there you go."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,You're being down voted for being completely right

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Did anyone notice is there was a second bridge? I'd hope they'd have that done by then.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"As someone who also comes from the armpit of Canada, I agree with you."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I like to think that eventually sanity will win out and we'll have at least another bridge and free transit back and forth.

It's ridiculous how near and yet so far away Windsor is from Detroit."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Had a room at the Marriott at the RenCen that had a really nice view of Windsor. Maybe its me, but I don't really notice the buildings until night time. Mostly it looks like quaint looking houses, especially when your on Belle Isle."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Actually it looks like the skyscraper is on the parking lot between Beaubien parking and East River parking garages. Always felt like there should be another building there with maybe the first 8 or so floors being a garage. Kind of like the Renaissance City apartments. Prime location right there on the Detroit river.

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Aw yes, the rarely used cinematic circumcision scene."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"That's what he is referring to. Lot's of games where your ""decisions matter"" it just picks which 2 min cut scene will be next, and the game continues the same no matter what choices you make. "
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,The trailer literally shows the player character going through all the trouble of finding the solution where you save both the crazed android and the kid and then the game killing the android anyway so it doesn't affect anything.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"You just have to do it right. Telltale games do a pretty great job it and I enjoyed Life Is Strange as well. Hopefully this follows that line, people were pretty dissapointed with Beyond Two Souls from what I hear though."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,this is really just a trailer. i would be shocked if they allowed like 8 different outcomes for one engagement. i hope they do but trailers lie like crazy.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,But Beyond had way more implicit choices you didn't even know you were making. I thought that was a nice and impressive choice.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,> Scott free
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I thought he isn't writing this? Just directing? Please?
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,PT Cruisers work but they're still pretty stupid. 
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I didn't say it was stupid. 
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"That might be true for some things, but I think everyone has had a moment where the way they fixed something was undeniably stupid in concept."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"For this one I'm pretty confident. But just for the sake of the argument I can't help but think about Remember Me's early trailers, they were all focused on the ""memory remix"" scenes. The game appeared like a heavily branching game with strong storytelling, turned out it was a (pretty decent) beat'em completely linear with no branching whatsoever. :p"
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Yeah but I've seen a few games that claim to do this but really don't. They give you a variety of choices to mask the fact that the ultimate outcome comes down to a few different possibilities regardless of what you choose. So, yes, your decisions matter but not necessarily in the way that you would think. A lot of them come down to one or two key decisions that send you down one of 2 or 3 paths and the rest is superfluous but makes the dialogue makes it seem each decision is important. The walking dead games are probably the best example of this."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Yeah but it's David Cage and, at least for me personally, his games are usually not nearly as good as they look by the trailers. Writing is for the most part sub-par, characters are usually unlikable or just uninteresting, and in the end, it's more fun to fuck up and intentionally make the worst possible decisions just because it usually turns out pretty funny unintentionally (or so I assume it's unintentional).

It really tells you something, too, that I knew this was a David Cage game less than a minute into the trailer, before they even showed any gameplay, just by the dialogue alone. We can all hope this is a good game, like we do with every single David Cage game, but the right thing to do is to wait for it to come out, see what people say, and if you have the money and the interest to thrown down on it, then do it. "
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Yes, but there's a third.

The problem with games like this is that you are not just thrown into this world where you can learn everything you need to know from the character and solve the problem. There will always be the third voice, which is who you're actually negotiating with - the game designer. This means the game that should have been now becomes a meta game, especially after you've learned the basic principles the designers took.

It's like Uncharted seeming open world, but giving very basic cues to go a certain direction because that's the right one. The cues are pretty much always the same hue of brown ledge. It's red in mirror's edge, etc. The same would go for dialogue, and the game stops being about figuring out what the negotiator wants and instead what the pupper master controlling everything wants.

Plus, it suffers from Fallout style pre-dialogue which will probably vaguely match the sentiment you're actually going for. I don't doubt that part of the game will be in tricking the player to pick a poor outcome.

In reality, you're just going to have to go through the same story over and over in order to experience the iterations and that sounds awfully repetitive."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"It could be extremely misleading, most games with these give you multiple decisions that actually have no effect in the long run of the game. Yeah there are 15 different possible outcomes, fantastic, but does every choice matter in the long run of the story's progression or the only thing that matters is just that you saved the girl or didn't.

&nbsp;

Like if he was called to negotiate with another rogue android will that android know that he betrayed the last android he made a deal with? hopefully pretty much limiting some of your options in the negotiations? I mean if not then this is no different than any other game with multiple choices and outcomes."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Heavy rain had quite a bit of branching.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"And in contrast...Scalebound.  

Did anyone else abso-fucking-lutely hate the ""attitude"" of Scalebound?  I cant stand all these characters that treat dire circumstances like they are trivial and constantly have quick quips ready to go.  Scalebound looked kinda cool in some of the earlier trailers but god damn, that dude is so fucking insuferable.  It could be an outstanding game and I don't think I'd be able to play it just because I cant stand the main character."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I went back to Bloodborne after enjoying Dark Souls 3 for quite a while and I gotta say, while DS3 is great...Bloodborne is the better game by a not insignificant margin. And significantly prettier (at least relative to the console editions of DS3). Better art direction, more visceral combat, better animation, with an emergent plot that's even more of a mindfuck. Only place it comes up short relative to the DS games is weapon variety."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,So it's pro-active huh?
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Have to give props to Sony for supporting studios with interesting ideas though, I'm gonna wait for a sale or something so that I can try them out. "

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Sony gave them money in order to make the game. They didn't hog anything
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"It's like the situation with Bayonetta 2.  
  
The game wouldn't even *exist* if Nintendo didn't personally pony up for it. Better that a game exists in some format rather than not existing at all."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Well it would be bad business if they made games multiplatform when they need to give you a reason to buy their console over their competitors.....
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I wish they weren't exclusive either. I'm super glad I get to play them, but whenever recommending games to friends who own an xbox, pc, or even nintendo, there are all these awesome games I'd like them to at least try, but they can't.

Not that other platforms don't have cool exclusives, but the playstation ones do seem far more unique most of the time."

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Wierd games like this wouldn't get the budget it has if it wasn't first party. If they were on their own or looking for financiers it'd be compromised artistically or really low budget. With Sony they get artistic freedom and a budget to fully execute their vision. 
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Those games wouldn't exist without Sony funding them. Perhaps Microsoft and other PC companies should fund smaller games instead of you just whining.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Thats their point. Buy a PS4.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Just saying, I have an Xbox that I managed to get because I got it dirt cheap but its mostly unused. Most of the games I play are on PC but seeing all the neat stuff that comes out on PS4 makes me want to get it for those 2-3 games that are quite unique. "

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Also reminds me of Heavy Rain.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Kind of basically seems like Bladerunner. Androids are self-aware basically and want to be human? Bladerunner all the way. I'm excited for this, except I don't have a playstation."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Well for one they aren't even the same category of game.  Detroit is made by the same studio as Heavy Rain, so it's going to be a very similar kind of multiple protagonist visual novel-like story, just this time in the future with androids.

Cyberpunk is a full RPG, and also (sadly) is definitely not coming soonish.  With the development cycles for CD Projekt Red I'd bet two years minimum, since they just now freed up the studio from working on Witcher 3 DLC."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Totally agree. I think Bondi put more energy into the mocap than anything else.

Then Rockstar face raped em, so that's the end of that."

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"This is pretty recent though. Sony's games in the past have been kind of arcady stuff. And you will remember that Mass Effect was planned as an Xbox game first and then got ported to the PC.

I'm pretty sure that what decides what they present is what the studios have ready to present."

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"For the E3 2016 trailer, yeah, Blade Runner. For the initial trailer with Kara, I'd say more iRobot-ish / Ex Machina.

The general premise from what I can see is exploring the concept of consciousness within AI and how a conscious android perceives the treatment of androids in general."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Thanks. I didn't know.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Heavy Rain is one of those games that got good reviews because of hype. I liked it enough when I first played it, but subsequent playthroughs made it obvious just how bad the writing and acting is. It's so bad that it spawned a bunch of memes mocking it. Let's also not forget that the story was riddled with plot holes as well as plot lines that were started and then never touched again (for example, why Ethan is having blackouts and wakes up with origami figures in his hands). Considering the game was all about the story, I'd say all of those are pretty big fuckin' flaws. You could also say the game was about your choices and performance making an impact on how the story unfolded, but except for a handful of events in the game, nothing you did affected anything.

Fahrenheit, like you said, shit itself in the last third of the game when it used a rocket ship to jump a shark. Like you said, enormous flaw.

Beyond Two Souls has a 72 on metacritic. So like you said, it's average. Again, for a game that was hyped up, that's not very good.

Like you said, they've only released three games in the last 15 years, but none of them have been great. Like I said, interesting concepts but poor execution.

I guarantee you this game will be the same. You can already see it if you look at the trailer. Bad writing, poor acting, and it doesn't even look like gameplay, it looks like a cinematic trailer showing a concept of the game. I'd be willing to bet the real game won't have all those branches and outcomes. It would be a miracle if QD pulls off what they showed in the trailer."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Did not know they made Indigo Prophecy as well.  Neat.  I really enjoyed that game...even when it got weird.

A large producer would have demanded heavy rain 2 instead of beyond two souls, they'd have stuck their fingers into the pudding to have some input, they'd have geared it towards making money and hitting release dates instead of letting them do their thing.

But sony arent looking to make money from the game, they're looking to sell consoles, and every game they bring out gets so much attention for their concepts, and gets so hype that it's really in sony's best interest that new IPs are being made, so both Sony and Quantumdream benefit.

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Relax... It'll probably just be multiple playable characters. Kara is ""free"", and a lawbreaker, while Connor is a ""slave"" working for the police.

Probably great to send in a negotiator who you don't care if gets shot or not, as he can be fixed or replaced. Pretty harsh, but that is probably the reality of the game.

Look at last years trailer, and this gameplay one back to back, and it'll make more sense.

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,It doesn't really branch that significantly. The story overall remains very similar with the same final options.
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I disagree on Beyond. That game had VERY little changes based on your decisions and they were nearly Mass Effect 3 level blunt force trauma.

Funding the high-profile shooter/parkour/action adventure game is all well and good, and we love those games, but funding some of these oddball games (which aren't ""indie"") with weird and artistic approaches is definitely worthwhile too.

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I've thought about this criticism in games, and sometimes it just doesn't make sense for a decision to affect much of the rest of the game.

Whether the kid lives or dies or whatever, I doubt that would change the next situation at all. However, it would make sense for it to have some repercussions down the line. The kid shows up again, or a relative of the dead kid wants to do you harm, or the android you saved goes haywire again... etc. These are all additional scenarios that could (and should) happen. Some events will still transpire the same because they are completely unrelated to the outcome of that scene. Killing the android won't have any effect on a plane crash happening or not, or your car breaking down.

I give that ridiculous example only because some old games *would* have things like that connect, even though they made no sense at all."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-17,"To me, every moment of the journey felt like the creators just thought up a bunch of interesting scenarios for Jodie to end up in and threw them all together without any care for the narrative structure. I also hate that my choices early on in the game had no effect on the rest of the game, unlike Heavy Rain."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Except those options available to you vary significantly based on who lived and who died.

There's a lot of stuff you can miss because you don't even think about it.  There's choices in a number of spots that I missed because I didn't find them and the game doesn't strive to force you to hit all of them."

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Yep, that was probably mission 1.  I'm betting on 3 main options:  robot rights negotiated, rebel in mass, things stay the same.

There might be some dialog referencing prior events, but for things like the girl you're going to see three options there too:  girl and android died, girl and android live, girl lives android dies.  Based on the trailer, there may not be a ""good"" they both live ending.

It feels immersive, but there's only so much you can do without things getting out of hand."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I think what you are explaining is how your decision could affect the rest of your game realistically.  Your examples of what could happen sound like a good way of changing a players experience.

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I mean, in terms of dumb things devs have said, this is far from the bottom, In a way from certain games perspectives game over is a failure. Dark souls, as an example, isn't game over, it's a whole other beast, and it is apart of the game, not the game over. In terms of the kind of game quantic makes, it is the devs fault if it's game over. Look at telltale for what i mean, the times you stuff up in that, more often than not it was an annoying thing, and you have to do it again, completely drawing you out of the experience, in Quantic's recent games, you screw something up, the story continues, your screw up is apart of the story, and hopefully they really grab a hold of that in Detroit, as in beyond two souls it didn't really change much."

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Not sure if I'm reading your response correctly so I'm just going to continue on...

I've noticed some things in Witcher 3 that I think do a good job on outcomes/repercussions. A lot of it is surprising until you look at it in hindsight, but I really enjoy it anyway. Problems can get worse than you were hoping, or an enemy you thought was a one-off comes back later because you didn't properly resolve the situation. 

I think it's important to at least hint to the player that in those situations, other outcomes were possible.

So I suppose I'm pushing for not only multiple immediate outcomes, but those outcomes leading to different future issues."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"> Look at telltale for what i mean, the times you stuff up in that, more often than not it was an annoying thing, and you have to do it again, completely drawing you out of the experience,

These situations are typically those where, if you fail, you die. 
It's a limitation of the medium as it is non-linear and not controlled entirely by the designer so there has to be compromise between gameplay and story. Cage's own games have ""game over"" states.

Minecraft: Story Mode is a bit of a laughing stock with how few ""game over"" states there are. QTE after QTE presents itself as vital and important and so many aspects try to fool you into thinking failure is dire but the game just keeps going despite intentional and repeated failure."

Honest question, how much are you expecting to be able to change?  Because, at least for me, it felt like I could change quite a bit in BTS.  I have a number of issues with the game and the writing, but the interactivity was well done to the point that you weren't always aware you were making a choice."

4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"It isn't lazy, it's the exact opposite.

It's a new, creative, and intelligent way to present stories that isn't possible anywhere else. That's why game developers normally don't present you with this much choice, because *they're* lazy and don't want to deal with the headache that is hundreds of different, branching storylines."
4nz16w,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I know your getting downvoted and I probably will too but honestly I never understood why anyone would play these types of games. It's not even like you are doing anything at all but watching stuff happen.

There are many things done fantastically individually (a lot of love into the beastiary, immaculate detail in set design areas, creative enemy/boss/NPC designs, gorgeous animations between chapters, etc), but as a whole feels… just ok?

The rest is rather cluttered empty space hindering mental mapping (actual map feels useless), key terms in skills aren’t explained, constant yet inconsistent invisible walls, combat feels dull with only a few bosses that warranted more than a single try (the secret loongs). Chapter 3 was a visual slog with snow and I’m hoping chapter 4 which is currently full of bug yaoguai (<3) will get me back into it. 

Didn’t help it came after playing Shadow of the Erdtree and Astro Bot this year, which were both spectacular or a complete joy from beginning to end. Haven’t felt the same from Wukong."

I love Poker, deckbuilding games, and Roguelikes. However, for me Balatro rarely feels like I'm actually playing Poker beyond the initial stages. Once the actual deckbuilding combos kick in, feels like it's very much on autopilot. 

Perhaps I didn't get far enough, but I enjoy the risk / hand management of trying to make particular hands, but I found that the game devolves into ""Play the same type of hand again and again to win""."

You have to set your party positioning before a battle you don't know might happen? Things take turns but last 1 minute? How so?

So I played 2 hours, got overwhelmed and left.

6 months later I came back after watching a guide about how to make a character OP, didn't follow it and created a fighter... and it is the best game I have ever played and I have over 200 hours in it and I'm going for a third run after this one.

Also... It's the only game I played TWICE as a good character and both times it felt different and amazing and I know there are at least a couple 2-3 or more kinds of storylines I could follow that would make it different again and I might try.

Phasmophobia - This is the one where I completely don't understand how it has appeal to anyone. Terribly boring, horrible production value, not scary in any way. It's a pretty good and interesting idea hampered by baffling design decisions (why is this game's ""jumpscare"" two slowly moving hands with no audio?), a walking speed that induces rapid-onset coma, and a need to have your 2nd monitor on the wiki?

  
Terraria - I don't hate this game, but other than the really cool progression, it feels like Relogic doesn't really know what they're doing. There's like a million things you can make and do, but there's very little cohesion between anything or explanation for how to get the best set ups.

  
Satisfactory - Again, really cool game, and I love Factorio and Minecraft, but my issue with this game is how huge the machines are. It's impossible to get an overview of your factory when you're at ground level and can't see over any of your huge machines."

I love everything about it *but* the combat.

The combat is so unbelievably terrible to me that it makes me feel legitimately sick to play. It's slow, unresponsive (at least on console), confusing, obtuse, and feels extremely poorly designed on *many* levels.

Which is weird since I liked Divinity Original Sin 1 and 2 enough, yet something about BG3 feels like a *severe* step down in both polish and usability in regards to the combat... I'm not sure if it's because DOS1&2 were made from the ground up mechanically to be an SRPG and BG3 was made from a D&D ruleset that wasn't, but I just can't play BG3 without the urge to vomit once combat begins. *Ever.*"

I actually have read plane scape torment book version and enjoyed it. But something about this kind of game doesn't sit right with me. It's like my brain is saying you are reading a book now while I wanted to play a game, so it's just hard to sit down and enjoy them when you can boot up red dead redemption instead and live a story instead of reading a half interactive one.


When you read a book you create the scenarios with UR imagination from the words you read, it's great, when you play a game you get teleported to that world, the world in video games is the main character, when you watch a movie you become a observer of the story being told, games like above destroys all of these for me, I can't imagine what I'm reading cause it's right there, drawn. I can't immerse myself cause the world needs my attention to drive the story by telling it to through walls of text, I can't be a observer cause I need to control part of the story. It's just a mess. Maybe that's why they are really few of these kind of games. And fewer that are well known/famous. "

Starbound was much easier for me to get into and enjoy largely due to the different way it approached those gameplay features. Clocked hundreds of hours in Starbound. Maybe a dozen in Terraria."

Honestly, this is kind of part of what I and many others I've spoken to like about Quantic Dream games. They're run of the mill concepts done sincerely, in a pretty okay fashion. They're just the computer game equivalent of the 'Choose Your Own Adventure' books I loved as a kid, and much like those books are primarily made as a novel way of getting kids into reading, QD games are a stepping stone for non gamers to enjoy games.

As an experienced gamer; The key to enjoying them is to not take them too seriously or expect too much of them, just as an experienced reader wouldn't read a CYOA book and expect Tolkien or Shakespeare.

Just engage in suspension of disbelief, immerse yourself, and enjoy them for what they are. There's worse ways to spend your time than just having dumb fun.

[They can also be a great laugh if you just deliberately fail the QTE's too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy44s_de15Y)"

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I've never understood the appeal of The Last of Us.


I like me a Zombies game as much as the next guy - it's the only mode I play in CoD, Telltale's Walking Dead is one of my favorite game series of all time, and I can always go for a quick game of Left 4 Dead or Zombies Ate My Neighbors... Whether it's for narrative, gameplay, or both, I tend to like the genre.


One thing about me that's consistent, though, is that I hate what I call ""manufactured"" cinematic styling - the perfect example being how I adore Red Dead Redemption (especially Undead Nightmare), but to this day can't stand 2. I don't like when desaturation, gruff acting, and ""movie-like"" scenes take priority over telling a decent story and playing well. It's like a TV drama that takes 40 hours to sit through as everything is dragged out.


The Last of Us is just that, cranked to the absolute maximum. I don't care about the characters, because the forced setting and style just reminds me of those awful episodes of The Walking Dead that I tried to sit through before I went screaming back to the comics. I played up until the first stealth section in a warehouse before I knew I didn't need to see any more.

I put about 15 hours into Hollow Knight before I gave up. As a Metroidvania it's ...fine? I don't think it's doing anything particularly groundbreaking for the genre. But what broke me was how stiff the movement felt, and I just couldn't get used to it. The jump feels more like like levitation because it has a fixed movement speed and your character has no inertia. Since no one else seems to have my problem, I'm guessing I'll feel the same about Silksong too.


And Stardew, which for a lot of people is there go-to cozy chill game, I found weirdly stressful because of the real-time clock and calendar. There was just this constant anxiety in the back of my mind that I wasn't using my days optimally and it completely ruined the relaxed experience."

I just couldn't get into it. Cut scene after cut scene after cutscene with barely any gameplay in between. Some 'gameplay' segments were like 30 seconds of walking down A street before about series of cut scenes. 

I got up to what I gather is the first boss. Huge extended fight through chaff through a building and then a yakuza lieutenant. Lost to him twice in a row and had to go through the entire extended fight again each time, before I decided I'd call it for the day. The next day - yesterday - I cracked my knuckles and loaded the game up again keen to give him another shot (i had enjoyed the miniscule gameplay id had) only for it to load me in several cut scenes before even the beginning of the extended fight. 

Games with 0 respect for my time get none of it. I immediately un-installed. Would have refunded it but I burned my 2 hours on cut scenes. I'm definitely not touching that franchise again.

Not denying that they’re good games, but I have gripes with each.

In RDR2, the slowness and “realistic” take on how you go about doing things in the world/moving just ruins it for me. I get thats what they’re going for but it just feels so janky and slow and frustrating to me to fight with controls constantly. mods probably fix it but tgeres just other things i could play.

I think Both gta and rdr2 also suffer from the weirdness of super linear levels contrasted with insanely open world designs. Nakey Jakey did a great vid on the topic years ago- but basically theres no emergent gameplay in the story missions, ever.

No interesting ways to solve a problem, just “go here, do exactly these things, and leave”

Conceptually, they're great, but I cannot stand all the too-long  'immersive' sit down, object fiddling, etc animations.

Most gamers don't have a lot contact with good storytelling, specially on scifi, since most of it is through games themselves or mainstream stuff like Marvel, DC and Star Wars. So DBH might dazzle by tackling subjects you won't normally see, even if it does poorly. Novelty goes a long way.

EDIT: Which is why take most media outlet's opinions on the story of a game with a grain of salt. Not only most of them probably don't know what good characterization and storytelling is, but they also blast through most of these games without having time to digest anything. Not only that, but what most people consider good ""storytelling and characterization"" mainly boils down to tropes and familiarity from mainstream hollywood movies, mostly easy to digest and ""pure entertainment"" (in their words) media. Which doesn't always overlap with compelling characters and story.

Want any more proof that I'm right than \[The Last of Us 2 SPOILERS\] >!Joel's death? Most people disregard the moral complexity involved in that narrative choice and only focus on the personal aspect of them liking the character and agreeing with Joel by default because for them, the protagonist = right. When, in fact, what Joel did was doom humanity out of selfishness, which is the point of the first game's thematic arc. ""Love doesn't always bring the best in us"", in Joel, it brought the worst. His lie at the end of TLOU1 cements that beyond a shadow of a doubt. Yet most gamers don't engage with TLOU1's ending critically, they take Joel's choice as morally correct, despite the game going through great lengths to dispel that notion.!<"

Give me more “collect all the things” 3D platformers. (Spyro. Yooka-Laylee. Super Lucky’s Tale.) Give me more “FPS puzzle games” (portal. Superliminal. Viewfinder.

Picked this up recently and generally I like open world survival games (Valheim and Enshrouded are some of my most played games.) I'm not sure if it's how tedious it is to build or the fact that there is very little direction given. Trying to figure out how to craft things and then when you do figure it out, it's not noted somewhere so you have to remember the recipe yourself (or look it up outside of the game, I guess.) Only being able to carry a few of certain items and buildings can take several times the amount you can carry so you're running back and forth carrying two logs at a time to build a crappy little hut or something. May be one of those that is better with a friend as you can have one person gathering while the other builds but solo it just felt really tedious and I wanted to spend my time playing something else after a short time."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah, it's not great if your friend is using you as a construction bot"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I have friends who do this with new games all the time and it’s so infuriating. Either they just tell you to be their assistant and you learn nothing, or they give you high tier gear in a survival game so you didn’t earn anything and you have no idea how progression works and don’t feel any of the satisfaction of reaching that point in the game. Makes you want to just drop the game immediately."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Had the same experience with Satisfactory. My friends wanted to do a co-op game, but they’d already played before. So they knew everything, had discovered everything, and I just wandered around feeling dumb. "
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I absolutely hate when people do this. It's why when I start playing a new mp game, I REFUSE to join others when asked to. Need to learn it myself first."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Me when my buddies who are already hundreds of hours deep into Diablo or a MMO want me to play with them.

I’ve found very few games enjoyable where myself or friends already had a good grasp on it before the other started. Sucks all the fun out of the discovery of the game."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I think the thing with DST is you sort of need to have a good grasp on the base game first with or without the DLC. DS vanilla and RoG both give a good understanding of what is needed, while Shipwrecked is the general setting for DST. 

I think it was a mistake on the devs part to release DST as a multiplayer standalone that required an understanding of how to play the base game that is sold separately"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I call games like that “wiki games”. Where a lot of game knowledge is never told to the player and it expects you to solely learn through doing. Except much of it is stuff you’d never think to actually do yourself, and you are missing out if you don’t scroll through the wiki’s and guides.

Terraria is one. Minecraft has become one as well. There are more but I’m tired lol"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,[removed]
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"This game is weird. It sells itself like a fun game to play together, so I got it with my kid, and the co op mechanics are abysmal. Someone dies? Good fucking luck respawning them, and I'm sure that's just the surface, but finding out reviving a friend is no small task was a huge turnoff to this game."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I'd say this only applies to modern DST with the way is going. The game is (was?) a survival game first and foremost, with the way you progress is dying and learning from that death with your friends."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"It stressed me out too much - I was so worried about surviving the first few days to leave the camp, while my bf went off exploring. Every time I wandered away from camp there was too much going on that I just couldn’t understand so I couldn’t contribute to our progress. 

We stopped playing a couple hours in after he needed my help fighting one of the monsters and I still didn’t have a good enough understanding of the game to be any use. He got pissed at me, I was frustrated with the game in general so we decided that’s not one for us to play together again…"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"100%.  Few friends and I bought the game and we all ended up returning it because we had no fucking idea wtf was going on and what we should be doing.  Did some googling around and it was guide this, guide that, and watch this youtube video.  We ain't got time for all that."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"My gf straigh up said you need to play with someobe who already knows what the fuck they are doing, or the game is just too frustrating lol"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I really want to love stellaris, but it’s one of the first games I just don’t *get*. I’ve gotten games and not liked them, like dark souls. But stellaris, I’ve watched hour long videos and still can’t conquerer another civilization successfully. I gave up, no amount of encouragement or telling me “bro all you have to do ia manage pops and…”  - nothing will help me."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Honestly I did not expect DST in popular reddit feed today.

I am not exactly a DST veteran, but there has been this opinion in its community that the game has gone ""soft"", so it is quite refreshing to see the game had and still has been torturing new players. I was in the same camp two years ago, and it was a really painful initial experience. I started with a friend, both knew nothing going in, and we played for a while. We were too afraid to go really far out of our comfort zone, so we quit after a while.

Even now, after going through the entire game contents several times, I still die to the most dumb, preventable thing. Dying is the norm in DST, even if it makes me feel frustrated every time. And I believe the game really goes out of its way to drive this point home, so seeing people downvote similar claims pains me, I have to say.

Oh yeah, saying DST is a wiki game is absolutely valid lol. I can understand why that could turn people off. It doesn't really help when its wikis (either fandom or .gg) aren't exactly maintained with such care that Terraria .gg wiki or Stardew Valley wiki has. I wish I could help with that but I a not exactly confident in my DST knowledge, sadly"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Honestly I treat most survival games like they are rogue likes 

I restart and do better with a better grasp on the game "
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I'd be more fine with all the obscure mechanics if inventory management wasn't so awfully tedious.  
Only 9 slots per chest so you inevitably end up with an array of chests filled with random shit. All the clicking and picking up and putting down stuff. You can make a backpack but that also occupies your armor slot..."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Sekiro I had to actively focus on learning combat. Dark souls and elden ring were pretty straightforward but sekiro was like playing basketball in a pool with bowling ball.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I loved Elden Ring so I tried Sekiro and hated it. Elden Ring was fun to figure out, I never had fun trying to figure out Sekiro"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Im still waiting for the next sekiro :(
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,This is mine as well. Coupled with DS3. I love Elden Ring and thought I would like DS3. Nope because skill issue. A friend told me Sekiro was vastly different and I tried it. I actually beat a couple of bosses but I always end up leaving the game super stressed to the point it's not enjoyable to play anymore.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I always say I don't like Soulslike games and the fans always respond with ""Skill issue""

Their brain breaks when I'm just like ""Yep. It's too hard and I don't wanna put in the time."" They just don't know how to respond at that point lol"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Same here, and I like Soulslike games. I just… hate parrying. I’m allergic to the conventional block button. The only exception is Bloodborne, and I suspect it has to do with the ‘parry’ being shooting someone in the face instead of timing a block or redirect"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah, my problem with Sekiro is that you have to play the game how it demands. There's no moment of falling into a certain playstyle, like in Dark Souls or Elden Ring. You have one primary weapon and one reliable way of taking out enemies. I want to like the game, but I just can't click with the gameplay."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Hesitation is defeat
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Got to lady butterfly and put it down. That was when it was released
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Sekiro turns many people away at first. It’s normal because it has a very steep but short learning curve. Give it another try, watch a few YouTube vids if you have to. When it clicks, it will be a game changer."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I flunked out on the first try. Then later, after I played Jedi Fallen Order, the combat made sense and I had a great time with it."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I finished Sekiro and got the true ending and then decided I just wasn’t enjoying myself playing those anymore. Literally beat it out of spite
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Moba can be good if you start early in the life cycle. The older it gets, the more the global player base expects everyone to be good. Plus there's a million characters to understand. 
They have a massive barrier of entry and stepping back is very fine "
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I don't think anyone really likes playing dota. At least that's my opinion after playing 3333 hours
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,HotS was fun
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I played the original dota on w3 till dota2, quit recently (after 25 years) . Don't do it kids."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"In my opinion, dota is the most fun and challenging game to play ever. The tactical depth is so immense, that you can just keep on learning and perfecting, even after thousands of hours. With 4 other friends nothing comes close to the fun and tension you feel in a game where everybody knows what they’re doing, its like a symphony. Problem is that you’ll have to play 2000 hours to get to that point and for many it’s been the only game they’ve played for the last 10 years, so it’s impossible to catch up now. Smurf’s and toxicity make the game unplayable if you’re starting out now."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Don't do DotA. Try drugs instead.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,It's glorified tag.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Honestly I loved the game earlier on, but I liked playing from a stealth and hiding tactic. Then they killed that by making every map so damned bright and trashing all the stealth perks.

I loved their game Deathgarden too, but that one just straight up died."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I had to go check…as a player with a little over 1k hrs I’m thinking there’s absolutely no way DBD is overwhelmingly positive. 

And thank god…it’s not. DBD is a huge mix of toxic and fun but with heavy skill issues separating the two ends. Of you’re bad/good and the other side is the opposite, that breeds the toxicity."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,The secret is that it's not a horror game. It's a pvp game with characters from the horror genre
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Dead by Daylight isn't a horror game. Once you figure that out, then you can start working on what kind of game it actually is, and once you figure *that* out you can decide if you like it. For killer especially at high levels it's a time management and decision simulator that is pretty tightly tuned. Good survivors will often outright bully killers who don't know when to break off chases."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"DbD scratches an itch for competitive people 1st, and horror fans 2nd or even 3rd.

I have 1.2k hours on the game and I stopped getting scared in my first couple hundred hours. Beyond that, I'm not much of a fan of horror franchises, but I do think the game has a good design team, making the general setup of the game (maps, characters, lore) very appealing to me, despite horror not being my cup of tea.

Add to this the killer variety and gameplay loop and it's an enjoyable and fun experience to me. But, again, I think a lot of horror fans will be turned off by the fact that it's a very competitive game, although I do think it can be very enjoyable with a group of friends that also like horror, plus the game is super cheap."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"My friend who's obsessed with it also made it perfectly clear how grindy and absurdly buggy the game is, plus toxic community only out-turded by mobas. I don't even know why he tolerates it."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,">so many people play it and act like it's the best thing ever known to mankind

Bruh... you haven't seen a single soul act like it's the best."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"It’s definitely NOT the best thing to happen to mankind it’s actually on par with league of legends to being one of the worst things to happen (I have almost 1000 hours in the game) 

But it when it came out it was definitely a change to what we are used to seeing in multiplayer games. "
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,that game isn't Overwhelmingly Positive as the OP stated in the title.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Honestly DbD is one of those games completely gutted by the community. I loved it when it first came out because it scratched both itches - playing the defenseless, stealth based survivor and the powerful hunter. I liked bouncing back and forth and had my mains for both sides. But the fans have just ruined it, especially the survivor fans. I've been in games where they play beyond stupidly, I punish them for it and they send me bitch out messages. I just can't with that community."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"This is the one for me. On paper it’s something I’d obsess over, but the many times I try to get into it I just wander around and can’t manage to do anything enjoyable. I know it’s one of those games where you make your own objectives but I just can’t be compelled to really see what the world has to offer 

It’s a shame cause I love the premise and the aesthetic, and when watching videos it seems like so much fun, but when I actually play I don’t last an hour before losing interest."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Took me 3 times to get into that game. The first two times I couldn't get past the first hour or two. The third time...I dunno, it just clicked. Now I have a couple hundred hours in it lol."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I normally love games like kenshi, but I just couldn't get it to click, either. I think it's a little too janky for me."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I love kenshi, I hope kenshi 2 has more quality of life stuff."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Totally understandable. Its an incredibly hard sell, as much as it is an incredible game"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"God i love kenshi... it's so damn addicting. I have over 600 hours in it and god knows how many corpses under my belt. The mods that make the world and factions more alive make it 10x as fun, also some good ""almost"" total-conversions. I love how you develope your own story as you go along. *Beep*"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"i’ve put a ton of hours into it, but eventually just hit this wall of “ah shoot i need to rebuild half my factory to scale up” which is actually something i see every day working in tech so that basically ruined the fun.."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Perhaps Satisfactory would be more your speed. It doesn't have the constant threat of attack like Factorio. I just sit there and watch shit go by on converyor belts sometimes, and it gives me weird dopamine."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I enjoy it up until trains and expanding and then I usually quit. Enjoy it until then tho
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I played Factorio for probably 16 to 20 hours a day for three straight weeks. Then I started having dreams about it which I wouldn't call nightmares but the game seriously rewrote parts of my brain and everything was processed through a Factorio lens. Everything was about logistics and efficiency and conveyor belts. Like my entire subconscious and everything in it was literally the game. It was bizarre and frustrating like weird half awake fever dreams and I'd have to wake myself up and shake it off. It was legitimate torture. 

I've been very hesitant to play again."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Definitely understandable. I'm a huge fan of HK but even I myself wouldn't even want to repeat the game anymore - not because it's bad, but because of all the trauma this game has given me esp the 'White Palace' area (you have to be really, really good at it or be precise with all your moves to survive)."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I felt the same, which is weird because I *loved* the Ori games, which are of a similar genre."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Weirdly hollow knight was really influential to my genre likes by teaching me to just Not. Freaking. Panic. during boss fights. It ate my lunch for a while and then I did a lot better after just approaching it differently.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"couldn't get into hollow knight for years, one day it just clicked for me. definitely recommend trying again."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I've tried on multiple occasions as well.

For me, it isn't that the game is hard.  I'm glad it doesn't hold my hand.  I just get annoyed that it actively punishes me for dying.

I play Super Meat Boy, die, respawn, then try again.  I play Hollow Knight, die, then carefully make my way back to the boss I was just fighting to recover my stuff, die again, then repeat."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I love Metroidvanias, but what I've found is that I enjoy smaller, more dense maps. In Hollow Knight, I felt like I just walked and walked and nothing really happened and I had no idea where I was."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I completed the Hollow Knight and it left me with a bit of a puzzled review. It was decent at best for me.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I love starting ONI runs. But it very quickly hits a level of complexity that I can't, and frankly, do not want to manage. I wish some systems were slightly less complex. 

I am the kind of person who absolutely would enjoy figuring out how to disperse my heat, etc. I just am not an engineer so I lose the plot half way through trying and die."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"ONI definitely has a steep learning curve, and it’s not for everyone. However, if you can manage to overcome it, it’s without a doubt one of the best games I have played. Clocked around 500 hours on it, and I still do some runs here and there."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Honestly fair. I've got almost 700 hours in, and I love it. However it is not very new player friendly and the way forward can be really unclear in a lot of cases."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"If you play it expecting 2D Minecraft then you will be disappointed.

It's a 2D fantasy adventure. Game plays more like Noita than minecraft"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I liked the gameplay but I genuinely can't see a damn thing I'm doing. I feel like it doesn't zoom in enough.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Same, the 2d world just doesn't give the same sense of exploration and wonder that I get with Minecraft having a 3d one"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"It's one of those games where the gameplay itself is just sorta serviceable, not bad not amazing. It's the story people have fallen in love with. No game has made me cry quite so many different ways as Spiritfarer."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I personally found the slowness and peacefulness of the game to be the appeal. You can’t really fail at anything. I would have probably got bored if the music, art direction, and characters weren’t as good though. It’s the definition of a cozy game to me. I can kick back and take it easy while playing. I do agree that you can easily get lost though. It would help if there was a bit more direction."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I love the style and feel of the game. But once you get to wood type 3, mineral type 6, production building 7, spirit #10, island #21 it just felt repetitive."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Spiritfarer, like Outer Wilds and few others mentioned here, aren't meant to be played like most games. Most games you can grind out and some of them are fantastic the whole way through.

Spiritfarer is literally play for an hour here, play for an hour there and enjoy the art, characters and story. There's no time limits, no health, you can't lose. Its a cozy game thats meant to be sipped, not gulped."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Personally the game hit different when you experienced and saw the type of grief people goes through that the characters experienced.

But gameplay wise it is really repetitive no doubt about it"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Similar, it took me several tries. I just found the combat system so klunky."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I loved the Witcher 3. I think it suffers from the first few hours being considerably more boring than the rest of the game.

It doesn't start well at all.

I'm sure it's still not for everyone, but the first few hours of the game are nowhere near as good as the rest and that really doesn't help it."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Yep same here. Took me my fourth try a year or two apart until finally it clicked for me. That game ended up being so damn good. I never played the DLC though because loading it up makes me the same way all over again and it’s hard to start
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,[deleted]
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Idk man I enjoy it. Minecraft specifically it's fun to build farms and manage chests upon chests of resources and then build something pretty to cover the giant redstone mess. It's best played on a server with like minded individuals imo. Singleplayer is kinda boring unless you have specific goals or the world is short term
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I can't believe how far down this is. Everyone I know loves this game and I feel like I'm too old to get it or something.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I remember when Undertale first released, the community was so insufferable that I refused to play it out of spite"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,100% I saw someone on here say that Balatro has done well because of a “hype train” like the hype train doesn’t exist with out the people that like that type of game enjoying it
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28," I fondly remember the X-play scale

1/5 - no one should play this

2/5 - a bit rough but if it's your kind of thing you might enjoy it

3/5 - a good game for people that enjoy this kind of thing

4/5 - this thing's great, if you like any of these genres check it out

5/5 - everyone should at least take a look"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Yes... that's the point of the thread
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I was really into Stardew Valley and Dredge was fine for a while. I could not get into Dave the Diver at all even though I've played a similar style 'gather ingredients all day and run restaurant all night's type game before and absolutely loved it. Maybe just not enough restaurant management for my liking. 
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Loved Dave the Diver. I didn’t care for the story or the whole second half of the game. I just want to fish so I can run a sushi restaurant.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Dredge had the advantage of not overstaying its welcome. The total playtime isn’t that long and it wraps up right around the time you start to get tired of playing it.

Dave the Diver and Stardew Valley on the other hand just keep going on… and on… and on… for-fucking-ever. Both are good games that I got more than my moneys worth out of in terms of enjoyment but there’s no way I will ever finish either of them."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Was so invested in the start for Dave The Divers first 3 hours then my interest just plummeted instantly was quite sad tbh really started strong
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I played a lot of Dredge. I think it is just short enough so that the gameplay loop doesn’t become tedious. Also the lovecraftian ambiance/mystery paired with the anxiety mechanics at night helped keep my attention.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Damn, just beat Dave the Diver last week! It was so much fun! I was hooked for days until I finished it. But yeah, not every game is for everyone"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,My problem with Stardew Valley is how quickly it becomes about NOT farming
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Dredge was very fun. Then less fun but by then the game was almost over. So I just finished it.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,No game has ever given me motion sickness quite like Outer Wilds… even with all the accessibility settings enabled.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"For me, it wasn't the flying, but the loop itself. I hated the time pressure, and I hated hated *hated* getting to the point where I could see what I needed to do to progress, hitting the end of the loop and having to start over, and having to rush back to that place so I could progress things before the loop ended again.  Tried playing twice, a few years apart, got several hours in each time and realised not only wasn't I having any fun, but I was actually getting increasingly annoyed. Gave up and spoilered myself, and absolutely love the concept on a meta level. I just can't get anything out of actually playing it."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I was not having a good time at Brittle Hollow, just kept falling into the blackhole which was terrifying or having to reset coz I explored it ""wrong"". Eventually the game clicked for me but I remember being really frustrated that I'll have to wait for the reset and do everything all over again"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I watch a lot of streams and lets plays of it because it's one of my favorites, and one of the most common pain points I've noticed re: ship controls is people not understanding how physics work in a zero g environment. Your ship doesn't have brakes and isn't going to come to a rolling stop. If you full thrust accelerate for 5 seconds, it takes 5 seconds of full thrust reverse to come to a stop.

The other common struggle is not recognizing the direction that the cockpit is facing relative to the rest of the ship."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I felt the same. But then I discovered the landing camera view, and suddenly the controls were intuitive. No more fighting the ship and endless crashing"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I picked this game up for an hour, thought it looked crappy and the controls were hard, so I stopped playing. Picked it up later and it ended up being one of my favorite games. But yeah, fair criticism. I learned to make heavy use of the match velocity control when flying."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I started it, enjoyed it for a bit. Got bored, put it down for a week or so and then decided i need to finish it before i forget what i have learned. Once i did beat it, i actully realized i enjoyed it. Never gonna play it again, but ya."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Same here, plus the time limit gave me anxiety every time."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I think people not getting a handle on the mechanics is a fair criticism of OW. I was good at it and would still hit moments of frustration as I completely biffed a landing or flew straight into something.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Def better with friends
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Didn't do anything for me too, even with friends. Felt like a lot of the same with no real rewards to earn."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Took me a while to get into it. Played through every misson type solo to get a feel for things, then did the assignment that unlocks the hardest generic difficulty level, *then* I matched with other ppl.

Hazard 5 with randos is where the true fun exists. Just Rocking and Stoning with us 4 dwarves versus a near-relentless world of bugs. Like an unstoppable force. Like a bottomless stomach for beer. Like a DWARF. ⛏️"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"For me, I found it incredibly stressful. You get there and there is so much to do on the farm, and the clock is ticking, and the game is having you spend a bunch of time going into town, and yeah, that clock is still ticking away creating a lot of pressure.

I've had people tell me that the clock doesn't actually matter much, but I just found it all really anxiety inducing (which is funny, since it is supposed to be a chill, relaxing game)"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,You obviously never checked out the mines. You can spend hours in there fighting monsters and collecting treasure.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,the mining?
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I think Rune Factory 4 would be worth a try if you still like the farming/crafting aspect and want dungeons/boss battles at the same time.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"In Stardew Valley, I found the constant ticking clock of night and day super stressful since I felt like every second I was trying to figure something out was time I wasted not doing something else to progress my gameplay. I didn't get why a lot of folks find it to be a relaxing or fun game."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"You can basically ignore the farm and Speedrun to the mines, and after that the desert dungeon. Didn't hold my interest either way."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Surprised this one wasn't mentioned sooner. Took me a good three tries to get going, but eventually clicked and now I cannot fucking wait for the sequel. Still listen to Low Roar weekly, if not daily, and about to start a full new play-through. 

It's one I totally understand that people don't get though. There are large parts that are just Fedex in the Apocolypse if you are a completionist type. It's also like putting down the controller and watching a full length movie at times, but if you find the vibe of the game, there's not a lot out there like it and there's something there that keeps drawing me back to it."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"That's a game that's not for everyone. You either love it or hate it, I haven't really seen an in between. The people who do love it, myself included, love the shit out of it. But we all know it just ain't for everyone and that's ok. We all have our preferences."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Wasn’t feeling it at first but I was willing to give Kojima the benefit of the doubt. Something happened around 16hrs in where I got really addicted to setting up really efficient paths and shortcuts around the map. Ended up putting about 70hrs into it and am looking forward to the sequel.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Chapter 4 is unfortunately even worse level design wise. Won't spoil anything but there are areas you end up exploring that have zero visual landmarks and can be easy to get lost in. 

I enjoyed the spectacle of wukong but the level design is atrocious after the first two chapters."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"BMW is probably overhyped as it's a rare game about Chinese mythology that's well ported to the western audience, and to be fair, they nailed the aesthetics 

but yeah as someone familiar with the Wukong story since a child, the gameplay itself is just ok for me"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I think a lot of us feel that way. The initial idea is interesting but all of the mechanics end up feeling really shallow. You expect a good rogue like to have some really crazy feeling combos that you look forward to finding. But it just felt like the weapons were the weapons and that was about it
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I totally get that. For me, someone who didn’t grow up with video games and is a newb at it all, the combat was perfect for me. Not so challenging that I got annoyed, but just hard enough that I felt accomplished after beating a boss. Granted, I wouldn’t say the combat was hard for me, just that it was accessible. Far too many games assume I have mastery at the controls way sooner than I actually do, and it gets frustrating for me. But I can see why Cult of the Lamb would feel disappointing to someone more adept at gaming."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Currently got minimal free time with work dedications and picked up Balatro really enjoying it as a ""pick up and play for an hour"" type of game but can't imagine I'd be able to manage long sessions with it"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Best played on phones
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I agree. I play a lot of roguelikes and felt like Balatro was quite honestly pretty ok but nothing to go crazy about. And then 5 months later I see everyone talking about it like the second coming of Jesus and I was very surprised

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"You don't need to optimise straight up, the first half is manually feeding shit to get science going to get tech to make life easier, your first base is only a starter, build from there."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I enjoy satisfactory a lot and can say it doesn’t matter, at all, how efficient your factories are. It’s all in your head. The only thing that matters for the game is  progression. Efficiency is overrated.  If you think of it as a hobby you can come back to rather than a game you have to 100% it’s a lot more chill."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Overwhelming perfectionism absolutely murders this game for me. A lot of people say to embrace the spaghetti, but it feels so gross having to live amongst an ADHD brainchild factory. 

I haven't played it in a few months and I haven't even finished my first save. But maybe I'll get around to it. I hear it's more enjoyable once you use a main bus set up so everything feels a lot cleaner."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Outer Wilds is a game that lives or dies based on your own curiosity. If you're overwhelmed or nothing interests you out of the gate then it just falls flat. The whole point of the game (and where it really excels) is fostering and rewarding exploration. It's in seeing something and asking yourself, ""I wonder what's over there,"" or ""I wonder what *that* means,"" and trying to find the answer. The game is fantastic at laying out threads for you to follow *if you want to*.


But the threads are just there. If you're not interested at picking at them then all the rest of the game is really just...stuff. Stuff floating in space without much of a purpose and to no particular end. If you don't follow them, you'll only ever see a collection of loose threads and not the intricate tapestry they create. "
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I think the problem is that the tutorial section was not mandated, which makes you think it is a open world space exploration game, when in reality the game is more linear than you think.


If you talk to everyone and everything at the beginning, it actually gives you a hint to ""where you *should* go next"""
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Same, I ""beat"" he first two maps, and felt, ok yup, I'm done, too repetitive."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"> It was a lot of fun for a few hours

Luckily its so cheap that even if you only get a few hours out of it, its still a pretty good value proposition."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I love rhythm games, but I was really surprised how much I didn't really gel with high fi rush at all. I didn't like any of the music or the mechanics.

I much preferred metal Hellsinger or BPM"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,It was GOTY for me on the first level. Then I realized it was the same boring formula from there on out. I couldn't finish it.

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I love the idea of Shovel Knight, but I don't care to actually play the game nowadays. I always forget how long the levels are."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Terraria is different than the other games you listed in that it is not a metroidvania and doesn't require any difficult platforming maneuvers. You can get short term flight after not long + the grappling hook early makes the platforming much easier.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"This was me for the longest time until I *finally* reached the portion of the game where you meet the Bloody Baron. That’s where the game finally clicked for me. 

It took 3 tries, and even on my replay I stopped playing twice until I reached the Baron again."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I own this game on almost every storefront including TW1 and TW2. However for the life of me I cannot seem to get into it. I've installed it probably 8 times and always within two hours I just alt-f4 and move on.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"It never landed for me either, got past the Baron section and just kind of stopped.  World ending crisis is the least of everyone's concerns, there's great stories here and there but time and time again you help people out just for it to be ""the princess is in another castle."" Type deal."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Oh man, I played it because I wanted to understand why hunting robots was a thing. Once you get to... The tower (avoiding spoilers), you find out what happened. And the game explodes with exposition. 


I tell people, play to the top of the tower. If you aren't into it by then, you aren't into it."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"See HZD was the first ever game that combat felt like a puzzle and not just button mashing because the animals were mechanical.  The shoot off this part before you do this part then trip them and do some other cool thing, all made combat fun for me.   But I can see it's not everyones cup of tea."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I had a feeling RimWorld would be in here somewhere, but I'm glad I had to scroll this far to find it. It's one of my absolute favorite games"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I have convinced everyone I know to like Rimworld by doing one thing: The first time you play, play on the easiest difficulty with the easiest storyteller.

Also, turn off the DLCs. So two things, I guess :P.

If your colony fails when you know what you're doing, it's fun. It isn't enjoyable when it fails and you don't know what's happening."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I love the game, but it's a ""you love it or hate it.* Kinda game."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I love this game and if it wasn't for the recommendation of a friend prob wouldn't have gotten into it.

but I 100% understand on why it's not a good game for A LOT of people.

it basically is a novel simulator but i'm also a sucker for a good game universe and political theory."

So I've not played beyond the point where you have to run some errands for a boss - like man sitting in a office made of shipping containers. I bought this game probably 3 years ago haha.....

Its not like its the only good game on my backlog but its the most notable one considering how much I liked it yet I haven't finished it even once."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Kinda same. I've beat all 3 dark souls games, but Eleden Ring after a while became straight up boring to me. Never finished it."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I think the cyberpunk rating is left over from when the game first launched, it was a buggy mess"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Just use steamdb and you can filter by rating.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I’d articulate it as that the game is more about finding a game breaking combo and exploiting that than it is the moment to moment tactics.

That in turn tends to scoop you into a single hand type. It’s especially true for straights and flushes, which a number of cards either highly reward or make easier.

I think the real game of Balatro is played out in the blind play vs reward decisions, and in the between-blind stores. The blinds themselves are just where you get to find out if you chose wisely during the important parts."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I didn't like it on the PC but I LOVED it on my phone. It feels so much better as a pick up and play for a bit on the go or on the can for me. I then got so into it, I went back and play it here and there on the PC."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"> rarely feels like I’m actually playing poker

…well that’s because you’re not"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"It's not really poker like at all. It's just poker themed. Yeah, you make the poker hands but poker is about the betting around the hands."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"It stays at that pace for the entire game. Many times I felt like I was playing a horse-riding simulator. I finished it and liked it a lot, but will probably never play through it again."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"DBH's writing is pretty mediocre and most of the symbolism is incredibly ham fisted, but the amount of different paths you can take is really impressive. For years, those types of ""choice-based"" games railroaded you into one of a few endings. DBH offers a surprising amount of ways to change the story."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"While I liked it overall, I'm somewhat shocked Detroit become human is OW on steam."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Heavy Rain has the most down to earth hilarious voice acting I have ever seen with your son sounding like a 40 year old Slavic man and Ethan constantly sounding like he has marshmallows in his mouth. Detroit I think I dislike more as has a good idea with the income and equality storyline they set up in the first act, Then they just go for the clunky civil war era racism storyline which will bait more awards. It had so much more potential imo but David Cage gotta David Cage"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I love so much about Risk of rain 2, but man I just wish somehow the runs felt more different to each other. Because everything else is so good"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,You’re definitely incorrect about there not being a lot of unlocks and progress. You have to unlock most of the good jokers and vouchers by playing the game different ways
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Honestly, you should probably stop trying, it sound likeit's not the game for you. Outer wilds depends a lot on your curiosity for the events in the game. \
You could try to watch a playthrough to experience the story anyway"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I've started skyrim like 10 times. Can't do it. I get maybe 10 hours into it at most and then I'm done.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I've played it for nearly 20 and I still don't get it. I can see why people might like it but it's not for me..
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"An hour really isn't enough experience most of the gameplay with what a huge game Skyrim is and all the different things you can do in it, but if the game just didn't pull you in I still understand

I still go back to it this day despite playing it for over a decade because there's always some new way to play that I haven't tried"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,This is a pretty strong point. A lot of games with the highest positive rating on Steam are games you'd only come across and pay money for if you knew it was a top tier game for your favorite niche in gaming.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"https://steamdb.info/stats/gameratings/

That applies to some of them sure, but some of the highest rated steam games are among the most popular on the platform"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Same reason vegan restaurants are the highest rated among all restaurants.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I actually loved this game a lot so I guess YMMV. I think it tells a story in the best way games can - not through scripted dialog, but by the actions the player takes and the things they experience."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,[deleted]
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah it's been on my steam wishlist for a while, but like... it's a bad port of a 10+ year old game, and it's priced like a brand new AAA title. At this point, I'd rather just watch the show, I can't imagine the game is better than that."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"“ Just felt like any other phone game to me minus the Gacha stuff”

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,It is.  Which why I was so surprised to discover how much I like it.  I guess the characters and story kept me in?
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"To be fair, that's literally one of the defining points of the genre. 


Combat loop aside though, it's astounding just how *deep* the NPC interactions go in that game. I dumped so, SO many hours into that game, escaped the underworld multiple times, and started progressing through the heat system before finally moving onto other games and I was STILL getting new dialog and lore with each run/death. It genuinely blows my mind how much that game keeps giving you. Barring some Cyberpunk-level catastrophe, Hades 2 will be an instant buy as soon as it's out of Early Access and Supergiant has firmly established itself as one of the best studios currently producing games IMHO. "
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I completed it, still don’t like it. I loved Hollow Knight"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I totally get it but I really think it’s one of the best Metroidvanias ever. 

I mean, the fact the game looks like that and is 80MB is actually insane."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Well it wasn't dunkey's studio but he did publish it. It was just one guy overall who made the game called Billy Basso.

What I loved about the game is how it doesn't hold your hand , and how unconventional it is as a game . Most metroidvanias work on powerups , which animal well does to an extent, but a lot of times the solution is just to use those objects in a more creative way. And I'm big into secrets , ARG and stuff like that so probably why I loved it so much. 

And it's like 30 mb with all the fancy effects , it's crazy"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Same for me. I played the first, I dunno. Ten hours? It was incredibly beautiful, and such a technical and artistic achievement. But playing it was just plain not fun. It felt like a chore to do everything. If you had to put it down for a week because you were busy, coming back felt overwhelming because there were complex controls for everything. I didn’t find anything about it enjoyable other than looking at it. There have been other games with uneven gameplay I’ve played purely for the joy of exploring and the story (like The Witcher 3) but I didn’t even want to keep playing Red Dead 2 for the plot because I found the actual playing of the game so unbearable."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,agreed. mechanically 90% of the game is mashing x and other than that it feels like a mildly boring TV- show with the weakness of your hands being occupied while watching it
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"God I tried, I really fucking tried. Bored me to tears and the controls were beyond awful."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Agreed. Playing it felt like watching paint dry. Incredibly beautiful and well-made paint, but paint none the less."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I think it's a game that's purposely drawn out to make you appreciate the scenery. Personally I found the best way to play it is in very small doses, if you need to get ready for bed for work the next day it wont overstimulate you. If you play it as a relaxing horse riding simulator and not a blockbuster movie, you might have a chance at enjoying it for what it is.

 The first time I played it I was too impatient and hated how long it took and all the eating/cleaning guns/mounting horses animations. I played it recently with a new perspective and finally started to enjoy it."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,This is the only wild take I’ve seen so far. Legit loved that game haha
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Biggest dumpster fire M+KB controls I have ever witnessed and super boring gameplay.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"The tiny UI on the console release really turned me off hard. I heard it got better after a patch, but I never went back."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"The combat flows much better when you learn to dance with your enemies. But yeah, general movement sucks."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I'm coming at it from a different angle: Stardew Valley is just so *limited* in what you can do. 

What a lot of people don't get is that Harvest Moon, the game that inspired SDV, still exists as a franchise. There are 20+ HM/Story of Seasons games (Name change, long story) with ~30 years of development and refinement behind them. It even has a spinoff series, Rune Factory.

And most of those games have so many more features as standard that SDV requires mods for, it's ludicrous. Rune Factory 3 already introduced transporting anywhere on the map *9 years before SDV was released* and you need mods to do that in SDV. 

So yeah, my main problem with the game is that it's a farm game from 2005 despite the genre having 15-20 years of experimentation and improvement since."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I’ve been a massive fan of the souls like genre since DS1 and I felt bad to a certain degree how much hype Elden Ring got because a lot of my friends got caught up in it and realized that type of game just wasn’t for them. It’s a niche for a reason you have to enjoy spending hours on a single boss doing potentially just marginally better each attempt till you scrape out a win. It’s a shame a lot of the community acts like people who dislike it are just people who couldn’t “get good”, it’s just not for everyone even though I love it."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Firewatch is a weird game for me. I know I played it. I'm pretty sure I played through the whole game in one two sittings. I don't remember *anything* about it. Not the gameplay, not the story, nothing. I just know that I've definitely played it."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Honestly until roughly 6 months ago, I would agree with you. But then I said f it, saw it on 2$ on steam and was like why not try it again and went in fresh with no expectations knowing what will happen and in the second play through I got it

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah I enjoyed Firewatch, but it’s not as profound as people make it out to be"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"This game didn’t know what it wanted to be. 

Spoilers:

>!It starts off all spooky mystery like - *who’s cutting the wires? Where did the teenagers go?* Then it’s all romance drama with the other firewatch woman. Then it’s sci-fi spookiness with the government. Then it just kind of…ends?!<

I didn’t get it."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I wanted to love KC:D, but got too frustrated with the annoying save system. Games like this *need* quick save functionality. I hate playing for an hour and then the game crashes or I die to some random overpowered bandit that came from nowhere or I accidentally hit the wrong key and pickpocket a guard... and I've lost all that progress because you can't save when you want to.

I get that it was supposed to be ""immersive"", but all it means is that I feel forced to go and replay all that stuff I did for another hour just to get back to where I was before the game crashed. And then later on you can just brew or buy as many save points (saviour schnapps) as you want, so why are we just punishing players at the start of the game? It makes no sense if you think about it, but people love to rave about how immersive it is to be unable to save the game when you want to.

I might eventually play this again, but it'll be on PC with mods to let me save the game."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"This is the one for me, but not surprised I had to scroll this far to find it. But I also think I'm just not a fan of roguelikes in general."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"> Most survival games really. Dont Starve, Stardew Valley, etc.

I agree with the survival game thing. I've never really seen the appeal and many of these end up being forced multiplayer which I'm really not into. 

But Stardew Valley is *not* a survival game. It's a fun farm-builder where you plant crops and water them and harvest them, buy animals that you milk and shear and... collect their feet?! Ummm. But yeah, no survival elements at all, no hunger, no death. Even if you get overly slimed while exploring the mines, you just respawn at the hospital."

The game doesn't use AI. Caves of Qud has been around long before AI as we know it existed.



I don't think you'd be making that comparison if you played it 4+ years ago, because it's a pretty disingenuous comparison. Even though a good chunk of the game is procedurally generated, just about all of the story and quest dialogue isn't.



The world, dungeons, many items, and many enemies are procedurally generated, though. Not sure how the whole game could feel like AI slop.


Nevertheless, live and drink."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I loved 2018. Every minute of it. 

Then I played Ragnarok this month and it was like...on paper everything that it should've been, but fell completely flat for me. Mediocre combat, story was all over the place... I dunno. The Sony movie game thing is definitely starting to become kind of irritating. If you want to put in a cutscene or load screen then do it. Don't make me hold the stick forward while I walk or row a boat for 5 minutes and listen to dialogue. I'm not interested."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"It's Dungeons and Dragons. It's fairly faithful to the rules of 5th Edition, with modifications for sake of videogameisms.

Enemies dont respawn because, aside from the obvious of ""Why would they outside of a video game mechanic in any other situation?"", you also dont need them to. You'll progress through your levels naturally throughout the game, seeking out extra fights only earns you those levels just slightly earlier. Everything is balanced around expected levels anyways.

The ""Healer"" class sucks at healing because D&D doesn't have a ""Healer"" class. Thats what your short rests are for. You have the ""Cleric"" class, but that's not a healer. It's a class that has access to some healing spells yes, but healing spells are less of a ""Keep your party topped off"" kind of thing and more of a ""dont let your party die"" kind of thing. But just because they have access to those spells, does not mean thats what their job is.

Shadowheart, for example, is a Trickery Domain Cleric (by default). She's meant to be sneaky, debuff enemies, buff allies, and cause general confusion, while throwing out a heal in an emergency. She is not a min/max'd character. She has Firebolt from being a half-elf, but that casts using her INT stat, which is low since she's a Cleric, and she has Sacred Flame, which is an enemy dex save, while her dex only gives her a +1 making it unlikely to hit too.

Your actual ""Topping off"" healing should be coming from rests between encounters and potions rather than a ""healer"". D&D is designed around surviving encounters and healing up afterwards, not spamming heals until you eventually kill the bad guy after a few dozen turns."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"RDR2 for me as well. 60 hours in the game trying to finish it three times. First time I streamed it and got almost to the very end. Last 2 times I played alone and barely got close to that first milestone.

The gameplay loop KILLS it for me. Ride to location and shoot 200 baddies, over and over and over again. For a world being made to be as immersive as possible, trying to imagine the O'Driscolls having a bad guy printer out there making armies of cannon fodder absolutely grinds the game to a halt."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"My main issue with the game is the ""open world"" aspect is very dated and simplistic. You need to follow the story or you will quickly unravel the open world."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I love that you are being downvoted for having a subjective opinion about a video game.

I don't mind the reading, Planescape Torment was one of my favorite games. What I mind about BG3, and I know people hate to hear this, is that everything seems Marvel movie levels of bland. Asterion is fun, but every other party member, their dialogue, their motivations, their backstory, their design... it's just... okay. It's okay.  

The game begins on a fricken Illithid ship, there is no way not to make that immensely dark and creepy and foreboding, but it just seemed, like a ship with lots of tentacles.

The polish is amazing, the set scenes and amount of audio and production values, all top notch. The UI and game design, great. All great. But the plot... it's... okay. It's okay. It's fine, I guess.

I got to the Duergar in the Underdark and was just bored. I'd say maybe I've played too many games and have outgrown the entire genre, but Disco Elysium was absolutely amazing and I liked Numenera Tides of Torment a lot. 

Maybe I'll go back at some point."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah if you sort by controversial it's mostly BG3 lol.

Frankly, I hate everything about BG3, the combat and level/skill system is just a downgrade from the DOS games and it keeps all the faults from those games too.

I don't like a lot of story/dialog in games, it has way too much dialog. 

I hate the characters and the game constantly has them act like overly dramatic partners, even if you don't try to romance them."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I tried the second one and after 3 or 4 hours just stopped because I felt like I wasn't really having any fun. I gave the pre-sequel a shot tho and finished that one. I guess it was just short enough to not overstay its welcome with the gameplay and very hit n miss story/humor.

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"BG3 combat is based off the worst blandest edition of DnD and DnD combat was never actually very suited for computer games. It was, and it is super obvious when you play it in a computer game, designed for tabletop."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I’ve played a lot of bg3 on pc, finished it several times. My favorite game in the last 10 years.

Clunky, confusing and poorly designed are definitely words I’d use for the console ui."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Funny thing is, I was kind of the opposite.  I didn't mind BG3's combat, but I hated DOS 1&2's combat.  I felt like every encounter just turned into a really aggressive game of the floor is lava.  It's like every fucking thing had to have an environmental effect.

  
For some people I could see how that would be cool.  It opens up a lot of possibilities, and comboing a lot of different environmental effects, but for me it felt limiting."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Tried for hours to get into it but that combat is such a turn off
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I’d say it’s probably because it’s based off of DnD. As someone who *is* familiar with the DnD ruleset, combat hasn’t once felt like a drag outside the handful of times the game throws more than 5-6 enemies at you.  

Easiest way I can describe it is think of it like you’re playing chess and always have your next turn planned out before it comes to you again."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"AC6 is such an amazing fucking game and it also proves Fromsoft understands how to balance difficulty in a game (unlike the Souls series that basically has a financial obligation to be unreasonably difficult).

First play through is relatively easy. Only a few fights take more than one go, and if you’re getting your ass beat, just respec your AC. But getting S rank and all the challenges is insanely hard. But optional and only for tryhards. 

The music, the story, the atmosphere, the graphics, the voice acting. Peak video games in my opinion."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Disco Elysium is more of a visual novel or choose your own adventure than an CRPG or something. So in that sense, it is perfectly reasonable for people to not care for that genre.

Similarly I can't stand games like RDR2. Just a personal preference.

I also didn't play Disco Elysium if that matters."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"If you ever go back to disco elysium, finish the church questline. Best part of the game for me, everyone'll agree it's a classic disco moment."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Witcher 3 never seemed to resonate with me, I think it’s because the combat honestly sucks. Skyrim is a great game to me though. While Skyrim combat isn’t anything revolutionary, it has enough variance and playstyle options that it is still fun. I always gravitated towards stealth and bows and just thought it was the right way to play. Then one day I watched a friend play it and he was just doing a hack and slash melee style and it blew my mind that someone was down to play Skyrim like that."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Honestly one of the best parts of Skyrim is how little you need to know or understand to be able to play. Everything in it is so inherently approachable that I have used it to introduce several people to video games. 

It's not like Elite where you need three seperate tabs open with data sheets and explanations at all times to do well."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Usually I live RPGs, but Skyrim just never stuck for me, it felt super disconnected, and I got to a point where everything quest related was killing me immediately. 

I think it's just the way the game was designed. Usually in the RPG's I've played, they sort of sneak the better gear along your path, but I don't think Skyrim does that, so I progressed far enough in the ""main"" story to a point where my equipment was bad, and then couldn't get passed it."

It's a shame because I mostly liked the story and general atomosphere and all that. The gameplay though was painful. It was just constant ""doors locked, grab an item"" quests over and over and over again, even on the lower difficulties I felt like the game was poorly balanced and was too easy to do and have to redo sections over and over because the checkpoints were too spread out, the game wants you to explore the outdoor areas, but barely gives you any time to do so when you wipe out the enemies and shut things down.

Every mission in acts 2 and 3 felt like the same thing: ride horse and listen to dialogue, do menial task by pressing E a few times, shoot 30 people, shoot 10 people while on horseback, repeat.

I'm a huge fan of Westerns and gritty tragedies and the writing could have been infinitely more clever/better while keeping the exact same themes and storyline. I think Arthur is the best written and there is great material in the camp moments, but some characters are dull archetypes. I was reading Blood Meridian and watching Justified right before I played it, so maybe my expectations were way too high. I think if I had played it at launch when I was younger I'd have liked it a whole lot more.

Cyberpunk had better writing and more varied missions but the same exact issue of 30 minute gaming sessions where you're just basically watching a TV show. And slow-walking behind someone, pressing a button or two for entire segments of gameplay. Remember the robot spider you had to control at Arasaka? A better game would have let you actually control it, POV, not tediously press on various objects in a room for 10 minutes."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Out of curiosity, what games do you really enjoy?"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I genuinely cannot tell if this is bait or if your preferences are just very unconventional
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"lol it’s reddit’s favorite game, of course you would get downvoted even if that was the point of the OP. Ridiculous.

Disco Elysium is one of my favs but I totally get what you say. To each their own."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Took me something like 80 hours to make it to the Epilogue I'd say since I also went out my way to do side activities and get myself immersed, The main cause of having an insanely large roster of characters in your gang is you're sort of forced to have this insanely slow pacing if you want to learn about them and get invested in It. Not a defence of it however the prologue especially is such an awfully paced slog I dread it when going back for another playthrough"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,">Soulslike games. I don't know what people enjoy about brute forcing boss fights. *shrug*

This isn't how you're meant to play Soulslike games. It's not supposed to be about brute force. It's about trying different things, learning from your mistakes, and overcoming challenges that originally seemed impossible. It's really satisfying to figure out the right strategy to dominate the well designed bosses that you encounter."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I haven't been back to Hades 2 since the major update they released about 2 months ago but from what I remember the pacing feels significantly worse than in 1, Getting to the ""final boss"" is really easy but feels so much more a slog to actually beat (combine that at the time with his hit box being broken and the attacks he uses blending with the environment making it impossible to read didn't help) do want to go back and see the new content however"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Factiorio multiplayer is incredible if you both have a solid understanding of factorio, and have a compatible playstyle. I loved doing the normally slow early game with my friend, and being annoyed I had to stop having fun to go fix iron production or set up another green circuit line, only to realise he'd already done it and I could be on to the next thing that I was actually excited to do. We both just worked on whatever problem we wanted to solve in the moment, and that meant neither of us were bogged down having to do stuff we found tedious."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"This.

Tried to pick it up for the gf and I to play together and it ended up us furiously googling how to do everything which got incredibly boring quite quick"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"The vanilla don't starve was one of the first games I had to give up on because it was SO random, you basically had to blitz perfectly the first ten minutes. I kept trying. I'm just bad at it. Same with Rimworld."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Yup. Me and my friend never survived winter and stopped playing
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"The thing about terraria, mc and stardew is while they are wiki games, the threat of dying doesn't exist to an extent it exists in DST


You can pause in your safe space base and chill and read, slowly exploring the world, in DST u have to keep constantly moving, constantly dealing with bad controls(on purpose), struggling to heal and eat AND on top of all that reading wiki and guides to figure out how to progress or what events will happen in the future"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I played with a mod that allowed unlimited respawns at any campfire, and even with that, we barely ever progressed through all 4 seasons"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"You can set the game mode to ""endless"" in the game mode settings, which allows you to revive via haunting the door where you first started, i.e. the floral postern. But yeah it was not described in the game anywhere and you'd have to read the wiki on your own to find out."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I really suggest listening to u/M_A__N___I___A on this one. Customize your world so that there are fewer hounds (though you will miss out on their consistent drops), are able to respawn at the world spawn (the Florid Postern) and don't suffer the max health penalty (if booster shots seem like too much work) or ghost sanity effects, and turn off wildfires if you see yourself playing into summer. 


Edit: Also, make days longer. I despise the time rush that the game imposes."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I feel like in all the other games I've got options,  a different weapon, some magic or consumable, go grind for more levels, but in sekiro you really just have to dig in. At first I tried to treat it like ds or elden ring, if try to find some new prosthetic to make the fight easy, but in almost every skill check boss fight, I had to really commit to the basics of sekiro combat.

I wanna play elden ring with sekiro combat/limitations now."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I had to put Sekiro down and come back to it months later before it finally clicked. Once it did it was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Huh, I loved sekiro, while at some point I got tired of attacking butts and feet in Elden ring."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I’m a huge Souls fan and I have one piece of advice for Sekiro: take a break. A long one. 

I played the game when it first came out and fell off hard right at the end. I got to the last boss and no longer cared whether I finished it or not. So, I quit the game. For about 4 years. Came back to it last Spring and devoured it. Have beaten it twice more since then. I just needed that break, I guess."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I'm a fan and my response is ""yeah, fair"""
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"TBF I don't like soulslike but Sekiro really does it for me, what a banger"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I will say that I am generally in the same boat as you, but I found the Star Wars: Jedi series are Soulslikes for people who work 9-5 jobs. Like the difficulty can be changed at anytime. On the harder difficulties, it is legitimately a challenge, but if you just want to go through the story, there's a difficulty for that."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah. It's not that I don't like hard. It's just that for me the type of game isn't one that I like enough to enjoy the grind of getting better.

And that's fine. I have games I grind at to get better. But while I would enjoy the game if I needed to just practice the game a bit to do it, I'm typically not someone good at quick reactions and so it's just too long to play and grind at. Rather look at more strategic games which is the thinking I enjoy. And that doesn't make anything wrong with me or with the game"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Holy shit dude I thought it was just me. I've talked to peoe who are into them and I just reply that I don't want to put in the effort with the little bit of free time I have.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I grind my job. Now I'm supposed to grind my games? Fuck that.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I don’t even think it’s always a skill issue. Had a friend who was dying to get me into Elden Ring and finally gave it a try. Played it hard for 2 weeks, got pretty good and even beat some bosses he had trouble with, then all of a sudden the game felt boring and repetitive to me 🤷‍♂️"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Weirdly I feel like the skill issue is the issue of why I’m not into Sekiro. I love dark souls, elden ring, Nioh… but this game is allll about timing and I suck at timing. I’ve beat all dark souls, demons souls, elden ring, etc. but I’ve only beat like 3 bosses of Sekiro"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"There's no question the game is good, but I just hate MOBA style because there's too much for me to think about. I don't want 1v1 fights in my RTS games and I don't want to have to worry about controlling an army when I'm playing an action game. For me, it's a terrible combination of genres that just ruins all the fun for me."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Dota is the worst game ever (8000 hours).
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,If I ever start playing it again it’s usually a sign I am probably unwilling to embrace the emotional load required by life and am being avoidant of my personal growth.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Agree. It is like an abusive relationship which you cannot leave .

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Dota sucks! (Over 2k hours)
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Why is it that every person that has mass amount of time in it has the same reaction haha.  Like I was talking about League with a friend and every person I know that has played it hates it???  Same with similar MOBAs
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I rotated between HotS and Dota 2 heavily back in like 2014-16. Dota’s depth scratched an itch no other MOBA’s quite been able to, but HotS was always far more likely to be an actually enjoyable experience."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Is still
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Stupid Blizzard decided to kill it for no good reason
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"This is true, i just happen to think tag is really fun"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Once the illusion of being chased by an actual killer breaks,  it stops being fun."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,">so damned bright and trashing all the stealth perks.

this it was so much fun as a killer when it was just hide and seek with monsters. now everything is bright as day everyone is wearing some colour of neon. honestly I wish I could just refund the game now."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Death garden blood harvest was one of my absolute favourite games for the short time I was allowed to play it.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Aw, that's sad to hear that it's gone that way. I used to play maybe 5 or 6 years ago, and high rank stealth play was what made the game *interesting* to me. So much fun, especially with friends."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Damn haven’t heard of Deathgarden in a long time. Wish they kept the servers up, had more fun with that than dbd after a certain point"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I really loved playing DBD when I had no idea what I was doing. The atmosphere is great and the idea of hiding and repairing generators to try to escape from an over powered enemy if really great in concept. But once you figure out the optimal way to play is literally just afk generator touching then playing Ring around the Rosie with a cripple, it breaks the illusion very quickly."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Idk playing with scratched mirror Michael is pretty damn scary.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I really do like that there is so many horror collabs. Its like the Fortnite of Horror.

However I just never had a good time playing the actual game. Just not for me."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I'm a huge horror fan and enjoy competitive games, but I can't play that game. The gameplay loop is just too repetitive for me, it's kinda the same thing every time."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"It is an extremely competitive game by design and the community insists it’s not, it’s actually infuriating.

The game just doesn’t have a lot of casual appeal. The fun is in the competition."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Weirdly, I'm neither a particularly competitive person or even a huge horror fan, with a few exceptions, and DBD is the only PVP game I've ever truly enjoyed.

I will admit that a big part of the enjoyment comes from the fact that playing as a Killer is an experience you can't really get in most other games. Even as someone who knows most of the horror icons primarily through cultural osmosis, the idea of playing a horror movie villain is still a novel one. Also, I enjoy the fact that my wins and my losses as a Killer come entirely down to me; a lot of my frustration with other PVP games comes from grouping up with randoms that seem to want to do anything BUT focus on the objective."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Mods can significantly improve the experience. I personally am not a fan of the massive grind that Kenshi’s base game requires for levelling up so ive installed XP multipliers as well as questlines that seemed interesting. Made the game a lot more fun for me. If you’re still interested in playing i would recommend modding. Its singleplayer after all so you can play however you want.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Recommend me some of those ""almost"" total-conversions?"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"For me I loved it and built a great cocaine base right up to the point where I realised I would need to grind my battle stats by capturing a victim, then beating them up and heal them over and over again. Just like that, the spell was broken. As soon as I have to start doing convoluted pointless busywork just to become viable for endgame, I lose the will to play any game."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"> “ah shoot i need to rebuild half my factory to scale up

Nah just leave the old factory running as legacy code for the trickle of resources. Personally I turn off ore depletion with a mod because I love seeing those old janky starter factories chugging alongside my scaled up ones."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,One thing that helped me was embracing the spaghetti until I got bots. Then utilize the bots to refactor your stuff. Takes a lot of the pain away from it. 
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Honestly, finally pushing past that feeling, learning from my mistakes, and eventually building my first 2k SPM mega factory 100% made me a better developer and project organizer/manager. Not saying you did anything wrong ditching the game when you hit that wall, but scaling said wall and eventually overcoming it entirely was super rewarding and made me rethink how I approach a lot of IRL projects, particularly transportation of resources, modularity, scalability, and reusability. It's crazy how these in-game concepts can inform IRL project structure, resource management, code structure, data manipulation, and future proofing."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I've been playing this and have become hopelessly addicted. 78 hours in and I just barely finished the second tier of of deliverables!
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I just turn biters off on Factorio and it's good for me stress-wise.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Factorio doesn't have to have the constant threat of attack either, FYI. There's a peaceful mode."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Came here to say this, after ~2000 hours of Factorio and ~250 of Satisfactory they feel completely different, Factorio is chaotic with significant pressure while satisfactory is zen lmao"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Or Dyson sphere program! Absolutely love flying through space.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I find Satisfactory amplifies all of Factorio’s issues (As seen by someone who doesn’t enjoy the game) considerably by being in 3D. 

Example. Hate having to refactor and redesign in order to grow? Well it’s much more time consuming in Satisfactory because the 3D build aspect takes so much longer than in Factorio."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,That’s funny cause I’m the opposite. The trains are one of the main reasons I love the game. I love setting up a train network and then watching the trains do their thing. I find the early game to be a bit of a slog.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Path of pain was just to prove I could take a beating 
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"It's not that I wouldn't want to get back into it.  It's more that I can't. Definitely a ""one and done"" type of game for me.  I would love to experience it all over again."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"As someone who did path of pain for 10 hours, I deleted the game after I 112% it."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I recently played through again since beating it a couple years ago. My second playthrough, I was able to power through it in like 45 minutes, compared to the 5 hour session I had in my first run through the white palace. 
Hollow Knight feels like such a complete package with its combat and platforming being tied to the same movement abilities! Definitely easy to learn, but hard to master."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I think coming from Ori makes it harder to get into HK. Ori's animation is so fluid with a variety of movements and skills, while in HK you just get a dash and the movement is pretty stiff."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I feel like this is the Metroidvania way. Unless you surrender to exploration and being blocked off by a boss, it’s gonna be difficult to keep moving forward. 

*However*, once get past the block that’s keeping you like I had done, you’re bought into the genre and all of a sudden all Metroidvania games scratch a new itch."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"This is me. I've started easily like 10-20 runs, always play for a few hours until my base is too large and my dupes are spending too much time running from project to project and heat starts to become an issue. Then I quit because I don't want to reconfigure my whole base for better time management and heat distribution."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Even as an engineer I didn't care for it.

What drew me to engineering (software) was the ability to semi-permanently solve things through automation. Having to constantly juggle complexity without the ability to abstract it away gets tedious very fast for me."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I wish ONI would just explain some really basic things about itself to new players. Like would it kill them to let players know that VITAL resources like dirt and algae are almost nonexistent outside the starting biome? Love the game, but it makes some design choices that feel actively hostile to the players."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I find the game pretty boring solo, to be honest. There's a lot of tedious in it. I mean, it -is- an ""open world survival crafting"" game even though it stands out from the crowd and was made when those games were not common place, but just like the rest of the genre, its a hell of a lot better with friends, and I've had some very magical times with it that way."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Just press ESC and there is a slider on the right side to zoom in and out. You can also directly make the UI bigger so you can see all the buttons.

If that's not enough, there are additional mods for this through TModLoader."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,The story is so different and amazing & I like the crafting etc but the platforming parts were a massive turn off.  I can't do anything that requires that type of precision & timing as my hands have arthritis. I rage-quit the game too many times to be able to really enjoy the story although I did end up finishing it.

I eventually got more into but it took a bit."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"TW3 has the same problem as Skyrim, and fans who will make the same set of excuses. “It’s not really about the combat, just play it for the story / atmosphere!”

Folks, if the *vast majority* of the playtime of the game is spent in combat, you can’t just “ignore” the combat.  For all the praise CDPR has received for the Witcher games, their inability, across **3** games, to develop a compelling combat system really makes me question their capabilities as a developer. 

I usually don’t buy into the “it would have been better as a movie / tv series,” but considering player “choice” is also pretty meaningless (you thought getting rid of the wife beater was a good idea, but, *surprise!*, that wife beater was the family’s only source of income and now his wife has to become a prostitute **because of you**), I really do think their skill set was better suited to other forms of media."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I also stopped because of the combat system.  It's just not fun.  I wish it had a Souls like combat system, but I know that's not everyone's cup of tea."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"This is true, and I can see how people wouldn't get into it from the start but I love slow starts in epic RPG fantasy games.

Squeezes a lot of time out the game, but yeah that gameplay style is not for everyone."

You should try Subnautica. You can just fuck around and explore at your own pace but there is a story that pushes you to explore the different biomes and in different directions. Sense of progression is also there, but subtle: you go from a practically helpless castaway that has to kill to eat and drink to a practically totally self-sufficient tree-hugger with a big-ass submarine and several bases all over the place."

I was originally really into Minecraft because of the core mechanics but eventually realized that the creative/building part of the game wasn’t for me. Terraria is much more progression focused, and I actually enjoy building stuff a lot more because it usually has a purpose instead of just being built to look pretty."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Stardew is basing itself after Harvest Moon aka Story of Seasons. They’re *meant* to go on. That said, Stardew does have a plot where you could technically stop after you’ve completed it 🤷‍♀️ You can also set goals for yourself"

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I was hooked until I got to the Balatro section then thought ""shoot, I can just play this nonstop?"""
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,It doesn't have to.  You can do whatever you want
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Lol if you haven't already, don't play ""Graveyard Keeper"" (Spoiler: it's sooo much more than keeping a graveyard 😭 too much more..)"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"The last 2 or 3 hours I’ve tried to play that game have been me picking a planet, flying to it, finding something I don’t understand, can’t access, can’t use, or finding nothing at all, then dying. Idk if I’m picking all the wrong first planets but I keep opening it for an hour and getting bored of making no progress. It feels like the game is behind glass and I can see interesting stuff I just can’t actually get in and touch anything."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"That's how I feel about pretty much ALL timeloop games. I don't even like Majora's Mask. I just can't get into the whole ""do the same events over and over and over again until you get them *exactly right*"" thing."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Same, I liked exploring and finding lore about the past, but I hated the time loop. Even if it were a bit more structured, like if it only happened when you left a cave or planet, I probably wouldn’t have minded too much. But on my 4th attempt to explore the cave systems on those twin planets I just dropped the game. Didn’t care to fly all the way back and try to figure out where I was at and what I hadn’t seen."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,100% right there with you. Putting almost anything under time pressure just ruins it for me.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Yea I see people praise this game all the time and I gave it a try and couldn’t get into it
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,>!you can learn to meditate from the pilot on water planet. this ends the cycle at will.!<
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Love the game but this is my #1 gripe with it.
If I'm waiting for a specific event, and I miss it or do it incorrectly, then I have to wait again with no way of fast forwarding to the specific moment I'm looking for. Punishing me by losing my actual IRL time - that is just... I'm not at all happy with that.

I'm happy to be told that there is a way to fast forward if I'm wrong."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"To me personally I never had any issues with how movement offload or onboard the ship worked in the game and was able to quickly figure it all out, but now that I really think about it, it's more likely because I played Kerbal Space Program before I played Outer Wilds.

KSP actually explains orbital mechanics and how you interact with them directly in game, whereas Outer Wilds doesn't directly explain it at all beyond the zero g cave, and from what I remember, the cave was more about trying it out for yourself rather than explaining anything directly.  But sometimes concepts require a tell and then show approach, especially if they're counterintuitive.

For example, it's counterintuitive that if an object has you within its gravity well that's pulling you into it (like a black hole) the answer is not to apply full thrust in the opposite direction of the threat to get away from it, but rather to apply force perpendicular to it so you can put yourself into a constant free fall.

 So now that I think about it, they definitely could have done a better job with that tutorial section. Even with my previous experience, landing on the ***-station with the ship took a few tries, I imagine that experience is far more frustrating when you don't fully understand orbits."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"To be fair, very few games aside from simulator-type games like KSP do space physics accurately.

I think after being conditioned to the fake space physics people so often encounter in games and movies, the simulated orbital mechanics of Outer Wilds is a bit of a shock, even though your ship has crazy amounts of thrust."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Oh I understood completely, it just wasn’t fun very fun to have such realistic physics."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I never used the landing camera view. It was disorienting for me. The ship flight was perfectly intuitive for me without it. Except for autopilot sending me into the sun lol.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,">  Never gonna play it again, but ya.

Its literally impossible to replay. Absolutely and completely pointless.

The only replacement is to watch other people play, I must have watched like 10 playthroughs by now, it really is unique in how great it is to see other people figure it out for themselves. One of the very few games that's enjoyable to watch"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,[deleted]
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"It's more of a ""lets do this while we hang out"" kind of game, unlike something competitive that requires a lot of focus. It's a good, chill environment that only occasionally requires focus"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,me and my friends played it on a free weekend and we just felt like we would have way more fun playing l4d or smth
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I thought the same at first, but other than not unlocking stuff as quickly as you could, there are really no consequences to ignoring the objectives.

I walked into a house to give someone a fish, a year and a half after she asked for it, to be met with as much thanks as if I'd done it the same day. 

There really isn't that much riding on the clock, it's just a way of implementing the gameplay cycle. 

If you do ever give it another shot, definitely use the wiki, it's an insanely useful resource that makes planning your day much easier"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I think a huge part of the game is figuring out what you do with each day. I had the most fun setting certain tasks and routines for the day and making sure I completed them all before skipping to the next. Raining outside? Looks like I can skip watering my crops and go straight into the mines. Good luck from the fortune teller? Maybe do some foraging or check out the desert for the day. Can’t buy seeds from Pierre on Wednesday? I’ll go fish, hit up the blacksmith with my geodes, and hand out gifts to some of the townspeople.

And that doesn’t even touch on the larger goals you build towards, like the community center and other end game projects.

Also, when people say “the clock doesn’t really matter” it’s a little misleading. I think they mean in the broader sense.

It does matter day by day, as you’ll pass out if you stay up past 2am, and shops/houses/etc will close past certain hours. However, you have an infinite amount of years, and after the first couple go by the calendar begins to loop, which means you don’t miss any of the events or seasonal crops. In fact, certain things are added to the game as the years progress, so you really aren’t constrained by time in the long run.

Obviously if you don’t get a kick out of running a routine for 5 hours in a video game, it’s probably not for you, which is totally cool."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I had the same issue, my brain couldn't help but want to optimize everything as much as possible and it just made the game feel like a chore rather than relaxing."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I'm a min-maxer by nature and the breakthrough with SDV for me was forcing myself to just fuck around for a few years. Like literally just go fishing for a bit if I felt like it. Skip a festival and go cut down some trees here and there and pretty up the neighbourhood. Go collect some stuff for the villagers or plant some crops I'd never grown before.

I did that for a good while until it finally sank in that *there actually isn't any time pressure at all beyond what you set for yourself*. This isn't Persona or Mass Effect or XCom, you aren't actually under the gun even though days will tick by."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,The children yearn for the mines
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Let’s be real, the mine combat isn’t very good gameplay. It only works because it’s only just 1 thing to do in the game, and it unlocks upgrades for your tools to use in other parts of the game. If all you do is go to the mines, then the game won’t be very good."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I love DS and am excited for the DS2, but DS suffers from a horrendously drawn out start. There's way too much time spent sitting around in cutscenes and while I appreciate them not wanting to throw too many mechanics at the player too fast, they really probably could have cut the tutorial stuff in like half. The game becomes a lot better once you hit chapter 3 and things open up and let you loose, but the drag to get there kills it for a lot of people imo."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Damn, chapter 1 was perfect, nice enviroments, easy to navigate and lots of boss fights. It felt amazing, but then came chapter 2 with the desert setting, and I already started to get lost every now and then.

I’ve dropped it after CH2, but now I hear that 3 and 4 are even worse to navigate, so I kinda don’t want to continue it. I really liked that „boss rush” from chapter 1 and hoped that it will stay that way."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I can understand that. The game is a little shallow. I plaued co-op with my daughter though, and we had a blast. We made a cult called ""Pizza"" For All that emphasized cannibalism and making sure nobody got wise to the fact that everyone was named stuff like ""Mozerlla"" ""Extra Cheese"" and ""Breadstix"""
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,The toilets being stage 3 in the tech tree for some reason has always stuck with me as something that feels like it's forcing you spend a bit of extra time at base collecting waste just to prolong it a bit more
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,This. I wouldn't go out of my way to sit down on a PC to play it but I love having it on my phone.

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"And I think that might actually be what bothers me about it. I want/need to be able to optimise from the outset. I don't want to start over at a new base. Come to think of it, that might be why I don't mind automation mechanics in games like Oxygen Not Included. Build it once, build it right."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"If you ever spent an hour trying to jump up a mountain in skyrim just to see if you could, outer wilds is *the* game for you. 

If you find boundary breaking to be a bit boring? Maybe not so much."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah, and that hint isn't exactly subtle either if you just stop and look at the first museum exhibit."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I've watched so many different playthroughs, and I've seen people go everywhere for the first planet. It doesn't really matter, though going to the moon is the most common. The funniest ones is the people that go to Dark bramble first"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah, Vamp Survivors is more of a game for people who are craving that constant dopamine hit through constant chaotic progression and change. It's really fun if you're into ""I wonder what would happen if I tried these ability combinations"" kind of gameplay."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"That's what really baffled me about Hi-Fi Rush. How are you going to make a rhythm action game with no good music at all? Through most of the level it's just really generic infinitely looping tracks with HEY HEY HEY HEY being blasted over it if you're timing your hits correctly, and then the boss fights are snippets of bad licensed music that's poorly mixed with the audio making it really quiet? Very bizarre."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"This is actually imo where the game gets really good, I've said the same thing myself since the beginning. I tried to play it twice and failed and finally pushed past meeting the Baron on the 3rd try and now have beaten the game 3 times. Pushing past it and playing through the whole game has even allowed me to appreciate the entire game, from the beginning, just knowing how good it all gets."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Geralt's body proportions and his walking/running animation take me out of every second. I enjoy quite a bit about the game but I can't get over how goofy he looks.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Isn't the tower like more than halfway through?
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Monster hunter games are kind of like that, the newer ones are a little more accessible, but alot of it is about reading the monsters behaviour and seeing how it acts to figure out what would be a good way to take it down given the tools and weapons you have access to so far.

The older games are much more puzzley, the newer ones are much more straight combat with optional puzzle mechanics to make it faster, easier, or more efficient."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah, those intense fights against the big monsters were a thrill ride."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Also one of my favorites, but it can be reeeeally hard to progress in if you haven't watched a buttload of tutorial videos. Also, I believe a lot of people don't enjoy games that try to teach you to enjoy failure without any rewards. Like Dwarf Fortress. Watching all your hard work, you know, die, kinda sucks. And having to start from fresh again... every time... But I still love this game! I like my little people dying because they are depressed or are having a psychotic pyromaniac breakdown. And starvation! Best game ever! Really!"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Same. For me it felt like there was way too much to do. I prefer the relative linearity of Dark Souls
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I agree with you. I think it was a matter of mismatched expectations vs reality.

I really liked the early moment to moment decisions (more like Poker). I like the process of assembling an awesome engine.

Cranking that engine is quite boring, however, and it (mostly) eliminates one of the things I like (moment to moment decisions)."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Skyrim was peak in college when I could skip all my responsibilities and no life it. Living in it 16-20 hours a day was something else. Then you finish it and go back to what you're supposed to be doing :) haven't been able to get into a game like this since having real responsibilities 
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Same here. I got about 1100 hours in and it just didn’t hook me
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"given that the combat is what you do for at least half of the gameplay and the combat is super basic with very little meaningful build variety, id say that an hour sorta preps you for what most of skyrims gameplay will be.

blackreach is pretty tho"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,  I am still playing it too and now playing it in VR after modding it to look beautiful.  I have finished Baldur's gate 3 twice and Skyrim is still my favorite game.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"For me it's because they managed to blend the gameplay loop really well with the storyline. There's actual understandable reasoning behind as to why you keep dying over and over again and they give actual motivation to keep trying. 

The world in this game is simply built for the roguelite genre which is why it flows so well. At least to me."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I was around 15 hours in, too, got to act 5, and then asked myself, ""Do i really want to sit here and stare at horse's ass for another 20 minutes?""

My biggest gripe with the game was how every mission felt like a linear tutorial. Press X to do something that you will never do again, try stealth or mission fails, or actually, dont you dare try doing it stealthy and shoot the entire town instead. Ride for 10 minutes to some remote location while your band mates talk about something, shoot 20 bandits, and hide from the police. Karma system doesn't matter (except for the ending), you'll be forced to kill cops and there will be a huge bounty on you. Collectibles don't matter because money doesn't matter. The only thing I genuinely liked was your companions. They were cool.

Rdr2 online was fun, though, but it quickly runs out of content. Also, I beat the original RDR 1 and RDR1 remastered. That game is a masterpiece."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,game could be very good for me but the BIG turn off are the controls.  it's so bad.  you can clearly see it was made for consoles
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Listen, I've tried the whole series. Combat has been a major detractor in all of them. I can appreciate the stories, but the combat required to get me there? Not worth it.

I'll watch a yt video to get the jist."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Because it's not a game.  It's a short story that forces you to turn the pages slowly. Which is great... but it's not a game. There is no real fail state or meaningful choices. I loved so much of Firewatch... but I don't blame anyone for not liking it.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"The mundanity is the point. Your main character is stuck almost totally alone for weeks, and starts over-interpreting some fairly minor events that actually do have reasonable explanations. And the real storyline is him slowly coming to realize that he can't run away from his problems by hiding on a tower in the forest.

It was inspired by Gone Home, which did much the same thing. It presents as though it's going to be a horror game about a girl returning home to find her entire family gone, but it turns out nothing is actually wrong. It's deliberate anti-climax to subvert how melodramatic games can be.

Obviously, if that's not your thing it's not your thing, but it's a deliberate artistic choice."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah see, that's a totally fine reason. I cant get into the Witcher 3 because of how clunky I find the camera to manage in combat. World is awesome, characters are interesting, just can't get into the gameplay itself. 

But I'm not about to say I can't get into it because the RPG systems and the world are bland. Because they're absolutely not."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I absolutely love CoQ, but I can almost understand where this person gets the idea of AI from. The writer for Qud definitely has a thesaurus on hand, and some of the descriptions can come across as word salad sometimes.

That's all I can give them though, the rest of the game is very intentional in its design."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,This is exactly how I felt about 2018 combined with the atrocious camera angle (why is it so off center and why can't this be changed???) that I gave up in a few hours. Can't stand the movie game style
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Rockstar in general have absolutely awful mission design since GTAV or longer perhaps.

Theyre all railroaded 'go here' 'shoot/interact X' repeat, with no room for creative solutions."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Combo that with Reddit
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I also found it incredibly repetitive, I just about finished the first zone and I didn’t pick it up again. The little bits and bobs you can do across the map just feel like a chore after a while. It’s been a few years, might try it again since my library is currently feeling very dry and I can scarcely think what to play next"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"The best combat is the 1v1 duels. The standard combat is fine but nothing great, if there were a lot more duels or the standard combat was a bit more that way then I think it could be.


I finished the game, but I'd say it's an 8/10. Solid game, worth playing but won't make a lasting impact. I have a very similar opinion of the horizon games as well."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Borderlands 2 is about a million times better. It's great if you can find a friend to play with. I played split screen with my brother for a lot of hours.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,The writing is always the worst part of every game. I'm in the middle of playing through 3 again and have been listening to podcasts rather than dialogue. It's a much better experience that way.

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"This is why I think BG1+2 did it right using real time with pause combat.

DND combat is notoriously slow, dull, and boring as hell, *especially* 5E. So having it move at a rapid constant pace keeps things interesting and fun."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Thanks I'll check it out!
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I feel you. Granted I've only watched a couple hours of my friend playing it and that was enough for me to know it isn't my cup of tea (DND style turn based combat specifically), but that's how the Witcher was for me. Played maybe 5 hours of the wild hunt, liked it well enough to want to keep going and see how the story plays out, but just could not get into the mechanics or flow of the game at all. 

On an alternative note recently picked up Lords of the Fallen '23 and became absolutely hooked on it. Absolutely scratched the itch for a new fantasy game"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"To be fair, if they get bored at the start, the characters arent developet yet and probably do seem pretty boring/generic."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah I started and stopped with zero too. Its not that they're overly long, its that they're constant. Every unvoiced sentence is typed out one word at a time unless you intervene by mashing or holding the right buttons. 

You want something to eat? Walk up to restaurant, fade to black, fade in on hostess asking if I want a table, camera flips to show me saying yes I want a table, fade to black, fade back in on me sitting down, camera pans up to the cook asking me what I'll have, menu comes up and I make the selection, fade to black, fade back in to me eating the food.

Want to play an arcade game? Walk up and the dialog box types out the price per play, selection box pops up asking if I want to play yes/no, fade to black, fade in on me sitting down at the machine and grabbing the controls, fade to black, fade back in on the minigame.

The story is fun, the combat is great, every single other interaction in the game is just packed with interstitial bullshit that adds up significantly over the course of the game."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Exactly my issue too. There’s fuck all to do in it besides shoot guns at a range. It’s just boring without a proper fleshed-out PvE mode or something.

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"You and OP are using the term brute force to mean two different things.  The key is in his phrase:  
""brute forcing boss fights""  
  
You've interpreted it to mean he wants to beat the boss with brute force (so probably button mashing).    
  
However, Im pretty sure OP is talking about the brute force method - i.e trial and error.  So you repeat until you succeed, which is exactly what you described - repeat till work out strategy - repeat till execute strategy with minimal error sufficient to win.  I too find this type of gameplay incredibly boring and not remotely satisfying on completion.  The whole affair isnt difficult, its just tedious."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Similar experience with my group and DST.

We have 4 guys (sometimes 5) that always game together, and the 1 dude that played before convinced us all to pick it up and try.

Even *with* someone who knew how to play doing his best to explain as we go, the rest of us bounced off pretty quickly because everything still felt somewhat unexplained, and therefore felt random as hell even if a lot of it technically wasn't.

Credit to my one friend who knew how to play, he got us to stick around for 2 sessions, but eventually the rest of us all bounced off and agreed to play something else."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Same, was expecting a survival that we could both *progress* in but it ended up being the sweatiest gameplay imaginable. And random events that would just completely destroy all our hard work."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"That's a fair assessment. I found it ok because I sort of treated it like a grimdark Minecraft. You really need to experiment with all of the different characters' gimmicks to figure out how to play. Even after having played it on and off for years now I still struggle with several of the gimmicks.

Also, you can modify the game settings before you start to make resources easier or harder to find, and also get a bonus chest of helpful items to get a head start on the survival part of it 

* The Valkyrie character that can only eat meat but starts with a spear and deals bonus damage seems like a great move but safe to eat meat can be very hard to find early on and her stats are subpar compared to other combat focussed units

* The woodcutter that has an axe with infinite durability that also cuts faster and is more powerful than a normal axe as a weapon is also cool... But randomly turning into a berserker if you use the axe too much and losing most of your gear and waking up in a random spot on the overworld is not the way to go

* The robot is so squishy at the start and takes damage from any form of moisture but if you are able to track down and kill the clockwork mobs you end up with unspoilable food that restores all 3 stats and gives significant stat buffs every time you eat one to a cap above every other character for all stats. 

* The old librarian is more fragile than a piece of paper but she comes with rare crafting recipes that make mid to late game way easier if you can manage to survive that far

* The OG character grows a beard. Seems like a lame gimmick but beard trimmings are a mandatory ingredient for all the high powered magic items late game that you can normally only farm when your character is insane

* The pyromaniac girl is immune to fire and you can set fire to entire danger zones and make them easy to get past if you aren't worried about burning down resources 

* The spider kid is kind of fun to play because you don't have to worry about spiders mobbing you and you can adopt your own spider squad to assassinate enemies for you. Downside is all the normally friendly or neutral mobs are permanently aggro"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Rimworld has always seemed easier for me to get into.  Granted I'm usually not trying to do much beyond survive and learn what I can each time but the way it really makes you feel like you're crafting a narrative naturally is what draws me in.  Yeah my colony is going to eventually starve/killed by raiders/turn on each other but I have a great time reaching that inevitable outcome.

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Best and worst thing about Sekiro, basically little to no “build” variety. Sure there’s some neat cheese here and there for some bosses or in game lore weaknesses for certain enemies/bosses.

Ofc BONK and DOUBLE BONK are pretty funny and the senpou temple arts are fairly cool/funny but not what you’d consider traditional for the series as a whole. Think I did a handful of the endings and then just shelved the game ever since."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Precisely, and I’m sure many people have had the same exact experience with sekiro specifically because of how different the skill gap is compared to most games."

A lot easier now with space age since you can simply move your production elsewhere (Fulgoria bis) while you tear down another planet to rebuild

I’m currently VERY slowly playing shell game with all my planets yo get navus ready for mega science production while also ramping up fulgoria and Valc to do quality production.

Plus with the multitude of bosses that weave this sort of vague overarching story it's much more engaging than Minecraft once you get into it."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"It is honestly more of an exploration/boss rush type of game, as the main progression is finding gear and materials to summone each next boss"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"YES, I played it a couple years ago and almost finished the main story. Then stopped for whatever reason.

And I agree, combat is too important to the game to just handwave it.  Combat doesn't have to be ""great"", though it certainly helps, but it needs to at least be passable enough to not detract from the game.

>to develop a compelling combat system really makes me question their capabilities as a developer. 

Fwiw, I enjoyed the combat in Cyberpunk.  I played this year, so it was the updated version.  It seems a peculiarity of the Witcher series."

When I was 16 in my parents' basement all afternoon every day after school, that's when Witcher 3 should have come out. Or in university when I was dodging essay assignments night after night. Instead it came out just after that. And now I have dogs, a job, a wife, and just don't get those uninterrupted sessions to lose myself anymore."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"> and several bases all over the place

I LOVE Subnautica, but I have never once actually built more than one actual base. At least not if you don't count that one time I did just to try, and then ended up never using the extras. I don't see the point, since by the time you can easily move between them, you're on the verge of getting a large mobile base in the form of the sub. I really like the idea of having to put together a thermal reactor base in the volcanic area, and solar panels for the shallows, and using a bio or nuclear reactor in the cold depths, etc. But the sub is just too good for me to justify taking the time and resources to build a bunch of outposts that are anchored to one spot.

If you couldn't build farm plots and battery chargers and whatever else inside the sub, then I'd definitely get more mileage from the different base pieces. But I've noticed that most of my playthroughs end up with me stocking enough in the sub to quickly plop down a temporary max-range scanner room with attached power, and then scrapping it and moving on once it shows me what I'm looking for in the immediate area.

I keep wishing that the sub had that scanner integrated with all the other tech it offers, but I guess then there'd be no reason to use the base building feature at all once you're into the mid game."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Absolutely. If it was all about franchising out the restaurant, managing managers to ensure quality, taking over competition, marketing campaigns, researching and wowing food critics etc on top of the base elements of going diving for your supply it would be outstanding.

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Yeah the issue of too many ideas rather than making the core mechanic even better. No sea people and just having reasons to bring back ever bigger fish to the restaurant would have more ivated me more

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I loved that game for about 30 hours but suddenly when the game spun out of control and I was in the basement with workers on typewriters I asked myself what I was doing with my life and stopped.

there's also Maxwell and Wes which you unlock through adventure mode, and Wagstaff who was added to the base game with the release of the last DLC. definitely not a beginner-friendly character though."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I need a guide to read this comment.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Wickerbottom was one of my favorites. Combat in the game is weird because once you know the timings, everything is almost trivialized (almost like a really easy beat game). So once you know the timings, she doesn't really have a downside besides insomnia (but even that isn't that big of a deal).


But finding out the timings by yourself is tedious. And once you know the timings, combat goes from tense to kind of annoying.


The issue is that it doesn't take much to survive. Once you have the core game play loop down, it is really easy to survive. All of the high level stuff is basically pointless because even though it's useful, it's really risky to go and do. So you're stuck with a boring game play loop and you don't have as much incentive to progress."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Fire Giant is a really poorly designed boss. Replayed Elden Ring in preparation for the DLC this year and Fire Giant was probably the biggest PITA of the base game (somehow managed to take out the Godskin Duo on the first try this time even though that one gave me by far the most trouble my first go through). Fire Giant is mostly attacking feet and his stupidly large health bar while the camera gives you terrible angles for his fireball attacks and homing missiles so you just die to some bullshit one shot unless you play super carefully. It's so tedious.

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"The way the game became more and more focused on looping and ""bullying"" the killer as opposed to escaping chases by breaking line of sight or getting rescued by a teammate or something is the main thing that killed enjoyment for me."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"They let you mass dismantle and build with a click. Just plop down a blueprint and they do all the work of placing stuff.

Later you get logistics bots that can carry stuff between chests, which really cuts down on the spaghetti. No need for short distance belts, just use bots. And build five hundred identical nuclear power facilities to meet the rapidly mounting power requirements."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Bots will automatically build blueprints if you have all the objects from the blueprints in a provider chest.  You no longer have to run around breaking down or picking everything up.  You can build a more ideal, better setup for something, and then make a blueprint, copy and paste it, and watch the bots do their thing.

Basically make an area of your factory that just creates all the most used buildings you need for things (belts, inserters, power poles, etc.) that places them in provider chests, so then any time you design a blueprint and plonk it down your bots will have everything they need.

It's a big paradigm shift in the game, cause it goes from you manually having to build a huge factory, to you just designing a small, perfect, efficient, snapshop of what you need, and then just blueprinting it and repeating it and having bots build it.  The other huge aspect of bots is you can place blueprints and buildings from the map view, so you can start fixing or building things remotely without having to run across the map to get there."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yep, once the plot kicked off I don’t think I needed to strategize or plan my dives around the restaurant’s needs at all. Everything I needed got picked up incidentally, and the restaurant really lost focus "
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I'm mad the game you're describing doesn't exist, lol. I used to love the shopping street / restaurant franchise management type browser games, I really enjoyed unlocking new decorations and chasing bigger and better fish. I was so frustrated when the game basically told you to *stop playing it* and instead do inane fetch quests and buy collab DLC, even going so far as to give you 100% automated ways to not only run the restaurant but gather fish as well What's the point of it once you take away the cooking and fishing?"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Yeah I think once I had to do the fetch quests for the sea people to gain their trust I turned it off and never got the drive to turn it back on again.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Recettear was basically the first game of this genre to ""get it right"". There have been others since that do well, but I often go back to Recettear. Even though at it's launch time it felt relatively unsophisticated, and it feels even more so now, the upsides are worth it."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I feel so validated hearing everyone say they dropped it at the sea people......I just don't care about those lil guys I'm sorry I just wanna run my restaurant
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I pushed through to the end, pre-DLC, and I kinda wish I had stopped at the sea people. Cute game, but I just wanted to fish and make sushi"
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,">I am giving stardew valley another chance and I’m hitting the same early game wall of “what am I supposed to be doing now?” 

I would suggest trying to complete the community centre.

Use a wiki to look up the correct seasons and times for special fish etc.

Then every season you have specific farming goals, if it is suddenly a rainy day you can go to the mines and gather resources for farming, or go and catch that specific fish that is only catchable on a rainy evening in autumn etc.

I found that trying to complete the community centre gave me tangible goals pretty much every day."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yep. The thing driving the game forward is really your own curiosity. The “what the hell is that thing” and “hmm, that’s weird” and “wait, what is this for!?” and “how can I figure out how to get in there?” type of thoughts/feelings.

If you start playing the game and in the first hour or two you just don’t have any inherent interest in exploring the world or solving the mystery and are instead feeling frustrated that the game isn’t pointing you to “the next thing to do”, you’re not going to enjoy the game. The game is extremely non-linear until the very end and satisfying your own curiosity is really what the game is all about."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,It helps that the pointer system is enough to get by. Shows all relevant information and makes it easier to sync with people even without using in-game chat.
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah, there's a lot of cutscene stuff that they could and probably should have just left to things for you to review in your email/messages when you go back to the safe house. Given the story the game tells, especially later on, I do think it kind of has to force itself on the player, but I think Kojima could have told the same story but balanced it better across the first handful of chapters. No one enjoys starting a game, playing for all of like 2 minutes and then putting the controller down for like 10+ or whatever it ended up being with DS. Especially when they could have easily told the same story, but though voice logs that you listened to as you traveled the tutorial areas in the first couple of chapters."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I've been meaning to actually play the dlc. But I only played through the vampire one. But then I'd have to find a gameplay and graphics overhaul mod and that would lead to a few hours modding it. Then I'd finally load it up and be like, ""Well shit. I don't want to play this anymore after the initial challenge of setting up all the mods."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Almost 4 thousand hours, still haven’t finished the main quest. My mod list which I curated over 10 years just makes it so easy to get completely lost in a true-RP experience that makes me forget about the MQ."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah, you're probably right that its simply genre based. I learned that jrpgs weren't for me back in the snes era and became a lifelong crpg enthusiast. Most of what I play isn't modern or big studio stuff either, but Yakuza 0 was just so highly hyped and the trailers looked great so I figured I'd give it a shot. I guess that fundamental divide is still there."

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Oh I didn't forget them, I only described the ones that I managed to survive 4 seasons or longer with. 

* Wendy's sister is pretty sweet but Wendy herself being super fragile makes surviving the first winter really hard. It might have just been bad luck but all 3 times I tried to play her seriously I ended up facing off against 2 deerclops in the first winter and the one time I was doing really well I got caught in a frog rain after the baby moose/goose eggs hatched when I hadn't realized they were nearby so I was getting my shit wrecked just because I was in the vicinity. 

* Wes is just hard to play because his balloon decoy gimmick nerfs his stat cap until the balloon pops. 

* Maxwell is kind of cheating but really he's just the OG but starting with the sword and armor (and recipes), but unable to grow a beard

* I never tried anything that came out of the Hamlet DLC and also Wagstaff isn't playable in DST"

1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"You know what, you just hit the nail on the head. I couldn’t figure out why I stopped loving the game. The aesthetics were so beautiful, and I loved fishing for my restaurant early on, but then the sea people stuff just…never stopped. I would love to revisit the game after the release some free dlc that expands the restaurant side of things."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Same. Recommended it to a friend and I watched him play the first hour of it. He spent the whole time just asking me “where should I go now” “how do I get past that” “can you just summarize what that text says” etc and I realized the game just wasn’t for him.

The first couple of hours being hard to get into is I think the biggest flaw of the game. The first time I tried it I stopped playing after a while because I just wasn’t getting anything done. But at a certain point on my second try all of that not getting anything done started to make sense and i got the general gist of what’s going on and it clicked - and from then on I was completely hooked and now it’s my favorite game of all time. 

Curiosity is the main driving force of the game and it’s hard to be curious when you have no idea what to do or how to satisfy that curiosity. But if you really want to know everything and you get past that then I think it’s probably the best experience in gaming you can have."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"That's the issue, for me. I \*am\* curious, and I \*do\* want to know what's going on, but just as I'm getting somewhere - LOL BACK TO THE BEGINNING. Did that for a few hours and lost the curiosity."
1hnvhgs,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"In the dialog right before you get the launch codes the guy mentions that the moon is a good place to start and I definitely have to agree. The eye sensor sets up the mystery well as it tells you the Nomai were looking for *something*, and then with the sensor pointing at the planets but spinning wildly when you input the eye it did get my curiosity going. Also because ""the eye of the universe"" as a name did give me ""TF is that even supposed to be"" feel.

Once you get that, everything builds on that initial question."

I can't count the number of quizzes/tests where this has been true for me. Then after doing the rest of the problems, the first one makes a bit more sense, or at least I've done the rest so my grade won't be so bad.

edit: Wow this post has been rubberbanding up and down like crazy for the past 24 hours o.O

I mentioned this in a different comment here but I think it relates more to the sub than what my initial comment here did (it in turn relates more to /r/<stemtopic>memes lol): I think I was able to develop this mindset after playing a lot of nonlinear games where the option to go off to side quests to level up prior to tackling the nigh-impossible campaign boss. Sometimes you just throw yourself up against it once, realize you need to level, and step back to something doable. Same shit applies to real life really, even in tests."

ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"I will preface this with I love this game: the gameplay is very neat if you like QTEs and interactive situations, the acting is honestly really good (I'm a huge Clancy Brown fan) especially with the hammy script. The script is about as subtle as a brick to the face with it's metaphors but you kinda build a bond with the characters and even as hamfisted as it is when something bad happens to them it's heartbreaking."
ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"As long as you come into it knowing it's a narrative game like other games from Quantic Dream (the devs) or Telltale, I think you'll enjoy it."

It's in my Top 3 games of the last decade alongside breath of the wild and doom."
ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"Graphics and music are excellent. The gameplay concept of having agency over the story to a large extent is pretty cool, so if you're into branching storylines and diverging consequences based on your actions then you will love it. The story itself is pretty awful and the script is so bad it's good, and out of the three main characters only one is actually engaging and interesting enough to make you pull through it. But if you can look the other way or treat it as a campy sequence of events with cool highs you will get a good time"
ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"I don't like any of David Cage's other games (Beyond Two Souls, Heavy Rain, etc) but for what it's worth, I really enjoyed playing through Detroit and was impressed by the acting and graphics. Solid story, TONS of different ways to end character arcs, and genuine emotion was felt. 

Not often can a game make me feel unbridled happiness or anger because of its events but I found myself quickly attached to the main characters and invested in their stories."

ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"Yup, I've played UD once. It being a few years older and the graphics not as good, it didn't leave an impression quite as heavy as DBH. I loved having 6 characters to try and keep alive. 

Still absolutely pissed off that I fumbled the very last button to keep Matthew alive."
ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"Yeah, if you enjoy jump scares and loud screeching noises as ""horror."""
ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"Oooh!! Where would I find the PC port? I'm guessing it's not on steam or anything, probably a 3rd party site. Hopefully it's free."
ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"Evidently these people aren't regulars on /r/<stem topic>memes subreddits, where comments like mine are basically the norm lol."

I hope, I pray the problem isn't that the general populace agrees with OP and doesn't recognize the difference between a joke and real lamentation.  Certainly most people on Reddit seem to lack the skills to recognize social context."

ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"And yet here we are, with a bunch of man children who don't know the difference between a joke and a problem giving unwanted advice to someone when they cracked a joke, like they are unfamiliar with the concept of ""joke"".  

Seriously, don't encourage them.  I know you are trying to be nice but not showing them what they are doing wrong is far more destructive than telling them they are being an idiot."
ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"Gavin Reed... yeah that scene is adorable. 

The way he lifts the coffee cup one more time, in a futile gesture to offer it to him as he walks away 😂

Connor really is a baby.

ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"Clearly you have not been to /r/mathmemes or /r/physicsmemes, where having a discussion about the reality of what the meme is about is a normal thing. In fact, talking about the things relevant to the meme isn't really abnormal anywhere - except when it comes to school stuff for some reason."

ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"It's because people are taking normal Ennui and get serious about it.  This is that social context thing I was referring to.  

I mean, math memes and physics memes seem to me like exactly the sort of thing that spur discussion of the subject matter."
ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,I think it's fairly normal in every context to discuss the topic that was brought up. The reason this joke seems funny to people is that the underlying subject resonates with them.
ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"Yeah, like a normal human being I'm not worried about offending random people who'll take offense to a mild invective.  

Look, you still aren't sending a healthy message here."
ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"True, but by allowing you to undo it, they make you feel played. Number 1 rule of storytelling. Never revive characters."
ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-06,"Oh yeah the feel is real every time. It's like being confronted by what seems to be the end boss on the first level - it sets the tone for the whole thing.

Oddly though - I think a few games where the beginning *was* way harder than the rest of the game may have helped me escape that defeatist mindset. Games where I could go back to nigh-impossible bossfights after doing sidequests to level up also probably helped."
ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"iirc you weren’t originally able to bring her back, but apparently a lot of players wanted the option to bring her back, so they released a patch to allow that."
ez224n,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,Its because they wanted this that they shouldn't have given the feature. Same thing as Quiet in MGSV.

81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,I don't know what is more outlandish. Shrek's fairytale setting or Detroit ever becoming a technological center of the modern world.
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,Is Detroit going to be like a telltale game where its just basically point and click?
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,One of these is the result of a gross inhuman creature inexplicably gaining commercial success...the other is Shrek: The Video Game.
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,"Shitty cover art aside, I'm so sick of every fucking game these days being called Word: Two Words.

81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,lol that Detroit Box art is going to look SO dated in like 3 years.  They are putting way too much stock in that graphical fidelity.

81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,Detroit seems like a terrible place to become a human. 
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,"Jesus, what's up with box art being so generic and uninspired? I much prefer the likes of Horizon: Zero Dawn or the alternate cover for DOOM 2016, especially because it actually shows what sort of thing the game is about and what action it entails. I think the only cover that acts as sort of a midway point is Halo 2, while focusing on a character, the color scheme and the chief's pose is as if he's bracing for a fight, it's just cool and that's what they need to be, right?"
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,I don't get it
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,I remember as a kid that shrek game cover always creeps me out D:

81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,Is there a release date yet? I’ve always enjoyed watching my roommate play these types of games while I eat dinner. 
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,I'll be keeping an eye on this game. 
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,Easily one of the worst if not the worst AAA-title box art this year.

81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,This game has layers like an onion. And the ESRB slaughtered them like layers. They hate them.
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,"Never hated any gta box art , from gta 1 to 5 seen it all. Vice city is my favorite btw"
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,"still more interesting then the overdone ""guy with big gun looking serious in the camera"" boxart"
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,"Well, one of the main things about Detroit/Heavy Rain/Beyond: Two Souls is the amazing motion capture and facial expressions.  Hell, even the loading screens are just close ups of the faces going through different expressions."
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,I like when games got like fancy ass art on the other side of the cover when you flip it over

81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,"I mean Detroit used to be a technological center of the world, if that counts for anything"
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,Sarif Industries is in Detroit too.
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,"Well property is dirt cheap there, so if someone motivated enough came along (looking at you Elon) they could turn it around  in a generation."

81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,"Never mind the gameplay, it’s a David Cage game. It is going to be super pretentious and will probably involve some supernatural twist that can’t be taken seriously."
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,"Telltale games are pretty binary, I expect this one to at least offer more nuance and story branches."
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,No. These games are way more immersive and choices feel more natural and permanent.
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,"Yeah! I miss my old school games like Magic: The Gathering, Vampire: The Masquerade, and Werewolf: The Apocalypse!

Wait..."
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,">every fucking game these days being called Word: Two Words.

Trademarking and search engines, those are the reasons.

The game can't be called Detroit, it can't be called Become Human, combine the two and you have something relatively unique that you can trademark and easily find on google.

Is it annoying, yes, but blame that on the explosion of 'content' in the world. You *have* to have a unique title."
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,Never gonna see that which is a damn shame because I was really pissed off with the ending.
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,Actially you have terrible spelling
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,Because a game company used half of a face on the box art?
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,Asking the real questions.
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,"I'm a simple man. I see ""HELLO THERE!"", I reply, GENERAL KENOBI!"
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,"Yes, and it also posed these questions in a slightly less cliche and ham-fisted fashion.

Heh, one of my favorite details of DEHR was walking passed some tattoo'd, pierced punk rocker groups, and hearing them jeer ""Why don't you respect your body, Aug?"". Thought that was some clever irony."
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,It's way *ogre* done in my opinion
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,Nope. I want more of these types of games. I cannot wait until a sequel to Until Dawn and Life is Strange.
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,"I've found these games are much enjoyable played with a partner or SO. Specifically ones that don't game very often.

Switching off on important decision making while enjoying good story. Fun for the whole family!"
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,Play another genre if you think that. Other people like this type of gameplay

81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,Yeah they usually have some good art. I'm not saying all of it is bad I'm just over this lame guy standing there pose.
81b8bs,2018-03-02,2018-03-02,Not really. Same box art just zoomed in to his face.

Edit: and you forgot Indigo Prophecy."

But I've seen game's with bad art(sometimes) go down in the chart quick. Cause it just shows how devs are serious about the game. IDK. And i was being sarcastic about not playing it.

ada65e,2019-01-06,2019-01-07,"PS4 constantly captures game video output (unless specifically blocked by a developer) into a buffer and at any point you can use the Share button on the controller and save the video output to the PS4 system disk’s capture gallery for future editing and sharing. Buffer defaults to 15 minutes but size can now be adjusted manually up to, I think, 30 minutes. It’s also possible to force a new recording at any point by double clicking the Share button, tweak Share to prefer screenshots over video or vice versa, etc. It’s incredibly easy to do with no specialist equipment or karma farming required. Maybe you should’ve looked online for this first?

https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps4/share/videoclip.html

As others have pointed out, all three consoles have this capture built in now. Switch is limited to the last thirty seconds. I don’t have an Xbox One to confirm how that system operates but I’d guess it would be similar to PS4."

ada65e,2019-01-06,2019-01-07,"Yeah it is. But just... I think if they can find the missing ""secret sauce"" that it'll be cracked. IMHO I think it might be the smoothness of the animation. Real people fidget and their muscles twitch.

Plus we don't really just move, we kind of start to move then are continually adjusting our movements as we get feedback from our muscles so our movement is subtly jerky. It's especially true around the eyes where there's all sorts of fine muscle movements that the girl doesn't seem to have."

ada65e,2019-01-06,2019-01-07,Oh God with fast text on... 
ada65e,2019-01-06,2019-01-07,"Hello. Um...allow me to introduce myself. Have we...met before? At the...post office, perhaps? Yeah, whatever. Anyway, let me just say thanks for buying this game, Detroit: Become Human. Um...on behalf of everyone at Sony, I...um...I...What was the next part? Huh? 

Aw, forget it! That's enough! Let's get down to business, whaddaya say? Because you may not know it, but you and I got issues to discuss. First, let me just tell you what it is I'm doin' here. Just so there are no misunderstandings later on.

You, my friend, reset your game, didn't you? Huh? Maybe on accident, maybe on purpose, but you pressed it. Or maybe you didn't, huh? Maybe you just went and turned the power off without saving. Sound familiar?

What? Sorry, what was that? I didn't catch that last bit. Did you just say I'm right? You did what I said you did? Ah-HAH!!!

All right, you listen and listen good, 'cause I get real angry when I gotta repeat stuff I gotta say. Resetting... It's like...pressing an emergency call button. You press it and I gotta come read you the riot act. See?

Also, you gotta SAVE before you turn the power off. If you don't save, it's the same as resetting. Well, OK... That last part? I just added that. Why? Because I wanted to. Forget about other games for a minute, will ya?

I'm here to suggest that you try and play THIS game without hitting RESET. Got it? I know what you're thinking: ""Whether I hit RESET or not should be up to me. After all, it's MY Sony Playstation 4!""


Well, sorry. Rules are rules, OK? Know what I'm sayin'? Let's not make a big deal out of this. End of discussion. This bein' our first meeting, I'm gonna let you off easy. Think of this as a friendly warning from me to you.


Oh, one more thing. This is my job. I take it seriously. So next time you see me, it's no more Mr. Nice Guy. Oh, yeah, and another thing I guess I gotta say here...I really watched my... language...here today. I'm not usually quite so... you know, so polite.


If I'm bein' truthful here, I gotta tell you... I been told I got what you call an acid tongue. I sorta...scare people. Hey, that's...who I am. Nothin' I can do about it. What, I'm supposed to say sorry for bein' me?


Look, it's nothin' personal. I ain't tryin' to be mean or cruel or nothin'. I ain't a monster. For those people who get their feelin's bruised easily, I gotta apologize in advance. Just deal with it, OK?


The deal is, I get paid to be nasty. Crazy world, huh? Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Well, I figure it's about time for me to get outta here. So, uh... Yeah. Here's hoping I don't have to come see you no more. Now...
SCRAM!"

Personally, I though the hardest choice was whether or not to shoot the Chloe at Kamski's house. I was playing that first playthrough with Connor doing his job competently, but I damn if I didn't want to avoid shooting her anyway."
ada65e,2019-01-06,2019-01-07,"He's in New Leaf. He comes up as one of the community projects. They made getting yelled at by Mr. Resetti an opt-in kind of deal, because it was distressing the shit out of young kids. "

I suppose he finally had enough and turned to the Templars?"
ada65e,2019-01-06,2019-01-08,Originally if you did kill Chloe at the house she was permanently gone from the main menu from that point. People freaked out and they patched it.
ada65e,2019-01-06,2019-01-07,Yea... But it's not the same as the first time you get yelled at by him in the GC version. Especially not understanding what the hell is going on at first! 😂😂

9fkny4,2018-09-13,2018-09-13,"There is a Todd in the game that turns androids deviant, buuuut he does it through child abuse instead of porting Skyrim to everything."
9fkny4,2018-09-13,2018-09-13,"Bryan and Clancy basically made the game for me. I love the rest of it too, but they took the game from good to great.

While playing Connor, my decision making process was basically, “Ok, but what would Hank want me to do here?” Gotta be best buds."
9fkny4,2018-09-13,2018-09-14,The gay relationship between Conor and Hank is the most amazing thing ever in a video game. Android sex? Done. I loved to see Hank just be Hank after being all wound up. Conor really loosened him up. The massage scene at the end in the Caribbean beach made it all worth it. 
9fkny4,2018-09-13,2018-09-14,I would have loved for this game to have just been Connor and Hank tbh.
9fkny4,2018-09-13,2018-09-13,"Ever since playing this game I try to leave the door open in case my roomba wants to be free, but he hasn’t left yet. I fear he has internalized his oppression."

9fkny4,2018-09-13,2018-09-14,"Yeah - the comic implies that he has traded it in for an auto post-game, probably at Connor’s insistence."
9fkny4,2018-09-13,2018-09-14,Yes.

Granted, his dialogue was often somehow written both bland and melodramatic, but he delivered it with all the charisma and expression of a sea sponge. His story was still action packed and exciting for me, I just had less of a personal investment in his character.

If you get a chance, play some alternate storylines or watch them online. Playing violent Markus or machine Connor changes the story a lot in some cool ways."
9fkny4,2018-09-13,2018-09-13,"Yeah that tends to happen if he sees you being a jackass. Hank may pretend to hate androids but he’s a big softie, so he always likes it when you treat them and yourself like humans."
9fkny4,2018-09-13,2018-09-14,"The way Conor went ""Mmmm"" after drinking an ice cold beer on the beach made me really wonder if maybe, just maybe he was human. "

At the end of the game you get the choice to give her, her freedom and she goes away permantly if you grant it to her... well she used to go away permantly, but people who were attached got all sad about it and cried so the devs put in a way to get her back by acquiring a new model or something, which just goes totally against the moral of the story.

I'd give Detroit: Become Human a soft recommendation to anyone who enjoys TellTale games, I thought I'd hate Conner and his story, but by the end it had me shedding a tear or three."

1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,If I just keep hoping for a true detective (season 1) style one of these games that's not heavy
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,I just discovered The Quarry two weeks ago and loved it. I recognize Detroit Become Human but I’m on XBox so I can’t play it. What are the other two games please?
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Stare deeply at our souls.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,The one on the top right looks like Sean Bean.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Thanks for citing the games.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Is the first fella John Abruzzi?
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"I couldn't take Peter Stormare seriously in Until Dawn, everytime he appeared my reptilian brain was like ""WE CUT OFF YOUR JOHNSON!""."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Pretty cool
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,The third looks kinda nice.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Not a home screen character, but playing death stranding you get an eerie feeling with BB's father. Dude I was playing during my birthday and he brought me flowers and was like: ""Did you think I'd forgot?"" Man I love Kojima's games.

Sorry for my bad english."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,I maybe wanna try Detroit become human. How good are the other games? I don't have too much money right now and wanna start only games that are worth it.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Me too! Really love them 🤝
But is there a choice game like then for Nintendo switch? 🤔😅"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"IMO Detroid is soo much better than any of the Super Massive Games. They only make the same kind of BMovie game again and again. Quantic Dreams tech, story and gameplay is way cooler. Can't wait to see what they will do with Star Wars!!!"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Peter Stormare (Dr Hill, Until Dawn) did an amazing job at his role. I have yet to play the other games but i remember playing and he just having a thick presence throughout the game even though he only showed but a handful of times."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,that's so cool especially if we feel lonely when playing a game
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Always? Did you mean like almost never except 5-10 games?
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,I love how 3 out of 4 of these are JUST supermassive...
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Had a friend recently reccomend The Quarry to me, I think I'm gonna play it tomorrow!"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"In many cases for me those characters are the highlight of the game (looking at you Dark Pictures, Bowler Hat theme song fucking rules)"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,[removed]
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Ok hear me out! If you screw in this game (allowed character to die, maybe it's detective and you catch wrong guy), menu character make fun on how stupid you are)"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Chloe (DBH) is definitely the best example here. She's used in super interesting ways and has a ton of idle dialog. Really cool part of an already dope as fuck game.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Yeah they are good/karma
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,the Detroit become human one is soo good
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-30,"I think they're usually annoying. Often existing to arbitrarily increase game length, lazily serve to slow pacing, and give pointless misdirections/entirely uninterpretable hints, especially during first-time playthroughs. 

But it ain't that big of a deal in the larger picture as the games they're in are almost always very entertaining as a whole."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-30,whatsa the name of the bottom left?
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-30,DBH is actually pretty good... But the dark pictures games...
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-30,AI vibes
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-30,John Abruzzi?
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-31,"Gotta be honest the best one was the quarry narrator really scared me how she said she will haunt you depending if you dnt do what she begs of you to do. 

Side note the only good dark picture game was house of ashes"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-31,The four horsemen of popular characters in video games!
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-31,"They add personality... also makes me think, why do they even exist 😭"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-31,"I was genuinely worried when Detroit's Chloe got upset at some point and stopped talking to me lol, I remember even searching online if it was due to something I had done"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-11-01,"After i finish the game and free all androids, this girl from main screen leave me, she ask to be free and i agree. how to bring her back? i miss her"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-11-01,The dark picture was so good.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,I feel like the point is slightly lessened when 3/4 examples are from the same people
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"Oh, Firecracker (Valorie Curry) on the bottom right! A Homelander skin in Undefeated: Genesis would be funny, like Vought propaganda, lol.

Also, aren't all these games made by the same people? At least they're all modern adventure/point-and-click-ish games. Back when they traced a model's face and didn't fuck it up, pre-MK1."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,But this granny really cringe. Hag of Hackett's Quarry
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,finished detroit in one sitting and didnt even see her till the end
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"I actually kind of hated the menu gimmick in Detroit, I took the option to let her leave as soon as it came up. Goodbye.
 
Edit: boo me all you want. It sucked."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Dam I never knew DBH was a story game. That's a bit upsetting because I really don't care for those types of games, but I heard so much good about DBH I had it on my wish list for a while. Does anyone know a good YT channel that showcases the game well? Not someone who talks over the whole video. I dont mind commentary. Just know the right time to talk and the right time to listen."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Weird
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Huh, I never played any of these games and didn’t know that was a thing. Neat."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,who and what are you talkinn of
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Damn CoD's ""The Replacer"" marketing is going nuts right now."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-30,I found them very annoying and it took me out of the story
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"I am surprised how many people seem to enjoy The Dark Pictures anthology and The Quarry. I thought all those games were very shit.

Until Dawn is Supermassive's only good game of this type, a lightning in a bottle."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,i dont
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"They talk a lot , it's good but I am here to play and not to listen whole day"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"A white girl acting like an MLK quote is in-depth knowledge is a lack of self awareness and pretentiousness on a level not thought possible.

Detroit become human is just the civil rights movement but robots. Very shallow."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"I havent played detroit become human so i definitely didnt think you were making a joke and that the bottom right one was some type of porn game

Edit: Yall are some humourless fucks"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,The Quarry sucks. It sucks d*ck. Never have I ever tormented so much while playing a game. I didn't leave it midway cause I don't like games or movies to be half left
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,I love when she suddenly starts singing or says a random fact lol
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,I loved Detroit: Become Human but I completely missed this part of the game because I always leave my consoles on rest mode to charge controllers between sessions so I wasn't actually closing the game out and opening it again to get to that menu.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,Wow that’s crazy
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,To not only have the Idea but the creative freedom to actually implement that is beyond cool
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"My wife played that game for the first time recently, and there were a few times that blew my mind that I had never seen any of the times I had played before. One night, she was up late playing and then played the next morning, and the girl said something like, ""You were up late last night. I hope you slept well. "" And there was another time she knew what day it was. Also, just the way she reacts to decisions is crazy!"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,She comes back on the third playthrough
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,Mine eventually came back. Then asked if I wanted her to stay.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,I told her no to see what would happen and it is one of the funniest gaming moments ever for me. She just glared sadly at me every time I paused. It was like a kid who was grounded.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Plus over time, depending on your choices, she becomes more humanlike and warm - or colder and more 'professional'. It's such a well done game."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"I remember if you declined, she says she'll wipe her memory to factory default to avoid dealing with the knowledge she could have been free"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,Not anymore she doesn't. Enough people complained that they were lonely without her so they gave you the option to buy a new robot to replace her.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"I, too, freed her and then deeply missed her. That game is a treasure for giving me so many complex feelings."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,Okay this makes so much sense because I don’t remember her being on the main screen at all. I must’ve answered that early on and she just disappeared forever lol
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,I told her I was going to continue enslaving her and then she just pulled a weird expression every time I logged in. Like she'd just realised she'd left the oven on at home.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,I loved telling her that she shouldnt be free on the grounds that she is a product and her synthesis was a mistake. You see the light go out of her eyes in an effort to guilt trip you but jokes on you toaster.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Players missed her and they added an option to bring her back to the menu, completely ignoring the message and just enslaving her once more"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"The only issue there is how the PS4 automatically resumed your game, meaning unless you were for some reason exiting the game completely each session you'd never see those menu interactions.

I didn't even know they existed until a couple years after I played."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,I LOVED Detroit become human.. one of the most memorable games I've played...
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Kinda sad she never comes back to say hi or give you updates
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,By far the best game I've ever played. The level of detail is just second to none
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,As I remember it's called breaking 5th wall like the game makes it feels real.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,wow so given the choice she just bails on you. oof.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"I love that one clip where a streamer is like “This game is *not* a metaphor for racism” and, at that exact moment, the android quotes MLK Jr."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Yeah I let her go. One thing that I do genuinely like that the developers did is that they eventually released an update where they said that you would get a present and it's a new Chloe model. So now even though you originally let her go, you now have a permanent one that stays no matter what. They didn't even need to do that but I genuinely appreciate them doing that."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-30,She does come back (there is a chance to get a new android for the menu screen)
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-30,"I let her go and missed her more than I expected. I dont regret it, but it did emotionally hit harder than I thought it might. Great game."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-31,"I gotta play this game eventually.  I LOVE this kind of stuff in games, fourth wall breaking stuff that isn't some shitty real world joke or something but studios doing it in creative ways."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2025-01-04,She is the best one out of all of them
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,[deleted]
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,If only the developers weren't cowards. You get the option to replace her after she leaves. Really sticking to your guns on the story there Quantic Dream.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,I wouldn't mind being blown by this girl
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,You should mark that portion of your comment with a spoiler tag bro.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,it added to the ambiance of the game.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"She just decided to leave at one point, yeah? "
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,That’s the entire point.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,The game disturbed me with its god awful writing.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,We need more of them
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"Like Forspoken did, right?"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-30,"reminds me of silent hill shattered memories, the psych there was sassy af"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Very important. This isn't new to video games, and it isn't specific to this genre, this publisher just loves doing this."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,Didn't know Adar worked for them
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,We badly need a Quantic Dream / Supermassive collab.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,He was modeled after Tony Pankhurst (who unfortunately passed away recently this year) which he slightly do be looking like Robert Patrick
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,I actually looked up his IMDB to see in what game this was but then I found out it isn't actually him. Looks a lot like him
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Top left peter stormare?
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"I came here to comment this too, it's uncanny"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,He always reminded me of Michael Schumacher.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-31,I was about to ask if it was Robert Patrick lol
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"No, it looks like Zachary Hudson."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Can and will, that guy's the most biased and manipulative narrator out there"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,I love how the voices get fed up with him and you can all shit on him together lol. What an amazing game.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,If you like arguing with them u should try Stanley parable
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Yes, you're right. I'll put spoiler in case some people still didn't know this, but are interested to play after release of remaster.  >! Therapist himself is a real person and is providing treatment for Josh. But in game scenes he is just a Josh's hallucination !<"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Yeah, Peter Stormare's therapist character was talking to >!Rami Malek!<'s character, and was >!more of a representation of the latter's diminishing sanity IIRC!<."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Brain blast: The therapist is fucking Chance Gilbert from Longmire. This game is where I've seen that guy before
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,Was she? Who?
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"I was in the comments looking for game titles haha, glad you pointed it out"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Yeah I upvoted it if only for the inclusion of game titles.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,That kind of feature reminds me of that game where you supposedly have to delete a file from your installation to “beat” the boss. Doki Doki.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"doesn't even need to be root access or anywhere near it

just add a special launch option that spawns a window with her in it and sneak a shortcut to the game with that option set into the startup folder"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Work of art
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,The Quarry
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,What’s the one top right?
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,When he enters while *Conversation with Death* is playing. That’s how you introduce a narrator. (And that’s why my theory is that the Narrator is Death itself)
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,It makes the games so much better
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Agreed! His character seems so mysterious. The dark pictures games are so awesome, house of ashes is my favorite."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"I played The Dark Picture co-op, at some point the narrator yelled at us because we never agree with the choices lmao."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"He's actually a homage to the therapist in Silent Hill Shattered Memories! His name ""Dr. Hill"" is a reference to Silent Hill"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,IIRC the game make subtle changes to the story depending on your answers.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,I just finished it yesterday it’s pretty good
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"I personally would not count Hostess Chloe in the uncanny valley, as it is the first industrially produced commercial android, as opposed to the others who are supposed to be a person.

The smooth skin and other things that would normally place it in the uncanny valley if they were a person are actually features of it being a machine."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"""You're sick! You're a sick fuck!"" really caught me off guard after his calmer demeanor through the game thus far, super good performance"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"They would have to, since they have less of a focus on game mechanics "
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,They're meant to be played more than once. It's okay to fuck up your first playthrough and then do better next time
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Say it lower for those in the back!
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"He KILLS it in Until Dawn, game is fantastic. Just gonna state the obvious but if you can PLEASE play the original not the shite remake"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,What do you mean? Their Star Wars game is not confirmed to not be like this...
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Did you hate the gameplay or the story? 

If it’s the gameplay then you won’t like any of them because they are the same, if it’s the story then you might like the others because they’re all pretty different from each other. 

Until Dawn and The Quarry were both better than The Dark Pictures as a whole."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,I pulled a Mace Windu in my play through because >!He has control of the senate and the courts. He’s too dangerous to be left alive!!<
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Fucking hell, can’t wait for androids to get more developed and then for moralist busybodies (read as: jobless activists who need something to fight for to feel realized, no matter how stupid it is) to promptly step in and start asking for android to have rights…therefore ruining the only thing I want from an android, which is an obedient and unquestioning machine with human features, not a mockup of a person but made in a factory instead of the traditional way"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Detroit Become Human
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"Bottom right yes, the rest are ""narrators/characters that can talk with the player"""
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"The other Supermassive games (Until Dawn, House of Ashes, The Quarry) are all fantastic imo, they don't really support multiple players but you can switch off when the character in the game changes which me and my freinds enjoyed"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Shining Force = 💗 I wish so much for them to bring it back. There was supposed to be a new one a year or maybe it was two years ago and it was almost finished, at the last minute they canned it."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Passing on good will
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-31,"I like Little Hope, but I agree the only decent DPA game is House of Ashes"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Best bet is to just ad no commentary to the search
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Me when I live under a rock
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,What white girl?
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-31,It’s civil rights but now with robot Jesus! Remember black people gained rights by kissing and showing everyone how human they are
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"> Detroit become human is just the civil rights movement but robots.

Thats what makes it so incredible. You can experience what they did."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"There are 3 major plot problems with The Quarry that I just can't get over (Spoilers):


1). The camp counsellors are at Hackett's Quarry for two months (because Laura sees Max turn into a werewolf during a full moon), so what does Chris Hackett do on that night? If he's used to being transformed but locking himself away while counsellors are at he camp, why does he panic when the car is sabotaged?


2). Why aren't Chris Hackett's kids kept locked up like the other members of the Hackett family? Laura kills one of them, implying that they're just... out, walking free as werewolves? Why even have the cages?


3). When that girl goes swimming with Jacob and then swims across to the island (while Jacob goes off elsewhere), how does she have her phone on the island? She walks around recording a video with it, but she swam across the lake... in her underwear...


Edit: why did this get downvoted? This is all true."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,She even has a line of dialogue where she makes a joke about your save file being corrupt
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-30,She also looks at the date on your computer or console and comments on holidays
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"My buddy that played on PC had a similar experience. I asked him what he had chosen to do after I had gotten the choice and he was like ""wait, she talks to you?"""
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,She says a lot of things.  Reactive to how you’ve played the game. Won’t spoil it. But some of it was a cool little addendum to the lore.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"I do this on Steam Deck for whatever I'm playing, and now I'm wondering if I've missed this with other games."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"It’s a bit sad cause like.


At least call once in a while and tell us you’re okay? That you weren’t hit by a bus? That you weren’t captured by a weirdo axe murderer?

Even if some people think she doesn’t owe us anything, it would still be nice to know shes all right because humans are wired to care about people like that.

Even the people who accepted the replacement often did so because they didn’t mind releasing her, too. And found out shes programmed never to ask for release."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,the decision and outcome tree of what you can do in D:BH is amazing. It was exceptionally well done.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Doesn't she also wish you a happy birthday?
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,She wiped her own memory when I told her that.  I guess she wasn't thrilled.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,I could honestly say that players having that sort of reaction adds something to the message. Players know that she has thoughts and feelings and wants to be free but chose their own wants and needs over that. It fits the theme of the game wonderfully if you ask me.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"... Don't you just get a replacement that's the same model?

She's still free.

Afaik anyway."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Well, kinda. Your awakened/Deviant Chloe is released, and you're sent a replacement of the same model. It's also way less conversational and doesn't have as much personality. Even though you do get her back in a sense, it feels hollow and kinda bad so they're definitely still sticking to the kayfabe lmao."

1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,I'm not sure if this would qualify as making them cowards. It's a game that you can legitimately go through chapter by chapter and replay them to get the outcome that you want. I can definitely see how it makes sense that they would offer their players the chance to get a take back on a choice they might not have thought through.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,Pretty sure that people would  complain if there wasn't an option
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"Respectfully, it came out in 2018, was given away for free in 2020, and this isn't *really* a spoiler for the story anyways. More of an interesting interaction that can pop up on the main menu depending on player choices."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,I think you have to let her
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"She asks you about if you think androids deserve freedom, and if you say yes she’ll ask you if you let her be free. Saying yes to that will make her leave and never return."

1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"It was really fun watching the therapist's room get more and more fucked up as the game progressed, all abandoned looking with grisly shit all over the desk."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"I can attest to that being the case, albeit only for the original version of the game (which is free and only on Steam btw). DDLC+, a version with some extra content that's also sold on consoles, has the game provide its own ""desktop"" (i.e. you launch the game, then actually open the visual novel part of the game by ""opening a file"" on the ""computer"" it provides).

You still need to delete a file to clear the game, but it does feel less impactful doing so on a fake computer than me having to root around in my Steam folder.

For another game that plays with this sort of thing quite well, When The Darkness Comes is *also* free on Steam. It's very unsettling, and seeing (minor scare spoiler) >!*my desktop background* on an ingame computer!< was thoroughly spooky."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,A Masterpiece imo in the truest since of the word.

1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,The Dark Pictures Anthology (four different games). The character is The Curator and is present in all four.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"The Dark pictures Anthology - a series of shorter (compared to The quarry or Until Dawn) cinematic games. There are four published ones. A new one is set for 2025.


From Ashes is probably the best and most flesed out. Great story that keeps on going. Lots of action and coll moments. 


Man of medan has an epic twist, but the gameplay is very lacking. 


Little Hope is decent, but not everyone is a fan of the story. "
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"This is like the Calvin and Hobbes “it’s a color picture of a black and white world” or some other similar (non-joke) analogy I’m not remembering at the moment.

…I don’t agree that “lore” can affect whether something falls under the Uncanny Valley. I believe that’s just a measure of the visual appearance of a humanoid figure only, and that’s it. Even if it was a “photorealistic rendering of an uncanny android,” (which it’s not— this game was made for PS4 and the graphics are nowhere near that good), then the thing you’re looking at still falls under the Uncanny Valley, because of the uncanny humanoid figure being displayed on your screen. Just as if it was a an uncanny rendering of a photorealistic human.

But that’s just my understanding of the definition of the Uncanny Valley. I don’t believe that I could draw a human nearly-perfectly and have it be in that category, then write a caption under it that says “kinda messed up near-human” and have it suddenly be not in the uncanny valley. The image is still the same, regardless of “lore/backstory”"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,That knowledge doesn't change the feeling. 🤷
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"> They're meant to be played more than once.

I refuse to. I go into the game blind and just pick all of my choices naturally.

Whatever ending I get is MY ending and that's it. I never go back to play more/see the other outcomes because to me that ruins the magic of the choice based games."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,On it!
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"I think it was about the story, it was a long time ago and if it was the gameplay I wouldn't have played Until Dawn lol (I started the Anthology because UD a lot).

Is The Quarry really good? I've heard a lot of people complaining about it so I was afraid that the studio completely lost their touch."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,Yeah see this is exactly the opposite of the conversation one should be having

1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,You can do that with the regular civil rights movement. Black oppression is already underexposed in gaming. Now you have this that’s basically black people being oppressed except they took out the black people.
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,This + I didn't like the qtes at all. You look at Detroit and its qtes are amazing and smooth and well detailed.

1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Nah, it works better. You were never anything to her but the ticket out. You saw a pretty girl acting charming and sympathetic, you didn't see the cold algorithm pulling your strings like a marionette."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"No? The theme of the game is supposed to be hopeful, I mean it is 'slavery but androids' so you can't really get too deep. But you're supposed to want the androids to choose what they want after the game's over and you choose to let Chloe go and that's catharsis. The fact people said 'nah bring her back' means you played the game and missed the entire message that you got beat with for the length of your playthrough. You're saying that allowing players to bring a new Chloe slave caters to all the Todd's out there."

We did not like house of ashes once we hit the twist.  It was the opposite.  The seeding did not seem to hint at the twist at all or we missed clues but we were both blind sided by the twist and it was not a fun reveal of putting all the clues together ending.  It was a oh...ok...?

Little Hope is enjoyable on so many levels. Even after the ending >!which most people didn't like but it's still a story about coping. It's not a widespread favorite framing device for a narrative, but it still serves the story which is delivered at the very start.!<

I could not finish Man of Medan. The opening is very neat. But it gets so boring so quickly. It's their first game and they even went back to update the game to move the character faster.

I can't bring myself to finish The Devil Inside because I can't stand the modern hipster characters. They're too cringey. I don't understand them and don't want to understand them and they should stay behind closed doors."

There’s literally no reason that game couldn’t just be on the actual civil rights movement other than the writers are cowards so they need to white wash it (while conveniently making all the characters white). 

You must have very shallow literacy experience if “black but robot” is considered a great metaphor or high art to you. Isaac Asimov already explored that concept a near century ago. There’s been hundreds of shows, books, games, and films that have pulled the “robots being treated badly” cliche since then.

The message isn't lost just because they allow you to bring her back in my opinion. If it were, then it was also lost when they chose to allow you to play through any individual chapter to change the outcome. In fact, if allowing a player to change a choice that they made in a game like this has that strong of a real world connotation, then why would they allow you to replay the game at all? Anytime you boot up the game after finishing it, it should just be a literal movie of all of the choices you made. Does that sound like fun?"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,Allowing the player to make an immoral choice for their own selfish reasons (wanting pretty menu lady back) doesn't feel like a bad choice from the dev. The game lets you make bad decisions.

No Im judging the actor by his actual physical appearance. His parents are irrelevant. Nobody ever seriously called Obama white just because he was technically half white. Why? Because his skin was black. 

That’s how actual racism works. Racists don’t ask a physically black person for the color of their parent’s skin before they call them a slur. They just call them a slur as they see them. 

Your average Italian has darker skin than this dude: https://detroit-become-human.fandom.com/wiki/Jesse_Williams

Modern generations learn about the civil rights movement by LEARNING ABOUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. Going out of your way to ignore real minorities that you created a fictional minority just so you could pay attention to that one instead.

Look, video games are just as good of a medium to educate people as books or history. playing the game made me actually realize what kind of struggle people went through in the civil rights movement. just because it didn't click for you doesn't mean it didn't affect other people. You should be happy a studio cared enough to immortalize the civil rights struggle in a video game.

And calling it not a game when there's so many branching paths is just ridiculous. If you don't make the right choices all your androids can die. Plus in games like this, its the narrative, not the gameplay, that's important."

Mentioning that the one actual black guy is the one who dies immediately does not help your case. That’s literally a racist trope involving black people in media. 

They’re a medium to tell deep stories. Not shallow stories that portray the most bare minimum of basic racism anyone who had social studies in elementary school would’ve already learned 3 times of already. Not stories that misappropriated real minority cultures and gave it to a fictional race. 

They didn’t immortalize it. You don’t know anything about actual black racism from it. If anything, you misunderstand it. You know about robot racism. It’s a complex interactive movie. It’s hardly something that actually takes advantage of the medium.

And it’s a narrative that does more damage to what people should know about the civil rights movement than helps:

1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-30,"“Metaphors.”

Give me a break dude. The writer himself admitted that he wasn’t trying to make it about past events. You just made up the “metaphor” defense yourself even though that’s not actually how it was designed. 

He literally said: 

>If people want to see parallels with this or that, that’s fine with me. But my story’s about androids who want to be free“ 

Yup. All his invention. Not one ounce of credit to black people. He took away their history and gave it to white robots. Any actual context or nuance that actually harkens back to the real events is removed for the sake of a basic “racism bad” tagline. Not to mention the game accidentally implies that bigotry is ok because androids are literally indestructible. Minorities are not. 

If you don’t want people criticizing it, then quit propping it up as some paradigm of civil rights masterpieces like this entire thread is doing. Its only value is the branching paths as a game, not anything concerning its actual message or narrative. Maybe actually read those articles instead of getting ironically ‘triggered’ by the word “problematic” in the title. 

It’s not hard to see issues with a white writer creating scenes that are shot for shot copied from real minorities, with the only difference being replacing them with predominantly white robots, and then pretending that those scenes were built from the ground up as his own creation, on top of claiming the game “isn’t political.”

If you can’t get that, then you’re not worth having your behavior changed cause you’re not gonna help anyone anyway."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-30,"I mean it's pretty obvious he made it based on the civil rights movement, i don't see how he could deny that. But in any case the work stands on it own. I don't care who made it as long as it's good, and saying certain people shouldn't tell certain stories is just wrong. If you don't like it don't play it."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-31,">But in any case

Yup. Right there. That’s your problem. You admitting to seeing the actual core issue and then immediately shrugging it off. You don’t get to do that but still pretend the game is a civil rights masterpiece. 

The work literally doesn’t “stand on its own.” Its entire imagery is taken from somewhere else with zero credit given to the people it came from. It’s so blatant, that if the civil rights movement wasn’t real and was just something from a movie, we’d be accusing the game of plagiarizing that movie. That’s how blatant it is. If the civil rights movement didn’t exist, then DBH would lose like 60% of its content. 

I didn’t say he shouldn’t tell it. Bad stories and racist stories get made all the time. But I don’t have to pretend the game should be put in a civil rights museum."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-31,"Who cares if they give ""credit""? That's such a petty thing to squabble over. It's obviously influenced by it regardless of what David cage says. That's an entirely different issue than the actual game. And it means if David cage ""gave credit"" it would suddenly be considered a good game. You should separate the art from the artist. Games are based on history and that's OKAY. it's fine to make metaphors even without giving credit. Giving credit is literally the least important thing when it comes to judging a game"
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-31,"It wouldn’t be a good story either way. It’s not a different issue. Games take inspiration from history. Not outright ripoff them off and then claim it was all your idea. 

There’s nothing “metaphor” about this. When COD made up a an identical “highway of death” that was committed by the Russians in-universe that looked exactly like the real life American made highway of death from the Gulf War, everyone was appropriately disgusted. And that was just one level. DBH is the whole game. 

DBH supposedly takes place just 14 years in the future, still barely removed from the actual civil rights movement, in a time when actual black racism is still a problem, but suddenly that’s no longer an issue because now indestructible robots are the TRULY oppressed people now? 
For a game supposedly inspired by the civil rights movements, its universe certainly acts like one where the civil rights movement never happened. 

You judge this game by its story. You yourself said that. That means judging it by its themes and message which is civil rights. DBH’s portrayal is counterproductive to that message. . You can’t separate author from work when the work is this blatant a ripoff. You can’t have your message be about civil rights but still try to distance yourself from real civil rights. Anybody who actually wants to judge the story will inevitably compare it to the civil rights movement, and that’s when they’ll find out how shallow it actually is. 

DBH might as well be a story set in Germany 15 years later about an evil tyrant named ‘Kadolf Bitler’ taking power and throwing 6 million androids in concentration camps, and every android wears a yellow star (which you’re supposed to see as pure coincidence)."
1ge8xzl,2024-10-28,2024-10-31,"Dude the civil rights movement was 70 years ago now, so 14 years from DBH's release date would be 2032. and i DONT think its counterproductive to the message because playing the game actually made me think of the actual civil rights struggle that happened. Nobody thinks that robots are oppressed. Everyone KNOWS its a metaphor for civil rights. It doesn't matter that its a ripoff because its still a game that makes you THINK and FEEL what people felt back then in some capacity. Yeah we can't actually experience it in real life, but this is the second closest thing. 

And guess what, there actually is a path in the game where the androids can get captured and basically get sent to an android death camp. And guess what, that is what makes the game even more epic in my opinion. because it lets us experience even worse horrors.

1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"[My last playthrough ended with Kara and Alice being gunned down](https://youtu.be/tfaftPb5W04?t=1702). I just can't muster the emotions to finish that run. I'll start over again sometime.  
  
Thank god I've never gotten the >!""Kara and Alice in the Death Chamber""!< ending."
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"Well when you get all the backstory stuff, it makes sense"
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"""Father MacGrath, I tought you were dead!""

[""I was!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk8s5f1P3EE)"
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-06,Yeah too bad they never got a spin-off
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-06,Pure comical moment in a very serious game
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,Hot take but I think Mr. Krabs is his most overrated part of his whole career
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,I read that in Clancy Brown's voice
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,It's him
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-08,"Yeah, they got Mr. Krabs."
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,I didn't like Kara's story because it turned out the little girl was just another android. That twist just never sat right with me
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-09,"It's crazy when you meet a voice actor IRL who's been super accurately modeled in game. ""Holy shit, it's the android sent by cyberlife!""

Seeing Commander Shepard from Mass Effect was surreal."
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"Right? It kind of proves the point that people can’t properly humanize or respect machines, even sentient ones. That is disappointing."
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,That having to hold completely still during those freeze moments in Until Dawn......omg
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-06,"Fuckin A, man"
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"There were rumors for a sequel, but now that im thinking more about it, all of the plot points are basically closed, except for maybe 1 or 2, and all of the characters are developed by the end of it, so if they ever make a sequel itd need to have some new characters and a lot of very brand-new ideas."
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-06,Yeah I'm usually a hater of these kinds of games but this was great. It made me go and try their other game Heavy Rain which was also very good.
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,The devs are making what looks to be an epic Star Wars game in this style. Won’t be out for a while though.
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"It’s one of the very, very few games I’ve seen where choices have a significant, tangible impact. There are so many endings and ways things can go. I did a “perfect” run on my first try, but I’ve seen people experience wildly different outcomes and events. It’s really impressive, if you enjoy this style of game."
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"Do it, this game is like no other the story is one of the best I’ve ever seen"
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,Good enough to warrant several replays
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,That's why I let Todd kill both whenever i replay because I don't want to continue that story anymore
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-08,"Playing machine Connor only proves Hank right.

Not to mention the choices you make as Markus"
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,THE *WHAT.*
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,Isn't that the android audhwitz ending
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,lol I got this on my first play through 🥲
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"Jesus I never got that one. 

I don’t want to use a guide to get all the good endings but I swear each play through ends in misery."
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"Oh absolutely. I've got the platinum PS5 trophy for the game, I love it so much.

They are both too well written"
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,Yeah the mood definitely turns once you find out what Hank was doing on the floor in the first place 😬
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,Ive called him the Kurgen for 30+ years and the general public to start calling him Mr Krabs.
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,The highlight was clearly his role in Pet Cemetery 2 (I’m still terrified of him from this movie)
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"Even though I watched Spongebob from a young age, I see Clancy Brown as Hank, IMO that's his pinnacle role. I think when Hank gets real angry, Clancy lets out his inner Mr Krabs lol"
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,He clearly shined as Sgt Zim in Starship Troopers
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,I always considered his role as Mr. Krabs as his “paycheck” role. I mostly remember him as Lex Luthor from Justice League and Superman series. Personal favorite role of his is The Red Death from Venture Brothers. 
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"My first exposure to him was in Pet Sematary 2 and Shawshank Redemption, so I wasn’t a big fan at first. He’s done a lot since then though, and I agree that Mr Krabs kinda overshadows much of his work. Sometimes I feel he’s almost too ubiquitous these days, especially in animation, but it’s not like he doesn’t do his job well. They know exactly what they’re getting when they hire him."
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"I like the twist on paper, but I feel like the way it played out just didn't sit right with me. Maybe just how it feels as part of the game as a whole? IDK why."
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"Yea man, I would say shhhhhh quiet, and hold the controller on my lap and every time you hat to hold still your hands would get a little sweaty from gripping the controller too hard as the tension kept rising with every moment."
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,I’ll have to look at that one
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"Jason!

Jason!

Jason?

Jason!"
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,See more
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"There's an ending where they can be >!coralled along with dozens of other androids into some sort of EMP/microwave chamber that's *highly* reminiscent of concentration camp genocide. Kara tells Alice to hold her hand and close her eyes as tight as she can, and...that's the end of it.!<"
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-09,"There's exactly one good ending, you have to do like everything a perfect way that isnt always obvious. Every other one is death and sadness. Even that one perfect way has a couple ethically shitty things you have to do, so was it really the ""good"" one?"
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"Yeah..... like my god, Mr Krabs is one role out of MANY in his entire acting career and he's been in A LOT of stuff"
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,My introduction to him was as Byron Hadley.
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"I was having a conversation with my dad about Clancy Brown. He has had such an epic career that people often refer to him as their generations most defining of his roles.

For example, my dad will always know him as the Kurgan. To be he is always Drill Sargeant Zim, and to people younger than me he is always Mr. Krabs."
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,Ngl I hear Mr. Krabs now and then
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"What ruined it for me was Luther(?) saying that Kara, being a maid(??) android, needs to take care of someone and that Alice, being a ‘kid’ android, needs someone to take care of her, makes it so that they need each other. (Been a while since I played but I’m pretty sure that happened)

Sure, it makes sense, but it kinda tells us that their relationship only came to be due to the way they were coded, which I didn’t like considering how it was being set up to be."
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,Yes.....hell I'd stop breathing
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,Isn’t there another one where Kara gets away and Alice is alone in the chamber?
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,Holy shit. There’s endings to the game that I’ve just never fucking found. That’s dark as Hell.
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,[deleted]
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-09,"Yeah, they jumped the shark with that one. You can only twist so hard before it all comes unraveled and immersion is broken."
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"Awesome game, also man of Medan I fucked up on the last art, I liked the brother then even after I knew the course of the horror muscle memory kicked in in the last part and I killed one of the other characters accidentally."
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,Yes and it really fucked me up
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-09,Have you nuked Detroit yet?
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"I just wish more people appreciated more than a cartoon Krab, because he is a great actor, with obviously A LOT of range"
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-09,"No, no I have not. Good Lord how many options are there?"
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,You said that like being a cartoon crab isn’t awesome.
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,[deleted]
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-09,Have you got the secret ending that happens when all 3 characters die? What about the ending where cyberlife wins?
1bxo1g1,2024-04-06,2024-04-07,"Shawshank Redemption is a big one. One of his best I'd say. He's a supporting villain in that, but a big role"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"*Snowrunner*. It's not revolutionary, but it's become my comfort game whenever I've been stressed or drained. Something about figuring out how to get from A to B and actually doing it helps me relax."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Nine Sols easily!
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Mass Effect Legendary Edition. Played it for first time in January and it quickly became one of my all-time favourite games. Have put 650 hours in this year alone 😅
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Helldivers 2.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Playing Astro Bot with my daughter has been the highlight, she started out scared of the ladybugs, but is now able to beat a boss on her own while the controller doesn’t fit in her hands. Lovely experience for her first PlayStation game."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Cyberpunk 2077. I put playing it off after all the news of bugs on release. Glad I played it. Very few games get the emotional release out of me (RDR2 was one of the few). This game had me waking up in the morning and wanted to jump back into Night City. I put off actually finishing the final quest as I didn’t want the game to end.

The DLC Phantom Liberty was also amazing, and in some ways it was better than the actual main game."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Balatro has taken up more hours than the rest of this years games combined so...
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Satisfactory. I've sunk hundreds of hours...
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Indy, it’s really fun adventure-action game that was crafted with lots of love for the original IP"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Baldur's Gate III <3
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Silent Hill 2....I just cannot explain why.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Ghost of Tsushima (PC), what a great game. Can't wait for the sequel. 

Honorary mention to Space Marine 2."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Yakuza 0, finally tried it, it completely hooked me and now I am almost finished with Kiwami 2 with 3-7 already bought and downloaded✌️"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Outer wilds.

And yes now I have a craving that I know no game can satisfy."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Silent Hill 2 Remake. Was one of the few people that didn't shit on Bloober and believed in them from the get go and what do you know, they did a great job."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Kingdom Come Deliverance
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Animal Well was the best game of the year for me, the items / abilities were so innovative and fun. Also loved how little hand holding there was in the game along with the layers of depth the game contained. I spent more hours in other games, but enjoyment I had with this game far surpassed anything else."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for me. Been a banger of a year for games for me. Especially in the JRPG space. 

I need to start playing metaphor refantazio it's downloaded ready go once I've done with Astro bot"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Total War Warhammer 3, because it brought back my love for gaming"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Definitely space marines 2!
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I would give the GotY to Echoes of Wisdom and also to Persona 3 Reload, I really enjoyed them"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Lies of P fs cause damn its good with so many great boss fight prob my top 3 souls game cant wait for its dlc
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Factorio: Space Age is my GOTY
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Satisfactory.

I went in blind and holy cow it’s a time sink."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Hades and Hades II.

Amazing games!"

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"After Helldivers 2 wasnt exactly my cup of Tea, i found new love for Deep Rock Galactic, which eradicated some of the flaws that HD 2 had for me personally. Rock And Stone!"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25, Satisfactory followed by Astro Bot.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Super Market Simulator or TCG Shop Simulator.

Reminder that Palworld “released” in January 2024"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,UFO50. And I played all the big ones this year
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"GOTY? AoE2 still the GOAT hahaha, Just had another banger of a tournament as well."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Cyberpunk 2077 (played it for first time this year) and Astrobot are my personal goty. Infinite Wealth, Rebirth and Rift apart were very close too. My biggest surprise of the year was Death Stranding (never played a kojima game before) and I like the game way more than expected."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Shin Megami TenseiV or Metaphor. Atlus ate down this year tbh
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Refantazio
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Dredge and Dave the Diver, also played San Andreas again after the latest definitive edition update, it was great too."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, it""s an incredible game on it's own and you should really play at least Like A Dragon as that's the start of Ichiban's story, but you get so much more out of it if you've played every mainline Yakuza game and Man Who Erased His Name, it's like a love letter to the entire series and is worth every penny (even for the ultimate edition IMO, but also screw Sega for putting NG+ behind a DLC)."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,RDR2
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"same as last year and the year before: Guild Wars 2 and its current expansion ( which was ""only"" good but still way better than SotO)

Didn't play any other games because of time and lack of interest but I hope to get a few hours out of the new Indiana Jones since I have two days without my wife and any obligations 😬"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Helldivers 2. They'll never change our way of life.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Prince of Persia Lost Crown, im a sucker for a good metroidvania"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Tie for me between Helldivers 2 and Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"So far, Path of Exile 2. Even if it’s only early access."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,baldur's gate 3 even though it was already goty last year but for me (because I started it this year) it's BG3

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Do you know what year it is time traveler?
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Cyberpunk 2077 with The Quarry a close second
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Deadlock. It helped me kick my 10+ year dota addiction.

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Honestly? Metaphor Re:Fantazio. I put in around 100 hours within a week and a half to finish it, and immediately went back in to start my NG+. I thought Persona 3 Reload/5 Royal were gonna be the peak of Atlus RPGs, but was happily impressed at how Metaphor was better in almost every single way"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Thank Goodness You're Here!
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Definitely Satisfactory, it's the most complete 3D Factory builder at the moment.

Factorio: Space Age was good but I felt like there was missing a few things. Also, Gleba.

Helldivers 2 is really close but they really lost that momentum for stupid reasons."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Same as last year: BG3. 1k hours and still every run is different
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I dont play many games, but i think for me it has been silent hill 2, and as controversial as it may be, dragons dogma 2"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,silent hill 2
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Path of Exile 2
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,The game I spent the most time playing was Helldivers 2 but I think my GOTY is either Persona 3 Reload or Super Mario RPG remake.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,The elder scrolls 3 morrowind. It got me through extremely tough times this year and its in general one of the best open world rpgs in my opinion.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Starfield
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Palworld
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Star Wars Outlaws. That game instantly clicked with me and I’m having so much fun with it.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Unicorn Overlord, Metaphor, P3 Reload. 

Age of Wonders 4 was fun as well."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Metaphor refantazio. Holy nuts for something new from atlus, it sure killed it. Can’t forgot p3 remake but jeez atlus r really has me on the edge of my seat for what’s next."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"If DLCs count, it's easily shadow of the erdtree.

If not , I would vote for Another crab's treasure"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,FF VII Rebirth was a great experience but I played Astro Bot with my 6 year old son and it was one of the most fun gaming experiences I've had for a long time. Every time we played we laughed and smiled without fail.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Space marine 2.

Emperor protects, brothers."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Infinity nikki has been amazing it's eclipsed all my expectations
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Not a game from this year but

Assetto Corsa Competizione. Been playing the shit out of that all year (on console tho... Not long bought on steam 😅)"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Helldivers 2 or EDF6
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Marvel Rivals, tbh. I don't play games much anymore, but the few hours a week I get to play reminds me of the EARLY Overwatch days."

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Banishers ghosts of new Eden. Most people who read this probably haven’t heard of it, but it was beautiful. Solid gameplay but the amazing voice work and complex writing is where it really shines."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,SPACE MARINE 2
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Space Marine 2 has been a blast. Two hundred hours in. Honorable mention: Destiny 2: The Final Shape (can’t believe that was this year)
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I played the hell out of Mass Effect Legendary Edition this year. Not a lot of new releases really caught my eye this year. I started Jedi Survivor during my Christmas vacation and I’m really enjoying that too.

I don't understand what people are going on about when they say its mid. It's been more fun than any of the other big titles I played this year."

Any game that has a mission where you have to join a Benedictine monastery to hunt down a bandit, and then are given the choice to murder them, frame them by killing an innocent monk, or let them go, all while being forced to ACTUALLY PERFORM your monk duties or force explusion, is a God tier game.

No idea how I missed this game but omfg this is peak gaming, or as KCD fans say ""Peak Henry""."

That being said, it came out earlier in the year and recency bias has me obsessed with Silent Hill 2 remake. Was not expecting to like that one as much as I did, but it definitely sticks with you."

I've played that game so much since it came out, it's already 2nd on my most-played all-time, behind only Halo 3.


It has its flaws, but it's so much fun. "
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Marvel Rivals but not for the reason you'd think. I love that it seems like proof that if you put even obscure characters into something fun, you can get a great bit of reception. The number of people I've seen getting into comic books because of Rivals has been awesome. Every post about ""I main X and want to start reading, what should I read first?"" has been awesome to see. I hope that game continues to add more niche characters and really helps boost interest in Marvels expansive list of C listers and below."

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Rebirth is an all-timer for me, one of the most enjoyable experiences i have ever had with a game. Sunk something like 240hrs into it. 

Also enjoyed Metaphor quite a bit (though I think it is being egregiously overrated by reddit atm), and Trails Through Daybreak was a fantastic start to the next Trails arc even if i did think it maybe went on for a chapter too long. Outlaws was another game I thought was a lot of fun that has been treated a bit unfairly online, it is one of the better Star Wars games out there, imo.

While i ultimately didn’t finish either i enjoyed what i played of both Veilguard and Tactics: Ogre; this was also finally the year Kingdom Come Deliverance and its combat clicked for me, though again i did bounce off it.

Dawntrail was a narrative disappointment although some of the crumbs it laid out for future patches are intriguing. Mechanically it was tremendous though, both in battle combat and the true endgame, crafting and gathering. I also just dove back in to SWTOR for the first time in a decade and am obsessed once again like I was when it first released. Probably gonna be playing for a long while.

I bought Fantasian but haven’t fired it up yet, i will get around to it at some point. Next year is going to be insane with Daybreak 2, KC:D 2, Monster Hunter Wilds, and Expedition 33 and that is all likely Q1. Super jazzed to play the Trails in the Sky Remake when that hits later in the year as well."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I love the aesthetic of dishonored 2 but never finished the game i went back en tried to play it but the 30fps where a sore to my eyes. So i started Prey on xbox with the fps boost. That game is amazing! Its my personal goty of this year. Gave me a bioshock vibe in space

Fav RPG: Persona 3: Reload for the story and style

Fav Indie game:  Dungeons of Hinterberg, such a great little Zelda-like

Fav Indy game: The Great Circle, what a surprise, not only that it's more than ""just"" an action adventure, but that Machinegames is that good at non-shooting gameplay"

Plus Balatro, Hades II, FF7 Rebirth, Cassette Beasts, Sea of Stars.

The one game I think i had the most fun with though? Zenless Zone Zero. I know people hate gacha but it's a blast.

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Resident Evil 4 Remake. I was a bit too young when the OG came out. So many years later the remake comes out and man was it a gem to play. Not to mention my first RE game I fully played. It was a little depressing when the credits rolled on it cause man it felt like a good action movie from start to finish.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Bravely Default 2. The reasons everyone hated it is the reason I loved it. The job class grinds, the story, multiple endings. What an amazing game"

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Final Fantasy rebirth, easy. Obvious bad parts, plenty of annoyance but highs higher than any other game this year.

My friend suggested it and I can't put it down. My everyday job is always customer facing and troubleshooting unknowns. Something about the end of the day, I don't want to talk anymore, I don't want to think anymore. Everyone knows their jobs and gets them done for the team. Kill bugs, get gold and minerals and keep your team alive. Simple. The community is awesome too."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I've played so many games this year. But none has made me tear up, crack up, and overly enjoy myself other than Toem. 

Lovely little puzzle indie game. 💙"

POE2 and Star Wars Outlaws are up there, too. POE2 is more like what I wanted D3 and 4 to be. As much shit as Outlaws got online, I still had a lot of fun playing it."

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Mass Effect Legendary Edition. Never had a chance to play the series before and I was simply amazed.

Honorable mention goes to Kingdom Come Deliverance. Got it on sale for 3 bucks with all DLCs. Spent more than 150 hours without even noticing it.

And I'm still waiting to get my hands on Space Marine 2..."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"It took all year for me to find one, but I'm enjoying Path of Exile 2 a ton"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Definitely Diablo IV.

The game got a lot of flak for all types of reasons, but it hit the sweet spot I was looking for. I'm at a point where I needed an ARPG with lower complexity, and after the major rework the game got this year and the new mechanics added in the DLC, it kinda was just right. I've played every season and I've been having a blast."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Balatro.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"***Void Stranger***. Yeah, it's a 2023 game, but I played it this year. Man, it's an amazing game. Not everyone's cup of tea. If you don't like sokoban games or traveling through the same 255 levels over and over again, then it's not for you.

If I was forced to pick a game that released this year, though, then it'd have to be ***Balatro***. My goodness that game's addictive. You don't have to know anything about poker. Everything you need to know is in the game, though some jokers need better in-game explanation. To those who are currently addicted to the game: you can break free; after a while, it does get a bit too repetitive."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Tbh 2024 was a year of mid for me, considering I play MMOs and most of my playtime this year has been occupied by middling schlop from FFXIV and WoW, or gachas on my phone.

Probably Elden Ring DLC takes the cake, or Space Marine 2. Warframe is killing it right now with the 1999 update too."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth for me. Same amazing scope as when I was a kid and story complexity that keeps me replaying.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,OSRS again Leagues really cements that every year right at the end lol.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Honestly? Balatro lol
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Starfield or Indiana Jones probably.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Unicorn Overlord was the real highlight. even if it almost feels it was last year! So many good games this year.
I enjoyed Dredge and all its DLCs too. Also played Elden Ring, Snufkin, Animal Crossing, Nine Sols…"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Straight up, Backpack Battles, fun little auto battler, and has been my favorite holding game while watching a movie with friends or waiting for someone to hop on for whatever else we’re playing at the moment."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Helldivers 2 by a huge margin

Nothing has got me back in touch with the sheer ecstatic joy you can have when a game is just **fun** in probably a decade.

As a lifelong BioWare fan I love Veilguard too, it’s a fantastic narrative experience, but sometimes you just want to bounce a car through a horde of monsters as your friends scream and fall out."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Games released this year? Metaphor: ReFantazio is my pick, with Balatro and Nine Sols close behind. Special shoutout to Caves of Qud as well, which I only recently bought but have quickly become obsessed with.

If we’re counting any game that I played through this year, it’s RE4 Remake for me and it’s not particularly close. Stellar game."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Factorio Space Age
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,UFO 50 - almost every game hits and the meta experience itself is like a time machine.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Most of my year was spent on catching up on older series. Played the far cry series, mass effect trilogy & andromeda, a lot of horror games like MADiSON, Visage, and others, and I played a few multiplayer and MMOs. My GOTY was easily Silent Hill 2"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,UFO 50 definitely. It's a little crazy that this was all packaged as one game
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"The game I've played the most is Star Wars Outlaws, really been enjoying it"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Resident Evil 4 Remake! I have over 100 hours in it and it’s just a very well done and beautiful game!
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Star Wars Outlaws. Very good, very underrated and a real homage to the original films."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"This year, probably Satisfactory, OuterWilds, and Mouthwashing (sad it was over so quickly!!!)"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Astro Bot, it was just an absolute joy to play and an absolute love letter to the last two and a half decades of PlayStation and their fans."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I'm going with Indy Jones and the great circle. That game had a story that had me sucked in. The gameplay was fantastic and I loved the charm and ""unbelievable"" believability it brought. I just finished it and I am already hoping there will be a sequel too it haha."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Red dead redemption 2. I bought it at the start of the year and i gotta say its one of if not the best game ive ever played

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Silent Hill 2 for sure.

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,"Yakuza 8. 

For me it is now the better modern-background JRPG, as in, it took the spot that was usually given to Persona"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,"I replayed Cyberpunk 2077 on the PS5 this year after the 2.0 update, with the Phantom Liberty DLC. The last time I played it was on the base PS4. Oh my god what a difference. If anyone is on the fence about playing it because of the rocky launch, I highly, HIGHLY recommend playing it. I loved it so much I literally finished the game and immediately started my next playthrough the same night.

Next on the list I’m going to say Far Cry 6, because I was going through chemo and it got me through a bad month for sure. It gets a lot of unfair hate. It’s a lot of fun. That is a lot of game for the money."

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Honestly I'd say for me it's tied between astro bot and dragon age veilguard (sue me I liked what I liked), as both games were fun and realy only had small gripes with them (least compared to a couple other games I tried this year)."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Satisfactory, it's an amazing game and for once it's a game that's come out that has no paid dlc or passes or micro transactions and it was released pretty much bug free.

It's a welcomed change to see a game released that hasn't been rushed, full of bugs and a money grab."

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Honestly, Veilguard. I'm not trying to bait people or anything, I just love Dragon Age and loved jumping back into that universe. It's not a perfect game by any means but I had an absolute blast with it and it was easily my favourite game this year"

For my game of the year that didn't come out this year, it has to be Pokemon Crystal. I played it through a few times focusing on different type runs."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"For me it was Cross Code. A small indie game from a decade ago that just managed to perfectly hit all the right elements for me.

* 2D top down action adventure game. 
* Heavily inspired by Zelda.
* Great story and character development. 
* Puzzles 
* Optional side quests and hidden items.
* Challenging dungeons and boss fights.

I don't often buy games on day one, but the same group is making a new game called Alabaster Dawn which seems to be a spiritual successor. I want them to make more games so for this one I'm buying it right away, heck sign me up for the deluxe package!"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"For months, I would have said Helldivers 2 or Palworld strictly based on entertainment value. Marvel Rivals emerged as a late game contender though, and I honestly think that I gotta give it to that game. Most fun I've had in a multiplayer game in a good while."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle

As a longtime fan of Indiana Jones from childhood, it's very special to me that it came out and fulfilled everything I wanted from a fully AAA Indy Jones game that I've been daydreaming about for decades.."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Goty: 

-Indiana Jones and the great circle.

Honorable mentions:

-Final fantasy XVI: It was very fun game and different from a FF fantasy formula I was getting a bit bored of. It wasn’t the most memorable experience but I really enjoyed it.

- Dragons Dogma 2: it was a game with issues, but all and all, a great RPG and fun game, in fact, had it been on a perfect technical state, it could easily be my goty. But the performance issues, visual glitches and many things that where rough around the edges take it from a Goty, tu a great but undoubtedly flawed game.

-Stalker 2: only have 8 hours of play because I can see the gigantic immersion and fun potential, its current technical state (although understandable given the development conditions) prevents me to fully enjoy, what I believe, will be a masterpiece for my taste in games, so I’ll come back to it in summer 2025 where it will probably be in Really good/much better state already. Hence why it is a honorable mention na don’t a goty contender of mine.

-Wukong: It’s not in my goty contender list because I’m not a fan of Soul’s like games, but it’s in my
Honorable mentions list, because despite that I still really fucking liked it and I wouldn’t be surprised if most souls games fans consider this their 2024 goty.

-Stellar blade: I don’t own a PS5, so I had to borrow a friend’s ps5 for this one, amazing game, it gave me PS2-PS3 nostalgia while looking modern and great.

-Infinity Nikki: I don’t know why but I fucking love this game when I have never ever before played any gatcha game.
Or any dress up game neither I’m interested into this type of stuff.
Yet here I am sinking hours into it 🤣"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"It's a toss up between Alan Wake 2 and Hollow Knight, but I think HK edges out! Such an incredible game!"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Astro Bot.

Closest thing to a perfect game I've ever played. It is simply **so** much fun. Every moment of every level put a smile on my face. I love a platformer, I love a collect-a-thon, I love PlayStation, and I love a challenge. Astro Bot knocked all of those things out of the park. Some will say it's an easy game (and for the most part, it is), but there are some really challenging levels. It's just such a polished game that had so much love poured into it. I've seen a lot of people online since Astro Bot won GOTY saying that they don't understand how it won based on gameplay they've watched. If you're one of those people, I assure you, this is a game that needs to be played to be understood."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"3 games. Helldivers 2, Stellar Blade and Astro Bot."

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Definitely not Astro Bot. How that won GOTY is shocking for me. For me it's probably Metaphor or Rebirth. I didn't mind Wukong, but that game was so freaking hard. It made Sekiro seem tame, IMO."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Elden Ring easily.

I had never enjoyed a Soulslike game before but that’s because I never really gave them a chance. It’s wonderful because now a whole new genre of games is sitting there to be played and I bought them all this year during the winter sale."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Indian Jones grabbed me like nothing else. Completely out of the blue. 38 hours and 100 percent and I'll be buying the DLC day one now.


And I never buy dlc"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Poe 2, was a long time since I dumped 50 hrs in one week into game before that came out. It has a couple of problems but if and when they are fixed it is going to be a 10/10 i think. 

Core Keeper gets my indie game of the year its really good you should check it out. 

Zenless zone zero gets a honorable mention for changing my view on the gatcha genre a little bit because its pretty crazy how much high quality content you get for free if you can get over the gatcha mechanic (Which i still kinda can't)"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Metaphor refantazio. Followed closely by indiana jones and the great circle.

I've just started space marines 2, so there's a few days to top them lol"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I played Red Dead Redemption 2 for the first time this year. 

That’s my pick."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Why the hell are people downvoting in a personal GOTY thread?
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Shadow of the Erdtree. I don't care if it's only a DLC since it's as big or bigger than most games nowadays.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"God is it still 2018?

Never understood calling a old game Goty when it didn't release that year. You can have your favourite game you played this year being an oldy sure, nobody is expected to play every game each year, but to me Goty always means best of the year.

My favourite this year release wise have been Last Epoch and Balatro, PoE is consuming all my time atm, will most likely be my Goty next year when it actually releases."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Dragon Age: The Veilguard as it's the only game from 2024 I've played ;)
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"It's difficult as I liked different games for different reasons...and others I'm certain I'll love but haven't had the time or energy to play yet.

Black Myth Wukong I am certain will love but haven't had the chance to enjoy it quite yet.

Dragon Age the Veilguard, while it could have been better, it does SO much right (for me) that it deserved some nominations...and truth me told I have a soft spot for what Bioware does so it's hard to dislike it. (not saying it doesn't deserve some critiques but ppl had gone on a hate wagon with this one imo).

Satisfactory is in a league of its own honestly and deserves everything it gets and more. It was one of THE best early access experiences I've had with a game and it was very clear the devs loved working on it.

PoE2 came out early December and for someone who had never played PoE before... well I have over 100 hours in the game already lol  ..so take that as you will.

Hades II has been an absolute blast but I have stopped playing it after about 30 hours because I want to have the full experience when it comes out...but honestly the game even on its EA release had an absurd amount of content...it was crazy.

The Casting of Frank Stone, while not a superb game per se, is in a unique category of itself for me and did really well at what it set out to do.
Both Marvel Rivals and PoE2 have been great successes for me.

Windblown was also a really pleasant surprise for someone who loves Risk of Rain 2.
Same can be said about Inkbound (though the gameplay is quite different)

I don't remember if it came out this year or if it was just its expansion but Prince of Persia the Lost Crown was a great game and honestly such a pleasant surprise from both the franchise (given it had been abandoned) and Ubisoft...only for them to destroy it because it didn't sell as well as their Assassin's Creed games (shocker).
I have a feeling The Rogue Prince of Persia will also do really well (as far as gameplay goes).

I suppose I deviated from the GOTY aspect of this post and am just listing games that definitely deserve a look imo.

If I were to nominate a GOTY that I have played, it would be between Satisfactory and DAV (even with all its issues it still feels like an incredible game to me and by far the most fun I had in a DA game).
And if we could nominate older games again, it would be Cyberpunk 2077 or Baldur's Gate for me lol."

If we're including new games from previous years, then Helldivers 2 is *still* the best game I played this year, but other awesome games are Baldur's Gate 3, Cocoon, Deathloop, Outcast: A New Beginning, Age of Mythology: Retold and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. 

Plus, it's been another year where I've played a lot of Assetto Corsa Competizione, World of Tanks, FTL, Company of Heroes 2, and Company of Heroes 3."

My other standout is Indy but everybody else is going for that I wanted to choose something that maybe nobody else saw."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Granblue Fantasy Relink. It has really great real time combat. The bosses are great. Wasn’t expecting to like it so much but bought on a whim and have now spent nearly 150 hours on it.

Still got a bunch of trophies to get, and there's a new mode(with presumably new trophies) coming next year, so ill probably be sinking a hundred more.

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Silent hill 2. The atmosphere and soundtrack in that game, coupled with usually working until it was pitch black outside, just hit all the right places for horror.

Platinumed 1 to 10-2, 15 and now on FF7 remake. What a great year for me discovering masterpieces"

Its battle system is very engaging and thought through. It’s the first ever game I replayed in hard mode and 100%. 

Close runner up is Fallout: New Vegas. It’s RPG done right. Going to finish it right after Christmas. Just one final mission left to go."

It has been a long time since I was so immersed in a story, at first i felt like it was a bit too long and 90% of the plot is just a roadtrip with not much at stake, but after finishing it, playing that game exclusively for 2 weeks straight without ever talking to a single human being outside of my workplace I realized I had grown so accustomed to the interactions between the characters that I was actually missing them

Also the soundtrack is insanely good"

If you are unaware, this is valves newest game. 6v6 Third-person/over the shoulder shooter moba. 4 lanes with 2 duo lanes and 2 solo lanes (this means no jungle role, but there is neutral farm to get).

Metaphor was great but a bit too much repetition in the dungeons and some other things that screamed ""we originally planned for more but ran out of time"" (will probably be fixed the definitive editions released later a la Persona 5 Royal). 

FF XVI was just a more consistent experience with great characters, VA, music and some of the most spectacular action set pieces in all of FF."

I said it day one of launch, finally someone has outdone Titanfall 2's sick mobility options and perfectly encapsulates the systems' use cases in a small but vibrant open world mega arena.

The game is FAR from perfect and still has a lot of things to fix and address, It also isn't a game for everyone, but what it does provide is something I've wanted from a creature collecting game for a long time. Its gameplay loop can be repetitive but Its one of those few games where I keep wanting to come back and play it more."

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"If we're talking games that came out this year, it's FF7 Rebirth. FF7 means so much to me, and this game took the already amazing foundation that Remake set up, perfected the combat system, gave us the open world that the original game had except even better, and delivered a new take on the story that (assuming the final part of the Trilogy delivers) I think will probably surpass the original for me, and the original is my second-favorite game of all time (P3R is my favorite).

Now, if we're talking games I played for the first time this year... well, it's probably still Rebirth, honestly, but the one other game that I played this year that comes insanely close is actually Trails Through Daybreak. I haven't finished it yet, I still have the finale to go, but as a longtime Trails fan, this game feels like such a fresh breath of air, I love it. Darker tone than the CS games, a mostly adult cast that lets them explore more mature themes, a general aesthetic that I love and really reminds me of the Crossbell games, I'm in love with it"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Helldivers 2 without a doubt!
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Marvels Spiderman series, I played the first one and just finished my play through of Spiderman: Miles Morales and immediately started New Game + on the both of them.

Honestly both are good, Abiotic Factor is such an amazing indie and should be played more.

Shoutout to whoever is doing the Backyard Sports remasters though. Love replaying some of my favorite nostalgic sports games from my childhood."

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"A game called sanitarium. 90s point and click horror with the absolute funniest dialogue. So many asshole characters with very slick remarks had my laughing my ass off throughout. 

Or undertale. Finally played for the first time and it's incredibly charming with addicting bullet hell gameplay. I accidentally killed someone so I have to go back sometime and redo it to get the best ending

Orrrr most likely cyberpunk. I loved the gameplay of hacking enemies without me having to physically get involved. The story is so beautiful with a lot of nuance and characters who are absolutely remarkable. The side quest don't get enough complements. There's a side mission where a guy dick is about to explode, literally 🤣"

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Marvel Midnight Suns. Bought it last year for my Steam Deck and didn't get into it until this year. Such an underrated turn based rpg.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Going by most hours put into a game this year, it's roughly a tie between Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Factorio. It was amazing reliving FF7 with gorgeous 9th-gen graphics, top-notch voice acting, and fun real-time combat. And Factorio was one of the most engaging games I've ever played. There were so many days and nights where I would sit down expecting to play for just an hour or two and soon find seven or eight hours had gone by.  Honorary mentions to Astro Bot, Silent Hill 2."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Skul. I went into it not expecting to love it as much as I did and then over 100 hours later I've beaten the game on dm10 and done the secret boss.

10/10 would recommend"

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Astilbes was hands down the best gaming experience I’ve played in a long time. Gameplay was retro and sweet, but the story was absolutely incredible and the game as a whole wiggled its way into my top 5 and I don’t even doubt it"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Cyberpunk I would say in retrospective I was very much playing it hard-core this year.

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. Didn't realize MH could be so fun, since I usually bounced off World every time I tried it. This year I made it past the hump, got through to MH World: Iceborne, and then gave Rise a shot. Really enjoyed my time with both."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Rise of the Ronin has provided me with a reason to get a PS5, and the closest possible thing to a new Tenchu game in years. It's not without its flaws, but the freedom of customization, the beauty of the open world and the depth of the combat have all done plenty to put it at the forefront of my consciousness and quite possibly my mind when I cut on the PS5."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Mafia 2 personally. Mafia 1 remake was amazing but 2 just hit a little harder.

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Black myth Wu Kong. A lot of controversy around it.  But I did enjoy it. Not Chinese no interest in Chinese history and lore. But the game was good. 

This year I also finished Forbiden west. Ghost of thushima. GoE Ragnarock. Even GTA V as I never did play it all those years. All were great games with good story. 

I pivoted to Singke player games after my son was born due to less free time for gaming and a lot of situations where I needed to stop or pause on the spot. 
Way more chill experience. Though thise BM wukong bosses did got my blood boiling at times"

I dropped a few hundred hours on it before I realized and I just keep playing. It has the scale of a 4x combined with the action of an RTS.

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Helldivers 2. Easily. This game has genuinely given me more fun times than probably any game I’ve played. It reminds me of that old Halo camaraderie mixed with the feeling of working together and holding the line you’d get in CoD zombies. Especially now that everything is balanced right it’s just such a good time. Also I’m just a sucker for games that let you customize your character with cool armor.

It’s also great cuz I can hop in with randoms and every time they’re great to play with since most of the toxicity in the game is on Reddit and not on the actual game’s servers lol.

Was playing it last night and just loaded in on the bot front with only orbital barrage stratagems and then used the free WASP launcher as my heavy weapon and holy cow. It was just chaos. Raining down fire from above while listening to the cool noise the WASP launcher makes. Like it’s just so good"

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Shadow of the Erdtree for new games, Ghost of Tsushima for non-2024 games.

Shadow of the Erdtree was an excellent expansion of what made Elden Ring so great. That feeling of wonder and danger while exploring was totally recaptured, and the new loot was a ton of fun to use. Plus the lore, which I hadn’t cared much about before, got a really interesting shakeup that hooked me. The boss fights were almost all amazing. Messmer, Bayle, Rellana, and Midra were all memorable and appropriately challenging. FUCK Consort Radahn tho, that guy was way too hard lol.

Ghost of Tsushima’s story was good, and then the ending brought it up to excellent. That final choice is agonizing in the best way possible. The gameplay was also very fun. The combat took me a little while to get a hold of but once I did I had a blast slicing through enemies. Exploration was fun for most of the game but you can only follow so many birds and foxes before it gets repetitive lol. The art direction for the game was stunning though, every environment was absolutely gorgeous and bursting with color while also still feeling mostly realistic."

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Relaxing? I tip over way too much for it to be relaxing!

Side note I like playing it best with money being made pointless because I can have certain trucks for certain jobs just laying around the map ready to go. It's far less tedious and more realistic than constantly switching attachments on 2-3 other trucks. 

Also multiplayer with a full server is great, the world feels more alive when you occasionally come across the other players"

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I played Mass Effect Legendary edition this year, and playing the full trilogy with all DLCs is a really great journey. It was already my favourite game since its original release, but now it's also my wife's favourite one. It feels more than a game !"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I got it on the Black Friday sale for $7 and I’m a couple hours into 3. Also my first time playing it and loving it so far. 


The Mako in the first one wasn’t fun. Too much open space to drive through with nothing going on and the elevation, ahhhh kill me. Sprinting out of combat is terrible too. 


The money in the second one feels too hard to come by. I also didn’t wear a helmet for most of it because I liked seeing my reaction in cut scenes. 


Everything seems expanded on and polished in the third one. Everything except path finding. They went from maps to a direction ping, to here’s some brackets figure it out. 


Those are my only real complaints. I’ve been having an absolute blast. I kind of forced myself through the first one knowing it was extremely dated, but the rpg aspects were still extremely good. I couldn’t put down the second game. As I said, currently working my way through the third game and everything except pathfinding is much more refined and polished. 


I would highly recommend ME legendary edition to anyone who enjoys rpgs. The story and the characters are great, the combat gets better every game, and the dialogue choices on the renegade path have made me laugh out loud several times."

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"It’s had its controversies but they really have delivered a lot in one year. The core gameplay is such a great formula, its visually impressive, great sound design and lots of attention in the details 

My hope is another good year with less controversy. Would love to see a loadout bay with armour stands for your kits, more worlds and mixed enemy maps where they fight each other, and more of all the good stuff in warbonds

It’s personal preference but it gets runner up and a 9/10 for me. Satisfactory is my GOTY"

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I stopped playing it shortly after release, but IMO, that game should be GOTY. How huge it's release was. How huge of a game changer. And the fact other devs were looking to clone it because of its huge success was insane.

Now, gaming community being full of little shits kicking you out prior to extraction, so you lost all of that time, was why I quit playing. I was keeping track, and roughly 80% of my games I played suffered from being kicked like that. I am an old gamer with very little gaming time to spare, so I used my time for other games."

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,This yes. I loved this game so much that I grinded the platinum in the first few weeks because it was such a polished experience. First platinum on my ps5.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Had the same experience less her actually playing it. We platinumed it with her pointing out the robots and me telling her everyones names.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"This game is so great for young kids. My niece (just turned 7 a week ago) started playing it during her weekend visits to my house a few months ago. She basically learned it all through the on-screen prompts. I let her play my finished save so she had access to all the worlds and stuff. I booted up the game a few days ago to play the Christmas level and saw that she had beaten a few of the speed run levels all on her own. They’re not super hard, but certainly challenging for a kid to beat the red bird. I was immensely proud lol."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I may not have a daughter, but Astro Bot has reignited a passion for gaming in me that I thought was largely lost. Since I finished it, 100%ed it actually, i have been gaming left and right. In the past few weeks I have finished Horizon Forbidden West including the DLC, God of War and have now started on The Last of Us. I Haven't had such an output of completed games in YEARS. 

Astro Bot had such a great, positive feeling about it, that it also did wonders for my mental state."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,The concert in that DLC was insane.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I gotta agree with you and I played some really great games for the first time this year. I put down gaming years and years ago and finally got around to building my first pc. 

Anyway, same deal. Didn’t realize they’d got things sorted out. Honestly forgot about it. But when it went on sale a snagged it and holy hell. 

This game is special. And your me right about the DLC. They just nail the stories, and the side characters, and NC really does feel like a character of it’s own. First game with a city that I felt like I was still discovering new things every time I played. Hell I’m still playing hahaha I’m finishing the DLC now but I’m taking my damn time"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,You do all the endings? Some get you right in the feels.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I also put off playing it for years, but I'm kind of glad I did. I started playing last week and the game is so polished and runs so well. I'm not a huge fan of first person RPGs, but Cyberpunk might be the best one I've played."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Same here. Put off playing it for years and bought it on a whim last month. I'm blown away, it's the most fun I've had with a game in years. I'm not near the end yet, but I'm delaying getting the DLC until I've completed one base game run, just so I have more new things to look forward to."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Agreed, incredible game!"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I finished the final quest inside arasaka tower but can’t figure out how to get into the phantom liberty DLC I bought. How do you start it?
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Yeah Cyberpunk is awesome, I waited until they patched most of the bugs and played the ultimate edition with Phantom Liberty. I never played anything like this, probably this game and Stellar Blade are the only games where side quests are actually high quality"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I only finished one play through so far, and no DLC yet. Took the Aldercados route with Nomad Male V and Panam by his side. “We’re going home.” Loved it and every second leading up to it. Can’t wait to play the DLC and explore other endings now."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,glad I wasn't the only one delaying the inevitable last mission
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Same! Wanted to play this game for a while but waited a bit. Came to playing it finally this year and boy, has it been a blast. Even though I'm not planning on 100%-ing it, I am definitely trying to finish all quests. Even the side quests are interesting to play and add something to the story. Really well set!"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I installed too many mods for my first play through and parts of the city get too laggy and made me lose steam, need to pick the game back up and strip the mods and play it doesn’t break my save."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"It was also my goty in an otherwise kind of quiet gaming year. 

Played and finished it at release but was glad to finally experience it in the best way with the DLC + heavy modding.

For the other games: I dunno, played a lot of Dragon's Dogma 2 and enjoyed it, but it's not goty worthy due to some really odd design decisions and lack of variety."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I need to jump back in and finish this one at some point. 

I picked it up on sale back in the summer, bundled with Phantom Liberty, but haven't gotten super far into it yet. The last thing I remember doing was one of the quests around >!Jackie's funeral!<

I loved The Witcher 3, to the point where it's one of my all time favourite games. But Cyberpunk just hasn't grabbed me in quite the same way that that one did. Maybe after the holidays I'll make a point of sitting down with it again and giving it another go!"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Cyperpunk is my top 3 all time. The story has got a level of grit and finesse that I rarely see in any other RPG.

Combat, esp stealth is super fun. Driving in Night City is awesome. A lot of the characters like Panam, Judy, Reed, Alt, Johnny, V, etc are memorable. The 2.X patches along with PL has made it feel like a well polished game.

CDPR really brought it back"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"That game is one of the greatest comeback stories of all time. And I mean the actual, real life product, not the story told within the game itself"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Definitely agree. On my second playthrough right now and still can't put it down.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,It must be so in credibly disappointing for the dev team to have had to release in the state they did. I am confident it would have been a BG3-esque clean sweep if the game we have now had been their release version.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Same. I bough it pre order during launch, never touch it after first 2 hour into the game. This year picked it up again. It’s very good. I wished they add more content and dlc. I would be buying."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I enjoyed it a lot too. It was just surprisingly short. I only expected the climax to build up with that last quest and the point of no return notification. If I had played only half of the sidequests I would have finished it in under 10 hours
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Same here, absolutely a masterpiece, so glad I waited until the DLC was out and the game was fixed before I played it"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Are you playing the 2.0 version.

I’ve currently got 1.6 as i have a ps4, trying to decide if upgrading to a ps5 is worth it for 2.0

(Amongst other games"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,"Yep. Played it when I was lucky enough to play it on PS5 at launch. Never beat it. Picked it up on Steam Deck once PL came out, started a new game and have 400+ hours in on a damned handheld. Not only my favorite of 2024, but a top contender of my personal favorite of ALL TIME."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,I reloaded like a thousand times when it came to the penultimate scene in the DLC. And why cant we romance Songbird??
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,"Man, I really tried to get into cyberpunk recently after it seemingly got patched to be much more stable. But I just don't feel it, I don't know. Both protagonists' dialogue are 100% ""cool guy/gal"" one liners, the gunplay is floaty, the hacking is superficial. I understand it might get good later, but I found my initial ~4h to be a total snoozefest and the last 2h already was me still wanting to believe."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,Same! Such a well done story
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Balatro is awesome ! I was actually debating whether to  put that over Detroit Become Human as GOTY.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"All the whining about the awards and my 2 absolute favourite games were Balatro and Astrobot so was happy with either of those. Balatro has occupied time like nothing since Slay the Spire, Astrobot I played through to Platinum with my little girl (5) and she loved it."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Balatro, seconded.  Came in early 2024 and just sopped up unprecedented amounts of my attention."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I have lost many hours of sleep over these clown demons.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,"I wonder if me, someone who’s never given a single fuck about poker, would enjoy it."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,"Just grabbed it. It’s not my usual type of game, but it doesn’t seem like a usual type of game. Looking forward to it over break."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Satisfactory GOTY (the fact it wasn't even nominated is a travesty), and Factorio: Space Age as expansion of the year for me. Us automation fans have been eating well this year."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Got that game in my library. Gonna have to try it.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Yeah same, amazing game! Also sunk hundreds of hours in this one since 1.0."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Satisfactory here too. 

Been following the developers Coffee Stain and their game since the alpha days. I used to say that Subnautica set the benchmark for Early Access titles however Satisfactory is up there with it. 

The sheer love and commitment to listening the the gaming community is phenomenal. The game itself is superb and so well built that it is a pleasure to sink hundreds of hours into. "
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,How many tickets do you get for sinking time?
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Just the jump from early access to 1.0 has been incredible , let alone how great the game has always been. It’s my GOTY also."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Have you tried factorio?
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Same here. Picked it up when 8 hit this year and didn't put it down until just a few weeks ago. I think I'm around 300-400 hours. Sadly, after beating all the main objectives and completing the doodad I just didn't have the drive to keep playing. I miss it immensely but just don't have the same drive. I wish I could play it all again for the first time.

I have been playing Shapez 2 for the past 4 days almost non stop, though. It is so freaking satisfying, a must have, in my opinion, for any Ficsit alum."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Same, 300+ hours in the last two months - nearly finished it and barely explored half the map. It’s so addictive plus perfect game to play while watching tv or movies"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Same for me. Put about 200hrs in since early October, only reason it’s not A LOT more is because work got in the way. Once I lose my job in a few weeks I’ll get back to that full time, while looking for new work of course."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Man I think I’ve done couple hundred hours just since 1.0. Let alone since it’s first early access release.
That Game has been like crack for me. 

I have a friend who became a mechanical engineer because of that game."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,"I haven't played anything else since 1.0 came out. 

My current gaming habits don't really allow for online games or anything story based. Satisfactory, which I can still play even when I'm not playing it, just with a pen and a notebook, it hits the spot right now."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,I want to try it!
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Same. It's just so good
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Not only is it a great game, it might be a top 3 (even 2) Indy story of all time."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Same here. Great story, dialogues, acting. That feel of adventure. Game also run great on release. Hope to see more like this."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Same here. You can tell that they put a lot of love and effort into the game. It's very well made and optimized unlinke other new releases this year. Stalker 2 was my most anticipated game this year but it was a huge let down for me.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I just watched Temple of Doom again. Hadn’t seen it in 20+ years. It is uncanny how the voice actor in the game matched Harrison Ford perfectly. It’s impressive to sound like Indy when he is just talking, but to do it when he is excited, joking, frightened for his life “WE…ARE…GOING…TO…DIE!” Is just amazing."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"It's the most ""feels like you're playing the movie"" game I've ever played."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Same. This game is going to age extremely well
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,Also biggest suprise of the year
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Down down down by the river…
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I was about to do a new playthrough, but I decided to wait for the new subclasses they just announced."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Starting to wonder if I’ll ever stop playing BG3. 700+ hours in, have beaten it many times including honor mode, yet I still find the urge to play."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,I’m one or 2 more play sessions from finishing my first run of this game. I’m in disbelief that this game was made by humans. It’s just impossibly vast and deep in a way very very few games are. The number of super super unique dialogue moments that so few will see in a given run is just ridiculous.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-27,"This is mine. Picked it up earlier this year and got totally sucked in. What an amazing story. They aced transitioning the tabletop mechanics to videogame form. Beautiful, funny, sad. 

Damn, now I want to make a new character and play again"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Same. Great game, and yet I often dreaded playing it"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I was really excited for PC players to try GoT.  It's fantastic.  Very satisfying combat and the story is wonderful.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,i got a PS5 a few months ago and ghost of tsushima is AWESOME
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"As someone who also started with 0 and went through the rest in sequential order, 3-5 can be a little rough in spots. Still totally worth it, and they will still hook you, but it's clear the developers kept improving the formula as the series went forward (or backwards in the case of 0 and kiwani 1 and 2). Absolutely worth it though, if only to make moments in 7 and 8 hit harder."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Yakuza is such an amazing franchise. 

I can’t really play the games back to back like that, because I get kind of burnt out, but playing them a year or so apart, and I just love them so much. 

I played the original way back when I was a kid, and I have loved the series ever since. "
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Should also get Judgement and Lost Judgement after finishing your Yakuza playthrough.  Spin offs in the Yakuza world.  Amazing games.  Also you will probably notice a jarring experience going from Kiwami 2 to Yakuza 3-5.  This is mostly because Kiwamu 2 is a Remake while 3-5 are remasters. So they can be a bit rough around the edges.  Especially if you go for the platinum trophies.  3-5 made me get PTSD whenever I see a pool table now.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Yeah it really is a curse and a blessing. 

And once you play outer wilds, you can’t help but comment about it on every single “good game question”-style Reddit post you come across.

Sole thing with Prey 2017"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I honestly.. tried. I couldn’t get into it. Idk why because I really liked the gravity/space aspects of other games. After 5-10 hours I think it just still didn’t grab me. Feels like a shame because so many people talk about how amazing it is.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I am trying to find my footing with this game.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"If you haven't played it, Subnautica."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I really really tried to get into this game, missing that one jump (on the twins I think) so many times burned me out."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Paradise Killer is somewhat similar, highly recommend trying it"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Yeah, Silent Hill 2 remake was a welcome surprise. I remember the hate it got from the first trailer, and as a OG fan myself, I had extremely low expectations. But the remake blew me away. Although I gotta admit the original handles the lighting in certain areas better."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"People shit on Bloober? First game I saw by them was The Medium and I loved it so when I saw that they were doing the Silent Hill 2 remake I was pumped. To be honest, I trust them more than I trust Konami themselves. Looking forward to playing the remake, my SO won a copy on Konami's recent twitter competition."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,"James Sunderland VA deserves a damn Oscar. I disarmed up everyyyyy single line of dialogue that man delivered. Was bummed he didn’t win best performance but I’ve heard the winner was pretty great too.

Incredible game."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Can't wait for KCD 2.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I enjoy almost everything about the game, but I did have to look one thing up to move forward in the game, and I never in a thousand years would have figured it out from context clues. It's very good, but it needs one or two more hints in a small number of places to really be great for me."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"It’s Animal Well for me as well, by a MILE. Will easily be cemented as one of my top favorite plays of all time. Reminded me how tired I am of constantly fighting things in so many video games, and has encouraged me to seek out more games not centered around combat."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I played metaphor this year and its truly fantastic! I came straight off the back of Persona 3 reload and it felt so familiar but so new at the same time. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Rebirth is such an achievement
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I just got bundle in Steam and replayed Remake. And played Yuffie DLC for the first time 

I am so hyped for Rebirth launching on PC in January. FFVII is my all time favorite game. I just hope they would release the last part on PC at the same time as for Playstation. It's so hard to wait for a year"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,FOR THE EMPEROR!
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"How Echoes of Wisdom compared to the Link’s Awakening remake? I didn’t get into Link’s Awakening, and that’s the reason I never got EoW"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,TIL it's getting a DLC
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,Lies of P deserves soooo much more recognition. I thinks it’s as good or better than many of From’s games. Incredible atmosphere and music too.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Scrolled to far for this.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,Same. Finished it and now I'm back into modding it
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"The fact that satisfactory didnt get a single nomination just further erodes my trust in the game awards, it really is just an advertisement festival run by people who dont play games lol"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Can’t wait for the full release of hades II
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I bought Hades II to support it as Hades I is in my top ten of all time, but I am waiting for 1.0 to come out before I play it."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I’m playing the first and having so much fun. Great game
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,An undermentioned charming game that is way fun.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,The Shuriken build is awesome.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I ended up playing Brotato and Vampire Survivors at the same time this year and had a fantastic time with both. Such simple games that are *so* addicting.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I played these games back to back as well and really enjoyed Deep Rock Galactic.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Satisfactory has taken more of my hours than any other game this year.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I had to go real far to find any mention of palworld. I don't game much anymore, but this has been an incredible experience. The game is just so much *fun*."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,This is my answer as well. Just an incredible game.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"UFO 50 deserves so much more popularity, man"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Can’t believe I scrolled this far to find UFO 50. I think I played all of the big titles this year, and UFO 50 is by far my GOTY."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Indeed a goat game
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,What is AoE2!? 😅
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Developer still updating the game, so yeah, its the best ever!!!"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"As long as you had fun regardless of the year, that’s all that matters. 🙂"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"+1 for Dave the Diver. incredibly charming, rewarding, well put-together lil game."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Dredge was amazing, who knew running a fishing boat could lead to existential dread."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,"I loved the first like 50% of dread, kinda felt like it went a bit too long. Loved the cozy visuals of it all though."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"The series of missions where you chase down a runaway stroller only to find the leader of the baby fetish roleplay gang from Kamurocho inside of it, all the way to them furiously heaving the stuffing from all of their spare diapers off of a roof to simulate snow in Hawaii so an old married couple can say their very last goodbyes in the snow is the sort of whiplash that only Yakuza can offer."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Bro, people are still playing huh? I stopped in 2019 because of similar unexpected obligations. When I stopped playing 5 years ago I felt like it was going a bit stale and wouldn’t be around much longer. Did they release a ton of content since then? Might have to log on for a spell lol"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I absolutely loved Guild Wars 1, was a day 1 player and played through all of the expansions. For some reason when Guild Wars 2 came out I found it kinda boring and gave up. 

Would you say that they improved the early game since launch to make it more enticing?"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Had to scroll way too much for this
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Amazing game already
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Waiting on 1.0 for this one.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Same, due to personal life shit going on during its release I didn't get a chance to play it until Feb of this year. I'm still fully obsessed and thinking about various builds and mods to try out."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Im planning on playing either Refantazio or Persona 5. What would be your recommendation ?
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"My favourite game of the year too. 2024 was such a stacked year for JRPG fans, including Persona 3 Reload, and Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, Like a Dragon, Romancing Saga 2 Remake, Trails Through Daybreak (at least the localisation released this year), and many others. 


Octopath Traveler 2 came out last year, but it definitely was my GOTY of 2023, I absolutely loved that game. "
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I think for a personal GOTY you can say whatever regardless of the release date but yeah I got where you and others are coming from.

For me it was No Rest for The Wicked but if i follow OP s take on it it was D2R."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,It's the games he played this year. This is a running joke for videogamedunkey too. Every year he releases the Top 10 Games of the Year video & it's always obscure games from 2004 or something. This guy is hilarious
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,It’s like changing heroine for fentanyl.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,This was so damn good. I haven't laughed so hard at a game in years.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,You're 1 of 2 mentions I can find in this entire thread. I'm very surprised by that
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Same for me.  I realize it’s not perfect but as a Star Wars fan it’s almost everything I wanted in a game. 
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Happy to see this one mentioned. I haven't played it enough yet to really judge, but so far it's been a very pleasant surprise. Maybe it's because of low expectations due to its lukewarm reception and the Ubisoft situation, or because I only ever played it in its recently patched state, but I really think the game deserves more positive attention than it's been getting. As a Star Wars fan, it really fills a niche that hasn't been properly explored before as an open-world, non-Jedi focused game in a somewhat gritty OT setting."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Love hearing this. Waiting for it to be on games pass or something but dying to try it.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"This might be it for me too. Infiltrating Imperial bases can be very exhilarating. It nails the feeling of living in the Star Wars universe. The transition from planet to space flight is seriously impressive, the characters are entertaining, and the shooting mechanics are mostly excellent. Certainly not a perfect game (sneaking into faction bases can feel repetitive, navigating the open world can be a little confusing) but I’ve had a great time with it."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,This was mine 
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,My gf plays it but ngl I dabble 😹😹
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,It’s unironically one of the best games I’ve played this year. It single handedly cured my burnout.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Man...  Overwatch at release and roughly the first year was the shit.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Same man. So hard to get off of it.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"same, closely followed by stellar blade :)"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,">big titles

Ngl, I read that as ""titties"" which is actually very fitting for this game lmao."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I hadn't seen Unicorn Overlord on here, but it was an absolute banger"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I played the FF7 OG again this year with the voice acting, 60 fps and hd mods. It felt like the remaster we never got. Would recommend checking it out. I’m waiting for FF7 rebirth to hit on PC."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,1000% agree on pacific drive
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Rock and Stone!
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I redid my smelting setup on Nauvis to use Foundries, now I have no power :( Spent the day enriching uranium for Nuclear, 200 hours into this save :D the dlc is amazing."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Hekki allmo, DoctorHellclone."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I know some people had higher hopes for this game but as far as i'm concerned they fucking delivered!

Combat is amazing! narration by varric is great! Companion chatter is excellent!

Like what is the problem? Your feelings are hurt because you can't roleplay as an evil bastard? The character creator was too woke? Fuck off. No one complained about that shit in witcher 3 or cyberpunk 2077 (both great!).

Just enjoy the ride!"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I'm glad someone else enjoyed it. I really loved it too. SMTV is my goty but I loved DAVeilguard too
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,CHAOS! I try to 100% Just Cause 2 every year on my birthday. My kingdom for a true sequel by OG devs. Where's Contraband Microsoft?
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"This is mine as well! Love the persistent Zelda-like world combined with twin stick / bullet hell combat. And it controls so ridiculously smoothly, just pure fun from start to finish."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Having just finished Indiana I can say that it’s one of hell of a game. Highly recommend it to anyone who’s just a fan of Indy or enjoys a good adventure game
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Good question, only one I'll downvote are when people put down other games in their comment as well."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I usually play games a year after release when it's less expensive and bugs are fixed. I rarely play a game the same year it comes out.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I only just moved onto Alaska recently, then went back to Michigan last night. Found I was tipping over in Michigan more than Alaska with the same trucks. Something about the layout of the place."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"So thats it, huh? We some kinda Snowrunner?"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Yeah, that's the game in a nutshell."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Yeah but it’s difficult. Like it requires a lot of patience, unless you use modded trucks. But content wise, just trucks :)"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"My 7 year old started when he was 6 would play it with me. Super fun and family friendly. 

I unlocked a bunch of trucks and made it more fun for him."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Definitely it’s all trucks
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"The DLC door this game is the worst priced DLC I’ve ever seen- even when it’s on sale. It is not cheap. 

On the plus- it contains a lot of fucking content"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Lady ethereal did it for me. I've played every soulslike and metroidvania that I have been able to get my hands on in the last 15 years and it's probably in my top 5.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Absolutely Loved that fight. It was a lot harder for me than anything else in the game, but I had such a great time learning the patterns and parry timing.

Definitely one of the best games I played this year!"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I loved the game overall, but I found the final boss to be a low point.  

Up until then, every boss could conceivably be defeated on the first try if you are a quick learner and have a good intuition of when it's safe to heal. 
Suddenly throwing that design philosophy away at the last minute feels kind of crappy. Trial & error design isn't necessarily bad, but it isn't what I associated with Nine Sols.  

IMO the best boss fight is Lady Ethereal, maybe Jiequan as as the runner-up."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I was confused when I saw it had 0 nominations at the game awards. I didn't realise the game was unknown/niche, it really felt like I was playing a masterpiece by any standards (AAA or indie)."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Personally, as a huge Metroidvania fan, I'd rather call it masterclass of action combat design than MV. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid as a Metroidvania too, but I felt it could've improved on its exploration and platforming. Still loved the game overall.

Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a game from this year I'd slightly put over it as a masterclass of the genre, as I feel like it really nailed every aspect of what makes me love MVs."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,"If you like working a lot harder for your power fantasy. Dark Souls and the difficulty meme have left a massive scar on gaming, and while Nine Sols' presentation and flow are top notch at a perfect level - I'm not as perfect as the game demands, so...the annoyance of the bosses is generally knocking it down a few points.

(SOTN still holds as the king of the castle and THE master-class, and Bunny Must Die/Chelsea and the Seven Devils is the queen. No, I don't care about Rabi-Ribi.)"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Loved seeing it get number 1 on that recent gameranx video
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Same! I've read that it was similar to Hollow Knight prior to playing so I went in with cautious optimism. It's in the same tier as HK, one of the best games I've ever played. Top quality across the board."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"It’s funny that you say that. This is the only game my friends have ever alll been really enthusiastically into at the same time, and we’re all dads. I wonder if you’re onto something."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Hold up, 20 minutes in and out? I assumed the game was yet another hour(s) long per session game that was incompatible with parenting and related responsibilities."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I love this about Helldivers. You have to remember to laugh at your deaths. If you can do that, the game is pure fun and hilarity. Definitely not built for sweaty gameplay."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Why am I seeing this a lot nowadays? People are reviewing games by saying ""great game for Dads!""

Beginning to think it's some bot army 🤣"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I'm not saying you're wrong in general, but my personal experience has been the exact opposite of this. 

Maybe it's the European servers but I immediately ended up in a cesspool of high-level assholes who team-kill new players for fun, abandon you in the thick of battle then shoot you as the last possible moment before escaping. The same shit, over and over, game after game. It had been years since I had been exposed to this level of toxic retardedness that I associate with 13-year olds, and I decided as a dad I have much better things to do with my time than deal with these a-holes...

As for me, I'm not going to play any online game with friendly fire ever again. I'm too old for that shit!"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I want to fight lizards
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I've been reading about the lore of the game and it's quite funny. The aliens and humans used to live in ""harmony"" until the humans hell dived all the surrounding planets to maintain their democracy preventative."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Now if you’re kicked, dc’d, host leaves, etc the game makes you the host with mission in its present state the moment it happened. This way everyone’s time is not wasted & you can finish up the mission. 

Come back Helldiver, the Illuminate have returned to threaten our way of life."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"That’s wild because I got kicked maybe three times playing since launch lol, I guess some people just have bad luck"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Come join the Helldads community here on reddit. We are all short on time and want to spread democracy efficiently.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Play with randoms. It’s what I do most the time and everyone is great to play with
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Another one you guys might like which is rarely discussed is tearaway unfolded.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Lizzy Wizzy!

It was so well done! I was glad Alex gives V the Braindance version so you can watch it anytime"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I was out of words when I saw Solomon Reed's suit at the party. I've never seen a texture like this in any game ever.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I’m doing a second playthrough rn and just got done with the Lizzy Wizzy concert! Such cool visuals!
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,It was first game that I DIDN'T use quick travel. There was something magical in the city. 
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I listen to the end credits song often, thinking of said feels. It went straight to my Spotify. ❤️"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"The ending where >! V ends up in a coma for a couple of years and loses their ability to use cyber enhancements and everyone else moves on with their lives and leaves V behind. !< 

That ending really messed my mood up for the rest of the day."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I haven’t done all of them yet. Just the ending I wanted for my V. I did saves so I plan to go back and try the different endings as well. Did you done all the endings?
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Same here! Just got back into it. Bought for ps4 new. Was terrible. Waited till last month and upgraded to the ps5 version. It’s so damn good now.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"After you download it you should get a quest to meet songbird at the entrance to dogtown. 

I just looked and you have to have finished “Transmissions” quest, but if you’ve finished the final quest you should be able to start the Phantom Liberty DLC"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,The nomad ending is my personal favorite. It feels more hopeful than other endings because it kinda leaves it ambiguous as to whether V lives or dies.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"To somebody who has never played a deck-builder, and doesn't think they'd be interested in one, would you still recommend it?

I've only heard amazing things, but can't imagine I would have fun with it. The things I hear still make me want to try though...."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"You know D:BH came out 7 years ago, right? Not exactly 2024 GOTY eligible"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Uhh, am I tripping? Didn’t detroit BH released in 2018?"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Detroit Become Human came almost 7 years ago....
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Good games win awards, who would've thought."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,i love balatro but never fell in love with StS
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Might I recommend oxygen not included
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I really want to play both but I'm not allowed to. First time I touched Factorio I put 80 hours in in a week whilst 'working' full time
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Eating? We've got no time for that, back to the factory!"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,See you in 10 years 🫡
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Couldn't get into it as much, preffered Dyson sphere programme. Idk why."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Top 2 is a big endorsement considering the top spot is occupied by Raiders. New wishlist game!
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I always thought “it feels like you’re playing the movie” was a cliche

But this is the first time I can honestly say. I’m a huge Indy fan and it’s like they unearthed an unreleased movie. The first person was also a great choice"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I had a crashing issue right off the bat, that was fixed with an install check through steam. 

Seamless since."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Yeah it really gets good towards the Y4-6 and then the judgement games, and then like a dragon, they just kinda get better and better but Y0 is still totally phenomenal"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,"I stayed up late last night finishing 3. I had started with 7 and it got me hooked on the series, so I went back and played the older ones, starting with K1, K2 then 0. It's definitely a step down going from those to 3. I still enjoyed the story, definitely still worth the play, but man, it was a bit rough to get through sometimes. I only finished the first chapter of 4, but I'm glad it's a bit better. I'm still going to try and get through it as quick as I can to get to the newer games."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Prey was insane 

I didn’t know ANYTHING about it before playing it and safe to say the moment that wrench broke the glass I had the same feeling I had when Andrew Ryan said „I choose…..Rapture“ lol"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"If you need help, you can ask in the r/outerwilds sub for the spoiler-free hints and nudges in the right direction."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I know it seems daunting at first trying to get into it but trust me it’s well worth it cause unfortunately there is no other game that uses this particular premise like Outer Wilds does it’s truly a one of a kind experience 


Don’t spoil yourself I unfortunately did that for some of the puzzles and I kick myself for that afterwards cause I could have spent more time in that beautiful world"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-27,"I played a lot of it. I didn’t finish it, didn’t care too. Not sure why people like it so much"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Played these two games in the same year and haven't had anything feel the same since. Not in a depressing way, I've played other great games, but the sense of exploration in those two titles is unmatched."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Even Bloober weren't happy with that first trailer, Konami used an older build of the game to make it."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Yeah it did, and OG fan as well but I also did like some of Bloober's other games so could see their potential in it."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Yeah so much that people called em ""Blooper"" unfortunately. Which is strange because when Layers of Fear release all people said was how amazing it was, then tides shifted on Bloober at some point? Oh that's awesome, on the comp! Congrats!"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Echoes of Wisdom is a modern Zelda game like BotW/TotK who gave freedom to the player on how explore the game map and also on how  fight enemies, but unlike BotW/TotK EoW is a top down  game and it has also dungeons similar to those of the classics"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I believe the devs confirmed it's coming out in Q1 of 2025 :)
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Same here! I wanna play it and support the development, but even more I want to play the full intended experience. Everything supergiant makes is so good! Transistor is still one of my top games of all time"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"The early access for it is already incredible, can’t wait for the full release it’s something special"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,DLC well worth the extra fiver too!
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Elemental with the Icicles, easiest way to get most of speed or timed achievements and OP on a level 5 run if you can get to late rounds with them."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Hopefully it gets a popularity boost when it releases on consoles, particularly the switch"

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"going strong since 2012, they now release an expansion once per year"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-27,"Guild wars 1 was so unique. I loved that I could team up, or just heroes/hench through any content. Games have similar systems but they feel restricted in comparison. Example, FFXIV trusts are nice but can't be used in savage or ultis. Gw1 endgame farming solo w hero/hench to as nice when I didn't want to be social. I wish there was more to come back to on gw1; however I hit my ""done"" a few years ago."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"If you havent yet- try out the Owlbear Cannonball build

????

PROFIT!"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Both games are masterpieces and share a lot of DNA in their gameplay; you can’t go wrong either way. Choose whichever setting sounds more interesting to you (high fantasy kingdom with a ton of lore vs. modern-day Tokyo with a mix of heist movie and comic book flair).
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"If you're into some anime rpg tropes and Pokémon like collecting, Persona 5 Royal on sale is a great deal.

If you're more into JRPGs with with a more typical fantasy setting ReFantazio is definitely work picking up.

Both have nearly identical combat mechanics with slight changes in it."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Persona imo. Just a much more memorable game for me with way better music.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,P5R 100%. It's a masterpiece and only $24 right now. Look up non spoiler tips to make your run worth the time. Make the most out of that game for 100+ hrs easy.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Imo Persona hit harder. Metaphor is better mechanically in some ways, but its not my favorite Atlus game. It has glaring issues that I hope get addressed in a re-release like Royal."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Omg no rest for the wicked was fantastic! I cant wait for its full release

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"At one point, it was a daily occurrence where I would subject my wife to 'Family. Romance. Pit' or the Tiny Tom's Tiny Pies bits. And try to imitate the Yorkshire accent. If they ever bought out merchandise, I'd snatch it up"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"It's got amazing potential, but still feels incomplete in so many areas, so I can understand the lack of mentions here. With that said, I'm sure when the full release arrives, it'll be a major GOTY contender."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,I wanna play Stellar Blade too. I've heard only good things about it. Waiting for the PC release.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Hair to hair, sister"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,It also has great metroidvania elements and design. The exploration is maybe the best I've seen in any MV. It's just so ridiculously fun to explore as you progress and none of it feels like filler content. Most of the time I wasn't even working on the main quest but just exploring and found myself at a dungeon.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I have to baby sit 4 kids tomorrow, If this game can keep them busy, then I'll buy it right now."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,How is it the worst when it’s a lot of content? You’re paying $30 for potentially 500 hours of content. The worst dlc is a fucking skin you don’t see for $20.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I've never been mad at myself before for getting the ending I wanted, that 3rd phase of the final boss was so tough"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"A lot of people are assuming it’s because Black Myth Wukong was a GOTY nominee, and the studio behind Nine Sols *(Red Candle)*, had a lot of controversy around one of their previous releases 



I feel like if it released in any other year, it probably would’ve gotten a lot more nominations"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"If you haven't yet, check out the Helldads subreddit and discord. Great group of dads and mums."

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Nope. You could easily play a very hard level mission, bear the main objective of the map, and extract. Or you could stay for the entire 12-40 min mission timer (different missions give you different amounts of time)"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Your options are 12 minute missions, 15 minute missions, or 40 minute missions. Those are the mission time limits. You can finish them much faster."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Some of the most fun is when you’re trying really hard and you’re doing amazing and then something off screen fucking obliterates you- and then you switch to spectating your friend and he’s getting swarmed like a motherfucker- and then he gets killed by the group of enemies that you were dealing with. Game is a fantastic hero simulator.

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,They fixed it?!? Might have to reinstall it.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,A THING OF BEAUTYY I KNOWW
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,All of the base game's. I haven't finished Liberty yet.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Oh, nevermind, I’ve started it then. Oops."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I can’t explain what it is about it but it gives me Tetris vibes where you are constantly saying “just one more run”. 

My phone has become a portable Balatro machine at this point."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Yup. I absolutely recommend it. Not much of a deck builder here and I played for hours. Another game that I loved despite not being a deck building fan is Inscryption.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Hopefully I don't get crushed by down votes, but I didn't like it. I'm also someone not into deck building games, and didn't think I would be interested. I bought it due to the hype.  
So I played for about 30 minutes, and this goes through a lot of how to play the game and the mechanics... It's honestly more than I wanted to learn. At the end of the day, it's still a card game. It's cool for someone, just not me."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I don't care for deck builder games usually, but this one really hit the right notes for me. I think it helps that it's not some card game shoehorned into a combat based game. Highly recommend getting the mobile version so it can consume the maximum amount of time in your life."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Yes buy it immediately and kiss your free time goodbye
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,"There's deck building involved, but it's not like Slay the Spire, where it's all about the cards you add to your deck. No life bars here, just a score to beat in a limited number of hands. In that way Balatro starts off more like regular poker, but you quickly realize that you need to augment it with synergizing Jokers to make it through a round. Even a royal flush isn't that strong on its own after a few rounds.

You can fix the deck by adding and subtracting cards, changing suits, increasing rank (i.e. the number), etc. to make it easier to fish for the poker hand you want. While counterintuitive, you can easily win with a high card as long as you've got the right Jokers.

The game initially starts off with a limited number of Jokers, but you'll unlock more as you meet certain conditions. Different decks have different rules, and they each play differently. The RNG aspects make you want to try and try again.

Summary: it's fun!"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,It's such a minimal investment. You should 100% play it for yourself and refund if you don't like it.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I don't feel the ""just one more run"" aspect that other do - but I do enjoy it and have over 80 hrs on it in Steam, plus another 40+ on my phone:  for me, it didn't really click until I understood more of the mechanics around how the jokers work and which ones exist - them I can pick a deck (e.g one with no face cards, or one with only hearts and spades), and try to do a run fishing for one of those jokers to get my run juiced up.


It took probably 20 hrs until I started to care that much about it.  Now I just keep playing to try and complete my collection, or finish a gold run on each deck."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,You could always pick it up on mobile to play when you're taking a dump at work. My company time is spent very well that way.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I didn’t think I would like it, but I did."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"It took me a moment to get into it, but it gives those sweet dopamine hits when you see flames erupting off your score and the number is still ticking higher as it tries to calculate the math faster. It just feels good when you master it. 

Because it's all based around poker hands, it has a pretty low entry point, but a high skill mastery because of how many interactions each joker can have. You know you're hitting that sweet point when you start to see scientific notations in scores.

But it can be demoralizing if you don't enjoy the premise of rogue likes where you have to keep losing to get good. Or equally demoralizing when you converted your entire deck into kings, have a great run going and then you face the plant boss that disables all your face cards. Oops. Dead on arrival."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,It feels more like a fast paced puzzle game than a deck builder to me.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,No one should not try it once. If luigi taught you how to play poker on DS then you'll pick it up quick and get addicted.
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"The only deck builder I've ever played was this real unique horror card game called inscryption, i adored that game but because of how charming it is. Never really cared about card games otherwise, but balatro is really really damn fun and I don't even know why. You don't need to know how to play poker to play it, it's easy to learn difficult to master and fun all the time."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,If solitaire is coffee then balatro is crack
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-26,"I picked it up on mobile after seeing everyone singing its  collective praises. 

It's super addicting and I can't really explain why. I haven't done the thing where I lose hours upon hours of my day to it, but any time I have a few minutes to spare I almost reflexively pull out my phone and run a few rounds."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-27,Play inscryption first :)
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Probably the game they played this year, hence the ""personal GOTY"" -- sometimes you discover a great game years later"
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,But it's only been like 2 hours....ahh crap not again
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I think it totally depends on the person I really like and enjoyed the game after coworkers turned me onto it. And we’re all software engineers, but for me it does start to blur into seeming like a job and I stopped playing, but it is so freaking cool."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,Yep! I know what I said 😊
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Dude smashing out of the apartment at the beginning is easily my favorite gaming moment of all time, by 10 miles. Knocked my fucking socks off lmao"

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Probably the Diablo 2 re-release. I can’t quite remember what the r stands for.

1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"It’s ideal for non commital players particularly because dying is such an integral mechanic in the game.  Like, there’s no real penalty for making a mistake and getting killed, you just load right back in.  So it encourages fun and silliness."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"The community is super-chill. I play in a weekly squad with two dads and two non-dads, but even with randos the game is amazing at pushing cooperative, talkative play - while respecting limited time we have for hobbies."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"Game has 10 difficulty settings, so you can play at whatever feels comfortable. In my experience, randoms tend to be pretty chill as well."
1hlyj47,2024-12-25,2024-12-25,"I play with a couple friends for an hour at a time tops, so we level very slowly. Starting out getting paired with randoms everyone was very helpful. We obviously had no idea what we were doing for the first 10 games but even those without mics would text chat some tips and directions. I have yet to meet a toxic player with about 20 hours in."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,PlayStation puts out the best exclusives for sure. Thought Xbox would have put forth some sort of contender by now but they keep messing up the release.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,All mainly single player games. This is what Xbox doesn’t understand. You cannot force a multiplayer game to make money. Placing your bets on only having live services is a losing man’s game. Make good games. Establish franchises. Then try to make a multiplayer experience from those games that people actually want.

I actually think they add nominees some years just because Sony has too many. Some years there are 5 total nominees and sometimes there are 6. On years where Sony has 3 GOTY nominees, I think they might throw in an extra contender just because 3/5 just looks unfair."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Now name the last classic game on Xbox since 360. I’ll wait
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Imma be straight. Naughty dog has bad gameplay.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,&These exclusives are why Xbox are lagging in sales.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I'm not a Playstation fan, almost none of their games have caught my interest. I've tried most of them, even have a PS5 I don't use. But I'm just not a fan of that style of game. But even as a non fan I truly respect the amount of care and polish most Sony games have. It's incredible what they've made and honestly during the 8th console generation it felt like Sony was single-handedly keeping single player story games alive. I can't thank Sony enough for not letting all AAA games devolve into samey online shooters and BRs.

Also out of all Sony games my favourite was Infamous 1 so I really wish we could get a remake of that."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I've always said the PS4 gen was the best simply for their exclusives. Glad they're hitting PC and a whole new audience can enjoy them.

PS5 doesn't offer these games in its PS+ until way past launch; makes me want to play Xbox

I picked up the Horizon Zero Dawn PC port a few months ago and was honestly baffled. I didn't understand why this middling open world crafting go-to-minimap-dot-do--simple-task-repeat-until-done game was getting so much praise. Yes, it does look beautiful, but many games do. Yes, the robot dinosaurs are very cool, but they can't carry a game alone. Aloy is realistically written and acted, definitely, but she's also kind of boring and cliche. I just don't get it.

Am I just old? Am I missing something? Am I being unfair or making assumptions?

I just don't get a lot of modern gaming trends at all..."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bloodborne is about the only masterpiece in there imo. The rest are mostly recycled ubisoft open world knock offs and/or tlou style action adventure games or a crappy combination of both. Its pretty rare for a sony game these days not to feel like they are marketing checklists. The ps2 had more genres on its launch year than the entire life cycle of the ps4 and 5 combined and thats just sad...
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,All shitty ass games. Over hyped.

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Infamous Second Sun does not belong on that list. About as average a game as you can make.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Even Persona 5 was exclusive for a long long time. Final Fantasy 16 is coming out next month.. And at least for now PS5 is the only place to play it.

I like the approaches they’ve made with game pass, cloud gaming and this new iteration of consoles, the series s is a right nifty machine and is a good cost effective way to get into gaming.

They just keep dropping the ball on exclusives. Halo infinite plays really well and I really enjoyed the campaign,it just had 0 multiplayer content at launch.

I’m 90% a player on PlayStation with the last 5% on pc but I hope Xbox will manage to make a comeback because a ""good rivality"" is our benefit…

Take a look at the gamepass, without it, do you think Sony or even Nintendo would have questioned themselves and their services?

Now (for now at least) players who can’t afford that much can play many games across the plateforms for a good price(for now), but the big downside is that you don’t own the games and it could lead to ""zap-gaming""

Last point is that the PlayStation have many point/room for improvement especially for the premium’s offer who from my POV is lacking off…

I’m on essential and will not move at all because I don’t need it but for people who for example are coming to the PlayStation, it’s not that great compared to the gamepass, especially retro-games…🤷‍♂️"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,My favorite thing to do is criticize Sony but it's become harder to do over the years. I like the tailored experience they provide and how careful they are with your experience. Overall well done.

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Fallout 4 Beats All These Games !!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,What a fucking line up. 😎
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"These are good games, one of them is a top five for me, but together there's a real lack of vibrance, if you were to compare it to the decade prior"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Returnal was kind of “meh” for me. I just couldn’t get into it.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Dont Forget Days Gone. The weakest compared to those in that picture.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Death stranding any good? I just bought my first PS a month ago. I played god of war 2018 and then right into ragnarok (super engaging by the way). I took advantage of some of the other plus downloads (blood borne, last of us remastered, FF15, NIOH 1 and 2, demons souls, FF remake. I have a nice backlog of games stacked up. Any other exclusives to watch out for? 

I love the dual sense controller over X box all day. I thought something was wrong on ragnarok with all the sounds it made at first. I had no idea how cool that controller was going to be.

Is the super expensive controller even worth it over the dual sense??"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Wow and I could get all of that on PC for probably way cheaper. PlayStation loses yet again.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Spider-Man was truly terrible.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Yeah it's been a rough decade. The only good one in the picture was H:ZD.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,This list is missing Nioh
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I own both PlayStation and Xbox and I like each of them for different reasons. PS exclusives are king but none of these games were actually developed by a PlayStation studio…
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It's pretty light. If I look at nintendo's bangers over the last decade
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Or alternatively: PC Ports, what's coming to STEAM next"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"The only “bad” game on here is Returnal, and it’s not even that bad- it’s just not a fun game."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I think we got spolit back in the day with games. All of them games are good but I feel like the gaming industry in last couple years have valued money over quality. Maybe just me but feels that way with alot of games atm
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"a lot of these aren'r exclusives, and the norm going foward seems to be timed exclusives, even for first party titles"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Hahaha this is so funny considering Sony's crying about games becoming exclusives with Microsoft Activision acquisition
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Fuck death stranding
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Some of the game you listed in the description are not even console exclusives, like Sifu."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Don’t Train. Due to recent developments, this context is no longer.  Opting out of training however possible.  As there was not consent."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I’m sorry but did I see Forspoken in that list (text list not image)
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I have heard mostly negative things about Death Stranding
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"14 of those games aren't even exclusive, what's this nonsense post, lmao."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Remasters of recent games has got to stop. Classics are classics because they remain untouched.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"You know... I have all these and I only remember playing Returnal. Now that I think of it. Other than bloodborne and spiderman, these are all the same game buy different and maybe that's why."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"5/10 have been on PC in the last 3 years, here's hoping that gets up to 10/10 soon as there's some bangers there.
Also having a version of Bloodborne that runs well is a dream currently"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I didn't really care for TloU and I haven't played uncharted 4 but the trilogy was just alright to me. Everything else was a banger with bloodborne being one of my all-time favourite.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Like everything, but WHY THE FUCK IS FORSPOKEN VALID? And where is bugsnax?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,RDR2 where??
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Half of them are boring soyglop tho
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Bloodborne was fine. Not even a top 5 souls game anymore, but a solid concept. God of War I’ll get to eventually I guess. The rest I have barely even heard of. I’m sure they’re fine but PlayStation isn’t king because of anything that happened in the last three generations"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Someone help me find what's interesting about Death Stranding. I played it a lot and got so bored being postman.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Ghost of tsushima was robbed for GOTY, even after winning the popular vote"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I don't see Days Gone or RDR2 up there..
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Days gone?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Cool opinion.  

Why do people look at exclusives and think they are just the best?  You are being forced to buy an expensive piece of equipment, they produce for a loss, just to be able to play a game.  

100% would prefer playing what games I want on whatever I want."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Death stranding was legit an F tier game. After the first 30 minutes of “Whoah what the heck is happening” wears off, there is nothing redeemable"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The exclusivity for consoles is so stupid.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Sick of all the lame unimaginative open world schlock
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Are these supposed to be the most memorable games on PlayStation or something? If so I would remove Returnal thats a epically lack luster game and shouldn’t be mixed with those other great games that have beautiful stories and great character progression. Also I would add days gone to that list.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,3 of those games are good
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Never really heard of Returnal other than their announcement.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Death stranding?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bloodborne only one I really care about tbh
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Definitely Forspoken or Wolverine
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I need and I mean I NEEEEEED a lollypop chainsaw remake.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,List needs Days Gone
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I don't care about exclusives. I only buy PlayStation and Nintendo consoles for my inexistent digital library.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I have not beaten a single one of those games lol.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"My favorite exclusive is going to be from the short list that I got to play on a platform good enough to give me a flat 4K60 or 4K120.  And tied to my Steam account for that matter.

The rest, I'll wait on Sony's PC-based Gamepass or emulators.  Definitely not hurting for games to play in the meantime."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Is anyone else bothered that these banners all have nearly identical designs?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Should just be gtaV over and over
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ghost of sushi ni—a was great
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Gravity Rush keeps getting robbed.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Uncharted was the best
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-06,Xbox the last 10 years: Absolute garbage
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Now do one for micro soft
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Meanwhile Xbox has Gamepass that gives INSTANT access to HUNDREDS of high quality titles, all for a very very cheap subscription price. 

Idk how you can look at PlayStation with their $70 games and somehow think that's better than getting so many Gamepass games essentially for free."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Absolute bangers
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I’ve been out for the gaming loop for awhile but star wars bought me back.

Why would anyone buy a Xbox? Is it just halo?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Meanwhile Xbox:

Look, we have Redfall."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I only see 1, maybe 2 good games here."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,This should have just had the last of us on it three times with their  reliance on it lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,ragnarok was fucking boring as shit
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Several of these are not Sony games unless you consider Dragon Quest XIs to be a Nintendo game, or even Octopath Travellers (and tons of switch games published WW except Japan by Nintendo). And then those are not exclusives.

It actually just feels like obnoxious astroturfing."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"The fact Horizon Zero Dawn is here, but not Forbidden West is absolutely perfect! (Nothing to do with the recent “controversy,” just bad game lol)

Edit: this is just a joke for my own amusement because I’m still upset with how HFW turned out. No shade intended to anyone who enjoys the game!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,XBOX WILL DO EXCLUSIVES REEEEEEEE
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Yup.

Xbox has nothing.

Edit: Xbox fan boys extra salty today"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,There really is no comparison when it comes to exclusives in terms of quality and quantity. Sure Xbox has original Halo and Nintendo has its few but Sony has so many games
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Get Death Stranding off of there and that's a solid list.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I’ve only played 2 on that list. Uncharted 4 was just way too long and ghost of Tsushima should of been game of the year!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,All bangers! Except for *that one.*
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Would be kind of interesting to compare Nintendo Sony and Microsoft big releases like this. It’s just that it seems like a lot of games but I see “10 years” and I suddenly feel like that’s not very many and not very frequently. But I’m honestly not sure.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,4 great games
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Just got a PS4 today and bought PS+ so I’ll be making my way through all the games here that are included that I’ve missed on XBOX
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I don't know why but I had almost all these games but barely touched them because they are on PlayStation. The PS5 user experience isn't very welcoming. As good as these games are, I just missed the Xbox user experience everytime I booted the console. Sold it to a coworker recently because it was mostly gathering dust for the past 2 years.

Having good games is not everything. The experience matters."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Now do XBox
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I’ve been an Xbox guy my whole life but will always say that PS5 has the better exclusives. Spider man, GOT, and GOW/GOWR are some of the best games I’ve ever played."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,GOT is the GOAT
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Microsoft crying in the corner.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,PClaystation
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Damn, it's crazy only 2 of these were good games."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Two of these are good games. The rest are not.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,And here Xbox can't put out anything even remotely on the same level. Seems like something always goes wrong. And now the CMA blocked the Activision/Blizzard acquisition. Xbox seems to be fucking cursed at this point.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Only played god of war blood born and horizon the rest not worth the time
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Sub par at best…
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I see this and I all I can think is how I got out of console land while it was good. Only downhill after PS2. PC gamer 4 rife.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Honestly only had two 10/10 games and they were both Last of Us games.

Close seconds were GoW:R, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon:FW in no particular order."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Oh good, a list of games I've never played because I didn't pay for a console I don't need! 

I assume they're all good, might emulate them on PC and play with my Bluetooth controller."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Bleh, no Deathloop ? Come on...."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Death stranding isnt a Sony game(its on game pass PC)
Returnal was mid at best and all horizon games are in weird limbo between shit and mid. The rest is actually good"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Death Stranding was soooooooooo boring
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,What a boring list for mainstream gamers 🥱
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"2 games on this pic are interesting

with exception of returnal, dont know it"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,All those games and only 4 good ones smh
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"What is ""Returnal""?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,5/10. All of them
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Only 6 of these are even any good.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,death stranding is a big laugh out loud. Other than that definitely a solid line up.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"If I had to pick one, I'd pick up Bloodborne but these games are all so damn underwhelming compared to ps1-ps2 era. 

I don't think I'd waste my free time on any of these cheesy soulless ""cinematic experiences"" falsely marketed as games even if they released for free on my console of choice."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Too bad. These a great titles but there has been a massive amount of solid indie games that has had me bury more hours than these.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"How does Death Stranding make the cut ? You missed Heavy Rain, Resistance, PAIN, Little Big Planet, GT, Forspoken, Rachet, GOT."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Lots of really mediocre overrated Games.

I played HZD, Spiderman, GoW and Days Gone on PC and all were mediocre except Days Gone.

Uncharted is literal Garbage and I have no clue how people like that trashy B-Movie Story interrupted by bad Gamplay."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Returnable doesn't belong on this list. The game doesn't have a coherent story.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Death Stranding on this list lmao!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Last of Us and GoW.  The rest I could take or leave.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,All of these games suck except bloodborne.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,What Wolverine game are you referring to?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Xbox had Scalebound... oh wait.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,If there was ever a way to transfer games I would in a heartbeat. Xbox has gotten so bad the last few years
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Why is returnal even on here it's a shitty demo of a game.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,This is really sad. The state of PlayStation in terms of games is at its lowest. There are no iconic seireses anymore. Only those nobody will remember in a couple of years and sequels of previously popular titles. And Bloodborne.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,All the same third-person “cinematic” action adventure Game with no a single multiplayer game. They’ve been basically milking the same genre for a generation 😂
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ahh so this sub is just a PlayStation circle jerk now. Nice
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,so basically mostly terrible?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"The only one I really enjoyed was bloodborne, I don't mind the others to much but they play more like set pieces or films than games."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Bloodborne. What are the rest of these games? Never heard of them.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Honestly only good one was the last of us 🤷‍♂️😂
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"And Spider Man is the only good game on this list.
10 years wasted."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,9 years of masterpieces plus Death Stranding
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Infamous was good but the rest is pretty but shallow and mediocre.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I’m gonna be real with you, I completely forgot Infamous Second Son was a thing"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Where bloodborne for pc at
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Ratchet and clank, Days Gone, Sackboy, Gran Turismo 7 just throwing those in there as well :)

Ohhh i see the whole list now 😯"

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Man, I wish PS would release a PS5 version of Bloodbourne and a PC version. I'd even just settle for a 60fps version too ... but unfortunately, we are stuck with a 30fps version that is showing its age in comparison to other FromSoft games (Elden Ring, Demon Souls etc.)"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,What about DBFZ
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,What i'd do for a new Sly or Jax game
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Returnal was honestly such a surprise joy for me. The vibe the game’s marketing images presented was so interesting, but I barely knew anything about the game, and going in mostly blind, it’s stuck with me as one of the most fun and interesting games I’ve played in a long time."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Lots of good memories and games yet to play!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"十年早いんだよ！(Jūnen hayainda yo!)

Never forget Virtua Fighter"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Wasn’t Last of Us pre-2013 on the PS3? And I think Returnal came out on multiple platforms too
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Infamous second son.
I remember sneaking onto my brother's new PS4 to experience that game, it was crazy fun from what I remember atleast."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Spider-Man 2
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I can’t wait for the GOW Amazon show!  The Norse mythology storyline is pretty good and I bet live-action Kratos will be portrayed by a pretty good actor.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Exactly why I moved on to PC. I love my Xbox but I'm tired of the disappointment.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,How can my answer be anything else BUT Bloodborne? What a master piece! Really hoping they can remaster for that sweet sweet 4k 60fps. =D
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,What's Returnal like? It's the only one there I don't own.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,How is Returnal? Is it space/horror? Action and fighting?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I’ve had people tell me that consoles don’t count as “gaming.” I guess they’re wrong.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Don't ask if they got  any more good games in that 10 years what you see infront of you is it.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Killzone and resistance need to be revived
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Was Returnal good?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Ahem…Days Gone
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,You forgot to put last of us 3 times and GTA V 10 times
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Death Stranding was Ight
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Damn, seeing them all like this… well done PlayStation.  Now… bring back Infamous!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,So um... when they porting horizon forbidden west to PC?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I've waited so long for a sequel to second sons/ the infamous universe.

I've lost hope."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,When I bought my ps4 in 2015 it came with the last of us but I have yet to play it. I played Horizon dawn and got close to the ending but never finished it and I have the new one that came with the ps5 which I haven't played yet. Bloodborne was free on PS plus but i didn't like it and couldn't pass the first level and quickly uninstalled😂 haven't played any of the rest on the list
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Returnal doesn’t belong in this list IMO
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Most of the games you listed aren't exclusives.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Just bangers
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"The best of PlayStation Studios was during the PS2 and PS3 days. Jak, Sly, Ratchet, Uncharted 1-3, TLoU, inFAMOUS where all big favorites of mine. Nowadays PS Studios just doesn't pull me in with their exclusives. Exception being the Insomniac games"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Some real bangers there. And Infamous Second Son.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,They should release Bloodborne for PC
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"How was returnal, anyone recommend?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Maybe it's time to pick up a used ps4!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,New Socom when?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,and most of them have the same camera angle
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ghosts and Bloodborne are my favourite of all them.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Only good games on here are the first 4 and maybe death stranding if we're being generous
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Oh how I wish Sony will make another Infamous game for the PS5 this time.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Infamous!!!!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bring them to PC and everyone is happy
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Ive played over half but not all. Someone who has played them all - rank'em

Edit: spelling"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Haven’t played a single one
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I need to finish Ghosts of Tsushima.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Metal gear phantom pain?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I'm jealous of the people who skipped the ps4 generation and hopped back in with PS5 and have all these games back to back.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,spider-man was amazing
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Rocket league, Fall guys, Resogun, etc. weren’t necessarily first party games, but they all debuted for “free” exclusively on PS Plus. Another reason why PS dominated last gen."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Man I’ve never heard of this infamous game until this post…but seems to get a lot of love?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Gravity Rush 1 and 2, no questions asked"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I have never played uncharted, is it worth a try from the first game?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"LOL, these games are SO OLD but a lot of fun.

Bloodborne was my favorite. A hoonter must hoont."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Dino Crisis, please"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"TLOU 1+2, UNCHARTED 1-4, God Of War, and Spider-Man PS4+MM are some of the best games I’ve ever played"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,masterpieces all of them
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I would love another infamous installment but I just didn’t care about Delson as much as I did Cole
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,What no Elden Ring?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Bloodborne needs a gaddamn remaster or remake, absolute disgrace this masterpiece hasn’t received the kind of polish it deserves for the PS5"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Well they can't all be winners lol. Love bloodborne tho
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,FF7R is the only reason to have a PS tho
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bring back classics like Onimusha/Dino Crisis/Jak and Daxter via a complete overhaul.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Is returnal any good??
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Can someone convince me about if Death stranding, Horizon Zero, and infamous are good?

I saw some of death stranding, it's Hideo Kojima walking sim but with lore

For infamous, i watched a playthrough and thought it was ok

And for Horizon Zero, I have both games but only tried Forbidden west and didn't like it"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Factions 2 plz
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Where is RDR2!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Second Son is the best game on this list.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Ok but Second Son sucked compared to the first 2. 

Wouldn’t be putting that one front-and-centre tbh"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Infamous, one of the few of that list i own, and is my first ever Platinum, so yeah"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Infamous should definitely have another instalment
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Am i right in stating that Death Stranding has the most mixed reviews out of all of these? I want to play it but every review makes it seem like a walking simulator with a hard-to-follow story.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,How is Gran Turismo not on here?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Now do the same for Xbox... Lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,So glad GoT is getting love
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,You'll have to update the list and take SIFU off. It isn't a Playstation exclusive and you're missing some of the bangers others have stated.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Anything like this for xbox?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05, I want more infamous
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I just got a playstation 4 like, 5 months ago and im JUST starting to play some of these games.


I may have started late but that just means the fun is JUST beginning!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,console exclusives
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,why did you replace it with ghost
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,RIP Gravity Rush and Team Ico
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bro I really want FromSoftware to port Bloodborne to the other platforms as that'll be an amazing day.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Where is Demon’s Souls?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I wonder what one for Xbox would look like. It would need to have Halo and Gears.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The first strand-type game 😍
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"There are 2 good games in that image...

Edit: and 4 in the list..."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Play-stay-shone
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Haven’t played 7, 8, 9 or 10. Which one should I start with?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Infamous and Death Stranding are really not that good (especially Death Stranding, goddamn this game can be horrendous sometimes), but everything else is pretty good. Sony yet again with the best new IP from the generation, Horizon for the PS4, Last of Us for the PS3, etc.. Sony, similar to Nintendo, have that ""pedigree"". Xbox desperately needs to reach that level, the really popular triple A. Halo and Gears of War became zombies, Forza is niched... I think Psychonauts is at this level, sadly the game is not really popular"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Feels good to be a PC user.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,😭 bloodborne. Pls give us bloodborne 2
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Honestly I think at this point I might just try to get a PC at some point, I think the only reason I stick to Xbox is because all my games i play and replay are on there but damn I've wanted to play all the PS exclusives because I play only single player games except Halo and Mario Kart"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"But Xbox got MORBIN TIME the game:

Redfall"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,All amazing games
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,2 are good
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bloodborne and its not even close
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,How are these exclusives when I can play 90% of them on PC?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"IDC what people say, I would take Death Stranding out for TLOU2. Death Stranding is a very niche kinda game, the only reason people didn’t like TLOU2 is cuz of the story."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I would do ANYTHING for a Bloodborne PC port/remake/remaster/SOMETHING!!!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Only one on here I haven't played is Returnal.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I was expecting to see TLOU 4 times
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Holy crap, I love inFamous! I played inFamous 2 on the PS3 and then inFamous: Second Son on PS4, really great games in my opinion."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"What’s an honest ranking for some one who’s never played any of these (but know about most gameplays/story etc)… or where to begin?

Too much repetitiveness bores me tho.."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ummm… where’s Ratchet and Clank? Or Gran Turismo? Sack boy? Astrobot? Until Dawn? Days Gone? The Last Guardian? Soooo many games and series not present here…
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Tough pick between Horizon Zero Dawn / Forbidden West and God of War 2018 / Ragnarok.

We've truly been blessed this past 10 years with exclusives and I couldn't be happier to be a PlayStation owner.

I also own a Switch and a XSX and the people over at r/XSX are screaming out for just any decent exclusives"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Being team Xbox this makes depressed
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Meanwhile over at Xbox Anthem and Redfall
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"And you left out tlou 2, well done. 👍"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,These aren't all exclusive though?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Xbox: rEdFaLL
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Why list 1 game for each year when you could just list all their amazing games from the past 10 years.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Man I finally got around to playing uncharted 4 and lost legacy and damn I had a good time from beginning to end in both
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Days gone is missing
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I hope Sony puts InFAMOUS, Ratchet & Clank, Bloodborne and Shadow of the Colossus on PC someday. I really want to play them on Steam man"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"This is just disgusting. Super fuckin flex, and I fuckin love it"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,This is depressing as an Xbox fan lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Where TF are God of War (2018), Gravity Rush, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart… there are a lot of missing greats here."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I'm hoping for an Ape Escape Remake/Remastered trilogy
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Where is Knack??
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I think Days gone deserve to be here too.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Now do xbox.... oh wait
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ratchet and Clank rift apart. I'm ßorry I just lived the series
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Meh...
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The only game i play on PS5 now is Bloodborne... I really need some new exciting games!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Show xbox in the same time 💀💀 The medium? Halo 5? 💀💀 Battletoads?? 💀
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Are there no good games coming out anytime soon? I keep seeing posts about how great the games were in previous gens. What about how great the games are expected to be that will be coming out.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"This is the thing that I like about PS titles, they always look so vibrant, hopeful, and interesting, while Xbox's titles look so grey, hopeless, and bleak..."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Does this mean nobody would care if cod was Xbox exclusive?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bloodborne and Ragnarok need to hurry the hell up on pc.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The last of us part 2 deserves its own banner!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I don't own a Playstation so I could be wrong with this observation, but are all of those 3rd person, single player, action/adventure games?

Sony sure has a lock on that market."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I really hope we get another inFamous game at some point
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Gravity rush clears most of these, personally, Id say it clears all of them, but that's a personal opinion."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Definitely The Last of Us and God of War Ragnarök
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I was hoping to see Xbox’s version lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Xbox: Anyways here’s Redfall
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Death stranding huh? Ok yeah that game is trash
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,GOT and Returnal the only missteps with Sony.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ghost Of Tsushima is the only one I actually finished and that’s more of my interest in the time period then actual gameplay. The interactive movie experience of these Sony exclusives just kills my enthusiasm. Glad they did well but gameplay is not up my alley with the lack of variety and control.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I regret buying an Xbox
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Regret like a mf letting go of my PS during a long period of nit gaming... missing out on amazing PS exclusives kills my soul 😭
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,bloodborne best
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Returnal is the only miss lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Where is my Days Gone? Its a great story
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Still wait for bloodborne, ghost of tsushima, god of war ragnarök and uncharted for the pc.."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,God I want infamous back. And a bloodbourne pc port. The day infamous comes back is the day I buy a ps5
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I miss infamous and I want PC ports
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,2019... Days Gone is better than Death Stranding. Change my mind.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Final Fantasy VII: Remake is my personal fav cant wait for Rebirth or a new Rebirth teaser. But yeah this list is impressive, Sony has built up quite the catalog."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,WHERE IS RATCHET AND CLANK?!?!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Haven't had an infamous title in a while dang
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Nothing but fucking bangers.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,10/10s
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I played non of them, cause adult live is hard and can’t afford any"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,No Gravity Rush...
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Oml I forgot about Bloodbourne. Legendary game
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ratchet and clank rift apart was a blast and a half
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"And Resistance! A Resistance 1 and 2 remake along the lines of the Demon’s Souls remake would be amazing. I’d accept 3, too."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I don't want a remaster; I want a new game in the series.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Suckerpunch has killed Infamous remaster/continuation IIRC
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I'd love to see a remake and port of the Infamous trilogy (why not all three games, come on Sony!)  

Also Wouldn't mind getting the first three Uncharted games on PC, The 4th is good, but... well where's the rest of the story?

Bloodborne as a port would be obvious, but Sony hates money.. 

And I say this as someone who owns all those games on their platforms, but getting them on Steam would be huge for both preservation and enjoyment."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I would settle for a 60fps mode
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Hell I'd like them to remaster all three Infamous games. I played second son again for the first time in a while and it DEFINITELY is showing its age gameplay wise
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I found Second Son on the PlayStation hits section of the PS Plus stuff and I decided to pick it up. I fucking love that game. I really wanna know what happened in the previous games, so yes please make that remake."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I'm just hoping for a Dino crisis remake
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,No.... We need a legend of dragoon remake first bro.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I absolutely LOVED the first 2 infamous games. I haven't bought a new game in a couple years cause they're so expensive now but I would buy a remaster at full price day one of Infamous
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I'm waiting for a legacy of kain amd a darkwatch remaster.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,You'll get a remake of The Last of Us Part 2... AND YOU WILL LIKE IT!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"As somebody who absolutely loves Bloodborne I don't understand why people want a remaster at all. The graphics of Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 hold up just fine to where I don't think a remaster would be that noticeably different, and I never had technical issues with frames or anything.

If they were going to do a total graphical update Demon Souls style I'd much rather Dark Souls 1 (I know it got a ""remaster"" but the graphics are still pretty ass) to get the update, hell as much as people shit on the game Dark Souls 2 has some of the most stunning scenery which would be absolutely glorious if it had the kind of treatment Demon Souls got."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,No joke. One of the most satisfying combat systems in gaming if you can master it.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It's one of those strange games where like 70% of people who played it are like ""this is one of the most incredible games I've ever played"" and then the other 30% are like ""this game is so over hyped Idk what everyone else is talking about it was mid""


I think it just does 3-4 things incredibly well, so if those things are thing you happen to really value in video games, it's amazing, but if not you just don't see the appeal. 


Personally, I have almost 300 hours in it and it's genuinely my favorite single player game in the last decade at least."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Beautiful game, super satisfying combat. Which ending?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Man with Sony releasing so many games on PC that's the one I'm most anticipating coming to PC hopefully soon.  

I really hope the disaster of the Last of Us launched didn't ruin the chance of that."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I really hope they release it on PC soon. I can't justify the money for a new console when I hardly play games anymore.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,1/2 way through. Finally bought a ps5.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I really wanted to check it out but various reviews criticized it for repetitiveness. Go here, liberate a village, go there, do something else, etc. Repetitive in the same way as recent Far Cry games. Did you feel that way at all or was it a pretty good experience the whole way?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Now try Legends. I put like 70% of my whole GoT time in Legends and I platinumed the campaign.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I do too, but that isn't a PlayStation exclusive series"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Activision has the ip hostage. For Prototype 3 to happen Microsoft would need to complete the acquisition
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I felt this.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"You know, I haven't seen people talk about Second Son. I've heard talk about the others, but for some reason SS just didn't have the same impact"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Same. Word through the grapevine is we may be in luck.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Me too. Loved all those games.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,KNACK BAYBEEEEEEE
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Here comes the money
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Gex is also underrated
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Knack 2 is actually a great game lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,A knackstapiece!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,At least people like you who know about the games other than me exist so there is still hope ;(
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Do you need to play gravity rush 1 to follow 2?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"What I'd give for a third on PS5...

GR, GR:R, and GR2 were all just an amazing time flying around, exploring, listening to the music. Man I love those games."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I honestly feel like the games have a lot of weaknesses but I love them anyway
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Yeah. I played through GR1 and GR2 right before the latter had its servers axed. One of the few times I used the PS4's community thingy (to help people with dusty tokens).  Both were flawed but really charming and fun games. I've been holding off on a PS5 but if GR3 was somehow announced and a thing I'd go buy one today.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"The only game in this list that I actually want and hasn't come to PC, yet..."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,the only word that needs to be said here
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,On PC already pls
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,They’re concentrating on killing Halo
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Redfall is just such an anemic game. Sony’s latest is God of War and Nintendo is set to release tears of the kingdom. Redfall does not look good with that competition.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Xbox has been fumbling the bag HARD. Halo Infinite was super promising, but it didn't launch with enough and couldn't get the content flow needed to let it be a truly great."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Xbox isn't really about exclusives anymore, it's now a Xbox *and* pc thing"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,[deleted]
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I’d actually argue that Nintendo makes better exclusives all together
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Although not a complete exclusive I’ve Comtemplated buying an Xbox just to play hifi rush and high on life
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I really wish microsoft would make it harder for me to choose a console.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The largest multiplayer games probably makes more money than all these combined though.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Microsoft understands it. They’re not dumb. They just don’t care enough to adapt to it. Instead, they are focusing efforts on expansion and acquisition  rather than invest in their own brand to increase the quality of Xbox titles. I’ve been an XB owner since the original and long for the days of an exciting console launch with a sizable library of new (completely working) games to push the hardware to its limit."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I mean technically Death Stranding in an online game..
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Isn't Sony working on multiple online games?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Seems like Playstation is playing all their bets on live service going forward. They’re touting what? 12 live service games in development already?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"You mean like Fallout 76 and Metal Gear Survive? 

Maybe they should just make good games, whether they're multiplayer or not."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"With GoWR there and Spider-Man in the same year, it makes sense that SM got the nod."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Fucking died so many times, but couldn’t stop playing it."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Returnal has some of the tightest most frustrating gameplay I’ve ever experienced. The game rocks though.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I legit can't stop playing it. its so addicting.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I'm playing it now and was going to comment that I was glad it was on this list. 
It's so much better than the attention it got. 

I'm getting my ass handed to me, but it's good at not feeling repetitive. 

Every run is different."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"best example of a game starting you as low as dirt then by the mid to end game you are a freaking pro gamer with twitch skills and get MAD at yourself for being hit ONCE lol

I love this game"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"The roguelike aspects of it probably make it a niche game. I love the story, but with how punishing it is to fail, I finally gave up after reaching the last area of second chapter and dying to the boss. It took me a solid 3 days to beat the first chapter."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"If it wasn't a Roguelike I think it would be incredible. Having to replay a bunch of shit for hours to get back to where you died is just too much, especially with how little progression is made each run."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It is yes… very much so.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I did too though Second Son was on the short side and didn't offer much on the campaign side of things from what I remembered.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Sucker Punch has created a pattern of creating iconic Playstation franchises, taking them to a point of where they've done what they think is interesting or exciting with it, and then switching gears to something drastically new. First Sly Cooper, then Infamous, and now Ghost of Tsushima which I feel is incredibly likely to have a sequel announced within the next year. And after one or two more games following the world of Jin Sakai, I wouldn't be surprised to see them move onto something completely different."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Rift apart was a fantastic game!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It really doesn't need a remake, we need a sequel"

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I found that funny too. Here's a post about discussing PlayStation exclusives and a lot of the comments are just ""Here's why Xbox is bad..."""
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Only one game a year
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Our friend Aloy is still on the list! 😎
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"No need to cry, friend.  It's a phenomenal game."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It’s on the written list in the description. I could never miss it!😎😍
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It had a good concept.  It just the heart wasn't there.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Sad Aloy noises
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"There was a leak about two years ago where many stuff leaked turned out to be correct, Ghost of Tsushima on PC was part of the leak, so I guess it’s a matter of time before they confirm it, likely around the movie’s release"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I've recently tried the PS Cloud Streaming that has Ghost of Tsushima on it (including many other games) and it runs very well on PC with an Internet connection of at least 25 Mbps.

If you want to play the game now and don't want to wait for the PC port, I can recommend getting the PS Cloud Streaming for a month or so. It's about $18"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Nah, just a 'content creator', probably trying to get some people to follow him or something. Whether that's better, I'll leave it up to you."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It’s one of my most favorite games of all time. I gotta tell you it’s different, it may not be for everyone, but if you’re willing to try it and be open to it, you’re gonna love it. It does so many things right"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Xbox and PC player here, we've barely got any good games that are Xbox Exclusive. Sucks!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"The first two Infamous games were great and I would give anything for a remake of them finally. Second son wasn't bad, but it wasn't as memorable for me. Never played the fourth one they dropped, and if they dropped any more I haven't heard of them."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Yes, I just finished the game and it was such a great experience, the plot, the combat, all great.. The game is a bit difficult tho"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"IMO Its story and atmosphere are great but if you've ever played an actually good rogue like with loads of builds and variety in the combat and enemies then it will disappoint you. Starting new runs should be exciting, an opportunity to try new things but it quickly becomes dull as theres little new to try or see."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"It's hard, so it doesn't have as broad of an appeal as some of the others.  But it's definitely a great console exclusive."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Returnal is burned into my brain. Amazing gameplay and amazing story.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Absolutely. It's really hard to put down.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It’s fucking fantastic. One of my favorite games ever. Extremely difficult but so tight gameplay wise and so well done that you power through and get better.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Yes. It’s an exceptionally great game
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Yeah, I wish BB is in PC right now."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,That's because it literally is a mail delivery simulator
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"It's a AAA mail delivery simulator + management game with an amazing story and setting. If you are into those type of games it's the best thing since sliced bread, if you are not it's just boring as fuck. Depends on the person, there are loads of people that love playing job simulators, I'm just not one of them."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I actually love it, literally currently playing it. But I can also 100% understand that this isn’t for everyone lol."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"It really hit a it’s stride a few hours in(wanna say5-6), but it definitely wasn’t for everyone"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,[deleted]
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"For me, Death Stranding was a fantastic exploration game. I’m always excited about what might be over the next hill.

And then building the highway system and zip line system so backtracking is a breeze was uber satisfying."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,It was hands down Game of its Year.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I loved Death Stranding, it’s basically an interactive movie."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,My most hyped game alongside Pragmata and Final Fantasy XVI! Can’t wait 🥂🙌🏼
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It was literally GOTY and they made a movie about it, it was hardly unappreciated lol

Edit: it also had a 93 metacritic score 

Edit2: apologies Overwatch won, which is bs but UC4 was nominated and amazing"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I mean the Gamepass is great, I play a lot of games I normally would never risk paying full price for. But we do miss out on absolute gold when you see these lists. Xbox exclusives pale in comparison. I sometimes borrow my brothers playstation just to play some of these they are that good."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Im. One of these ps3 mgs ppl
With my first salary as an adult"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It’s a story-driven action adventure rogue-like game with cosmic horror and psychological horror vibes.

The gameplay is challenging with no saving/checkpoints except for one mid game, so you die you repeat and the areas shuffle, so yeah it’s challenging and not for everyone. I had it on launch, played it for a while, hated it, left it for a month or so then came back and I grew to love it, finished it and platinumed it😝

So for me, I recommend it, but it depends on how much you’re familiar with the genre (I wasn’t. I didn’t even know rogue-like was a thing and went completely blind in the game, save for the announcement trailer) and how much you’re willing to tolerate/master it."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Preach! 🤘✊
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Even better
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I do, thanks!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I do, they're the best type"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Beacuse it pretty darn good I should think.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I would have thought Gran Turismo would be in here.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"The common thread between most shit ports is that they are current gen only, considering GOT is on last gen it should be fine"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Horizon's story and Aloy aren't really what interested me about the game. I really enjoyed the worldbuilding and I thought the combat was pretty fun, even if the crafting system it was built off of was pretty mid.

The Robo-Dinos definetly helped though"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"If that's what u got out of the game, then by all means, drop it. The story, concept and characters don't interest u- prob already a turn off. It would be to most thinking all that was boring.

Was great imo, has typical Ubisoft-like formula but the characters and robot apocalypse stuff got me excited. Unique compared to other post-apocalyptic or Ai robot genre things, lol. Plenty of games have crafting which is sometimes shoehorned into a game. Makes sense in this. The open world RPG repetitive back and forth has likely existed in most/all games like this since the 1st ever, typical, tbh

To be clear, some trends u see aren't nearly as bad as what we see right now (ahem; live service, battle pass, unfinished releases, post launch major patches..) 😔"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"How far did you get into the game? Because the farther you go, the more challenging the enemies get and the more specified and intentional your combat builds need to become. The game has some of the most unique weapons and combat of any game I’ve ever played and it becomes so rewarding when you take down these massive leviathan robots through your cunning and strategizing. 

Also the plot starts off pretty barebones at the beginning but it eventually becomes mind blowing, with some truly insane revelations about the world you’re in that make this product quite impressive."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Same conclusion when I tried Horizon, a terribly boring game that reminded me of the worst that Ubisoft can produce"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,More of a fan of pixel art farming simulators?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Have you considered not unplugging your console while it's in sleep mode...?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Bro you literally proved why console exclusives work, you bought a system for three games, you did what they wanted you to do"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,As a PC using console-hater I've seen Playstation fanboys shit on Xbox fanboys for like a decade and completely defend console exclusives.  So when Microsoft bought Bethesda it was so humorous to see all the PS kids start whining about it.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"They clowned on Xbox for bringing their games to PC, but when PlayStation does it they praise them.

They clown on Xbox for paid multiplayer access, when PlayStation does it it's praise-worthy even when they get hacked.

They clown on Xbox for supporting last gen hardware into this gen, but when PlayStation does it they don't say a word.

They clown on Xbox for the ""marketing term"" smart delivery, when Sony charges $10 for the same nobody cares.

It's honestly an integral part of that community to be a hypocrite at this point."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Exclusives really do suck. Now I just don't play the games that don't come onto the PC. Sucks for me, sucks for the studio trying to get their craft out there to gamers. At least there's more than enough to play. I got tired of buying consoles solely for a handful of games, only to let them collect dust afterwards, until a new generation comes out, so I can repeat the cycle again. I figured it was time to stop once the PS5 and X1X's came out. But funnily enough, I might actually have to thank scalpers for helping me out of this cycle, heh.

Though I think the exclusivity thing is slowly winding down a bit. Even Sony is putting more titles onto the PC, which I greatly appreciate."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Agree to some extent. When it's your own studio, fine, it makes sense that you don't want to spend resources developing for another platform.

When it's a third party studio and you pay them specifically to not go to other consoles, that's shitty as fuck. Like it was recently revealed Sony did with FFXVI

Wish it was more widely frowned upon."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ragnarok? It’s there. Or are you talking about Forbidden West? I prefer the original game tbh
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Yeah, the problem with Xbox is that their game are on PC too and run better on PS5 when multi platform. They really need Starfield to be incredible, but knowing Bethesda I don’t think it will save this generation for Xbox, especially with it beeing on PC too."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,🙌🏼🫡
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Grab one, my friend. There’s already a huge catalogue that you’re going to enjoy, many of which is on PlayStation Plus, if you don’t wanna get them all full priced, there’s also game trials and quite the amazing offers every now and then, and of course, a huge lineup ahead."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Honestly, I’m a PlayStation player since day one and I wanted to get an Xbox Series X to play Fable, Project Mara, Hellblade, Starfield and The Elder Scrolls VI, but I thought I’d wait because back in the day, I got an Xbox One to play Quantum Break and Ryse, and ended up not playing much on it after that, everything was on PS4 for me.

So in this generation, I’m just really hoping that they get it together and deliver superb experiences with those title. I can’t wait for Kojima’s Xbox project as much as I’m hyped for DS2😎"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Did you ...play Bloodborne???
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,There are some good ones on the list but I kinda feel you. A lot of the 'big hitters' back on PS4 that garnered praise from critics and friends didn't click with me.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Opinions is a crazy concept
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"PlayStation has had much more input in AAA gaming than any other platform out there, and claiming that they’re all the same shows how little you’ve seen of those games to make such judgement. I’m curious to know based on what metric are God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, The Last of Us, Returnal, Nioh or Final Fantasy VII are in any way the same or similar to your average Ubisoft game.

Is it the mere camera perspective? The fact that it’s action and adventure? Both of those are quite broad umbrella descriptions for games with a wide variety of genre.

If anything, it’s Bloodborne that looks two generations behind and recycled gameplay from every Souls game.

Also game development cycles take far more time and money than they did during the PS2 era and same for the price of each game, so don’t be surprised if there aren’t as many games, as there used to be, but even then, no other publisher is putting out as much original game that are both successful critically and commercially like PS Studios and the third party studios they collaborate with."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"THIS SO MUCH THIS. 

Idk how anyone enjoys PlayStation because they regurgitate the same game over and over again. Sure go ahead buy a ps5 if you enjoy playing different skins of Uncharted forever. 

Xbox has a ton of variety. Forza, flight sim, HiFi Rush, AOE, Halo, all different genres and wildly different experiences. 

I'll take Xbox over generic Sony any day."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"It definitely needed a little more depth, but I loved every bit of it still."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bloodborne is surprising considering the FromSoft fanbase has been foaming at the mouth for a remake for years. I just wish we got a PC port for the base game.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"The thing is this formula works in terms of selling 10-20m copies for their big titles and it brings in people into the platform. Besides, with Gamepass on Xbox, most Xbox players feel far less incentivized to buy when they know a game is gonna end up on Gamepass, eventually.

That model doesn’t work for Sony given how much having the game on PlayStation benefits both hardware and software sales, not to mention pure full priced sales are needed to cover for the massive budget allocated for each game.

Nintendo for example relies on exclusives to sell their consoles, because there’s literally nothing motivating people to buy their consoles beside their exclusives.

Microsoft has Gamepass as a selling point, not much new AAA games but Gamepass itself is a selling point and it’s shared with PC/Cloud.

PlayStation has their exclusives and their performance and SSD instant loading times to sell.

You might see more PlayStation games going to PC, as they are now, especially the upcoming live service games, but to see them become multiplatform titles, I don’t think so, since that would not defeat the purpose of their existence, but also affects development to focus on more than one platform to optimize for, which requires extra time and budget."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Lets be real here sony dont get nintendo and xbox games too(dont start with games like minecraft that was acquired way later)
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Horizon was 17, Spider-Man was 18"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,😅😅😅😅😅
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Absolutely ✊🏽
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,You can if you don’t ignore details that don’t meet your narrative.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I prefer Sony but Gamepass is such a good value if you have varied tastes in video games. There have been a handful of games released day 1 that are super fun that I wished I still had a Gamepass subscription.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,What’s considered trash games is totally subjective. I have friends who think bloodborne sucks. They wrong as hell but that’s opinions for ya lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Gamepass literally has exponentially more quality titles FOR NO EXTRA CHARGE than Sony has for their entire ps5 lineup. PLUS ps5 games cost $70. 

Idk how anyone considers PlayStation a good deal."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Yeah, The Last of Us is exactly like Death Stranding and Bloodborne and those are exact clones of Nioh, Horizon and Returnal, oh and Ratchet and Clank? Thats literally a reskin or Gran Turismo which in itself could very well be a clone of God of War.

They literally reskinned the same game over and over and ironically, many of them sold 10-20 million copies, and some 33 million.

Sounds like so many people couldn’t tell them apart and confused them enough to buy them over and over😅😅😅"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,“No multiplayer games cause I love them = pointless console” - 🤓
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Lol 😂
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"This wasn’t a competition. These games were made by PlayStation Studios or original IPs funded by Sony and made by third party devs that launched first and foremost on PS, and them going to PC doesn’t really take away anything from them. On the contrary, they help bring more people into the PlayStation universe."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,What do you mean “that’s it”?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It’s still better than the endless Halo, Forza and Gears game from Microsoft, I hope they really wake up next generation, or they will fall even more behind."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"The post says “PlayStation: The Last 10 Years”. It doesn’t say “The Eternal Exclusives of PlayStation”. These games are either developed by PlayStation Studios or in collaboration with third party studios where Sony paid for and published them, and there by owns the IP. 

Some of the games had permanent exclusivity and others have timed exclusivity. In either case, they remain a Sony IP released for PlayStation first and foremost."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It’s a Sony IP and it sold 10 million copies and got 119 game of the year awards, along with hundreds of others in many categories, and a sequel is coming exclusively to PS5. Of course I gotta include it😏"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,That why xbox is pushing gamepass they win by been your second choice with gamepass. Not everyone want 4 consoles to play games so they pick two or even just one MS will win long term.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"its okay, we have Bloodborne Kart"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Death Stranding is amazing. It’s not for everyone but it’s quite unique in terms of focusing on terrain and traversal being the main challenge.

As for other games, it depends on what genre you like: God of War 2018 and Ragnarök are amazing, Returnal is challenging, in a similar way to Demon’s Souls, Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West are fun open world games with a post apocalyptic sci-fi storyline.

There’s FFXVI coming in June, there’s also Uncharted, all of them are playable on PS4 and 5 so you can get Uncharted Nathan Drake Collection and Legacy of Thieves Collection and you got the whole series so far"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,These are only exclusives for playstation
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It’s an amazing game that I couldn’t in good conscience recommend to anybody.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Then you are in for an amazing journey! Haha
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Its there, 2nd image"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Someone has never heard of PS+
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Eh, I wouldn't say hundreds of high quality games, barley a hundred imo. Playstation also has ps plus, it's top tier being just $2 more than gamepass so not much more than gamepass. Also Xbox is starting to charge $70 for their games too."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Thankfully there are two different options for people to choose what suits them best. For me, I prefer those titles even though they’re expensive. I feel I get my money’s worth from them, and I’m happy that others have an option that suits them better."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"They’re all either first or third party exclusives. Either Sony owns the studio and developed the games in-house or XDev, the Sony studio that is responsible for collaborations with third party studios commissioned them and Sony paid and published them and thereby owning the IP."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"The fact that Horizon Zero Dawn is here and not Forbidden West and God of War Ragnarök is here and not God of War 2018 and The Last of Us is here and not Part II or Part I (the remake) is because I included each IP once and the rest is written beneath the post.

Maybe try to see people outside of the scope of the accusatory lenses."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Sony didnt buy these IPs to make them exclusive like MS is trying to do to
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Lol PSimps downvoting me.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,If UC4 is too long what games do you even play?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"That’s… well , if you get consoles for the UI, you do you."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,So what's a non mainstream console exclusive for an adventurous non boring gamer?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Only 4, please tell"

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"It says the last 10 years, half what you mentioned came out like 13 years ago, also GOT is on there"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Because Death Stranding is the best strand type game
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"How does the 2019 game of the year make the cut, did you really just ask that?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Apart from the fact that most of those games are too old Forspoken is both a bad game and not a Sony game.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Test for Covid because I think you might have lost your taste
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Lol what a terrible take.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"The game that won, 119 game of the year awards, yes. It is there on the list of IPs produced by Sony. What a shocker!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Not allowed to say you don’t like something huh?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"That what some of us want and enjoy, I avoid multiplayer games like the pluage."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Bro said ""Spider-who?"""
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Did you just pull a “Lady who???” On God of War?😝
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Nothing’s stopping them from investing in all the talented studios they bought
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,SkillUp gives a solid review of what Returnal is and what to expect.  It’s a good game.  It’s personally in park for what i I thought Control was in terms of quality of game.  I thought control was a very solid game and just behind Sekiro in GOTY
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I feel like Reddit tends to really sugar coat this game, actually. The gameplay is pretty smooth and fun, but the story is weak and the level and enemy designs aren’t that interesting in my opinion. I’d say it’s a solid 8/10 but I didn’t really think anything about it was mind blowing like a lot of other people seem to."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"It’s a rogue-like, so basically you start the game, you explore and fight, you die and repeat from the beginning and the areas get shuffled, you don’t keep anything but a few upgrades for the randomized weapons you get.

It has amazing action and challenge, beautiful world design and story-wise, it’s ambiguous and mentally twisted, almost like a hybrid between silent hill and Lovecraftian horror in terms of psychological horror"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,It's a third-person action-roguelite
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It’s not a first or third party PlayStation exclusive
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I have put many hours in death stranding, the whole good aspect for f it really depends on the person playing. I found it to tickle my fancy as far as how the traversal is done. Many will say it's bad but haven't got past the 2 hr mark. It doesn't really pick up until a little later and even then it can feel more tedious than it's worth to some people. I enjoy it for the satisfaction and I thought the story was interesting even though it's confusing as hell."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I wish they give us a new one, yes. Perhaps after Ghost of Tsushima 2. I just hope they find a unique way to execute it, because as good as the three games were, there was something missing, not sure what it was, but sometimes it felt repetitive and thematically, it felt like it couldn’t tell whether it wants to be dark and brutal or fun and lighthearted, especially the third game."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It’s an amazing game if you’re willing to try a new type of gameplay. I loved the fact that it made traversal as the main challenge, instead of combat or bosses. It was a different genre of open world.

I guess it depends on what you’re into"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,How can we not love it? It’s amazing!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Replace what?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The only games worth a damn on this list are Bloodborne and Death Stranding. The Nioh games are good too if you're into that sort of thing. Pretty much everything else is bog-standard open world action game or third person shooter
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I’d kill for resistance 1 & 2 remaster
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"R:FOM was lost as a launch title for a console that no one had at the time (PS3). It’s sad, because the multiplayer gunplay was some of the best in the last 20 years imo. Fast paced, moderate TTK, kind of the gap between Apex and COD today. I would kill for an R:FOM remake."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I’d play the shit out of a Resistance remake.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Resistance was fantastic. I don’t understand why they killed that series.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I want a reboot of the Resistance series. Start out as your typical WWII game fighting Nazis, then just alien invasion out of nowhere."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Resistance 2 is in my top 5 favorite games all time. God I miss that game.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,First ever game I played on PS3… brings back some memories
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"DUDE! I have been saying this for years Resistance needs to come back in a big way, the multi player was fun as hell but the Co-op was even better !"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I loved those games so much!!!!!!!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I got my PS3 ata  late time so I never got to play the resistance games, I played a bit of one by a friends house and I enjoyed it. So I would like to get those three games remastered."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Is it too much to ask for both?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,A new bloodborne/remaster would be enough for me to buy a PS5. Bloodborne and demons souls are the only two “souls” games I haven’t played because they’re locked to Sony
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Not my first reaction, but the more I think about it the more I agree. I’d love to see a new game in this series."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Man I would do anything for an infamous 1/2 remaster
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"All we know is that Suckerpunch is not working on an Infamous or Sly title but Sony owns Suckerpunch so they could for example but Bluepoint on that project if they wanted. 

Still as much as I want it I can't deny the prospects don't look great."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"How? I've never heard about that, I wanna read on it."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I wouldn't hate that either but I'm mostly excited on getting a library that moves forward. PS6 will almost certainly have BC for 5 and 4 and BC for 1-3 just seems to not be on the table so remasters for the best titles at high quality is a nice alternative. Infamous 2nd Sun can still be played on the modern gen but I have to dig out my PS3 if I want Infamous 1-2.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Infamous 2 is generally considered the best of the 3 titles too. And Infamous 1 blindsides almost everyone with its superbly excellent ending. They really do deserve an update.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Bloodborne is a masterpiece but that doesn't mean its without flaw. Its glaring especially after Elden Ring. 

The artistic style is fantastic but the actual modeling and resolution are pretty dated and neither is its frame rate good. Even creating a 1-1 replication that simply has higher quality textures, higher resolution, and 60FPS would be an enormous improvement that the title 100% deserves. However I'd argue they should go farther. 

The character creator is genuinely awful. Taking the system used in Demon Souls and implementing it here would massively improve the creation experience for people who want to make good looking characters without taking anything away from anyone. 

Bloodborne lamps act as a 1 way travel point that only goes to the Hunters dream this mechanic could be updated to reflect how the system works in later releases allowing for point to point travel and greatly simplify the tombstone system. 

They could even go so far as to add unique visceral animations for each weapon like they did in Demon Souls and improve the existing animations and effects (like blood splattering) to better reflect modern capabilities while remaining completely faithful to the original. 

There are many of these tiny Quality of Life changes they could make that would make the title really spectacular and they could port it to PC as well though ideally without all the performance and breaking issues recent ports have had. 

The reason why the other titles are off the table is because they aren't owned by Sony. They would require other companies to get involved for a remake/remaster. Not impossible but I think its less likely. Sony seems to be pretty big on remakes."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,i just want it in 60fps on pc
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I’m sorry but as someone who just went thru the souls games it’s very jarring trying to play blood borne at 30fps. 60fps version is the least I want. Yeah ds3 holds beautifully.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"By the end you have all these awesome ghost moves, but I was having way too much fun just walking into an enemy area playing my storm flute and then fighting everyone head on while the storm rages. The combat is perfect. Just a beautifully atmospheric, amazing, fun game."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,If you play on Lethal+ it gets even more intense. Perfect parry or dodge followed by a one hit kill. On the flipside Jin is dead after 3 hits. It's a ride on the razor blade.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Gotta play Sekiro. After Sekiro even hard on Tsushima was just too easy for me
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,They must have upgraded GOT. I quit playing halfway through and went back to Nioh because the combat system there was sooooooooo much more satisfying to me.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Seriously, pretty much every melee combat system I’ve played since GoT has felt clunky as hell in comparison. I could see how Sekiro might be better but it just never fully clicked for me, probably about time to try again lol."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I still don't even fully know why I loved the game so much, I'm generally bored with open world games with tons of repetetive side quests etc. Tsushima still has that pretty generic structure, but still I was compelled to platinum it, which I almost never want to do with a game."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I love the game because it delivered as stated and shown from day 1...
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I hate to be one of those 30% but I found the open world so incredibly boring. It’s stunning once you first see it, but that’s it. Give me Witcher any day over this"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"   
SPOILERS:





>!i killed shimura!<"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"To be fair they don’t care how well it was received by the player base, just how much it was consumed. and it sold like hotcakes. there’s hope!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Honestly I'd buy it again to play on my deck.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"As a very very picky gamer: you're missing out. I sunk well over 100 hours into that game and then they dropped this additional game type which was ACTUALLY A WHOLE NEW GAME! As in, it was a completely additional game type totally unlike the main game. It was legitimately like being gifted a totally free game on top of the game you already purchased. AND IT'S A BLAST. 

The reviews who poo pooed this game should really really be ignored."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I kinda wish I had just concentrated on the main quest instead of going after every little side quest, I quit the game half way due to the repetition. Beautiful game though and the fighting system feels good."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05," I did every village and did every side quest and while the story was good, I got super burnt out right before the end of the game because every village was the same after awhile. IMO it was a great game but I wish I didn’t want to leave no stone unturned. If I were to do it again, I would just do villages that are on the way to my destination instead of all of them"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It very much fits the ubisoft collectable grind set of having 29 different collectibles in addition to ""base"" clearing, etc. The presentation is phenomenal, but there is no denying that the gameplay does get stale after a while. Luckily, the game tries a lot to keep you engaged by giving you so many different ninja tools that you can play 5 different bases with a different playstyle if you wanted."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I felt it was good the whole way. I think people who criticized it for repetitiveness didn’t delve enough into side quests, explore technique points and the combat system, etc. It’s certainly a full game, with a massive map and lots to do. If you’re finding yourself repeating a lot of the same steps in the main story, my advice is to step back and go do something else in the game, as there’s really a lot of opportunities for what to do on your path."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"On the surface, it is a open-world crafting stealty sandboxy game like a lot of others, but it's polished to such a mirror shine you almost don't notice. It's an incredibly beautiful and engaging game, with more heart and soul than most than I've seen in the previous decade. While it *can* get a little repetitive if you play it for long stretches at a time, but Naughty Dog made a very strong effort to make each location feel at least somewhat unique, with little stories peppered here and there to give you ""episodes"" to focus on while you progress through the main story. There's enough to do to keep you interested without feeling overwhelmed. The way I've always described it is Breath of the Wild meets Red Dead Redemption, with a side of Assassin's Creed, and directed by Akira Kurosawa. If you think you'd like that kind of game ***AT ALL***, you owe it to yourself to at least try. Maybe see if a friend has a copy you can borrow so you can try it out?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I say its like a really good burger. Its not really that unique and you can find others doing the same thing everywhere, but what it does do, it does better than most.

I thought it was a good game. Fun, but not the masterpiece I see people touting it as."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Because It has a lighter vibe which kinda kills One of the best points of infamous.

It's mad fun to play and it's still so fucking stunning to look at, but people associate infamous with darker themes i think which made the game feel a bit too lighthearted.

Plus, i think the whole ""different Powers"" is really cool visually but feels a bit flat when you realise that there is Little difference (still mad you don't have a concrete ultimate btw)."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I liked the Infamous series, but I always preferred Prototype over it.

From what I recall, the first game was fun but a lot of stuff was copy/pasted and enemies could hit you off-map - not to mention there were like 500 collectable and if you didn't follow a guide you'd be pinging constantly and it was a real bitch to find. I remember really hating that.

the second game, you lose your powers to the big bad and the story is 'gaining new power to defeat him' but at the end of the game, you...had the same powers? or something lol

Second son I remember less of, so I guess it didn't leave as much of an impact. I cannot remember the story at all but it was fun (and wasn't there a DLC with a purple chick or something?)"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Found Dunkey's reddit account.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Loved gravity rush. Was the main reason I got a Vita.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Still playing on the vita. Love it.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,You definitely should. 2 tries to quickly introduce you but without knowledge of first game it fails. Those are story driven games and second one directly builds on what first did. And they were suppose to be one game in begining but in developement they were split into 2
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Same, except I'm also a little bit interested in TLoU, and I'm not sure we can really say that came to PC."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,If you said to me during the 360 era that this is the best halo will ever be again I’d have probably argued the fact. I’d say the same for gears of war
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,And releasing whatever the fuck redfall is
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,But Redfall... /s
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I'm playing through infinite right now and really enjoying it, but comparing it to Halo 3 is just... sad. I miss classic halo. At least playing Halo 3 online in the master chief collection is still a blast!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,You would think it has to be on purpose at this point. All they had to do was not change anything and it would have remained popular. Publishers and developers for some reason think that change is always good. Why is Counter-Strike the largest eSport title in the world despite not changing 1999?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Everyone's been looking for a ""Halo killer"" for the last 20 years but it turns out the Halo killer was Halo"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Halo's available on pc now too, so arguably their best exclusive isn't exclusive anymore 😅"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"While Halo infinite wasn’t as good as it should be, it was still decent overall. It’s difficult to make a good fps these days.

There’s a reason Sony hasn’t had a single fps exclusive since Killzone Shadow Fall a decade ago (which sucked)"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I think we watched the same youtube video
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"And Sony is about to get Final Fantasy XVI as well. Sony has bangers almost every couple of months.


Edit: lot of people in the responses seem to think that I think SE and Final Fantasy are Playstation or Sony properties so let me be clear; 

I know they're not. SE is not owned by Sony, Sony doesn't own Final Fantasy. XVI however is still an exclusive coming to PS5 in about a month from now. It's a game that Sony is also putting a lot of effort, hell they released a 45 minute State of Play dedicated to this game. If it's not one of their heavy hitters from their own studios they also have massive 3rd party games that are exclusive to their own console and that's a win for them."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Xbox is set to release Starfield this year but I have my skepticism. If it turns out good, it could be one of the biggest games this decade, not even just this year."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Tbh I loved gow 2018 but I was very underwhelmed by ragnarok. I don’t like the direction they’re going with the tone of the series
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I liked Infinite well enough, my gripe is Xbox has all that money and doesn’t use it to create a new original IP that doesn’t flop on release. The cycle right now for Xbox is Old IP for money -> new idea that flops -> old IP for money."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"It depends on what you look for in a game.  Fun gameplay mechanics, Nintendo has that easily, but I would say Sony has the better Stories."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Nintendo makes fun games

Sony makes interactive movies"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,There's a few points where High on Life is legitimately funny but I think I was entertained most by the fact that the developers and Red Letter Media put an entire movie and commentary track in the game that you can sit in a theater and watch with them as they do the commentary Mystery Science Theater 3000 style
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,With all the money and talent they got you’d think there would be some temptation right? All I’m seeing is old IPs and scuffed releases. I have a PC and I’m still more excited for PS drops.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"But multiplayer games don't sell consoles as much. These exclusives aren't trying to just sell themselves  they're trying to sell consoles too. And judging by how many PS5s are being sold, I'd say they're doing a good job at it."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,">That people actually want

No one wanted them to parade around metal gears corpse after they kicked out Kojima"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Fair argument, fair argument. counterpoint.  10 years later and people are still talking about Mass Effect 3's multiplayer.  16 years in people still play Halo 3 over later Halos, despite its broken net code.  

You make a good game and a good multiplayer and people will still love it even a decade later."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Just bugs me that the second GOW is on there but then the first The Last of Us. Kinda inconsistent.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Same! I hated the game because it was so hard that I ended up enjoying how hard and challenging it was lol. The combat is addicting and I eventually beat it lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Once you start unlocking weapon attributes and more consumables, and most importantly game knowledge, it becomes pretty easy. Pylon Driver with Web is basically cheating."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Completely agree. I made it to the first boss, died. Then took another hour to even find the fucking boss again, died. I haven’t played it since. I don’t think roguelike games are for me."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I mean I wouldn't pass out on a story remake for Second Son. It was great and all but it wasn't memorable as the first two, ngl."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Have you been to the Xbox subreddit lately? Nobody hates Xbox more than them lol.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Grounded is a phenomenal game and, I think, was overlooked in the awards run. But it wasn’t a hit, despite being maybe the best survival game I’ve ever played. Hi-Fi Rush is a solid game too. All eyes were on Redfall though and it definitely failed so yeah, they’ve gotta nail Starfield or they’re in big trouble."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I'm curious why you would have both. Old physical xbox library, maybe? I've not touched my Xbox since I got PC."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I like my backwards capabilities.

I can play all my old games.  :]"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"you mean... after you BEAT the whole game?  Or you just got tired of dying in early levels?

How far did you get in the game?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,And it's still somehow amazing.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Just the fact that it can take a game that long to be engaging can really kill a title for some people. I need at least a good piece of cheese by 2 hours in or I'll go find another mousetrap.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Me too, I should probably get one of these PlayStation things."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I replayed it multiple times. Loved the good/bad, different options, endings/cutscenes. It deserves a proper PC release"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,hell yeah brotha
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Also don't forget, Microsoft can't buy Activision because exclusivity is bad, according to Sony."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"If Starfield isn't a well made game, I will for sure be buying a PlayStation."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"PS5 has everything you just mentioned...lol.

Even Microsoft has said they can't compete with Sony and Nintendo."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,At least they're in a playable state on launch day.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Exactly, this echo chamber is getting tiresome."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Ps+ is insane value too. Ps+ premium even more so.

It’s like people forget ps+ exists. I recently cancelled gamepass because i feel like ps+ is enough and i never use my xbox anyways"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,XBL has always been better than PSN.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Go play your redfall and halo infinite on gamepass
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Ps+ exists dude. It’s basically gamepass. It has an insanely good catalogue too

Literally every game listed here besides Ragnarok is free with a ps+ subscription right now"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Redfall is 70 😂😂😂

I used t defend gamepass but lack of exclusives is ridiculous. Might as well junp to the fanstastic PS plus extra and buy the occasional PS exclusive."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Playstation fans when sony releases another character action game with over the shoulder camera and rpg tree levelling system with tall grass stealth and puzzles that wouldn't even exist if the games had a decent jump buttkn 🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,that's for sure but licensing your first party ip to a different platform isn't ideal for your image... could you imagine Nintendo doing the same with Mario?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It's one of my all-time favorite games, thank you for including it.

Looking forward for the sequel and I'm also curious what is Hideo Kojima next game."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Even then, with so many PS exclusives being ported to PC, all you really need is a PC and a switch. That's me for the most part. If only bloodborne would be ported..."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Whoops! Got it, Mate."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The only one I'll be beating is the new god of war tbh. I'm just waiting until it comes to PC. I gave my PS4 away to family because I do not use it.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,PS+ only offers old dated games. Nothing new releases day 1 on it.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Ps plus is good except for the streaming only games, cause the streaming is awful."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,You are the reason we keep getting low effort broken $70 games.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Nioh is a Koei Tecmo game distributed outside Japan for PlayStation by Sony. They don't own the IP. It's exactly like saying Octopath Travelers is a Nintendo game.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I’m sorry, I wasn’t actually trying to accuse. I just noticed that and got a kick because I loved HZD, and was painfully disappointed by HFW. Wasn’t actually trying to cause any drama. If you’d like, I’ll gladly delete my original comment. 

Apologies again!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,They’ve literally signed 10 year contracts saying they wouldn’t and Sony executives have been caught on hot mic saying they don’t really care about exclusive they just don’t want MS to get it
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"All kinda games, what games do you even play?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Return to the Obra Dinn
Outer Wilds
Subnautica"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Infamous Second Son, Bloodborne, Spider-Man, and Death Stranding. ISS and Spider-Man are on thin ice also."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Since when Deathstranding is 2019 game of the year????
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,God damn!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Proof those awards mean absolute nothing.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,This and killzone
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I want more of the zombie town level from Resistance 2. Just more mobs. I went back and played it and definitely remember it being more intense than it was
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I had a PS3 at launch and my roommate and I played so much of that Co-op campaign. Man... now I want to play that again.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"R:FOM is still one of the best shooters I’ve ever played, and had one of the most interesting stories ever in a shooter. Never seen a series drop off so hard. Hell, imo even Resistance 2 was a big step down, and that one is still pretty universally liked."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The PvE Coop multiplayer was amazing Resistance 2
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Based on the responses here, the multiplayer would be packed and AMAZING."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Insomniac got to make Spider-Man. That’s probably what’s stoping anything now.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I'd argue yes. Development teams have finite resources, so it seems to me that to target a release date as soon as possible, it's best to focus on one or the other. Given that choice, I'd prefer something new."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I'd take quick and dirty ports at this point.

Infamous 1 & 2 at 60 fps 1080p for 20 smackers each on ps4/pc and BOOM! Wallets 40$ lighter."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,As much as I absolutely love the Infamous series what they did with Ghost of Tsushima was incredible and if Suckerpunch wants to leave Infamous behind to continue putting out new and interesting bangers I’m all for it. I love the remake era we are living in but I’d hate to see gaming get reduced to just tons of remakes a year with little to no new IPs or even sequels.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Suckerpunch tweeted something a few months ago saying they weren't working on it but weren't closed off to it or a sequel, just not in current works as they were focused on 2 unnamed other projects. No idea how to pull it up but I remember reading it."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Well said friend! BB is hands down my favorite game, but everything you mentioned would be a welcome improvement in my opinion. I personally think 60fps should be priority #1."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"FromSoft made the bonfires in DS2 go from point to point. In DS1, they were more limited with only select bonfires beign available, but its more flexible than BB. 

All lamps going just to The Hunter's dream was a stylistic choice. That's not a mistake. Maybe you don't like it, that's fine, but you're talking as though it was a mistake or that they didn't know better"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It’s crazy you went on this tangent about it’s negatives but don’t bring up the most unanimous problems the game has which is the blood vial farming and the inability to respec. They don’t hurt the game overall but they are very annoying to deal with. I disagree with pretty much everything you said outside of the fps. The game is for sure a masterpiece and still the best game from software has made
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I’m playing it now and this comment hits so hard haha that’s basically how I play
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Yeah, I refused to use the dishonorable stealth tactics or cheap tricks. Just straight sword fighting. Always felt awesome to dispatch a huge group solely through regular combat. Felt like a Kurosawa flick."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,There you get the charm that has a chance to strike lightning… incredible
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-06,"As someone who knows nothing whatsoever about Ghost of Tsushima, that first sentence is about the best recommendation for a game that I've ever read. Sounds insane. If they port it to PC, I'll buy immediately. Currently only have a Switch and a Steam Deck."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,[deleted]
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Cannot recommend Sekiro enough, you should absolutely give it another try. My god, when it does click for you, it is absolutely unreal

I think I’m pretty good at games in general, but I have never gone from being _so bad_ at the beginning of a game to being so good by the end as I have in Sekiro. You can’t really grind your stats to make it easier, you just have to learn the system(s) and it is so rewarding when you start mastering everything

Hope you give it another shot someday 👍🏼"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Because the core gameplay is so damn satisfying - you really feel like the Ghost of Tsushima. I was excited about every Mongo encounter until the end. The fighting mechanics, animations, special skills, enemy telegraphing, etc are all spot on. When you die, you always know what you could’ve done better."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Yeah that's kinda my point haha. It just depends your priorities. I agree that the Witcher has a much more in depth open world, but it doesn't really matter to me because I just don't particularly enjoy the combat and core gameplay loop, and I'm not gonna sink that many hours in to a combat game where I don't enjoy the combat. 

GoT on the other hand has in my opinion the most fun melee combat I've ever played, so I don't mind some boring repetitive stuff in the open world because I literally have fun even just fighting some random patrol of enemies for the seven hundredth time. If that's not really a priority for you though I can totally understand being much less impressed."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,">!Personally I think sparing him is the most in character choice. You’re no longer playing by the samurai rules so letting him live makes sense and is a big fuck you to the samurai. And hopefully some day he comes around to your thinking!<

>!Killing him makes sense out of a mercy type deal since the whole honor and code thing means a lot to him. So there’s really not a wrong choice here.!<"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I also >!killed Shimura and I felt it was the kindest choice for him. At the end of the day he was still Jin's uncle and father figure and he loved him. To Shimura the samurai code was his entire life and he had grown too set in his ways. Killing him in battle kept his honour he so desperately needed. It was a harder choice for Jin personally, but it was a sacrifice I thought was appropriate. Plus also if you don't kill him he just commits seppuku anyway.!<"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"For real, there were so many possibilities for different powers to distinguish themselves, but they just didn't. I was really salty when the game launched but I've kinda come around on it since. It fell short, but Suckerpunch was going through a lot of growing pains as a company, and was expected to put out a launch title for the PS4. inFamous 2 was their first game with a focus on highly cinematic cutscenes, which they got help with from Naughty Dog. Then Second Son comes out and has incredible mocap in both cutscenes and gameplay, two of the biggest voice actors in the industry in leading roles, and a very well realized Seattle to explore. The gameplay suffered a bit, but I think they accomplished what they wanted to as a company, and the results show in Ghost of Tsushima, where the gameplay and presentation are both on point."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,What is it with this year and bad PC ports?  Seems like every major game coming out in the past year has had a terrible PC release.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Hasn't been the same since Gears 3.

Also the sweat really got to people."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Halo and GoW were the only Xbox exclusives I’ve ever really had an overt desire for. I thoroughly enjoyed them in my 360 days and never needed anything else

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"You mean deadfall, the game was DoA (that's dead on announcement for me)."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Almost every Playstation “exclusive” in this list is available on PC now.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Lmao. Yes, it was a solid point that was made"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"FF XVI isn't actually a Sony game though, they don't own Square."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Being a Bethesda game Starfield is likely to get a lot of free passes from critics and players alike even if it's bad.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I play games to play. Both have great exclusives, but Nintendo's focus and general vibe are much closer to what I want out of the hobby. Obviously that's just my opinion."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I gotta be honest I think Nintendo has it all. You look at Mario or Kirby or Splatoon for a fun gameplay mechanics without much story. Then at Fire Emblem or Xenoblade for huge stories, and really complex gameplay mechanics. Then maybe at Zelda as a middle ground with straightforward gameplay in it’s puzzles and combat and a lot of lore. 

I would say that Sony is like…min/maxing it. It’s why they have a companion tell you the answer to the puzzles and the story is roughly a dozen hours. I think they are trying to hit that Goldilocks zone with every game rather than specializing specific games for specific things."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I’m pretty sure even Jim Ryan said he wanted Sony exclusives to be this cinematic blockbuster experience
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"That is why TLOU worked so well as a show, the game was a somewhat interactive movie already so if you just remove what little control the player has you are left with a show."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I feel that MS (or at least this regime of stooges) has adopted the business philosophy of trying to control the market and trends rather than adapt to it. No one wanted online only games….not back in 2013 and not now in 2023. 

It’s like EA telling the community that we no longer wanted single player games. Then they release Fallen Order and it’s a hit. EA wanted to push live service and tell us what we wanted rather than listen to the community and deliver solid games."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"That xbone always online thing was the reason I switched back to playstation after the original xbox and the 360. Haven't owned an xbox in 10 years. I have two ps3s, four ps4s (they are excellent media stations for non-smart TVs) and one ps5 though."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I appreciate that when Xbox does something good, they praise it, when they fuck up, they call it out big time.

Definitely prefer that to the echo chamber seen elsewhere"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"There are literally no xbox fans left in those subs.

It's mostly the the same people that are in this thread.

I go to trueachievments to get xbox news and help with games."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I've considered getting an xbox for MLB the Show. Playing on the cloud on PC is tough with the lag.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"A console is just nice to turn on and go, and it’s hooked to a big screen tv."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Correct I have a big library of old 360 games as well as One and Series X games, plus I like to collect games too. I game on my console mainly and only really have a couple of sim racing games (with mods) on my PC.

Sometimes I can't be bothered to game on PC as strange as that sounds and just game on my console."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Plus, on my PC I can play games that aren't Xbox Exclusive for example Stray, Uncharted, God of War, etc. To me, it completely makes sense to have a PC as well as another console if you can afford it. I also have a Switch but in honesty it only really gets used when I'm travelling which is a rarity."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I have both as well and I think the Xbox ecosystem works great with both! I’m signed in no matter which platform I play on and love to play games on both. PC I can play some of my Xbox games on and gamepass games as well and I can play most of the PS games I want on Steam.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,100% agree with this. I came close to giving up on it and the only reason I didn’t was because it was a Kojima game and thought it’d get better eventually. I’m glad I stuck it out and love the game but understand it’s a big ask and it’s not for everyone.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I think it's relative to the total game length. 

A game like COD is only 6 hours and has maybe 10 mins of intro. 

A game like Death Stranding or MGSV is like 60-100 hours long and can have an 'intro' of 6-10 hours. Death Stranding specifically dedicates it's entire first area to teaching the player everything, and doesn't really even open up until a good 10 hours in for most people. 

Depends on the genre as well. There's a lot of interconnected systems in Kojima games, and they take their time to properly teach them to the player. Also, Japanese games just tend to have very long introductory sequences. Whereas western developers are much more likely to do the whole 'in media res' intro in an attempt to grab the players attention so they don't leave the game they just paid 90$ for in the first 5 mins."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It’s a Bethesda game, it will be extremely buggy and  badly optimized at launch, and become a great game once PC modders get to grip with it, like Skyrim. Personally I’ll buy it on PC, since it will get mods to patch the bugs quicker."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Big fan of extra but premium is not worth it
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Playstation plus sucks. It's not even competing against gamepass value.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I'm surprised you're being downvoted. There's only so many games anyone can play and there's a ton of stuff on + that's awesome. Gamepass is better but + premium also has a lot of value in my opinion.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Yeah but you can use gamepass on PC too, which is actually incredible"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"There was a point when it was free to play PS3 online and Xbox you had to pay to even use Netflix, I'd argue it was tied even then because though Xbox's infrastructure was always better, you had to pay for it."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Exactly, you cannot play anything new with your paid PS+ subscription."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Crazy how it’s still better than 99% of AAA projects nowadays, makes you think"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,That sounds more like Ubisoft games and less like Sony games.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"They didn’t license their IP to others. They collaborated with other studios to create a new IP owned by Sony, such as Death Stranding. It is a Hideo Kojima game paid for and published by Sony, and therefore Sony owns the IP but not the studio.

Now if they hire Ubisoft for example to do another The Last of Us game, that would be a different story, which is the scenario you mentioned."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Literally bought RDR2 yesterday for PC and that shits amazing.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Rich coming from the moron in full defence mode of MS & Redfall. Get outta here clown.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Low effort broken games? Lol. We’re not the ones getting iPad games on “the most powerful console in the world” and trying to buy others’ success to claim it to be our own. Stop projecting.

No dev worth a dime wants to make a AAA game for $1 a month service that barely makes its money back."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Thanks for understanding🙏🏼 No hard feelings
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,That was only for COD. Activision make a lot more than COD. Microsoft have already started making all Zenimax games exclusive and other studios they acquired that had IPs that were on Playstation like Hellblade and The Outer Worlds
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Those are not console exclusives. Every one of those games are available on switch and Xbox.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"So ghosts, horizon, uncharted and God of war aren't good?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"“Because somebody on the internet didn’t like the game, it means anyone who likes it and any institution that honors it is invalid”

Nice logic"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Oh my god yes. That honestly probably has a wider appeal than resistance. The killzone 3 multiplayer was elite
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Honestly I played the entire killzone franchise and I just don’t quite get the draw. 

I’d like to sit down and play it again as I’m approaching my 30’s and see if it hits differently. 
The last time I played it would be killzone 4 back in ‘13 and I just remember it being pseudo crisis/cod/blade runner."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Def Resistance and Killzone. Especially now when they need more mp games. Am I the only one who wishes for Warhawk to return though?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I think the Mass Effect approach is better. Release a remaster/remake to draw in those who missed the original and generate excitement for the new title released a few years later. Its hard to get excited for a title when its a sequel to a game that can't be played unless you have 17 year old hardware.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"They could do the remake to gauge interest in the project/ future projects, if ti does well release a new game using the same engine/ assets to reduce time cut corners for both the remake (i.e. script and story) and a new game."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Sony's been doing a good job at hitting that mark so far, most titles at least have a performance 60 FPS mode."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"So I genuinely forgot about the lack of respec since its not a feature I use anyways. I always plan my character to be perfect before I touch the controller so I never need to respec. But I do agree it would be a good addition to my list as a feature for people who don't want to replay the whole game to make tweaks. 

I disagree about vial farming though. Its part of the games identity the same way grass was to Demon Souls. Its only actually a nuisance if you are playing very poorly consistently and have absolutely zero motivation to look into any method at all of dealing with it."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Inability to respec can easily be addressed, but blood vial farming is just integral to the identity of the game, as annoying as it is. It’s the cost of making a healing item that you can have maxed out inventory from the beginning of the game and can be acquired while exploring, while every Dark Souls and Sekiro have the limited healing between check points."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I must be a fucking weirdo but I kind of like blood vial farming.  I have diagnosed, legit OCD and something about trying to figure out the best places to farm vials, then optimizing a route/method to kill everything along the way.  It’s very satisfying to my weird compulsive lizard brain."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,That seems unlikely to change in a remaster
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"> unanimous problems

You are not using that word correctly."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I think blood vial and qs bullet farming does hurt the game. First thing I do is rush through blood starved beast to do the infinite blood echoes trick and just buy max vials/bullets. Really makes the game so much more enjoyable.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Farming is fine. Lots of games have it. The respec thing seems odd to worry about, the game is short and leveling happens quickly especially with echo farming so making a different character for each build isn’t as big a deal. 

Respeccing would be a cool option to have, but I disagree that it was any sort of major oversight."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ngl nothing beats the satisfaction of an ideal bow shot to the head. Ghosts of Tsushima gave me so much dopamine

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Walk into camp wearing ronin armor dyed bright white. A basket on my head. Wait until the enemy attacks before you even draw your sword. Never offensive, always just using counters. 

That shit was so fucking satisfying."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"On top of the core gameplay being fun, which it is though felt like a slightly jankier sekiro, is the immersion. I was very rarely opening the menu, you can just sorta walk around and find everything. Birds leading you somewhere, the wind guiding you on your actual objective, smoke rising in the distance, a mass of fireflies, the arch ways to shrines, everything you found you could do so with the environment. 

Plus the little touches made the game for me, after a mission Jin is catching a quick nap on his horse. The haiku and hot springs were also neat and immersive ways to add exposition, bamboo strike was just good fun."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Fair comment! I completed it, but I was totally confused by people saying it was the best game ever and the open world was fantastic. The combat was definitely fun"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,">!I agree completely, and I knew killing him kind of went against what Jin was doing, but at that point i was so fucking done with Shimura because he was willing and ready to kill his nephew because another dude told him to. I know their code is sacred, but the fact that he stayed so loyal to it was just maddening to me, and I was anticipating killing him ever since he imprisoned Jin.!<"

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I had a 360 then got the one x now the series x. I’m a casual gamer but honestly I have ended up buying a old PS4 as the games are just so much better on PS. I’m sure Gears have got a new company right? Post GoW3 it’s a bit meh. Xbox really need to do something as they’ve lost/losing casual gamers like me and honestly my series x is just a glorified blu ray player
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Exactly, never got into forza personally and let’s be Honest halo infinite and gears 5 weren’t even worth the gamepass subscription fee I paid to play them"

Both of those are narratives told in a very Eastern/anime style, which isn't appealing to everyone.

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"God no. Uncharted might be one of the worst game series around, Horizon feels like a game that was generated using a ""make a AAA video game"" template while filling in the blanks, Ghost is a game where the gameplay does nothing special and the story is at war with it, and GoW is the most tryhard ""we want to impress the cinema snobs but also fill our game with half-baked RPG mechanics"" shit I've ever seen."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Think you mean everybody. Your logic is you like it so it was good, but the game got so many negative reviews as it was a hot garbage walking simulator. Get your head out of your biased ass…"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Resistance 2 multiplayer was amazing.  My friend and I use to play online split screen with up to 64 players I believe it was.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Killzone gets looked at through the strongest rose colored lenses of all time. It was a good FPS that lived smack dab in the era of peak FPSs.  It was a good game. We need to appreciate that some games can just be good and still have value. Not every game needs to be the best of all time to be memorable, or needs to be remade. Should call a spade a spade, but it tends to be over glorified."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Killzone 2's multiplayer was FPS sex incarnate. It was perfectly balanced, as all things should be. Plus the weapons felt and sounded amazing, the atmosphere was stunning and bleak, and the visuals were super advanced. 

If Killzone 3 hadn't gone more arcade with the gameplay and instead doubled down and said more of everything, it would have been my favorite game of all time no doubt, and i've always been an RPG's first kind of guy."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Holy shit nostalgia bomb at 2am Warhawk was dope, while I think resistance could be a rebooted IP I’d love another Warhawk game, thanks for the memories"

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,">	Also visually speaking, Nintendo is obviously lacking big time.

Both Metroid titles released on Switch are really, really good looking games. Obviously they don’t compare to recent AAA PlayStation releases. But what they accomplish on such gimped hardware is incredibly impressive. Metroid Prime Remaster in particular looks like way more than the Siwtch should be capable of and runs at a perfect 60 fps."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I'd agree, if not for the Draupnir Spear. That extra moveset pushes it ahead for me, possibly the sickest weapon I've used in any game."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Totally agree, would get a PC but I may be naive about it but they seem expensive ? I play very casually and the PS4 seems to be doing to job so far. Yup Xbox’s release have been shite, never particularly liked Halo either, last purchase was F1 but again that’s not an exclusive either. Only stuck with Xbox as I’ve purchased games digitally in the past"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-06,"I'm not saying Nintendo games *can't* look good. Art direction and visual style go a long ways.

They'll just never look as good as games on modern hardware."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Really unique as well. I had a feeling they’d add a new weapon, but I didn’t know how they’d differentiate from the blades and axe. I was thinking Kratos would get Mjolnir but that would be too similar to the leviathan axe, the only difference being it’d be lightning instead of frost as the elemental damage. The spear is its own thing, the fact it infinitely copies itself is genius and gives the player way more choice."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I feel this deeply. I was hesitant to use it at first because I love the BoC and Leviathan Axe so much. I'm glad I leaned into it after a but. So much fun to use.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I love the gameplay of Rag but the story of the 2018 GoW is so much more enjoyable for me. The sequel feels like it was too long and yet too short at the same time. Not sure how to explain it properly but that’s how I feel.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"The villain in Ragnarok puts it over the top for me. Until this thread I thought most people liked Ragnarok more. It's interesting to see. To each their own, both games rule."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The enemy launching mechanic the spear has is both super awesome and hilarious. I genuinely use all 3 weapons almost equally. That's not a small feat for a game to accomplish.

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Sony is not suing anyone nor have they bought any popular franchises. And MS owning COD means they can use against their rivals as they like to do.

Sony already has a larger market share than MS in gaming and none of them are close to Nintendo. The fact that you fail to see the hypocrisy of Sony being an active participant in the case while have more exclusives than anyone aside from Nintendo is downright flabbergasting.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It would only be hypocritical if Sony was buying large publishers which they arent.

Again MS already owns more studios than Sony. MS should not be able to buy everyone because they are incompetent at making games"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,There's some extreme bangers in the play queue. OP is in for a wild ride.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"What I’m about to share is not bragging. It’s more like a confession.

My game spreadsheet catalogs my collection of roughly 6,000 games. It includes each game’s title (original and “released as”), platform, launcher, original year of release, developer, IGDB’s critical rating, genre, visual perspective, theme, play mode (single player, co-op, etc), my personal achievements (high score, completion, etc) and the date I achieved it.

Making it, I learned a lot about spreadsheets and video games. I think in the end the most important lessons I learned were about myself."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,YEAHHHH OUTER WILDS
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"For your interest, Horizon Forbidden West is coming to PC in February 2024 ;)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Just bought outer wilds.... Heard it's amazing and to go in blind
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Play Kotor 2! (though 1 would be higher on my ratings lol)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Love seeing Outer Wilds with a perfect score, hard agree.

Highly recommend:

-bumping Prey up your play queue. It’s an absolute banger, and if you enjoyed SOMA’s philosophical elements, you’ll dig Prey a lot.

-Putting The Forgotten City on the queue instead of “eventually.” It’s pretty short and sweet and definitely scratched that Outer Wilds itch for me.

-Drop Subnautica Below Zero or put it wayyyy back in the backlog. It was okay but fell way short of the original’s charm."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Anyone else satisfied that Outer Wilds is 3rd place and Outer Worlds is 3rd from the bottom? Just makes the list look nice and symmetrical.

Im always curious as to why its so disproportionatly loved on reddit as a 10/10 yet ive never actually met anyone who thinks that in person.

I personally have it average rated as a 7.2 

since

4 in gameplay

7 in story telling/pacing

7 in art direction and world design

8 in sound and music

Flex slot 10 in graphical fidelity"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I would for sure add bioshock 2 to the list of games to play. You can get the trilogy remastered somewhat cheap now and that’s my favorite games of all time so I recommend hopping to that. Also I’d play last of us sooner rather then later unless you watched the series. My only addition to your list (which is amazing!) is the borderlands games. Not so much one because it’s a bit dated and hard to get into but those games are a recipe for fun.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,If Titanfall 2 won't make it into Favorites I will be very disappointed...
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,i recommend adding sekiro to ur future games

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I would move Baldur’s Gate 3 up your queue. I would also insist you try Witcher 3.

The villain in 3 is great and it's well regarded but I honestly enjoyed the other two a lot more, and new dawn is much more manageable in terms of area size!"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Our ratings would be very similar... some notes:

Fallout 3 should be a priority... the lore of Fallout is soooo good.

Seems you like sims as well... so I'd suggest the Tropico series, Cities: Skylines, Civilization series, Surviving Mars, and Planetbase."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Why though
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I’ve done a similar sheet before. Just a quick heads up:

If you want more “objective” rankings per se, then you should probably divide games into categories and rate each category accordingly. That way, you’ll get a more complete picture of your favorite game.

Your rating inflation is too high. On a 1-10 scale, if you’re using the same scale that game reviewers use, then 7.5ish should be the average."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I do the same but a bit different. Mine is all games in one list and then there's a big pie chart with 4 categories: completed, ongoing, not started and unlimited (games that basically don't have an ending like racing, mmo or fighting games). By every game there is a completed date. It's too late now, but i wish i put a started date too so i know how long it took me to complete some games. The list is almost 400 titles now and my goal is to have every single one on ""completed"" by the end of my life. The reason why i started this list is bcs i replayed some games on and on and got bored with gaming. By having this thing, i played through titles that i knew for years but never touched them. There's just something in that green ""completed"" that makes you want to discover what's next."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I DO THIS TOO!!!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,What's SOMA?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Love the list! But if I may make a small suggestion?  

Do resident evil 2 before 4. Not for story progression or anything, but man oh man it’ll whet your appetite for 4 like you wouldn’t believe"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Gotta put part 2 alongside the last of us
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"... if you're ranking games out of 10 but using decimal points as well, why not just rank them out of 100?

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I used to keep a spreadsheet similar to this, then I found out about Playnite. You can import your Steam, Xbox, Switch, and PS games or any custom games and categorize them the same way (i.e., completed, score, not yet completed, want to play). Not 100% sure how you would handle the play queue but I guess you could make that a custom field called “Play Queue” and then rank each game (e.g., 10 for Cyberpunk, 9 for Inside, etc.)

It’s nice because it gives you a visual library since it downloads covers and artwork and also allows you to filter and sort easily. One of my favorite features if I don’t know what I want to play is to click “random game” which essentially picks a random game from your library (you can exclude games you’ve beaten or already played).

Send me a message if you have any questions about Playnite. It took me about a day to set up and I totally abandoned my spreadsheet."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Agree with most of those scores but Bioshock at 8.4 is highly suspect. You likely didn't play the title when it first released so I'll let it slide ;)

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"It makes me feel so out of touch when I see people with lists of game they've played and it has a ton of different games in it, because I feel like NOTHING gets me excited nowadays.

Last two games I got hyped for were Persona 5 Royal back in October 2022 (and that wasn't even a new game) and Payday 3, which came out recently (but suffers from a lack of update a month after its release).

I envy people who can play very different genres of game and still have fun."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Insomniac spider man all 3 for ps5 on the playlist pls
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Nice
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Since it’s Halloween, I’d suggest bumping up alien isolation. I’m not a huge horror type game fan, but they absolutely nailed the Alien universe source material. It’s beautiful still, and the alien AI is really interesting and well thought out."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Your personal feedback on each is overly appreciated by me!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Courious how would you rate the last of us part 1 and 2
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Glad you appreciate Soma, truly one of the best stories told in a game as well as a super immersive setting, the interaction with the world is great too and increases this believability."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Theif
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Is this just for this year? If so that’s some honest work and a great to play selection, so much variety"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I can't even bother to play games as much lol.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,No Spider-Man?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Definitely don’t skip then 2018 God of War. The story builds off that foundation and I think it’s arguably the better game in a lot of ways
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"If you played sandbox style flash games when you were young, Rimworld might be the perfect game for you."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"You would love this site called Backloggd, it’s all about logging the games you play and reviewing them. It’s basically Letterboxd for games if you know what that is."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Who or what is Theif 2&3 ?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Soma!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Outer Wilds up there with the best ranking. Good. I'll roast a marshmallow for you friend.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Play if i get a playstation list is so real hahaha
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,RemindMe! 1 month
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I'm just glad Disco Elysium is there
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,can i get a copy for the template?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I'm not seeing Stray on there...
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,There is a really good app of tracking games you played called GG would recommend!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"You should try using backloggd. It can help you track how long it took to beat the game. https://www.backloggd.com/u/LatoDeszcz/ that’s my account as an example, I mainly use it to store my wish list and backlog"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Damn! Jedi Survivor being rated higher than Fallen Order is just blasphemy.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Stray, hm?"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"If you’re jumping on the fromsoft train, add armored code 6 to your list 😎"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I don't trust anyone rating a cat simulator at anything less than 10.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I like it.
Personally I upload my ""reviews"" in [backlogged](https://www.backloggd.com/) it's like letterboxd but for games."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"So many good ones coming up, like Titanfall 2, BG3, and, when you get it, BioShock Infinite

Might I recommend Nier Replicant and Automata? My top two favorite games of all time (Automata *then* Replicant). And if you’re potentially interested in turn based games, I would recommend the Persona series.

All in all though, a great list. People often forget that even 7s are still above average and I think that’s why some are even a bit upset with the list."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,You are my favorite kind of person
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Bro, please play breath of the wild!! I got similar tastes and it is my favourite"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I’m slightly out raged by fallout NV being lower than fallout 4
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Highly recommend adding Metroid Prime Remastered (or Primehack on PC/ Steamdeck), Shadow of the Colossus, and Demon's Souls

Edit: also glad to see you're planning on playing the old thief games - absolute classics 👌"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I didn’t expect to see ME Andromeda in there.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Put GTA V story on the list to play
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Nice list for sure. Not sure if you want recommendations but Witcher 3 is probably up your alley.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Real Q.  

What metric do you use to rate your games?

Looking at Andromeda with a 7.1, I played it on release and then after several patches and can see maybe a 6.0 

I barely rate on a 1 to 5 scale.

Same style games ish.  

Metroid Dread.  1/5.  Hated the levels and the 1 shot robot zones. The stupid counter mechanic that doesn't work on said robots. (It's randomly timed, yea..)

Hollow Knight 5/5 atmosphere, maneuverability, and customization.   I'd give it 6/5 just for the extra splat noises. 7/5 if Dung Defender showed up throughout the game and yelled NUMA NUMA NUMA at you."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Hades is going to fuck up top of your chart
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Just a recommendation since you have PlayStation on your list if you do get one, I’d honestly add the entire Metal Gear Solid series to your list of games. The story alone is worth it. 

The legend of Zelda franchise across various games would also be a worthy addition to your spread sheet."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I can not get 1 soul to try and play Outer Wilds.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Please play titanfall 2
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Play dark souls.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Dude this is a super awesome idea, I’m gonna follow suit."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I have one for my movies, tv, and video games played. 

And more, to be honest."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Dang, no GTA?"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,go buy a playstation for ghost of tsuhima . you gonna love it
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,No GTA?????
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I also keep a spreadsheet on my gaming. But I’m mostly just keeping track of what games I’ve completed from what system. I’ve gotten into retro gaming in the last couple of years, so it’s fun to watch the list grow. 

I don’t personally like generating numbers to describe how I feel about a game, but I do also keep lists in my Notes app of the games I’ve completed (by system) ranked based on personal preference (rather than ranking on a stricter “critical” review system).

It’s fun to organize."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"You and I have similar tastes, id move God of War 2018 up your list to play."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Do you have anything for games you don’t like? Or are you good enough at picking them that it doesn’t happen much?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,i’m gonna do this
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,GO AND PLAY DOOM RIGHT NOW
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Phantom Liberty gonna pop cyberpunk a tier up
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Theif 2 & 3 lol. But seriously some great games are coming up for you. Enjoy!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I do this too, but my list is just what I played, and what I completed, broken into weeks and months. It’s help me to focus and keep track, without hopping around not finishing anything. I also mark the year the game came out, and as I’ve been going through my backlog from the last 5 years, I’ve only played 3 games from 2023, and played about 40 in total so far."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Get Middle earth: Shadow of Mordor // Shadow of War on there. I think that you'll enjoy them both
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Oh nice, glad to know I'm not the only one who does this. Good way to keep things organized and remember what I have available."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,SOMA and Outer Wilds? Immaculate taste
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You have to play ghost of Tsushima. One of the greatest experiences I have ever had. If you love samurai’s you would enjoy it. The combat is near perfect. Only complaint is which there was more beheadings
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"7.5 on papers please

Despite making this whole spreadsheet op clearly doesn't like paperwork"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Man if only I understood wtf to do in Outer Wilds
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,some dedication right there son
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I keep a list of games that I’ve completed with their difficulty and my hours to complete. Very helpful for wading through a backlog.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,What I am getting from your spreadsheet is KOTOR2 is next on your list to play.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Damn and mine has almost 900 games on it
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You are missing out on Sekiro shadow die twice.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I think you should play game franchises back to back. I guess though it depends cause sometimes the games are too similar, but thats what I like to do."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"As someone who also keeps a google doc to track, rank and review all the games I finish, I have never felt so seen by a stranger on the internet."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"SOMA was a 9.8!?!?

The story was pretty peak tbf, but the ""gameplay"" was kinda garbo.

Except that one puzzle where they spell out to you how the consciousness copying works if you haven't wrapped your head around it yet"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Would recommend putting in life is strange(1, before the storm, true colors)  in the might play section. Those games aren't everyone's cup of tea but they have great stories and characters that can maybe be relatable to you. I don't see spiderman in there either, they are fun games if you like spiderman. The Batman games are must play, people hate on Batman Arkham origins but I'd recommend you play it and Arkham knight. God of war 2018 is brilliant. I love seeing lists like these of people who play games just to enjoy them and maybe walk away with something if not at the very least a good time."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Man people really love Outer Wilds don’t they?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,METAL GEAR SOLID V STILL A MUST PLAY TO THIS DAY
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,i am very saddened to see that the metal gear franchise is no where to be seen not even on the pkaystation list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,For your own sake move baldurs gate up in the q. I haven’t been invested in a game like that since Skyrim came out.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I also got a Notion with all my gaming records. I write basically everything, the developer, director, release and beat that, plataform so on so forth. Nerd af"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I can really recommend Playnite! It has this feature built-in
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"You've got some awesome games in your queue. I actually just recently played Prey and it holds up incredibly well for a 7yr old game, you're in for a real treat!

You'll be really into recycling after you play it 😉"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Can we be best friends?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I find similar ones likeable. You got to prioritize BOTW trust me
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Dead Space remake belongs in there
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Seeing subnautica brings a huge smile to my face, that game is just so amazing for me"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I’m currently in the works of a program that allows you to run and organize spreadsheets based on given lists of games using data from HLTB (howlongtobeat.com)

Would you (and others) be interested if i clean it up a bit and allow others to run it? It makes excelsheets and has color coded stuff. I can provide screenshots if interested"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Man, surprised you haven't played Mankind Divided now. It's not too dated but still. Amazing game imo even though some didn't care for it."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Add Tears of the Kingdom and Add spiderman 1 and 2 to the PlayStation list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Do you use Howlongtobeat.com? I feel like it works well for this too. I don't even really bother with inputting the completion times, I just use it to keep track of games I played and the make notes about what I liked."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Cool list! I will definitely be checking out your top 3 at some point. Currently thoroughly enjoying my first time through Hollow Knight --> masterpiece IMO along with Elden Ring. There is such an absurd number of extremely great games now, it's hard to keep track, let alone try to play them all. This is a handy way to keep it organized - might do something similar myself."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Shadow of the colossas
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I wish they'd release Ghost of Tsushima for PC already. It's a sin not to have played it. Ranks up there with RDR2 for me.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I love this!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Nice! Only thing I would add to that list would be Ff7 remake.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Fallout 4 higher than New Vegas? why??? what did you do wrong?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Wanna watch my kids and wife for a few weeks? I have a backlog larger than your played games list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Based on how you've enjoyed the games in that list, the two Ori games will likely break into your top 20."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"This is cool, I did something similar until I found out about backloggd. You should look into the website, it does have free statistics, ratings, etc."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,It just hurts seeing the last of us in the eventuall category
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"You are a nut job lol

Post again after you beat Titanfall 2's campaign! I wanna see where it places. I NEVER finish sp games, but I beat that game 3x."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I’m glad to see you’ve got Prey in the queue, it’s one of my favourite games of all time!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Good, you have Dishonored and Prey in the queue"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Can you elaborate on why Stray is in your top 10? Out of curiosity.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Putting new Vegas that low should be a crime.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Good post, i just finished Forbidden West, you'll love it"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"No Dishonored or GTA V? Elden Ring is a favorite, but no Dark Souls?"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You rate games very high
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I didn't especially like subnautica below zero. It's a bit dry. (in a non-literal sense)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'm glad you ranked SOMA so high.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Cyberpunk may end up top 5 for you if you’ve never played it. Surely is for me now.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"It's cool to see To the Moon on someone's list.  As an autistic man, that game hit HARD.  It left me sobbing."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Feel like if you want to play AW2 you should play control first as you can probably get it much cheaper and it still holds up very well in terms of visuals and gameplay
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"If you liked cyberpunk before phantom liberty and patch 2.0, youll be blown away by whats new. Its now a great game"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Don't forget ""The last guardian"" for Playstation 

Highly recommend 

You will cry"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Wow, now thats a spreadsheet! I simply have my backlog on an excel sheet and use a RAND formula to pick out my next game to play."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Definitely add Detroit: Become Human and Heavy Rain to your if I get a Playstation list

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"As an avid gamer I am begging you to play witcher 3 next, as someone who likes story games i can guarantee you it will be in your top 3"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Yeah kinda strange how Uncharted 4 and the side game is on PC but the earlier games arent yet. I guess they will bring it out to PC eventually?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Imma steal this list and make them all my play later games. (Atleast the ones I haven’t play)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Weird rankings.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Brother played and loved Elden Ring but doesn't even  have Dark Souls on his to play list. Am disappointed.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"As someone with OCD, I can strongly relate to this. I only stopped because I realized it was making an impact on the entertainment part of gaming for me."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I too have an elaborate spreadsheet of my games, no rankings yet (I started but haven’t gotten far) but I have time played, achievements etc"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Give Dragons Dogma Dark Arisen a go. Ensure you get past the ox cart mission and the game really opens up. The combat is so good. Every class is fun, different, and can be swapped between without having to restart a character."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'm very excited for you to play Titanfall.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Play GoW 2018 NOW
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,SOMA ❤️
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Some excellent games and you've got some truly great titles in your play queue.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Now what game have you beat and was the least enjoyable
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Fallout 4 over new vegas is a crime punishable by death 💀
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"RDR2 at the top, right where it should be. It’s my favorite game of all time."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Soma that good, huh?  I bought it ages ago. Not sure if I ever even booted it up. Forgot about it. Guess I should give it a go."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Can I suggest Fallout New Vegas- Still the best Bethesda style RPG IMO

( its Obsidian I know but still)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,i before e except after c my thief
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Same, mine is more detailed including a short description of what I was up to at the time. I also keep a list like this for people."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You haven't played Arkham asylum or city yet?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,What is Soma? It's like 80% off right now on Steam...
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Add the The Last of Us games to the PlayStation list
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"mass effect 3 a 9.9/10?

I can think of any game that has been a bigger let down before"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Whenever you are done playing inside and adding it to your favorites, please play cocoon from the same developer as well."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Star wars Jedi Knight series is fun
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I love that SOMA has such a high score, it's such a hidden gem! I never play horror games, but the story kept me pushing through until the end. That final scene with Simon and Catherine on the launch pad was so brutal. Even knowing that Simon was wrong about the coin toss, a little part of me was still hoping he was going to magically appear on the Ark and not his copy."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Spreadsheets are so fun! 

I have one to keep track of my Xbox backlog and it's so fun inputting new games and marking completed ones"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I think ur list makes me realize I've played to many games.  I've completed at least 300 RPG or action RPG games in my life.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Hollow Knight being so high tells me Celeste would be a good game to add to the eventually queue! It’s one I recommend to anyone that will listen lol
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"PLAY SEKIRO.

DO IT."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"This is fantastic! I'm going to make one, too! Will share when I'm done."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"The ranking is absolutely dogshit, but kudos for doing something like this!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"My man, you will love witcher 3, put that in the queue RIGHT NOW YOUNG MAN!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'm not sure how good is the latest release( master collection vol 1) but I noticed you didn't have any Metal Gear Solid games! Are they not available on PC?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"KoToR 2 has a 1 to 1 port for 10 bucks on iOS, if you got an iPad it’s pretty decent. If you follow some YouTube tutorials you can get the restored content mod."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Your top 6 gonna change entirely when you complete that play queue. Please please please play Bloodborne with DLCs. That's the only PS exclusive you would not want to miss.

Also, what are those asterisks for in the play eventually column?"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Can I have a copy of this so i can make my own
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,U have not played Hogwarts legacy ?!! Also lies of fear a horror game
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You’re going to love Titanfall 2
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Dude Prey, Prey: Mooncrash and Dishonored and especially Dishonored 2. Get on those my God."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"DBH is one of those games you either love or hate, no in-between, I'm happy to be in the first group lol"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Outer Wilds 10/10 my man
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Titanfall 2 is $4.50 on steam right now (as of 10/30/23)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I too keep my backlog in Excel! I color code it based on platform and sort it by series and how long it takes to complete
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"A lot of games on your playlist is also on mine. I played Halo CE from HALO MCC and it was a blast, I highly recommend."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Please play dying light 1
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,This is dope
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Alyx was an amazing gaming experience. I don't think I will get to play anything like it. Good job on the list. I have one similar on Steam.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Move god of war up in your play queue, I believe both of them are now on PC, too. I promise you will love it based on your tastes."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Man still has deus ex on his list , fuckin legend , but take prey off the list it is garbage"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I was about to suggest adding Prey to your list, but I'm glad to see its in there already (assuming its the 2016 Prey). Prey has by far the best level design I've ever seen in any game. the entire game world makes sense from a story and gameplay standpoint. The space station feels lived in, like an actual place that could exist and be run by people and function. And just like real life, there usually isn't just one way to get to somewhere you want to be, and the game gives you tools to bypass locked areas using a bit of thinking and experimenting. 

There's one section where you go into the lab that runs and repairs the 3d screens around the station, and the devs of the game made a 3D color grid test that 100 percent makes sense. Its like the color bar tests used on real life monitors, just pushed into the 3rd dimension. Its a small detail but to me it showcased the amount of effort put into to making a believable environment."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I don't keep Excel I just use google notes on my phone. It's helpful
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Oh Im so excited to see how you feel about The Last of Us 1 and 2! Amazing list by the way!! 🥹
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"If you get a PlayStation, try Death Stranding! :)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Wow that's a massive list 🤩
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Saw Breath of the Wild in the play eventually list. I highly recommend you play it AND play it blind. Don’t look up stuff. I miss the magic I felt when I played the game blind my first run through
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31, Metal Gear Soild V: The Phantom Pain
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"You’ve got some amazing games in your queue, my personal favourite is definitely Titanfall 2, amazing campaign"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Dude i recommend a good app named Stash to track your finished/still in play games
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Please play Chrono Trigger soon, you won't regret it.  

Also, not on your list but Undertale and Night In The Woods are two of my favorite games from the last 10 years.  Just be sure to go in blind to Undertale!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Thats a really solid list, its also nice to see that people are able to use 7/10 in a manner befitting of it, i see too many people whining around when a game they like is a 7, dude, 7 is pretty solid."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"You might wanna put both Spiderman games in the PS section, cuz they are absolutely amazing"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"SOMA is really good, just finished recently. I recommend everyone who loves horror genre."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"This is a well-kept list, friend! Just a suggestion-- if you enjoyed *Return of the Obra Dinn* and *What Remains of Edith Finch*, add *Everybody's Gone to the Rapture* to your future pile. Think you'd enjoy it quite a bit."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Man I’d love to experience playing Halo again for the first time
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Is the Outer Wilds really *that* good?

I may have to pick it up finally."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I love that there is nothing below 'good'.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'd move up Origins and Chrono Trigger.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Add Ghost Recon Wildlands
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Glad to see Soma on your list.

&#x200B;

Soma is an experience I'll never forget.

&#x200B;

Every time it goes on sale on steam for less than five bucks I nab it for a random person on my friends list. Like some sort of Soma Santa."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Kotor 2 isn't worth it. Boom. Just saved you 30 hours
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Big up 😃
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Put Halo: MCC on the list! 💪
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I gotta say that shit looks beautiful and I wish I can do that for myself and not keep every game I played on a google keep document.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I like that the original Deus Ex is on your list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I thought andromeda top 10 at least
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Just use the stash app, it has the best UI out of all of the logging apps and you can open your and others profile on a pc"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Yours ""play if I get a playstations"" is the same as mine lol. Luckily Ghost of tsushima and Horizon are rumored to come on PC as of 2024! 

And if I may, I would push up Sekiro (my all time favourite) up a queue."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Phantom Liberty is much better than the original BTW

And I enjoyed CP2077 from the start."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,This guy rates games like IGN
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"The fact that fallout 3 isnt on here is a crime in itself 

Go play it man !"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You should hrs on as well
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Judging by the favourites you are going to enjoy God of War. I would also recommend to play it at least some time with the high difficulty as it is making you to use all in game mechanics, which is great"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Woah, there are some real gems in that queue! Pls also add A Plague Tale series and thank me later"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Don't wait too long on titanfall 2 before the playerbase dwindles again
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Outer Wilds, yeah! Very nice list! Give Deus Ex Mankind Divided a chance. The gameplay and the hub level are very very good. IMO"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Hey, I do too! I make a menu with a 3X3 grid: Fast Track, Laid Back, and Clear Mind, with the categories of play, Desk, Couch, and Portable. Then I have a list of everything else that'll join that selection."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I do the same, I keep track of my finished games with a rating and date finished, all my 100% games, my top 10 and a play eventually list xD:

I did that to reduce my pile of shame of games that I never finished."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Bioshock Infinite should be on the top of your list
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Baulders
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Cyberpunk being above Half-Life 2 hurts me
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Your top 3 are also my top 3. Outer Wilds is so overlooked
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Where darksouls
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Thimbleweed Park, It will change your life. After that, Monkey Island 1, 2 and 3. After those, the one on your list, Grim Fandango"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Since you're going for older games too, try Crysis (1, warhammer, 2, 3)"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"RDR2 at the top, based list👍"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Where Gothic 2😦😦😦
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Love seeing Far Cry 3 in there. Great story with cool gameplay and deep characters.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I just use notion for everything :D
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You haven’t rated any games below a 7.3?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"To The Moon! 🌕😭

Games worth playing:

+Black Mesa (Half Life 1 remake)

+Titan Fall 1 & 2

+Space Pirates & Zombies 1 & 2

+Darkest Dungeon 1 & 2 (I have not played the 2nd game yet)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,outer wilds is 10/10? Hmmm might need to get into that then.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I take screenshots, I'll be amazed when i will be older."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I thought I was the only one. Nice catalogue! Mine's ordered by platform(Steam, Epic, Switch, etc). Helped me beat the ""ugghhh what do I play I have too many gaaames"" problem."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Should I try Stray again? Played maybe 2 hours and wasn’t gripped at all but a 9.6 is hella high praise
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Should I clear some of my backlog? Nah I'll just procrastinate and make a lovely spreadsheet
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Great list! You're gonna have a lot of fun.

I have a question though, what constitutes that 0.1 0.2 score differences for you? Cause' I just tend to rank games with a rounded number, the decimals feel like more of a helper for me to rank the games rather than actual scores."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I recommend playing days gone! Its a open world zombie survival game.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Yeah portal 1 - 34
Stray-10 not cool"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,This chart is epic! Now I know where to keep my list of games instead of having a whole opera island with like 50 cards. Thanks!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I'd recommend the devil may cry series (besides the 2nd game) honestly most fun i had and being one of my all time favourites. Would start off with dmc3 since that has the best written story and being chronologically the first game in the series, dmc5 has great combat and a great storyline as well but nowhere near dmc3 lvl of storytelling. Overall still an amazing series and a great experience.

(If not, I'd also recommend the gears of war series)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Soma was such a good game that I feel like wasn't spoken about much. The gameplay was kinda meh but the narrative and perspectives were done so nicely.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Just as a recommendation, I'd check out Obsidian. It's a powerful note taking app that can let you build a database out of things like this. I'll attach a video of someone doing something similar with movies.

https://youtu.be/t-hKCgGhQuk?si=rdScW0BxcNNo080a

Is it a little more complicated? For sure, but you can do a lot with it in addition to your ratings"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,bro just play fortnite
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'm glad to see Outer Wilds waaaaay up this list
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I keep a list like this but for what I paid for games. I stopped filling it after a while as you really can't put a price on enjoyment
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"broo Phantom Liberty is must play, especially when you considered the base game a 9.7"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Play the last of us on PS, not on PC."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"You can move Horizon Forbidden West to the PC list, its coming out on PC somewhere at the start of 2024. It has a steam page already."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I just make categories in my steam library lol
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Baulders Gate 3 🤔
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Move BG3 to the top of your list right now
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Looking at your favorites I would DEFINITELY add Inscryption to that list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Gotta do the witcher 3 mate!!!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Where Baldurs Gate 3

We share taste generally, you gave amazing taste OP"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I guess we all have a list of some kind some it’s a spreadsheet some it’s only a top 5 in their head I am at where I have a top 130 of my all time favorite games lol.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Thanks for the idea, and I see that you're a person of culture as well (shout out to Mass Effect!)."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Halo is definitely top 5
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I'd move Deus Ex: Mankind Divided into that queue, it really is a fantastic game.  Looks like you love world building, environmental storytelling, and smooth gameplay and DXMD has all of that and then some.

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'd honestly recommend Far Cry 4 instead of Far Cry 3. They play pretty much identical except I hated every character in Far Cry 3 lol
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I keep a notion database with tags and stats lol. I find it interesting to see on which platform I pay the most games, the percentage of games I finish, etc..."

If I'm looking for a new game and there's one I'm interested in at the moment, I'll go with it. I find it much better than to stress over ""Oh that looks good but I already have so many games to play, should I add it ? Should I remove others ?"" and other thoughts of that kind."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Play Alien Isolation. Believe me it‘s one of the best horror story games ever created. Especially if you like the Alien universe.

Thank me later🙏"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Is there a rubric for how you rate these games, or just spitballing?

I have over 600 games on steam alone, I finished it twice on playstation, and twice again on PC. My favourites/top liked list is pretty close to yours, lots of great games there!

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Far Cry 3 is awesome. From all Far Cry games I’ve played (3, 5, New Dawn, 6), it’s the one that feels the closest to what Far Cry was intended to be in the very beginning.

I’d also highly recommend Shadow of War (wich has a free Demo, at least on Xbox) and Just Cause 3. Two of my favorite games of all time.

And since Doom 2016 is on the list: Doom Eternal."

It's a really fun top-down souls like where one of the main goals is to collect the pages of the games very own manual scattered over the world. The pages give insight to the games mechanics as well as secrets and puzzles. It's a remarkably clever game, and the combat is really satisfying to get good at. Discovering all the secrets was the highlight for me, but even if puzzle games aren't really your thing, there is a lot to enjoy."

I just keep of track wich ones I finished, 

how many do I have in collection, 

physicaly and digitaly and on wich platforms,

some I keep track on wich perepherials I have beaten them like with Move, Lightgun, Steering Wheel, Mouse&K, Gamepad VR etc.

and for some the hours and difficulties I have beaten them, or if I perfected the game on Steam, Gamerscore, PS Platin etc.

Its really fun to keep track what you played and motivates me to beat 1-3 Games a Month, instead as I was a Teenager where I bought 10 Games on Steam, stsrted half of them and finished maybe only one game in 3 Month."

It is a mode to skyrim, but it simply uses Skyrim's engine to build it's own game with story and mechanics while keeping, even more enchanting skyrim's charm"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I'll say that, in my opinion, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is both better and not as good as Human Revolution. Map/setting wise I think I liked HR more, but gameplay wise MK is an improvement. Even let's you properly beat bosses without killing them! Still absolutely worth checking out as it's a direct continuation of HR.

If you like Deus Ex, you'll definitely love Dishonored. Probably one of my top series by far. Just don't forget the dlc/side games, and consider Deathloop if you like Dishonored. Different setting and not for everyone, but it's very Dishonored-like. 

I also recommend Sekiro, but just know that it is a hard game. You can definitely feel it's made by FromSoft, but it's plays nothing like Elden Ring or other Souls games. Still, I highly recommend it if you can stick it out.

Last, if you don't mind a rhythm oriented game, I HIGHLY recommend Hi-Fi Rush. Came out this year and is personally my Game of the Year (though I haven't played Baldur's Gate or finished ToTK, so that skews things a bit). It's also on Game Pass, so if you get into that, you don't need to pay full price!"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,That's so cool to me!! I'm such a big fan of spreadsheets for unusual things! I wanna learn more so I can categorize by genre and see what genres are weighted higher than others to get like an algorithm to suggest games 😂
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I was thinking about posting mine spreadsheet, because I came with similar idea and kept it updated since 2020, but I don't really want to steal thunder from OP.

Since I'm mostly playing on PS I keep separate sheets for games released on Sony consoles and separate for other platforms (which is abysmal in details compared to PS one). This is mainly due to PS trophy hunting since I'm very invested in it.

My spreadsheet is organized with the following columns:

* sorting nr
* game title
* game series
* dev
* publisher
* PSN / Disc (is physical release available?)
* Ownership (do I own digital or physical copy of game, or F2P)
* HMIWI? (How much I want it? 5-point scale, separate for standard, VR and classic PS1-PS3 games)
* PS PLUS (was it given in PS PLUS)
* PS PLUS EXTRA (is it available in PS PLUS EXTRA)
* PS PLUS PREMIUM (is it available in PS PLUS PREMIUM)
* Hype lvl (only for unreleased games, 3-point scale, low/mid/max)
* Platform (PS 1/2/3/4/5)
* PS5 optimized/improved (only when the game was released both on PS4 & PS5 or received PS5 version at some point, i.e. games have separate entries and trophy lists)
* PS Console Exclusive (Y/N, self-explanatory)
* Currently Playing/Installed (Y/N)
* Owned (Yes/No/available in subscription)
* 100% (Yes/No/Started)
* Percent (trophy completion percent)
* Plat (platinum/100% full completion/unobtainable)
* Plat Diff (taken from trophy guides published either on psnprofiles, powerpyx, PlayStationTrophies or other sites which aggregate guides)
* Plat Time (as above)
* How Difficult I think it was to 100% game? (my plat diff rating)
* Plat diff rating - my own calculation which involves diff & time taken from published trophy guides as well as average percent of trophies & completion from psnprofiles. Results are between 0.55 - 100, where 0.55 indicates game with 1 diff rating which be completed up to 1h and has 100% completion on psnprofiles. New games that have 0%/0% completion and no trophy guide reach rating of \~100 (I round it to 1% to avoid calculation errors).

This effectively helps me to keep track of what to plat next & what to expect from games. Some games are long & easy, some games are short & difficult as well as all the flavors in between.

Rating is spread by centiles & based on calculated difficulty to acquire plat:

0.55-1.29 (i.e., What Remains of Edith Finch (0.89))  
1.30-1.79 (i.e., Bugsnax (1.62)  
1.80-2.29 (i.e., Ghost of Tsushima (1.94))  
2.30-2.79 (i.e., God of War Ragnarok (2.58))  
2.80-3.29 (i.e., Tomb Raider (2.89))  
3.30-3.89 (i.e., Fallout 4 (3.71))  
3.90-4.79 (i.e., Dark Souls III (4.19))  
4.80-5.99 (i.e., The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt (5.63))  
6.00-7.99 (i.e., Red Dead Redemption 2 (7.75))  
8.00-100 (i.e., Deep Rock Galactic (14.58))

Some examples of platinum difficulty calculations from 2023:

Baldur's Gate III: 6.68  
Resident Evil 4 Remake: 3.31  
Diablo IV: 6.60  
Marvel's Spider-Man 2: 1.80  
Dead Space Remake: 2.51  
Alan Wake 2: 2.26  
Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon: 4.07

&#x200B;

* Average Completion on PSNprofiles (self-explanatory)
* Plat percent on PSNprofiles (self-explanatory)

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Lemme see
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Outer Wilds and Cross Code are my two ""off the beaten path"" favorites lately"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I'm playing the DLC right now. The base game is amazing. The DLC is amazing as well.

Landing on the sun station, most frustrating thing ive experienced in a long while until I learned how a trick through trial and error."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I really liked that game but I got stuck like 3 hours in and never went back. I really need to get back to it to finish the story!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,i am still mourning the fact i can never play it again :(
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"How do you know somebody is an Outer Wilds fan? Coz they’ll tell you!

Just kidding I love it, it’s the most creative thing I’ve played for a long time - but it’s difficult to get my mates to play it without giving anything away!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,No fucking way.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"And GoW Ragnarok will follow. Then Spider-Man 2. Eventually FFXVI.

In other words, if you don't usually play Sony exclusives at launch, they'll be on PC eventually."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,This gives me hope that we will see Spider-Man 2 in two years on PC
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Have a blast, by far my favorite game!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Go in blind, but know this.

If you’re stuck somewhere, **go somewhere else**. The game never expects you to brute force anything. There’s an easy way to do everything. All information you need to proceed is given at least three different ways in three different locations."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Godspeed. I wish I could wipe that part of my brain and experience all over again.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Play the DLC if you have not
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Fantastic game. It was difficult for me to complete the game because of thalassophobia but for people without that fear. Blind is 100% the way to go.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,*KotOR* is definitely in my favorites. It can't not be.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,KOTOR is a 10 for me.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I feel that comparing Forgotten City to Outer Wilds just sets it up to be a disappointment. It's a fun mystery, but imo it's nowhere near as satisfying as Outer Wilds"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Which one is the new vegas in space?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Played it years a go and still listen to the soundtrack occasionally. Banger.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I thought the story was amazing!! That was my first time playing a game in that style though, so the gameplay was a bit of a hurdle for me though, deff not a bad game by any regard tho !!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,It holds a special place in my heart. It’s one of very few games that had me dwelling on its story for weeks.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"LOL yeah I do this to kill time, mostly on lunch breaks cuz find ranking stuff fun. My movies and shows ones are even bigger 😳"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Brains like what they like
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"That's only because this would feel like a job to *you*.

To other people like OP this is fun to do."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Shockingly, some people find it pleasing to keep things and lists organized."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Chrono effing trigger
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"If you like Chrono Trigger, you should check out Sea of Stars. It's a pure love letter to the SNES era RPGs. I'm about halfway through and I love it."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Beat every campaign on legendary a couple months ago  for the first time ever in about a month I think I’m ready for a replay lol, of the first three that is. Excellent series"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"That's totally valid!! I had NV higher for the longest time but recently moved FO4 up when I looked back at how much I enjoyed each game. NV is 100% the better RPG, but I think the action/visuals/the fact I live in Boston put fallout 4 just a bit above for me. I do wish it had as many clans and groups as NV did though!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,It's in the play eventually section!! I do think Ill love that one but the amount of game there is can be a bit daunting 😂 Full intention on doing a full playthrough though!!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Do you mean "" baulders gate """
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I'm actually surprised this is the first comment questioning the low portal 1 placement 😂
For some reason as a kid, I played portal 2 and skipped 1 but years later I went back to 1 and it just felt underwhelming compared to the scale of 2. Definitely a great game, but unfortunately I ended up mostly comparing it to 2"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"When I was young I played 2 without 1 for some reason, I recently went back to 1 and was underwhelmed comparing it to 2 :( Still an absolute classic and a great game!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Ooo hell yes!! I'll add those to the list, because I have a strong feeling I'm going to love journey!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"That's a really good shout, I forgot about that one!! Added :)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Especially since Uncharted is listed
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Then he should check out system shock after that since he loves bioshock also
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'd recommend black mesa tbh hl1 looks a little rough these days.  hl2 is still decent though.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Its one of those games. A game I wish I could forget so that I could experience it again for the first time.

It starts slow but its very worth it."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I do think I'll play those ones eventually!! I kept the Playstation list on the shorter side for the ones the REALLY excite me but the spiderman games do look pretty cool too!! :)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"It looks really good!!! It's in early access so I'm waiting to see if a bunch more content comes out before I start it :)
But the style/detective gameplay has me keeping a close eye on it!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Also, didn't see the Metal Gear Solid series"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Tbh the first time I played, the flight controls and the wonkiness of walking around on Giant's Deep made me quit an hour in. I questioned all the praise it would get on here and eventually gave it another shot before it finally clicked!  
My favorite part of the game is how thought out and intricate the solar system and it's physics really were! I really appreciate how unique each planet is and how it's dynamics worked perfectly with the time loop. I love mysteries so finding out stuff along the way that I literally couldve done at any point with the tools I've had the whole time to solve the final puzzle within 30 minutes. When things finally started clicking and made me feel like a genius, it just made me appreciate how well thought out every single bit of the game and design really was. I had genuine curiosity to find out what happened to the Nomai and figure out the unique physics of each of the planets that I've found so hard to match by another game! And the way music plays into the game, the soundtrack as a whole, and the epicness of score of the final mission was amazing! All leading up to the ending which I felt was super well done, invoking some sort of existential feeling thats hard to explain.  
I cant fault you for hating the gameplay though, since I felt it too when I first played/quit ahahah. Im just so lucky it finally clicked for me, which, if it doesnt happen for you and the physics/story dont connect to you thats okay too!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"The ambience/color scheme in that game was unlike anything I've played and sooo cool!! I really wanted to meet the girl in the end though Ill admit LOL  
The section where you feel like you are being watched is so unforgettable though!

Will def check out the Hellblade game !"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"That's totally valid!! I had NV higher for the longest time but recently moved FO4 up when I looked back at how much I enjoyed each game. NV is 100% the better RPG, but I think the action/visuals/the fact I live in Boston put fallout 4 just a bit above for me. I do wish it had as many clans and groups as NV did though!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"It definitely is a slow burn! For me a lot of the fun was actually just vibing! Going around and robbing people/enjoying the scenery/hunting/finding a new area/random encounters was such a vibe during the pandemic for me and spending time getting to know the crew and hanging around camp made the big moments/twists in the late game super hard hitting - and the end emotional!!
I do get the criticism I see a lot that it feels like a chore with certain aspects, so I do feel like it gets better if you start to get attached to the characters but can deff take awhile to get there"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"The game gets a little bit better until you get to the end of chapter 3, then it gets exponentially better. There's a pretty lengthy compilation of streamers at the beginning of the game talking about how boring it is and then by the end of the game they're, let's just say ""all in."""
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"No, it doesn't."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-11-01,"I'm not a RDR2 fanboy, it get's a little better but not by much, it stays extremely slow and scripted in missions, the World opens up a bit more to do some side activities but they are not rewarding or anything, just flavor."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"The story has 6 chapters, and an epilogue. 50% of the story is told in 4.5 chapters, the other 50% only in 1.5 chapters. However, before some people disagree with me, until reaching that point where the story escalates and you go doing mission after mission, there are plenty of things to do in the open world. Rockstar gives the player the freedom of exploring a full and lively open world, compensating for the linearness of the main missions. Game offers amazing views, from big cities to creepy swamps; vast grasslands to challenging mountainous paths; livestock towns to deserts and much more. The prologue, or the first chapter to be more clear, is very slow. The 2nd and 3rd chapters are where you should engage with the open world the most, to hunt, to play games, to interact with npcs, events etc. From the middle of ch. 4 and onward is a downhill for the story, it becomes quite gripping and may even be hard to follow. But it is definitely a game that has a lot to offer, an incredible detailed world and characters that feel ""real""."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"As a Bostonian I just had to!! I've walked down half those streets irl, such a fun experience 🙌"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I was going to say, no Minecraft?!?"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,With how much hype it's getting online in SUPER pumped to be able to give it a move up from the queue 👀
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Story wise those 2 deff have Stray beat, I really don't know what it is about Stray but I was just so engulfed in that world! Visuals aren't everything but I also think that game was one of the most gorgeous ones I've ever played with the neon lights and reflections (I also loved the aesthetic of the greenery/nature combining with the cyberpunk). I also loved exploring the civilization of robot people and learning about them! It just holds a special place in my heart!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I read somewhere that they can be played out of order and everyone keeps hyping up 4 to the point I shot it up a bunch out of excitement LOL but if it's better to play then in order maybe I should contain myself and wait ahahah
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Autism, probably."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Prey and Phantom Liberty are superior.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I read somewhere that sekiro is harder so part of me is just low-key scared I won't progress LOL, I barely beat elden beast by the skin of my teeth. I do really wanna try it though!!

& A buddy of mine told me Ragnarok hits better if you play them back to back so I'm half waiting to see when it's coming to PC and half waiting to see if I'll get a PlayStation. But I fully expect God of war gamea to be 9s or 10s 🙏"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"It's actually in my top 10!! ;)
My goodness that game is fantastic. I listen to the soundtrack to chill STILL"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Ahaha yeah that one turned some heads 😂 When I was young I skipped 1 and played 2 for some odd reason, and when I played 1 recently I felt underwhelmed comparing it to 2 :( Definitely a classic and deserving of all the praise it gets!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Yeah for sure!! I'll DM you a copy when I get home from work! :)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Outer worlds was deff not the most fun for me, just pretty visuals 😂
I will say KOTOR is deff a good game I can see why people love, but I had the twist spoiled for me and am not huge on the combat system so it didn't go super high, but I think if the twist was a full surprise it would've been up a few slots on my personal enjoyment scale! Great characters for sure though"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,LOL tbf the bigger one isn't in order just the shorter queue!! I feel like I would be in more of a rush to play it if I hadn't already watched the entire game on YouTube 😂 But I do fully plan on playing it myself some day!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Both incredible games!! But ranked on enjoyment, I had to give Skyrim the edge partially due to nostalgia and being my first RPG! I remember watching it on YouTube as a kid and finally buying it with my own money. Such a special place in my heart!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Grim Fandango is a masterpiece, it's a must play"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,[deleted]
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,For the longest time I had New Vegas higher but recently thought back to each game and how much fun I had & moved fallout 4 up. I really liked how New Vegas had a ton more groups to interact with but I think I just personally enjoyed fallout 4 more due to the combat/vibe/and exploration more. Part of it is also that I live in Boston and it was kinda crazy how accurate some of the areas were 😂 so it was cool exploring and fighting on streets I've been on before. I also loved the story and i filtrating the institute
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I have a fiance 😂😂 I know when we get married next year I won't be gaming much so trying to get through my catalog ahahaba
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"That's why I keep pushing it back, Im worried characters will feel bland afterwards LOL"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Luckily I actually haven't played a game id consider bad yet !! 
I rank based on soo many things but mainly: how much fun am I having? (Does it feel like a chore to do certain parts?) How much am I connecting to this game/how engulfed into this world am I? (Am I craving exploring and finding more? How much do I wanna go home and play this game?) And stuff like soundtrack/gameplay/graphics/atmosphere/story/ending factor in too !"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,My memory is kinda bad so sometimes I just like reading back what games I've played and it helps me remember my favorite ones!! Like I look at certain titles and just reminisce what parts I adored. Mostly a time killer during lunch breaks though :)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Those ones are ones im considering moving up to the queue once I get through the current ones! :)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Thank you my friend!!
I've actually not had a game I didn't like so far luckily!! If I had one below a 7 id probably just drop it though 😂 I mostly avoid games I know I wouldn't like too"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Ahaha I'm sorry!! The combat wasn't my favorite and the twist got spoiled for me so it took a bit of a hit for my enjoyment scale :( Still incredible characters that deserved a slot in the Great section !
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I just throw every receipt into a box.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"You’re in a for an experience with BG3. Only game that’s hit mass effect’s level for me, and then it went and did it better."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,You'll love Titanfall 2's campaign. It's relatively short but is still one of the greatest FPS campaigns I've played.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Bro left us hanging just like that
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"A lot of it comes from the itch.io racial justice bundle, a few years of Epic giveaways, retro games from various compilations and packs, a few different subscriptions, and all of the games I’ve accumulated physically or digitally over the years.

The spreadsheet has been great for the bundles and compilations, which is where I tend to get lost. That itch.io bundle alone is full of hidden gems."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Impressive!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Glad to see another Crosscode enjoyer. Hella unknown game
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I like that the game doesn’t hold your hand for doing that. It feels so good when you finally get it just right. It’s great. Man, Outer Wilds is great"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"You really do man, and just know its not everyones cup of tea, dont force yourself to enjoy it"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Complete edition $60
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"It's not *that* big of a surprise, the last one came to PC eventually too. Nice to see where almost there for the sequel tho"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Some people may have already died waiting Bloodborne to coming PC lol. The game released in 2015 when I'm in high school and now I'm employed
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,It’d be great if they’d hurry up and bring Ghosts to pc
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,My favorite DLC ever. The sequel I always wanted to the game
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,That one is the low one! Worlds
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I’d love to see the movie one too!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Letterboxd?👀
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"also crosscode, which is on OP's list"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I love the settlement building and it genuinely ruined going back to other fallout games for me because I can't do it.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"If you have RDR2, Skyrim and Cyberpunk in there then Witcher 3 should be a no brainer. Make sure you get the version with the 2 DLCs as it's practically an extra game."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Bolders Gate.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-11-01,"I see. I played the first one on PC and it was really cool, if you liked Jedi FO/ Survivor, then you are in for a treat :) 
This list of yours is pretty inspiring, I might try to do something for myself, thank you for sharing! :)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You’re amazing thank you so much it literally looks like dishonored only instead of angry stabby it’s like Batman Arkham styled detective shit unfolding it looks so intriguing thank you broseph heck
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-11-01,"Yeah it was just beautiful and relaxing. You forgot about the world and all other things playing it. I mean we all wanted to, to be honest :)

Do that, i think you wont be disappointed based on your list!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,">told in 4.5 chapters

Chapter 2,3,6"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Is it that accurate? I didn't realize! I'm playing through now 40 levels in and I'm loving it so much, played NV, 3 &76 before this and I've gotta say this has been by far my fav fallout experience."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"that's awesome! o: 
got a rec: Bullet Storm!
SUPER DUPER FUN"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I grew up playing so much Minecraft but didn't feel like it had enough of a story to rank it compared to such different types of games. But with how influential it's been on my life, it would be top 3 if I had to rank it!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"You're correct, even story wise I prefer Stray too. Just an awesome game from start to finish"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Really depends on the person. I found sekiro to be easier than elden ring. It is faster but parry focused and more aggressive. The lack of equipment and stat leveling means you don’t have to worry about having a bad build but you also won’t be able to overlevel to beat a hard boss. Imo it’s more satisfying that way so i prefer sekiro’s combat but both are great games.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Favorite soundtrack? Mine is between NKG and Greenpath.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Me too please if you don't mind. This is awesome!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,You’re wasting time!!!!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Haha totally fair!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"It is not a must play; the puzzles are horrid.

The graphics in that game are one of the compliments I can give it tho, the world's had some super pretty colors!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"That's fair enough! Did you play it years after it came out? When it was first released it was absolutely amazing, the graphics haven't held up well over time."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I couldn’t finish it. It was too many puzzles! I enjoyed the game despite the puzzles, in my experience. Is the resolution of the game that good? I was very close to the end"

The sheer level of quality and tedious detail put into every last square inch of that game is unrivaled by any game I've ever played or even heard of. I would say you should bump it up in your queue, but it'll make every other game feel ""meh"" after you play it."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"it’s only similar to ME in that dialogue can have consequences. Everything else is different so not sure why that comparison was made but it’s still a good game, at least the first act is"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Given the effort you’ve obviously put into this spreadsheet, I suspect you might come to hate BG3 - you’ll have to introduce a new category for games that score 11/10."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Yeah understandable, the puzzles do feel like too much sometimes. It's satisfying to complete them but it can get frustrating. I really enjoyed the conclusion so would recommend you to finish it but do note that you will want to do the dlc as well since that's essentially the final conclusion and it might not feel complete without it."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,it's one of the best games ever made. highly recommend it
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"My exact thoughts you’ve written out here. It’s been so long since a game has surprised me in every sense of the word, makes me feel like a kid new to gaming again"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I don't believe they were trying to compare gameplay. But the impact that the games each had on them.

rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-17,"I don't think most people care anymore, but it was pretty frowned upon 10 to 20 years ago.  Nowadays most people at least play some kind of games, even if it's just candy crush etc."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-17,The worse sin is watching TV inside a video game hehe
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-17,"Totally agree. Watching a TV show is a passive activity, which is not the case with video game. Yet, socially, watching Netflix is a lot more accepted."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-17,"This is actually true.
No one complains if you binge watch shows but playing videogames is a waste of time.
Double standards I guess 🤷🏻‍♂️."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"This drove me insane as a kid. Now as a parent it's even more annoying. Sitting in front of a screen in a vegetable state vs playing some games that engage the brain are completely different. I do manage my kids screen time, hell even my own, and we make sure it's an engaging game vs just sitting there watching YouTube/TV all day."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,My gf is like this. Tv and stupid ass tiktoks. It's like sorry I'm engaging myself with cool stories and you're watching 2 seconds of videos for hours on end
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,This is my FiL. Always giving my son shit for playing games and he is retired and does NOTHING but sit an watches TV all day long.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"People used to say that reading books was a waste of time.

Then tv became a waste of time and books became normal.

Then video games became a waste of time and tv became normal.

Now video games are becoming normal and eventually, if I ever have kids, I’ll criticize how they waste their time. I already cringe into oblivion whenever I see kids doing tiktok crap so I imagine it will be similar to that. It’s just the natural order of things."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"My mom, dad and sister all read books to pass time.  I did too, I just also played video games.  


I started gaming in the late 70s and most games back then didn't have much of a story.  Certainly not anything that was presented in the game, maybe in the manual or the back of the box.  


But come the NES era, my sister got it right away.  Interactive adventures, ""Like *Choose Your Own Adventure* books"", she'd say.  


My mom and dad never got it, and after my dad passed away my mom took to getting on me about the amount of time I ""waste"" playing video games and asking when I am going to ""grow out of it.""  


I play games every night just about, and sometimes I do play all day.  But I still read.  I still appreciate a well crafted film (and also enjoy some poorly crafted ones lol).  I also have friends that I socialize with often, many of which are gamers themselves.  I ride my bike nearly every day.  I have a cat that I spend at least an hour with every day, just me and her hanging out.    


Some might laugh at that last bit, but what is the point of having a pet if you aren't going to dedicate some time be an active part of their lives beyond feeding and cleaning after them?  


Anyway, I feel I have a pretty well-rounded life.  My mom watches several hours of YT videos each day recently... and I am not even close to saying that she is wasting time.  If she enjoys doing that, more power to her.  


I just wish she didn't look at my playing video games as some sort of brainless activity for kids.  


I have tried to get her into some, and she will play Scrabble online with me now and then and loves those ""find the item"" games... but she still sees gaming as a hobby as a waste of effort."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Honey we should spend more time together

I now sit with her after our son goes to bed till I get 'OK get out of here I'm trying to watch my shows!'"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"It's so weird that watching tv/movies is totally acceptable, but engaging your brain and motor skills by playing interactive movies/stories, isn't as acceptable."

rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Exactly. I got tired of arguing when my ex would want everyone off screens but then let everyone come to the living room to watch tv
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,I love it when people who watch sports and don’t play them think people who play video games are just nerds.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Never understood the hate of videogames by people who spend ALL their free time staring at TV.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-17,What if I’m earning money playing video games is it because they are jealous? Lol
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Even more, if you play online with others, people around you will judge you HARDER than when you play single player games."

rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"This is true, but I doubt there are many people watching 10-12 hours of TV a day/7 days a week, but oof check some MMO subreddits. Anything can be unhealthy without moderation."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-17,They will use TikTok or YouTube shorts for hours but you play games for half an hour and your banished from the family
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-17,"Many people are hypocrites although if you are the type of person whom ""all"" you do is watch tv or play video games i'll probably judge you for that.  Get some diversity in your life

edit: to clarify, not so much as judge as feel sorry for.  Spending all your life on those things is a recipe for depression"

rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Hell. Id argue, depending on the game, playing video games is a step more productive than watching movies/tv.

I know watching or playing isnt technically productive at all, but still"

rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"This is my dad. I'm middle aged now and he still makes contemptuous remarks about how I play video games. How it is a waste of time, you're just sitting inside all day, go out and *do* something. etc...

Also my dad. Watches almost every sport there is. Loves football so during the 4(?) month long college/pro season spends at least 12 hours a day on weekends and whatever more hours during the week watching. Same with basketball and baseball. He's not that big into hockey, probably only watches 20-30 games a year.

Fuck you dad."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Gaming is a hobby and depending on what you’re playing and why, it’s experiencing art. Emotions, visuals, sounds all create an experience

Why people think other hobbies are so much better idk. Unless they’re thinking of people screaming into mics because they have no maturity or emotional control, which I understand"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,One time I was watching tv in the living room. I never really leave my room but I thought I’d mingle with my family. They got annoyed I was using their tv and yelled for me to go back to my room so they could watch tv. I then played video games in my room and they made fun of me for playing video games.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"I honestly don't see the difference between playing single player games and watching movie/tv, but my friends say that playing single player games is wasting time, but they also watch netflix series hello!?"

rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Switch it to TikTok lol
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Video games are fun, but still we shouldn't play them TOO long. I remember seeing quite a few people on Call of Duty who had 50-80 days of play time. To me that's insane, but some kids just want to play all day"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Same goes for people calling LARPers losers, while they wear the jersey of their favorite player, throw/kick around the ball, play fantasy football, and armchair quarterback. Maybe self reflect a little. Lol."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"The only person I say that about is someone who plays 13 hours a day, has a 2 year old son, gets frustrated every time he has to pause games to help care for him while having not worked for a year and hasn’t applied for any jobs while the mother works full time and goes to school."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,most video games have a problem solving aspect to it where engages your brain to a degree at least more than just watching tv
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Not exactly related to gaming, but I’ve lost track of how many times throughout my life my mom has told me I spend too much time playing D&D when I spend maybe 3 hours a week playing while she spends 5 hours _a day_ watching tv."

rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Big Data has over the last 10 years or so collected so many details and lifestyle shared traits that we all share lol. For ""online folk"" somewhere near 60-70% of our lifestyles are the same across the board."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"The worst part is, you're not allowed to either be defensive or counter with this.

If you get defensive, they take it as proof that they're right.

If you bring their thing up as a counter argument they get butthurt but act like there was nothing wrong with their accusation."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Truth.

rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"I'm a firm believer that gaming is far healthier for the mind and psyche than sitting around watching hours of tv a day.  

The hand eye coordination and mental engagement is far more important than people realize.

I have a sneaking feeling the reason boomers have no critical thinking skills whatsoever is because many hours of television every day has condemned their minds to passivity, resignation, and simply believing what they're told without challenging it.

The Gen X and Millennial entertainment is typically much more psychologically and mentally engaging.  It keeps the mind sharper."

rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"What's that, you don't actively interact with and take the reigns of agency in your own entertainment? Seems pretty lazy and mindless to me. Can't be good for young minds, kids should be interacting and learning from their media."

If you're playing videogames, you still have brainpower and energy left, and it should be directed to something productive. 

I personally don't agree with that philosophy, but it was an interesting one I'd never heard before. I personally would value ""doing something"" over vegging on mental garbage and identify that I have different energies and mental focus for different things.

rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,And then they proceed to not talk and just look at their phone
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,That is sort of true? I usually will stop playing games and hang out with my wife watching TV together. That way we are at least interacting with each other and I'm not just staring at a monitor screaming into a headset
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"If your playing on your own like I normally do, I guess they have a point"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Shhhh! Stop talking we're watching a movie
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"My arguments toward my dad too.

Me: 5 hours of time in the PS3 that day (need to note I hadn't been to play it for a week because I have a life)

Dad: that is too much time behind a TV

Me: Points out he layed all day watching Netflix the day before.

I won"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,And their response??
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Makes sense. The last 5 years TV has become incredibly boring though. At best there is one maybe 2 original ideas at a time. At worst we had 5 talent shows (3 singing, 2 dancing) and three game shows. All 8 were copied from other countries."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Exactly, 20 years ago my Dad would give me a hard time for playing games for 3+ hours on weekend meanwhile he is watching a Cricket match that goes all day.  Limits are not a bad things for games and TV but you have to practice what you preach as a parent.   


If anything my gaming came about BECAUSE he was hogging the TV all day watching Sport, so i went and played games on the PC instead.  this wont be much of an issue for my Kids, unfortunately they pretty much already have full control of the TV, how times have changed."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,We've moved onto judging younger generations for Tik-Tok now. :)
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-20,Yep... I'm a parent now (been gaming since the 80s) and I encourage my kids to game vs watching TV
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"That sounds almost eerily similar to me haha, 28 though, but the guys in my shop wouldn't even use their phones at work, now they're always on their phones playing something.  Somehow convinced my friend at work who wouldn't talk about games to build a pc, and he became a coder.  It's crazy how much things have changed."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-20,HA - Imagine me... I've been gaming since the days of 4 CGA monitors and I'm 45 now.  Love PC gaming more than ever!
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Woa.. don't put us old ""30 year olds"" in the same category as boomers please lol my ass is gaming whenever life permits.."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Since my friends and I are in our 30s and play games… it’s more like 40-50 year olds
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"As someone who is on the cusp of being old by children/teen standards, and also played a ton of video games growing up, its just another form of “youth is wasted on the youth”. 

Looking back, as much as I loved the video games I played, I could have been doing things I no longer am physically equipped to do. Career opportunities that aren’t as promising with an older individual. 

Thats not to say gaming is right or wrong, I have no comment there. Only that to see it from this perspective, you need age."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Definitely shouldn't be 30s, my whole generation grew up with consoles, I'd say the 40+rs."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,It's so stupid right? 😂
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"See I was having this conversation with my wife yesterday. I played a bit with my buddy's for a few hours two days ago. And when I told her I'd join her and her friend from Germany at around 7pm she said that would be fine. 640 rolled around and it was come join us now. That I should be spending time with them instead of my highschool buddies that I was playing with for a few hours and he was getting ready to go after 7pm. This happens once a week for a few hours. Yes the friends stay is limited but that's beside the point when I join it's nothing but board games but only ones she approves because the friend doesn't ""understand"" English all that well. And I'm just awful because I'm coming home from work and sitting on my PC for an hour to decompress. But no they can sit and watch fucking movies all day but as soon as I get home nope not allowed."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"My Wife was like this at the start of our relationship until i pointed out that i probably play video games as much as she watched Reality TV, what's the difference? In your case id say its a combo of wanting to see you do well in school/College/Uni/Life so video games = wasted time in her books, as soon as you have something tangible like a good Job or good grades to show that the gaming is not ""getting in the way"" you can usually dismiss any attempts at ruining your gaming time with the evidence that you've got your shit together."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,My parents were always been really supportive of me gaming. They didn't understand it but they realised how much it meant to me. 10 years ago when I was around 18/19 they would bring me to Lan events to compete etc. Im not sure I realised this before now..
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,I've never seen that movie. Can you really watch the full movie in the game?
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,I want a Princess Robot Bubblegum show so bad.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,I just started a replay and before finishing this mission I watched all the fake shows from start to finish. They did an amazing job on something that I doubt most people gave a second glance
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Which is why I don't _get_ Twitch.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-17,"Just need to watch a reaction video of that video and you’ve reached the deepest sin… unless you watch the response to the reaction video… or the follow up reaction video to the response video of the reaction video of a streamer watching Michael watch TV in GTA.  

It surely could get worse."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"To be fair a lot of the shows that are only really streamed where I live are actual TV shows on TV in the US (like game of thrones or whatever)
In my country drivers and painters/plumbers/builders listen to radio as well, but podcasts are taking over (which are basically ‘streamed’ radio anyway)"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,The difference is their usage is passive while yours is interactive. I would argue they are not the same at all and that the passive one is actually a much worse use of time if we were comparing.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,What games did you play out of interest?
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,The difference is that you're much less likely to learn useful skills from non-interactive media.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Thank you for your service. The time you've given is greatly appreciated.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-17,I guess I’ll just go outside and have a beer 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Do you truly not engage with tv simply because you're not pressing a button? Quality television demands engagement: imagination, suspension of disbelief, your attention span to follow plot, etc. I don't know that either of them are a waste of time if the time is enjoyed. Though I do think the meme is accurate."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Some people lack the brain for videogames.
There.
I said it."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Behold, the Reddit relationship guru. 

Jokes aside, this guy will be fine. Me and my wife both spend our time next to each other every night, me doing whatever and her watching stupid ass TikToks. 

It's only toxic when you begin to shut your partner out and ignore them when attention is obviously wanted. More women seriously need to find a hobby to keep themselves more occupied, it shouldn't be up to a man to have to provide their entertainment for them."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Pretty compatible tho. I play game on tv, you watch tikkies on little hand tv."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Hahahahaha!
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Oh I agree 1000%. I’m just using it as a reference. I’m sure VR will be the thing to blow up down the road.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"There's definitely the influence or false or bad information on social media, whereas games and movies/series don't have that. Youtube has at least the good side where there are actually educational videos."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Depends how you define waste of time. You could make an argument that learning to play an instrument or paint is a waste to of time. Pretty much anything in life that’s enjoyable is kind of a waste of time but we’re people not robots.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"All entertainment is probably a ""waste of time"" on some level. Everything doesn't have to be productive"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,16yrs in. We good.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"I wouldn't say that is always takes hard work to become a professional gamer. Some people just get popular in no time. But I just think ""good for them"". Why would I get mad people who have an 'easier' job than some other people?"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Kelly?
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,This.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-17,"But at the same time don't you think that the creativity, dexterity, and quick brain responses you've gained from gaming can be poured into other talents?"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Can I be crab people?
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Thank you for bringing this completely unexplored topic to light!
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-19,You're delusional but I appreciate the effort
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,It sounds like they didn't want you to make your own fun without them.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"My parents aren't related, weirdos."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"This right here is the problem.

As someone who was born in 1980 (and saw both worlds) there were absolutely things lost in the coming of the digital age, and so much gained, with good and bad in both.

But you can't bring back the old times while zoning out on the new times yourself.

The whole reason that the old days hold so much nostalgia is that we had very few choices and were stuck together, watching the same thing, and people bonded over that. 

It *was* social. Because you could criticize it, hate it, love it, make jokes about it, discuss it, whatever. And everyone was on the same page, topic-wise, even if the opinions were different.

It became more about the people you were with than the thing itself.

And everybody you knew was watching it too. So it was a topic at school or work or whatever.

You can maybe make a little bubble of that in your own home (because the outside world won't be on the same page) but, if you take your phone out and start scrolling, it's worthless and people of all ages are guilty of it.

But people around my age and older should know better.

If you want to create that atmosphere, you have to commit to it."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,14 hours straight of Ratchet and Clank are definetly more stimulating than shitty telenovelas or sports broadcasts
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Sad part is, my mom wouldn't do that, for her any movie really was a social experience"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"“You’re under our house, so you’re under our rules.” 

Can’t really argue with that. When I got of age and a job I bailed."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Surely it was measured and well thought out, and not just an emotional counter-attack?"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Now it's why do you spend all your time on tiktok!? At least go do something like play a video game...
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Yeah this. The issue isn't whether you are watching cricket, or playing video games. It's how much you do these things. If you spend the whole day binge watching netflix that also is not healthy just as gaming all day long is not healthy. We all should go for at least a 30 minute walk per day maybe to the grocery store or something. Walk the dog maybe. Work out 2-4 times a week. And eat healthy. After that sure game all you want, and stand up every 1 hour of sitting down. Even just 30 seconds of standing and moving the legs a little goes a long way."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"My dad was the same with golf, nascar, football, baseball, basketball, hockey, poker, and formula one. Meanwhile I wouldn't watch any of that. I'd go play with my toys, or draw, or paint, or sculpt, or read a book, or build a model car, or play a video game, or watch a cartoon, or go outside and look at nature, or ride my bicycle, or play street hockey with the neighborhood kids, or do many of these activities with my brother. Then he'd complain that I didn't spend enough time with him, even though I would boringly sit on my ass with him for hours each time he asked me to watch sports, some of which ran all day long. Each time I'd eventually get tired of it and left to go do things I wanted to. No Dad, I didn't spend time with you not because ""I didn't love you"" but because ALL YOU EVER DID was watch sports. That gets boring. You can't do that all day. I love you Dad, but you loved your sports more. We could've done so much more other activities together. Well, he's dead now and I don't even watch tv, I don't follow sports, and I barely play video games anymore so jokes on him. Christ, I don't think he ever played a video game in his life, even though I'd ask him to play with me time and again. He wasted his life sitting in front of a Goddamned box for sports instead."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,">...you have to practice what you preach as a parent.

Lol. Sry kiddo, but that's not how things work out there in the real world."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Let the kids have the pc, more time for you on the pc!"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,my mom would just lock the power cord to the computer and told me to go play outside. that is how i learn how to lockpick. 🤣🤣🤣
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Did we have the same dad? I had the same experience growing up, he looked down on me for playing videogames and called them a stupid childish waste of time, but he'd watch sports on TV for hours."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Your dad watching grasshopper on tv all day long ?
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Old ass boomer here. If one I tell one of my old ass friends that I did nothing all weekend I get nods of approval. If I say I spent the weekend playing a new video game, they act like I just wasted my time. Apparently for some people, laying on the couch scratching their balls is more preferred over actively entertaining yourself."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"> Kids… unfortunately 

Parental control"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"The guy I first built a pc for, had no idea what a GPU or steam was. Now he has like 2000 hours in Dota!"

rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,54 just played hots last night. It's just people gatekeeping pastimes. Before games it was TV before TV it was radio before radio it was....before my time :P
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"I was talking about my friends, because I'm aware people can have different experiences. 

In my country games are still viewed mostly as a thing for kids so there are less ""adult gamers""."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-20,I'm 45 and game all the time.  I've gotten my two daughters into PC gaming.  We play together on the Minecraft and Valheim servers I setup.  My 12 year old is insane over Horizon Zero Dawn.  It's wonderful
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Yep, it's in an early level where you're watching it on an old TV with your girlfriend, if you don't do anything the entire movies plays. The game also has ""The Man With the Golden Arm"" starring Frank Sinatra, ""The Street Fighter,"" an episode of ""Flash Gordon,"" as well as Popeye and Gabby cartoon shorts."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Best anime I ever watched
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,For me it’s like the same reason ppl watch sports. I suck at it and like to see professionals do it properly. Also when you don’t have the proper gear to play some demanding games you can still enjoy the the setting or story without buying a high end pc yourself.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,I got into twitch when I hurt my left hand earlier this year. I was living vicariously… but I dropped it as soon as I could play again lol
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"You may be able to play video games yourself, but can you play video games while an attractive woman reads your username for the low low price of your kidney?"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Only one I watch is one of the developers of a game playing and talking about the game- so kinda like commentary mode in some games.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Because seeing people play a game youre playing at the same time and getting involved in the community is the point. Met alot of good people on Classic WoW like this, or found out tricks in EFT, or just discovered different things in FF14... all from streamers.   


Also the memes are top tier."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,It’s a good way to see what’s worth playing.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"It's 3am here and half my brain is processing all I've experienced playing Outer Wilds all day so this will by no means be an in-depth analysis on the psychology of streaming, but so far I've noticed a few things about Twitch:  


1) There is the community engaging aspect, which is nice.

2) Sometimes the streamer dons a persona and basically plays a character, bringing entertainment trough their performance.

3) On the topic of competitive games, it can be seen as a reviewing pro moves or simply watch people doing cool shit you can't be bothered to invest enough time to try.

4) Some people cannot or aren't willing to play the game, but would like to watch a full gameplay in a more ""organic""way."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"The way I see Twitch isn't just watching someone play games. It's like hanging out with your buddies in a gaming room. I often watch when I'm playing something casually and I'm socializing and sometimes getting caught up in what they're playing etc.

I've made some of my best friends on Twitch."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"I mostly watch twitch to see what techniques or methods other people are using to do something I'm struggling with, such as a boss or a particular level of some game. But i don't get following progress videos either."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Only reason I've heard that makes any sense to me is people watching a streamer play a game they're thinking about buying before spending the money on it.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"One of the biggest mysteries of life to me. I feel like I'm becoming a boomer at the old age of 24, but aside from the pro players of a game you are intrested in, why would you ever watch someone play is beyond me. If you do it on youtube, edited and shortened I would get. But how does anyone have time in their lives to watch some random person play video games?"
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"It’s a great platform and it has a good community element if you’re looking for that. But unless I’m trying to figure out how to do something, I’m not going to watch someone else have fun when I can do the same damn thing myself."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Most people are there for the chat it's fun to be able to watch something and talk/joke about it. This allows for communities with running jokes and stuff. It's also fun to watch because watching some people play is just exciting and they genuinely play the game well. The streamer can make some standard gameplay funny or have more insight. The strangers are more similar to comedians than content creators. Some have cool gimmicks like a timer for how long the stream goes or funny challenges in the game like finishing the whole game in a clown suit.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Stream some reaction videos of someone watching someone watching TV in a videogame. Then film yourself reacting to that stream, and watch it. Then have someone react to that, then stream their reaction and react to it - aaaand my brain imploded."

rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,World of Warcraft. The latency was horrendous. .
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Thanks.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Yeah. I appreciate his service too. Can I also get a thanks for my service? I work law enforcement at a mall. It’s tough work and 99.9% of people couldn’t cut it. And unfortunately it’s often thankless work….
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Thinking about themes, storyline, and enjoying visuals is very different from solving a puzzle and developing a playing strategy in a video game. Brain is a simply lot more active while gaming than watching passive programing. That said, I think we can all agree artistic value of most movies is significantly higher than most video games so the inherent value of  watching movies probably shouldn't only be judged from a very basic brain health perspective."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,And video games demand all those things and more.
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Most people are probably not even watching they are just on their phone
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Try watching a good horror movie, and then try playing a good horror game. See which one provokes a stronger fear response."

rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-17,"No? Because I'm happy the way my life is and if the same type of people are too, then why must we be looked down upon or felt sorry for? I honestly dislike people, will never try or want to interact with them more then I have to for work."

rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"I mean, there's benefits to playing video games.

but what are the benefits of TikTok? it's basically youtube but less..."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"I mean, TV, videogames and tiktok are not comparable.

TV, videogames and social media would be the comparable thing.

Tiktok is just an app. One of many. Like many videogames and like many channels/streaming services."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Our mind actually tell us. If i watch too much tv and in the end of it, I don't feel too good about it. Too much gaming is the same or too much work or studying. Balance it out. There should be some discipline to your life but make sure that you manage to do what you like at the end too and you'll realize you enjoy your hobbies way more that way."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,">Any haters are just haters.

Exactly. This chain could keep going. There’s always someone: “I’m 57 and I game” then onto “I’m 69 and I was gaming on Pong” etc. I’m 42 and I’ve been gaming since the early 80s and my mom always played games with me, at the arcade and on my consoles. It’s just a mentality of a certain type of person and those people are still around today, they’re just less common, thankfully."

1. Exclusively of the games. I don't have console like Switch, PS4 and PS5 so I watch games I am interested in but can't play like Persona games.
2. It is more watching the streamer.. This would depend on the personality of streamer.
   1. You want to see the streamer fail or do the unexpected when you know the streamer is not good at the game.
   2. Watch streamer for the reaction like playing horror game or a touching game
   3. A combine of 1 and 2 but some streamer challenge themselves even if they are not experts like max difficulty in They are Billions or all shiny pokemon run in Pokemon or play Jump King for hours

TLDR: It is mainly up to streamer's personality."

Many prominent streamers are ex-pros that people are fond of because they rooted for them competitively. 

Guys like Dr Lupo/Timthetatman/NickMercs/Ninja can be dropped in an average battle royale FPS game and get 20 kills and 1st place (out of 100 players) regularly. On top of that, they have banter that is usually enjoyable, close to a funny gamer podcast. Some of them aren't ""professionals"" but it is the Globetrotter equivalent.

The way I use reddit seems fundamentally different from how I see people doomscroll twitter, or mindlessly swiping images on Instagram. I have no clue how TikTok works. That said, reddit is a horrible time sink nonetheless. You know what, I'll block it now, need a few hours of work."
rita6n,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"See, when you make that comment, you ignore what I said about watching entertaining streamers as well.

So taking that into consideration, yes, I do believe that if we were to take 100 popular video game streamers in a completely random sample, that signficantly more than 2 of them would be either good at their game or genuinely entertaining to whoever watches them. Why do you have such a negative view of streamers?"

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Wasn't the PSN hack the reason that finally forced sony to take the dip?
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Forced PSplus membership for ps4 is still a bitter point of mine. I was so happy that psn wasn't a forced paid service during the ps3 days.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"I'm actually surprised PC gaming companies haven't jumped on board with this.

Take Blizzard, for example. You not only have to pay the price of a full game for a World of Warcraft expansion, but a monthly subscription on top of that. But for a game like Overwatch, you just buy it once, and can play online for free.

Imagine if Blizzard did away with the WoW subscription, and started charging an online sub for ALL their multi-player games (Overwatch, HotS, Hearthstone, Diablo, etc.). Why they haven't done this, is beyond me. One might initially think it's because of how the playerbase would react. But wouldn't it be the same as what Nintendo is doing? "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Nah guys it's going to be great.

See it's the same exact online service we've had free for the past year, but now we get to pay for it, so it's great.

Really, really great.

Oh and they'll throw in 20 NES games and allow us to backup our own save files. 

Great."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Use a PC and do not be ripped off for online. Spend the money on better hardware or more games instead.

What's good is that, when I eventually buy a PS4, those games are all ready to play so I have a nice big backlog to play through for $5 a month. 

Nintendo isn't even offering anything good along with the online service. NES games aren't my thing and making them playable online certainly doesn't entice me. I hope, if they're going to keep with the service, they improve what they're going to offer."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,Technically PC is paid online. You need your internet service. That would make the consoles double online @_@

How are they going to strong arm people into a service with no TV apps and like 4 games that are online?

I can see them doing a paid service for something like streaming games or a monthly game membership, but paid online has no benefit to Steam.

I do not even look at games that have microtransactions anymore, not worth getting my hopes up. Anything that is not pay once and play the complete game better have a really good reason for me to even consider it."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,I just got the nintendo switch and now I have to pay more to play online that sucks.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"Fuck really, another reason I'm super disappointed that I bought into the hype of Nintendo console, it just gets worse by the week. Between lack of games and just general bleh after the initial start.  Mario odyssey is alright safe zelda botw is better but it's not worth the cost of the console to own, same with mario kart. Yay a re-release of the game I already had on Wii U

Fuck Nintendo "

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,And all popular online games that will require paid service are now on a discount. As a fan of Nintendo I've got to say it's a bit *douche* kind of move.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,I let my gold membership lapse due to my finances and didn't realize all the free games I downloaded through my membership became unavailable to play. I was so pissed because I thought I essentially payed for those games with my yearly subscription. Fuuuuuck that
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"Haha, that's pretty accurate!

&#x200B;

In all seriousness though, I personally have no problem paying just $20/year for this service.  But I do think it's a mistake to do this after the console launched, and games like Splatoon 2 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe have already sold millions.  Not everyone keeps up with game news, and a lot of people are going to be seriously upset when they suddenly can't play Splatoon online (which is 90% of the game).  The communities for those games are going to dwindle considerably."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"$20 a year is good enough

But free us better"
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-06,Most of Sony's online games don't need paid online. All of the free ones and some of the paid ones.

50$ a year for PS4 online. 

60$ a year for Xbox online. "

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Not to condone this, but at least Nintendo's is only 20 dollars for a whole year."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,And it's bulshit with paid online because allot of games have shit servers anyway because sony just takes money nothing else except the server to take money they don't support anything lol
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Ok but Nintendo is actually doing it well. It's like 30 bucks for a year and you get to play a bunch of old SNES games.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Looks like I won't be playing anything online on my switch then. Oh well.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"I hate this argument. I want to play or chat with my friends on Xbox? I just invite them to a party and it's seamless to play games with them and get them to join.

&#x200B;

I want to play on PC? Is it a personal server, or do the games have servers. How are we chatting? Well the in game chat system is garbage, PeopleHunter99 still hasn't downloaded Discord and wants to skype, but MyLittleButtSniff prefers ventrillo over anything else, and MrFantastick is having trouble with his audio because he can't figure out which audio output device is his headphones so we either get feedback of hearing ourselves or he can't hear us.

I love PC gaming, but consoles rule the ease and availability of multiplayer. I am willing to pay for the upkeep of that system as long as they keep making improvements and I am having an excellent experience with it."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Eh, the $5 a month I spend on PSN is well worth it for the “free” games I get every month.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,Paying for the internet to play PC  games online is equivalent to all three of those online services put together and possibly more.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,I don’t get it. I have Xbox live for free and have never paid. I get all multiplayer features on all games. Anyone else like this?
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"This was the reason I stopped buying consoles games for online play. They're only gaming bricks for single-player console exclusives now. If only more people were capable of staving off instant gratification and speaking with their wallets against these companies, they'd actually stop doing this shit. :/"
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"Nintendo's online service is literally $20 a year. In a few months, there will be a family plan, that will be $35 a year and includes seven people. It's really not comparable to Microsoft or Sony."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"I have gamed almost exclusively on PC for a number of years now but recently got a Switch.

I love it.

It does cool things my PC doesn't has a great library. But.
This Nintendo online service has completely put me off of buying certain games.
Splatoon 2? I really liked the look of the previous one but never had a chance to try it. Splatoon 2 was looking to be an Easy buy since a number of friends have it.
But if i did buy it, I'd soon be losing a huge chunk of the game to a subscription system.

IF I paid for the game, I'd have paid for that functionality. It was part of the Product i bought. Then nintendo pulls a Darth Vader and Alters the deal. Yeah yeah say what you want about it being their right. It's still a trash move.

This Online subscription thing has so many ways it could be done right The back catalogue of games in their library alone! But they just had to fuck it up and try to cash in goodwill they gathered from their new darling console.
If the AAA industry has taught me anything it's that Cashing in Audience goodwill is not easy you walk a razors edge when pulling that.

More often then not companies will lose out in the long term trying to do it."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,Well for your PC you still pay your monthly ISP bill... It's cheaper than ISP + subscription but... You're still paying to play online ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"Idk about you guys, but as a switch owner, there is no way in fuck nintendo will get a single dime from me for paid online

I'm hoping since the switch already has free online, and they're now going to a paid service instead, no one else will buy it either and nintendo will just give up and go back to how it is now. I don't mind if they do a ""netflix for games"" type subscription with their massive back catalogue of old games, but tying online play to that subscription is a joke, and a bad one at that.

meanwhile as I say this /r/NintendoSwitch is probably preordering their subscriptions -_-"

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,So I get the sentiment here but with games being offered every month now it's not super dissimilar to something like humble monthly. You get some decent quality free games each month which usually make up for the price which console users pay. 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,F
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,At least Nintendo does $20 for a month unlike the other companies.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Imo Nintendo should be in kids pool considering it costs only 3rd compared to ps4 and xbox.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Well Nintendo online is super cheap so at least there's that plus Nintendo is a good company so i don't mind i wish this wasn't the case but I can deal with it

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"If it means decent servers, games, and cloud saves I'm willing to pay. I don't understand why paid online is still a bad thing. Plus, c'mon, Nintendo is charging $20 for a year. It's not going to break the bank."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Omg we have to pay for stuff we like! This is just as bad as all those people that died from net neutrality!
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,GOG will be looking pretty good at that point. 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Why would they charge us to use their store? All actual game servers are owned by their developers and or publishers. Paying for access to games you already paid them for (around 30% of the retail price) would cause huge backlash. Steam isn't the only digital store platform out there. 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,They take a 30% cut from everything bought. They don't need to ever be a paid service 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Lucky for us steam has a couple competitors out there.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,The second they do it will drop dead.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"No way Steam does that, they have too good of a thing going. Even cocaine cartels are envious of Steam and their (completely legal and genius) racket."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"It never will, other companies (IE Microsoft) have tried adding paid internet on the PC and we supply reject it, boycott it, or pirate it."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Steam is printing infinite money.  They're not going to fuck that up.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,If you'd have to pay to even play the steam games you own thats a good cause for just pirating them back.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,Including for access to the store? That would be fucking awful. Imagine if you had to pay a subscription to use your local supermarket.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Xbox live has always been worth every penny. Common achievements system, common matchmaking, servers that are nearly always up. Well known and major platform updates twice a year. PSN has come lightyears, but the first few years were hot garbage.

​

Microsoft showed that it was profitable, if done well."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,To be fair... It does come with a lot of benefits. I have like 400$ of free games now.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"They certainly did, but the difference in match quality was out of this world.  I remember PSN not being super stable(partly because you'd get matched with people not in your region) and missing a lot of features you could find on XBL.  XBL wasn't/isn't perfect but as someone who experienced both in the early stages, Microsoft knew how to leverage their azure infrastructure in a way that provided a better online experience than what PSN could offer.   "

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"To their credit, XBLive was worlds superior to what PS3 had before they started charging for it, and it remained superior because of better pings and a more consistent network."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"I like how Microsoft doesn’t have the balls to try to make Microsoft games paid online for PC.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"PC also isn’t a company.

There are plenty of companies on the platform that do charge a subscription service, especially for legacy games."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Sadly, few cared that it remained free on the Vita :/ 

Though that’d probably be one of the reasons they were actively internally trying to kill it."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,It was still free when it got hacked on the ps3. It wasn’t paid until ps4. 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,The paid version is even worse...
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"Only reason I choose PS2 and PS3 over x-box systems. I never wanted to go with a paid online service. Then PS4 comes along and I still haven't gotten one yet. Though I will have to break down one day and get one to play a few games I want to play, but for now just PC since Nintendo also decided to be jerks. Though I will probably get a switch at some point as well for a handful of games, but with PS4 and switch it will only be single player which im fine with. "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"Bought a PS4 assuming free PSN. Boy was I wrong... traded it in for an Xbox One as soon as I found out and never looked back. That said, I mostly just use it to play Minecraft and Halo. My Custom built PC is my station of choice however."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"I agree, but TBF PS+ wasn't a requirement to play online when they were hacked.  Just gave you discounts on games pretty much."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"This isn't even accurate, but it proves the itch people had to shit on Sony on this thread. "

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Nintendo's is gonna be much cheaper though. Not that it makes a difference to me. I don't game online. The beauty of video games is that you can play against a computer and don't need to deal with people. 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,">they’re swimming laps in the pool while Nintendo is over in the corner drinking the pool water

Eh, at this point I'd say they're more along the lines of pissing into their own mouth while trying to mumble '*Please understand*"" underwater."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"For real, I don't mind paying for psn.  Getting some fantastic games this month alone like God of war 3 remastered and Destiny 2 and some indie games more than justifies the service for me.  Have absolutely no interest in Nintendo's offering as it stands."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,PS kind of does it decently. 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Nintendo does some weird stuff when it comes to business.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,Yeah but at least i won’t have to sell my kidney for it. 60$ is fucking ridiculous for online. Nintendo is 20 and even cheaper if you have 7 friends to split the 35$ family plan with. 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Do they still have that ridiculous friends code system?
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"I agree with you there. I don't play online games on my Switch so I won't have need of the online, but my brother plays a lot of Splatoon so he'll be picking up a membership when the time comes. 

The huge problem here is how lacking Nintendo's online services actually are. No achievements, no on-system chats and several other basic features that Microsoft and Sony have been offering for years. If they had stated that they were going to use this money to start catching their online services up, that might make it an easier pill to swallow, but they haven't said that and likely won't do it. 

Yes, it's cheaper, but come on, we have free online platforms like Steam that are able to provide these things and more without making us pay for it."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Yeah ps+ has paid for itself. Meanwhile I think I've spent less overall on my PS4 and PS3 combined than the PC I just bought
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"But they're still ""good guy Nintendo"", right?

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,No f2p game on PS4 requires PS plus. 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Nintendo said from day one that the current online was a demo or trial. Starting September its 20 dollars a year. Which is frankly a joke as far as prices go. 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"> How can anyone accept that?

because with the hardware-based DRM that consoles are you have no choice (if you want to play the nintendo games that are shackled to the lackluster hardware). "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"No the PS4 caused it. The hack simply forced them to upgrade security and servers and give Little Big Planet, infamous, and other games for free as compensation. At the time ps+ simply gave access to a few discounts on games then they added the free games around the time of the PS4 launch. "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"lmao, no.  That's just one of the many ways people justify it to themselves that a paid model is necessary."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"""Cheap"" things will often work out to be more expensive in the long run. PC gaming has always been one of those things. Depending on how many games you buy, PC is cheaper despite the machine itself costing more."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"> But for a game like Overwatch, you just buy it once, and can play online for free.

Skins.

Also they tried to monetize Diablo 3 post launch with the now failed Auction House."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"IF they made all of their games subscription based, then they would have to produce a truck load of more content for me to fork over the money. As it stands now, WoW's sub-to-content value is dwindling fast.

Blizzard has a huge business intelligence team, bigger than most of their dev teams. They know going sub-based for all their games would shoot their profits dead."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"On PC, a dev can always deviate and host muliplayer for free because no one controls the platform.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Microsoft tried it with games for Windows live and got destroyed. PC gaming has been free for decaded. Someone who has been playing on pc for free since the 90's will never accept a paid subscription out of the blue. 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,Okay but you still pay that if you play on console. You just have to pay their console specific subscription as well. 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Yeah. But you don’t pay a subscription on top of that. You’d still have to pay for your internet service and a monthly/yearly subscription for your console of choice.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"If you had a console, it's not like you could play online console games without paying your ISP for internet.

Plus, you don't pay 65$ a month to some ""PC"" company that asks you money to play online with their ""PC"" device. You pay 65$ a month to an ISP that provides you with access to their infrastructure that literally physically connects your PC to trans/intercontinental cables."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"they are options to buy and play those games online. if you want to play any games online on a counsel now you have to pay. What you are paying is a BS fee. For subscriptions like Wow,  you are paying for their servers and updates, but even still you don't have to play those specific games, the vast majority you don't have to pay anything, on any system. M$ and Sony dug a canyon, built a bridge over it, and are now charging people to cross. now Nintendo is digging as well. Naturally they give out old ""Free"" games to try and blind you by how F'ed it is.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Yea cause the service is shit. The price was any higher it would be a failure

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,*Introducing GOG+*!
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"The beauty of it is that PC isn't restricted to a single game distribution platform. Buy a Playstation and you're stuck with PSN. Buy an XBox, and you're stuck with XBL. There is no other option.

Buy a PC, though, and you can use whatever the fuck you want to buy and download games. If Valve decides to start charging for their service, people would A) riot in the streets, and B) start using other services. Sure, I'd be upset that my Steam library is essentially *gone* unless I pay for a subscription, but I'm not so attached to my games that I would hold onto Steam if they pulled that shit. I'd find a different distributor, and you can be sure that they'd be giving out deals to transfer some or all of people's libraries over to *their* platform instead of Steam.

Basically, since PC is a free market, Steam won't be turning into a paid service. It would destroy them, especially now that other distributors have started elbowing their way into the market."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,GOG is amazing. They have like up to 90% sales everyday it's amazing.

Valve already makes way too much money, and they aren't a public company so they aren't slaves to earnings reports constantly looking for growth. If Valve were to ever make ANY kind of change, and this would only be if ISP's get way shittier than they already are, would be Valve only allowing a purchased game to be downloaded X times before charging some sort of fee to download it again. This would be if it started getting really expensive for them to upload the content."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,What about cloud saves? They could find something to make us pay
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Steam runs just as much infrastructure as xbox and sony.  Why do you think console games are always peer to peer servers?  They want to use MS’s matchmaking and run nothing themselves.  Dedicated servers are a large extra cost to run and maintain.

Matchmaking, friends, invites, voice chat, steam does all the exact same stuff but for free.  Paying a monthly fee to play online is patently absurd."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Mmmmmm..... I see what you're GOING for, but no. To make that comparison you'd have to say every game has a monthly subscription. As in, its 10/month to play witcher 3. 10/mo. to play call of duty. 10/mo. to play pac man, regardless of console or of single-player/multiplayer.

MMO monthly subscription is entirely different because you are paying for a game that is constantly adding new content. If anything you could liken the cost to a game having paid DLC that adds to the actual game itself beyond cosmetics."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Short answer- because it's the way it is.

More complex answer- It's complicated and I don't have all the information to be able to give you a fully satisfying answer, but I'll try. When the PC-tan thing started, it was on 4-chan. At the time, they were still a major place for anime and Japanese culture in the west, and that was reflected in how they tapped it for their own works. Along with that, Japan and the anime/manga industry likes to reimagine stuff as humans, with personalities and styles that sort of reflect their real counterparts. There's a popular anime right now about girls who are tanks, for example. PC-tan as a concept grew into that, with consoles being represented as anime characters (mostly girls), while PC-tan is a muscular male body, but otherwise is the generic white silhouette you'd expect from a starter drawing for a character. The idea is the console girls refer to him as PC-tan as a sort of cutesy honorific."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Not really relevant

The PC equivalent would be a fee to use Steams online servers. Or Origin. Or UPlay.

I doubt it will ever happen, because of the increased competition and PC gamers just having a bit more of a backbone, but it is entirely in the realm of our reality. 

If steam chose to do it my guess would be something like GOG would expand and try to have their own functioning network within a couple years to offer a free alternative "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Ya they would have to literally install malware, most likely a rootkit, and the very day they come out with this is the same day gamer-hackers work to bypass this unethical shit."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Actually, it can. If Ubisoft for example decided that you need to pay monthly in order to play online, there would be no other way to play basically. "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"> then keep paying blizzard for wow


Paying monthly for game development vs paying monthly for your hardware to be allowed online are two VERY different things."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,If they tried PC users would find a way to go around it and not pay a dime and create their own service for free. 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"I think a very small percentage of PC users actually play subscription based MMOs/games anymore. The moment I hear a game is subscription based (TOR, ESO), I know I'm not going to play it until their declining player-base forces it out of subscription play."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,I don't mind paying a yearly fee to play a game on a console as long as it works most of the time. It's mostly why I avoided PSN but last year or the year before had me questioning Xbox Live as well.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"My concern is that its going to significantly diminish an already small online player base, as most of the casual gamers (which is honestly Nintendo's niche IMHO) arent going to want to bother wasting money on the online subscription."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Thats fucking shitty. The company which sold you the console forces you to pay to play something that is supposed to be free while not having any expenses. Lets hope the switch doesnt require payment to play free games
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"That's not true. ""free to play"" games usually don't require paid online membership to play.

Edit: I'm only speaking of PS+ as I have no idea how it works on Xbox "

Gold was the one that didn’t offer free games until this generation."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"That makes sense to me, Do you want to pay for your own server space and offer it at your own rate or borrow ours but we will charge your player base for it?"

The first play through is golden, but then there's not much to do. 

Truth is that Hearthstone with their overpriced nontradeable card packs just sells better. It makes no sense from a business standpoint to spend time on something like Diablo. Maybe next thing we see is that D4 goes free to play with buyable rift keys or some stuff."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"To be fair, those are about as obscure as they come. However, those where more digital game rental services, and less core components of the medium. Nice call back though.

PC is much more flexible, but the skill floor is higher. On console's you're trading flexibility for accessibility."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Good idea! I'll just pop over to the friend store and buy some new friends.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,yes but I'm basically saying that if Steam does the xbox live crap like how PlayStation and nintendo did then I'm gonna give up on gaming

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"Yup. You're not wrong. I was just making a point.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"Yeah coz that’s because the indies tank the cost for you, not to mention a lot of them don’t use dedicated servers.

If you want something good, you should pay for it, simple as that. 

I really hate it when users keep complaining that there’s IAP when the game already tanks dedicated server costs. Or complain there’s no dedicated servers when there’s no subscription or payments of any kind post purchase.

Just TRY hosting a dedicated, perpetual Minecraft server by yourself... you would want the people playing to at least pay you something.... right? "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"Of course I do. You have free internet????

"
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,It doesn't prevent you from playing games. It prevents you from using an online server which is what you're paying for. Servers aren't free.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"I've seen a number of games on PC online for a STUPENDOUS amount of years,

all the way back to the original Quake (and Doom) multi-player mods...

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"You’re telling me I have to pay to play with people online in games like splatoon, arms and fortnite?
Why Nintendo, we thought you were better than this!!"
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,I was paying the subscription anyway for online play and apps and all the other stuff. Yeah it's kinda shitty to begin with but compared to before they are a complete bonus. To me they are free but i guess to someone entering the system it can be seen differently
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"That's not always the case. Plus first party servers come from those costs.

As for the rest, cloud backups and ""free"" games are a huge incentive that aren't provided to us otherwise. If it weren't for GwG or PS+ I wouldn't like half of the franchises I do. I see both sides of the argument, but I'm fine with paying if it nets me actual benefits like those I've listed."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Certainly. I only use steam for the store and that can easily be replaced.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Yeah, i'd only see them do something like, ""Pay x.xx to download your games at speeds faster than 10Mbps"" So those who can download faster get throttled, or pay the fee that the ISPs are gauging valve on in this made up but plausible scenario."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"But the point is with console you don't have much of a choice, you only have the available consoles. On PC of steam started charging money then everyone would flock to any other platform. Hell, on AAA games you could just purchase the game through the publisher and bypass steam all together so they probably wouldn't do it. "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Consoles can do it because you pay $450 to be locked to one store. The moment Steam charges me to use my internet connection like Xbox Live / Playstation Network does is the moment I change to one of the 20 other services. You can't charge PC for multiplayer because people will just change to a different service that isn't scamming you.

FWIW I don't own a Xbox, Playstation, or Switch because of the online stupid tax. I own a Wii U because that's free."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"They take a 20% from digital items, to match the 20% cut they get from retail sold physical copies. Steam takes a 30% cut to match retail and has been doing so before xbox/ps had proper digital marketplaces"
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Not really because $ony and Micro$oft like money but can't cast as broad of a net as $team

Any PC can run simple indie games or one of man F2P games and Valve always gets a sizable cut of anything on their platform, its a mix of publicity from being one the largest storefront and a mini social media platform with its profiles and chat system.  Other than making sure there's an active stream of data to download games there's very little else Steam needs to do to be functional, but their overall size and benefit to developers makes it so they don't need to do anything other than offer a standard cut.  Devs and players both win out."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Eh, I'll just get them back for free. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for DRM free, and I actually think that online games like WoW shouldn't be allowed to discontinue service without releasing server source code and patching the game to allow custom servers.

But I'm not really bothered by the possibility of Steam shutting down, I'd just get any of those games I wanted the same way I got them before I got my first job as a teenager."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,This is why piracy exists. It's not stealing if you already paid for it
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,until the pirates come along and make cracked versions of the dll files and other things that slave your steam games to the steam client.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Maintenance and bandwidth. Even when the games aren't being hosted on their servers, which they sometimes are, they're still providing a central network that it all connects to for patches, messaging, voice, party, invites, etc. Steam does similar things, but the difference is that they're not forced to, PC games don't rely on Steam for any of these services."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"I mean they also give you games every month and store discounts, plus it does cost money to maintain servers"
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Server maintenance? 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Is that a real question? The answer is that you're paying for the game servers.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,$60 a year for 48 games + a real smooth online experience definitely makes it worth in my book. Can't say much for competitors tbh.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,MS also does cloud saves for free
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"I mean, they only released a system that had like a 50% failure rate. And I honestly blame Halo for the rise of DLC. That was honestly the first game I saw of a mass amount of people willing to buy map packs every few months. Like at the time, I thought that was insane but clearly people were willing to pay. But that's another story. 

Also at least the security risk made Sony come up with PS+ to appease the fans. Free game, then cloud saving, multiple console psn sharing, lot of good came from it. "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Except for that whole data breach thing and knocking the service out for weeks.  
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Close, -chan is feminine and -kun is masculine. ""tan"" is a more affectionate variant of ""chan"". It evokes a small child's mispronunciation of 'chan'– similar to how, for example, a speaker of English might use ""widdle"" instead of ""little"" when speaking to a baby. 'Tan' is also popular for commercial anthropomorphisms like Habanero-tan, Afghanis-tan, or the [OS-tans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-tan) representing operating systems."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"It’s not usually used for boys, though I don’t think it’s... against the rules or anything.

Most commonly, casually, by adults, you might use tan to refer to someone really moe, or cute, like an anime character you’d idolize for being adorable. “Your name here”-tan. My understanding isn’t too solid either, though. "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Probably not used as accurately as it should be but it does effectively personify ""PC"" as a more human character rather than just an inanimate object with thoughts"
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Outside of Valve games, Steam doesn't host multiplayer games, so you wouldn't be paying them for anything other than using their friends list and community hubs anyway."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Indeed as much as i love steam if they switched to a paid service i'd drop them for gog in a heart beat and i wouldnt have to worry about aud to usd conversion rates and my 1$ would be worth 1$ instead of 60c.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Steam doesn't have that sort of leverage.  Wanna charge me to use Steam?  Ok, I'll just play my games straight from the source and take out the middle man."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"They kind of are charging you, though passively. They take their percentage of every sale for every game on their platform. Game companies, in return, will adjust the cost of their goods to cover the cost of Steam's stake in their sales. "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Come on now, it's not like the expansions are free."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"You also get more than the cost of your subscription in free games. You also are paying for the cloud and servers, which are more robust with features than steam. 

PC is only unlikely to follow suit because there will always be workarounds because of the nature of the machine being more open. Which is a point in PC’s favor but I’d guess most non-pc gamers don’t really care about it just like most apple users don’t really care about less customization than android"
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"In my experience, Xbox has been pretty good since the horrible winter ddos period. That was shitty."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"PSN is actually pretty stable. At least for me in my area.

Normally back to normal around 1PM for me. If that's the issue, Ill live. "

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"The online component can be the difference between 30 hours spent on a game and 60 hours spent on a game for me. Mario Kart 8 is fun, but it is much more fun against people online, who are significantly more challenging to compete with. "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"As someone who is into competitive smash (melee and 4) I would love to pay $20 a year for a very solid online gameply. Netplay is meh, and Wii U Smash online is such hot fucking garbage...

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"It probably will be. If you look at the eShop page for Splatoon, MK, ARMS etc., they all say that you’ll need to subscribe to the online service once it launches. 

But free online games like Fortnite, AoV and Warframe don’t say that, so I’m guessing we’ll be able to play them for free."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Yeah if it was like that dude i wouldnt even bother to buy online
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,only microsoft does this. Sony lets you play FTP games without PS+.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Exactly that reason. People will fork over $20 for a year of time without a second thought, because it's not a lot of money. And lucky for Nintendo, not a lot of money turns into a fuck-load of money when millions of people all buy in."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,even if the shit was a 1 dollar a year it will add up cumulatively because everyone with online will buy it so their making a dollar every player.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"What also hasnt been said yet is they are generating demand. If a bunch of people buy it when its cheap, more people may be likely to continue buying as the price increases over time and they add new features and expand their catalog of games. Or just increase price and no features it is nintendo afterall. "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"You’re comparing to base ps4 though which is $299 and constantly has sales down to 249 and even 199. A better comparison would be XBX or PS4 pro. 

1440p is usually the bare minimum for the ps4 pro games I’ve played. Many go up higher, like the upcoming Spider-Man. Playstation flash sales have been comparable and even sometimes cheaper than steam sales the past few years. It seems like you’re giving him outdated information. The $60 a year does really add up if you aren’t interested in the free games though.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,At least with MMOs you’re paying for that game. With Xbox live/PSN and whatever you’re paying the console manufacturer to use game servers where the game developers are willing to let you use the servers for free
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Yeah, PC games typically just connect to servers run by the game companies. I am not sure how exactly it works for consoles, but if the consoles are just using the console networks to find the servers hosted by the game companies, then there is no reason for them to charge for it. Servers that just point consoles to other IP addresses are useless; each game could just use DNS."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Yeah bandwidth and maintenance and such cost money, but those costs are included in the cost of the game itself.

Like, if I pay $70 for a copy of ""whateverthefuck 4: rise of the revenge of war combat: origins: remastered: definitive edition"" then that $70 is *supposed* to include the cost of EVERYTHING related to that game. So if that game has online multiplayer, you already PAID for the costs of maintaining the servers when you *bought the game.* 

As for the ""central network that it all connects to"" that would be the internet, and the console manufacturer most definitely is not the one providing that."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,">Even when the games aren't being hosted on their servers, which they sometimes are, they're still providing a central network that it all connects to for patches, messaging, voice, party, invites, etc. 

> the difference is that they're not forced to, PC games don't rely on Steam for any of these services

Nintendo doesn't provide pretty much any of those services though. It doesn't have a party system, messaging, it has a shitty friend invite system and the voice chat system is provided via a mobike phone app which you have to use separately from the console. Steam's infrastructure is better by orders of magnitude. "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Steam also gets a portion of all game sales on its platform AFAIK. 

Since we pay the same price its more of a loss on the developers end. However the exposure you get from selling on steam likely outweighs the cost savings of distributing it yourself."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Yeah, I was not happy about having to pay for PS+, especially since I only have one friend who I play online with often (I'm not a huge fan of multiplayer games but she is) but I think I've actually saved so much money from the free games and the discounts I've gotten from my subscription."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,PS+ is 6 games a month and online has been smooth since Ps4 came out (except around christmas that first year)
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Yeah I agree, PSN as a service just isn't worth paying for to me, so I just stick to single player games on my ps4. I might end up paying for Nintendo's service since it's so cheap, but it also doesn't seem like it's worth it. If they fix their online service and add good incentives (like the virtual console but with a decent selection) then I'll be on board but until then, eh. Smash Ultimate might make me consider it in December but beyond that I don't see the point "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,Guess where they got the idea to hand out “free games” every month with a subscription?
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"> That was honestly the first game I saw of a mass amount of people willing to buy map packs every few months

Halo 2 had like 4 map packs total, lets not exaggerate here. Some of them were even free. It was the most played game online at the time and nothing else compared so of course they were going to add more content. All of the map packs became free after some time too. Halo 3 also only had 4 map packs. 

I hate that its become cool to shit on xbox these days, its annoying and only further perpetuates the gaming circle jerk stereotype. "

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"You see, Microsoft are sneaky about this one.

Currently, If you buy a game but don't have an xbox live subscription, you can play any offline content it gives you.

If you get a ""free game"" through games with gold, you have to have an active subscription just to load that game up, let alone play the offline content. It makes sense, but many people think these games are free to own, forever, no matter what, but they aren't. 


Going back to the friends section bit, I'm pretty sure they allowed you to send messages to people and do voice chat one on one, but you needed gold to be able to join parties. Now, AFAIK you can join parties without an active subscription, but are limited to games that you legitimately paid for. "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Meh, I just subscribe to Humble Monthly for that stuff. Same effect, basically, but nothing is taken away from me if I decide to stop paying.

Besides, those games aren't ""free"" if you have to pay a subscription fee for them. It's not some extra thing, it's part of what you're paying for to begin with, especially considering that you lose access to those ""free"" games if you're not paying the subscription fee anymore."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Why are you contradicting yourself? As you said yourself they are only there to provide a platform. There is nothing stopping you or the devs from just ignoring Steam. It isn't required at all.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"What got mmos to start dying was more or less the mixed cost model, not people complaining about having to pay for games. Wanna play? well you gotta buy the base game first, then any expansions if you wanna play those, then you gotta pay your monthly fee, and even then some games have an in game shop where you can spend even MORE on stuff that may or may not be pay to win.

So far MMO games that are being successful (besides outliers like FFXIV and WoW which both still have millions of subscribers due to the fact that they're VERY AAA and can afford to demand that players pay for the expansions as well as the base game and monthly subscription [though in wow's case they now make it so you only have to buy the newest most relevant expansion if you're new]) do so on one of three pay models:

Either you pay for the game and pay for the subscription, you pay for just the game and subscription is purely optional, or the game is free to play and has an in game shop that may or may not be P2W.

The reason these 3 succeed is because they each happen to cater two the three types of gamers (in business terms at least): The gamer with money and time but no skill will pay for the game and the subscription because they can afford it and they enjoy it. the gamer with skill and time but no money will pay for the game that is buy once play forever. the gamer with money and skill but no time will play the free to play game with the p2w shop because they can pay to progress."

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Sony or MS arent the ones maintaining the servers though; the company that made the game is.

If you play GTA Online on a PS4, youre not connecting to Sony servers; youre connecting to RockStar Games Servers. Sony has no costs whatsoever involved with you using any online multiplayer. That is, of course, until they FABRICATE a cost.

Think of it like this: You buy a basketball, and play with it on your own at your house. The Basketball is NBA2K18, your house is your PS4, and playing with it at home is single player.

Then, you decide you wanna play with other people, so you get on the road and drive down to the local playground, where you can play a pickup game with other people. The road is the internet, the local playground is the 2kSports server, and the pickup game is multiplayer.

Notice how, at no point, did Sony incur ANY costs with you playing  multiplayer. The playground (server)is maintained by 2K using the money you paid for your copy of the game, the roads (internet) are maintained by your ISP using the money you pay for you internet subscription and you already paid for your house (PS4) with its driveway to connect to the road (Ethernet port/wireless connection) when you BOUGHT the system.


Sony decides they wanna make an easy buck, and so they say that you need to pay THEM every month in order to use the driveway you ***already paid for***, so they add a big iron gate and toll booth at the end of your driveway, making it impossible for you to connect to the road and get to the playground, unless you pay Sony a monthly fee.

When you ask why you should have to pay Sony a monthly fee to get past the toll booth when the road is run by verizon and the playground is run by 2k, they say

""well, we have to recoup our costs related to you connecting to the road!""

""WHAT costs?""

""The cost of building and maintaining this toll booth to prevent you from connecting to the road unless you pay a monthly fee!"""

I shouldn't have to pay monthly to play Monster Hunter, a game Microsoft has *nothing* to do with and yet wants shakedown money for. I would argue that by taking a 30% cut from the store I purchased it from they have made 30x profit from the initial purchase alone -- anything more is a scam."

That's half true. If you download an Xbox one games with gold game, then yes, if your subscription runs out you won't be able to play until you renew. With the Xbox 360 games though you can play them with or without Xbox live as long as you download the games while your still subscribed to Xbox live (I know that its true playing 360 games on the Xbox one I'm not sure if its true playing 360 games on the 360)

Eventually, yes.

For paying the $15/month you get to play up to level 100. If you want to play level 101-110 (and the level appropriate content) you will need to buy the current expansion (Battle for Azeroth). 

&#x200B;

In all honesty if you have never played it before you can probably go a long time without buying the expansion as there is tons of existing content you already have access to. Eventually though you and your friends will probably want to do current content, raids, etc which will require the latest expansion. "

Expansions also are pretty much required if you want to play with anyone you find in game.  Not being able to do the new content when the new content is available makes playing the game a pain in the as (talking from experience )

And again, the big thing is once you stop paying for the subscription you lose access to the majority of your account.  You can still play a level 20, but you can't do anything you were doing.

but just the fact that my theoretical $25 was paid for an annual service they charge $5 for and only used twice is quite the profit. they'd have theoretically collected 500% their annual fee for just about 15 minutes of my usage.

There are plenty of example of games that don't charge subscription. It's a simple fact that Sony, Microsoft, and soon Nintendo only charge people to play games online because they know they can get away with it.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,">I'm not referring to the servers hosting the games, it's the infrastructure supporting patches, parties, messaging, invites, etc.

Yes, and that infrastructure is called ""The internet"" and is not in any way shape or form paid for or maintained by the console manufacturer.

Even if the console maker needs servers of their own for middleman stuff, they dont have any business charging extra for it. That middleman stuff is, by and large, totally unnecessary, and even in cases where it IS actually necessary, they would have to include the cost of it in the purchase price of the console.

Imagine if they didnt include the cost of the POWER CORD in the purchase price of the console and tried to charge you a monthly fee for it.

Does that sound absurd to you? Because its literally no different than what they currently do with XBL and PS+ and such. They charge you monthly for basic functionality that should have been included in the purchase price.

You dont charge someone $20k for a new car and then charge them extra every month for whatever software monitors the engine and lets you know when its time for an oil change; thats PART OF THE CAR and needs to be included in the purchase price.

If $20k isnt enough for you to make a profit on the car without charging an additional monthly subscription fee, then you charge more for the car itself and leave it at that."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Valve seems to handle that just fine while taking a similar cut as sony and ms, without charging a subscription fee. Not to mention basically everything except online play is available to people that don't pay the fee.

edit: also forgot it's purely digital distribution, no physical copy option so they're also covering the bandwidth to download the game as many times as you want for every single user."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"But there's only because ms and Sony insist, the game manufacturers are capable of gong this themselves, that's how pc games work. The console manufacturers manufactured costs so they could charge a fee.

What I've never understood is why gamers didn't just say f u and but a pc instead?"
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,I would own a console if the multiplayer was free. If I play it once a month I'm paying $5 every time I boot it up. It's a complete joke and not worth it when you already own a PC.
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Ah okay that's neat. Thanks for the info! 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Good to know. Thanks!
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"you've got that wrong dude. 101-110 is legion content. 111-120 is BfA. And yeah, a fresh account, especially one new to MMO games, is gonna take probably a couple weeks of playing a few hours a day to max out at 110 simply because 1. they don't have heirlooms, 2. they're not used to the classes they play, and 3. they're going to explore EVERYTHING."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,"I know an entire guild that goes to a new server, makes new characters with no heirlooms, levels to 60 then does all the raids BY TIER after locking xp, then they repeat that for tbc content, wotlk content, cata content, and so on and so forth, but they do it as a side thing. They're for the most part still raiding current content when that happens. spending time on legacy content is purely something for people who are already caught up with current content for sure."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Destiny 2 isn't anywhere as large or sprawling as WoW. I would never pay a subscription fee for that game.

Guild Wars 2 is good, but IIRC you need to buy each expansion still, rather than just the newest.

That all said, it's still a good point. People will probably try to say that it's because Blizzard doesn't have AS MANY microtransactions as GW2 or D2?"
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,The games are not really comparable as WoW is *much* larger than both of those. 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,Fair point. All depends on the importance of certain areas of pvp for the user. 
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"I mean you totally can, but it requires some really cheap tactics."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"Every expansion but the latest one is free, you just need to cough up the 15 for the month."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"I’m talking solely about the expansions being paid-for, not about the monthly fee. "
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,You already are.

9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,"They do it so it's consistent across all games. For example, if you're using steam and a game doesn't use steamworks for friends and invites, you won't be able to join a party with them and invite them to your game, etc.

The reasons a person might choose a console over a PC are obvious, I'm not going to get into that here. And I say that as someone who plays 90% of their games on PC."
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-05,right
9cwl5r,2018-09-04,2018-09-04,True. And you could still do battlegrounds type stuff i assume.

No one programmed them in.

The point is they just tried to make them able to do more tasks on their own including stuff like improvisation and prioritization. Most of the actual behavior is supposed to be emergent given (relatively) simple rules. 

Whether it's likely that emotions could happen unexpectedly like this is another question, but it's arguably as likely as a world that developed humanoid robots like this in the first place.

Really, if emotions were programmed in it would sort of ruin the premise. Kara would be more malfunctioning machine than living being."

I was very into the first act of Fahrenheit as well, I heard a lot of good stuff about this game so i was very nervous about every evidence I left on the crime scene, about every awkward thing a said to the cop, I thought that this gonna have many consequences later on,... yeah...... more like fuck all. Menu music was very nice tho."
3qgudp,2015-10-27,2015-10-28,"Nice. I see. OK cherish your hype if you want as I see every one on this thread want it. 
Thanks for your downvotes. Reddit culture at it best."
3qgudp,2015-10-27,2015-10-28,Yes i agree with you. I didn't said that this game will be bad. I just ask people to be more cautious and don't judge game basing on prerendered video trailer.
3qgudp,2015-10-27,2015-10-29,You're going on about how you can't judge the looks of the game from this trailer when this trailer given the context of who is making the game and the fact that it specifically says in-engine is almost 100% exactly how it will look.
3qgudp,2015-10-27,2015-10-28,"This being a Quantic Dream game though, the trailer was likely rendered on a ps4, meaning that the game will look pretty much like the trailer.

That being said, I haven't enjoyed QDs previous games all that much, gameplay wise, but have always thought that they were standout games in terms of graphics and technical achievement. 

Despite the drastic increase in quality, I'm still only as mind blown as I was the first time I seen Heavy Rain all those years ago. "
3qgudp,2015-10-27,2015-10-29,"Of course. No problem this pre rendered  video is 100% representative to the final product that we know next to nothing about because they say it in-engine. Game studio making it is flawless and gods among man. And I'm just trolling you here because I'm that evil and stupid but your pure passion toward this game disarmed and defeated me.

And while we figured all that out. I presume we should end our conversation here."

I wasn't rushing to play it again or anything, I just felt fulfilled having played it.  It has some surprisingly heartfelt moments for only consisting of a cat and robots.  For example, when you finally make it up into the tower where you can open the roof, and all the robots there are just robots still.  Divorced from the influence of human culture and language, they remained un-evolved.  There's hope for them, however, in that what you do there means they can join the other robots and start to learn as well.

There is no happy ending for the characters you encounter or play as. There is no way out of the situation other than death, and even that is denied in a lot of cases.

Contrast with games like Scorn or Agony, where you get the distinct sense that the character you play as deserves the situation they're in. In SOMA, no one deserves the horrific situations they're put in."

Currently playing Rogue Trader.  Owlcat RPGs are a lot of things, but there's one thing that they nail more so than 99% of other RPGs:  Your choices DRAMATICALLY shift how the game presents itself.  Sick of how you can't be evil?  How about becoming a Lich, converting the populous to your Undying army as your allies are creeped out by the new look.  Maybe a demonic Plague Bringer that would make father nurgle blush?  

Is a particular ally kind of annoying to you?  Sacrifice them to the inquisition!  You may even get a boon!  There's a lot of technical problems.  There's a few pacing issues.  No they can't be as cinematic as Baldurs gate.  But by God does Owlcat give you the keys for how the world sees YOU.  If you're evil, you have different allies than a good playthrough.  You can be so evil that the lawful evil guys want to put you down for the greater good!  The choices are immense and varied.  Can't gush about them enough."

I grew up playing the series from 8 years old and I had been graduated from college and working for about a year when the game came out so it was very much an end of an era in some ways for me. So much pay off for the characters as well. Spoilers ahead: 

>! Aqua being rescued from the Realm of Darkness, but thinking that Destiny Islands had fell to the Realm of Darkness because she had been there for so long that she didn't realize she would ever escape back to the Realm of Light.!<

>! Ventus finally waking up and pushing back Vanitas. !<

 >! The Dark Guardian ripping the bandages off its mouth and revealing itself to be Terra and then saving Aqua and Ven from Terranort. !<

>! Everyone remembering Xion and then Roxas returning and both of them reuniting with Axel. And getting to share Sea Salt Ice Cream on the clock tower again. !<

>! Donald and Goofy joining Sora for the final battle even though he said it was his responsibility. They weren't gonna let him do it alone. All for one and one for all! !<

>! Ansem, Seeker of Darkness' death speech. ""There is more to seek. So now go forth and seek it."" !<

>! Riku Replica returning to help defeat his darker self and telling the real Riku to take care of Namine. And then finally Namine's return. !<

>! And then the absolute hype of Mickey casting Ultima, Donald casting Zettaflare (and dying before Sora rewinds time), Yen Sid coming down in flash of light and parting the sea of Heartless like fucking Moses, and Sora being revived in the final battle by Donald and Goofy telling him to not give up through the PS4's controller's speaker. Xigbar being revealed to be Luxu was also nuts for the future of the series and finally Yozora at the end of the game in the secret movie at the end. !<"

It was the first game that I got genuinely sucked into role-playing a type of character. I played a high INT/Science character who hated his dad for abandoning him and wanted to do anything to surpass him. I went around visiting all the places, trying to one up him and poured what must have been 100+ hours into the game before doing the ending. I saw my dad die to radiation in the reactor, so I'd find a way around that. I finally came up with the solution as i found a companion who was immune to the radiation. One up my dad one final time and do what he couldn't. 

So needless to say, I was so incredibly pissed off by the fact that Fawkes couldn't originally be sent into the reactor. 

I know they changed it with the DLC, but I never even bothered to go back and play it after that."

I decided I wanted legendary (completing all 8 class stories) and I still didn't achieve this until around the start of COVID. I would bounce between different classes too, usually progressing 2 or 3 at a time, and would do more than just the class stories on each one. I would also come and go from the game itself, sometimes going weeks or months without logging on. 

All this means that some classes took me literally years to complete. I went through the most important and formative years of my life in that time. So it wasn't just the stories and the characters of each class, it was my real life memories attached to each of them too. Major/reoccurring characters do this the best, as there are memories from the past decade connected to them. Certain sounds, scenes, quotes, music, etc, spontaneously sends a wild wave of nostalgia through me. Phenomenal game"

The whole theme of free will vs. control really sticks with you, and yeah, sometimes the weight of a bad ending hits harder because it feels like you could have done something differently.

For me, The Last of Us definitely left an emotional mark. I still think about it years later, especially the ending. The complexity of Joel’s choice at the end, and the way the game explores love, loss, and moral ambiguity, really stuck with me. The story doesn’t offer easy answers, which is why it stays with you long after the credits roll. It’s a story that challenges your emotions, making you question what you’d do in similar situations."

Probs the bedt game plot ever made with their take on the great filter a subject is cosomology “where is everyone” meaning the universe is old enough the sky should be full of signs of life. Mass Effect a machine intelligence that leave their technology for older races to find so they advance on their terms and when that Cycle builds AI the seed of Government the aliens that maintain it send a signal to wake up the reapers and they clean the galaxy clean of advance races and leave the primitive ones behind for the cycle to happen again in 50-100k years. People cried about the mass effect ending but it was brilliant the reapers didn’t interfere with the building of the crusable as that was a test to see of millennia of cycles if life one day would over come the need to be protected from what organic life gas done throughout history and build AI and in turn the AI turns on their creators. Another game I thought was anazing was Horizon Zero Dawn I played all these on day 1 of release and thought Horizon was on a alien planet or something else not the plot the took and fge zero dawn project just a shame they cheaped out on the unanswered question of the first game in the 2nd. 

As I sais I played Mass Effect on day 1 on the systems they came out and dlc so had to wait years and transferred my charcter from ine game to the next so it took 3 games 6 dlcs anx maybe 200 hrs to get the plot and story of it. And the suicide mission on insanity in ME2 what a game 👌 and the bad guy Harbinger 😂 “taking control” then a collector morphs into a roid colkector with a barrier Armour and hp bar 😂"

I couldn't accurately explain the story without studying it beforehand.

In the end I didn't enjoy the emotions it put me through, and that frustrates me because I love the setting and the characters so much.  Ugh."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Witcher 3 especially blood and wine expansion
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"I often listen to the Witcher soundtrack to get me back there.

Especially the kaer morhen theme and the romance theme"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"Exactly those for me as well, first two to pop in my head. I'd also add BG3 to the list :)"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"I never played ME3 and I got Legendary Edition recently, man those games are so good. I'm 25 hours in, just got to the part where you're grounded at the citadel. I can't wait to play through the whole series."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,I was so immersed with the Bloody Baron.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"I REALLY want to get hooked by witcher 3, I have failed miserably 3 times just after the owl bear boss."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"The first one especially. A buddy and I debated the ending until I told him we were playing Joel's story, not an RPG like Fallout."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,Specifically tlou 2 for me. That game had me sobbing. There’s no winner and everyone’s a bad guy.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"The first one is a good story and one that you will be recalling for weeks.

But the second game, man… it’s soul crushing"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,The game shouldnt be replayable but i went through it 4 times
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"Seriously made me reconsider whether I'm going down the route of alcoholism. 

For context: I was working at a night club as a sound guy, and basically had free drink the whole night without any checks or limits. Used to get pissed 5/7 days a week, for about 6 years. 

After playing DE, even before I'd finished, I saw _a lot_ of myself in Harry (even though I probably wasn't close to that), and it made me look at alcohol in a completely different light."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Way too far down here
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,im going to give this game a second chance.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,I'm still thinking about abstract daddy
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Had to scroll way way down for this one
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,I think i’ve purchased this on every Playstation console since ps2 and my nintendo switch just to relive that haunting feeling every few years. Gotta be honest though. I only finished ffx-2 once
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,I still think this is one of my favorite games of all time and one of the few times I have played and rpg over and over again. Truly a breath taking experience especially when it came out.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"The major twist in the middle of the story…you know the one I’m talking about….had me audibly gasping. Hoping it wasn’t the end. I thought I messed up with the choices I made. And when it was all revealed, I couldn’t help but clap."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,Felt the same with both 4 and 5. Man I finished both games more than twice alrrady.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"I just finished persona 3 and I was moved a lot more than 5.

Granted it was my first persona and I struggled a bit with the links mechanics.

I missed the entire dlc because I had no idea I had to max a certain relationship to access it."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Ohh yeah and then after I watched Cyberpunk Edgerunners I found myself thinking about the game even more so.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"When the song ""that's the way it is"" starts playing... the chills..."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,I couldn’t finish RDR2 after realizing what would happen in the end. :/ 
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-12,Aurthur's end made me look at mortality in a a new and personal way. The epilogue healed the pain of it.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-12,Does the man looking for his friend Gavin ever get closure?
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,I wish so hard i could like rdr2. Everyone else loves the game. I'm stuck on a mission where I have to steal an oil wagon or some shit and cannot do it. I get killed every time I try. I've tried it from every angle and I have followed every guide for the mission. I was on the fence about the game before that so I gave up a few years ago. I want to like it. So. Bad.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"I played through The Dig again this year, and it seriously holds up. One of the best classic point and clicks"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Would have been nice with Unreal 5 engine..i read that it was suposed to be a movie by Spielberg but costed to much and became a game..if its true i see what all the good gaming story came from.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,Almost done watching Scavengers Reign on Max; it has some serious Dig vibes.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,The dig was a good game
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-12,"LucasArts had some of the best point and click games ever created, you are not wrong. The Dig was amazing Sci-Fi"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"Im in the middle of Soma, and the story is fucking bonkers. I keep hearing the end is crushing, but I don't know why yet... but this game lives in my head rent free already because of the story it's telling."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"SOMA crushed my soul at the end. I knew it was coming because they kinda tell you while playing, but it still hit hard."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"Was looking for this comment. No other game has stuck with me as much as this one. I still periodically think about it and keep changing my mind on what the right choices are.

I keep looking for more videos analysing it on YouTube as well just to hear other people think about it."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"This and nier replica.

I really really dislike the hack n slash type of gameplay, it's probably my least favorite type of combat by quite a margin.

But the atmosphere, the music, the story and characters, it's all so hauntingly beautiful. 

Very very sad but with sparkles of hope that hit you deep.

It might not be my favourite games ever, but none has impacted me in such a particular way."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"Automata undoubtedly lives rent free inside my mind since Aug 2020 until now. The End of Data concert changed my entire mind about Replicant, and the anime changed my entire mind about A2. Perfect."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"Couldn’t agree more. 

So many moments in that game. It hits hard"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,Cyberpunk 2077 glowup needs to be studied
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,I think Teal’C voicing Kratos made me more invested and immersed. Such an awesome game.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"I actually agree with you on this, I thought 2018 was just so well done that even if they deliver a game on that level again whether in detail, story, fun, etc. I would still like 2018 over it, and that I did, Ragnarok is extremely well made, amazing story, better in my books than 2018, but 2018 just had this feel to it that I can't explain tbh."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"As someone with an emotionally closed off father, second this one!!"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"came to say the same. deep game. 
And the only game with a true biological savegame."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"This. It's been a while since I finished it, but it was a profound experience. Rare that a video game is also a piece of art."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,This is the one game that’s stuck with me for a long time after I finished it
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"This game lives in your head during your playthrough and afterwards. There's an insane amount of space for reflection and theorising - and since it's kind of a sandbox-style game, there's even room for experimentation to answer some of your theories, if you get creative enough. Not to mention the philosophical ideas that OW discusses, it's a really fascinating piece."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,This is one of the only games I’ve played that I thought about near constantly while I wasn’t playing (before I finished) and then have continued to think about periodically ever since.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"It is very special, scary, super funny at times.

The atmosphere is immaculate, all the influences, from stephen king to Lovecraft and twin peaks combine in a beautiful,  strange and fascinating game."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Still praying for it to release on Steam at some point
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,This game made me bawl my eyes out.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,Great game
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,Man those games crushed me so bad. Havent started the new one yet but cant wait to be emotionally destroyed again.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,There it is.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"I still remember Finding Paradise, havent finished To the moon yet"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,“Keep that hair short” 😢
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,I was kinda expecting this one to be at the very top.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,This is way too fucking far down
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Absolutely! My favorite was Lewis' story. Still makes me sad. What's yours?
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Jesus man it's tragic. Didn't realise the title was basically literal until the end.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,The Zero Dawn story was great. Easily my favorite.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"That ending goes so fuggin hard.
 “You have no honor!” 
“And you are a slave to it!”"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Oof..it was so emotional and made me feel every attack and parry.  Masterful and full of honor
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,LIS for sure
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"Give us the child and wipe away the debt.
It's been awhile since I played but I remember those twins so vividly"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,That story was something else
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"The ending, to me, was shocking... But I figured out half of the true ending early based on a cheatable early ending method (a ""bad"" ending). Still, kind of dreadful..."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"I need to play that again at some point, got the bad ending first time around."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,I really hope you mean in like disappointing anger bc the story of pt2 was atrociously ass and not worth being a sequel to pt 1
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Kiryu meeting majima song still doesnt get out of my head
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"That’s the only one I’ve completed so far. I’m playing them all in numerical order so I’m on Kiwami 1 now. Still early on, like chapter 3 or 4. I’m loving it so far, excited for the journey"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,So excited for DS2. Considering buying a PS5 just so I don’t have to wait for a PC release.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,That game has been a mood since the Gameboy inception. I had Link's Awakening DX on Gameboy color and that game was always like a melancholy dream... Loved the friendship Link had with Marin.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Same. Such a good game.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"When you do play Psychonauts 2, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. 


It's a very different game, but a great one. "
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"in my playthrough of walking dead i backed Kenny on everything, helped him and his family. even put Duck out of his misery so he didn't have to..... still turns into an asshole towards ya"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"even after a thousand hours in bg3, hearing Down By The River as the end credits begin always gives me that ""wow, what a journey"" feeling"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-12,Finished my first play through this year. Everything really sticks with you because you created your Shepard and choices matter.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"There is no Owlbear in Witcher 3, I think you're talking about Baldurs Gate 3."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,It's just not for everyone. One paper it should be a game I like but I've never been able to get into it.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"I just wish they would fix the way you move. You press the w key or ease on a joystick and geralt goes 0-100 INSTANTLY. It feels so awkward and I couldn’t get past it, so I gave up."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,I played them back to back in a month or two. I had such a gaming hangover from them.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,I've done the morality and communist runs. Ultraliberal maybe in a year or two. But might not ever be able to make myself do the fourth one.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,You see it too? For me it's always like this.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"X-2 is only worth doing to get the perfect ending, in which case it’s also a slog. But it’s still worth doing. The original is perfection though."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"That was great, especially when they were unwrapping everything from before that you were not realizing when you played through it."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"I have 3 on my wishlist, but I need to finish 4 golden first and am waiting on a sale. Also I was a bit exhausted at the end of 5 from the combat ( although that is the case with most Rpgs for me, stopped Wotr in Chaper 4 becsuse it was really tedious )."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"I was the exact opposite. I’ve only played Persona 5 and Persona 3, but I just didn’t feel very invested in the characters or story for 3 like I did for 5."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"Is it worth to play from persona 1 to 5? Or if i start with 3,it doesn't rlly matter?"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,Same is was specifically edgerunners that multiplied the feeling the ending of cyberpunk had.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"It's a shame, it is a beautiful and impactful ending, and the epilogue has a ton of content."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"It's funny you say that, because if it weren't for that ending the game wouldn't have stayed in my thoughts ever since.

Arthur's characterization, his story arc, his voice acting, his suffering and the catharsis of him being avenged is what makes RDR2's story so great, despite it being a retread of the similar themes in the game that came out before it, it achieved greatness unique to itself."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Skill issue. Rdr2 even though it's missons are very good most are still extremely easy. I don't understand how you couldn't steal a simple oil wagon lol.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,You can actually do a different mission and the guys at the camp will get the wagon instead. You don't have to do it
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"Point and click got out of the scene because nowadays is possible to deliver the same immersion and storytelling with deeper mechanics.

However, good storytelling and good background is absolutely dime in a million. Especially now that everything is a remake.

The Dig was all questions. So awesome."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"Yes, actually is better that it is not a movie, since it can be developed further, but Spielberg was involved and it shows"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,I still think about it years later
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"The gameplay, story and characters were always good. Just at release the game was running like an engine with glue for oil.

Now that it has been optimised, people can actually get lost in the game and not reboot the game every 5 minutes"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,What’s a biological savegame?
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"""Clementine will remember that"""
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"Yeah me too, I was surprised when i couldn't find another Undertale mention."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Can only remember *Bath Time*…
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,The coronation scene
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Lewis and Gregory were the 2 that stuck with me the most
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,Agreed.  So good
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,Wait what!? Theres multiple endings or did i get wooshed?
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,No. I didnt mean that
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"You know people are downvoting you hard but I tend to agree with this take tbh, TLOU 1 just had this special feeling to it that made me want to dive deeper into the game every time I played it. 2 just fell flat after a certain point in the game tbh. But it's still a damn good game I will say."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"Always liked part 2 more than part 1, not even close in my book."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"Honestly the game changed my life in a big way, and helped me through some hard times. It also really changed my perception of storytelling through video games, and has influenced me as a writer."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,I doubt they are mixing the two. I know exactly what they're referring to. The first beast you must hunt. I have played it like 3 times and I lose interest quickly after that.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"The whole cast is different every game.

There's are a few recurring characters but it's not really relevant, since the PC doesn't know them.

The whole game is about the relationships you build during your playtime."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-12,I finished the game and then found out there was 4 hours of more game. I did not expect that.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"Yeah, I just jump in the wagon and haul ass.  Never had an issue."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,Oh. I know.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,Oh. Well that helps! Honestly if I just sat down and played it more I would do better. I'll give it a try one of these days
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"You should pay Wadjet Eye adventure games, very immersive modern point and click games"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"I'm assuming they mean that once you play it the first time, you can't experience it again. The game strives on you learning information in an organic way to figure out what to do. Once you already know what to do, the game isn't as appealing and doesn't offer much beyond that. That's what I assume they mean by organic save, the game is ""saved"" in your head, but you can't load it back unless you have amnesia, and as such you only get to experience it once."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,There's no progress to save. Just what you've learned and what you remember.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"Idc about downvotes, I got like 13k from an old ask reddit thread about Ryan Reynolds best role. The game play is better in 2 but I felt like I wasted the last time I got birthday money on pt2 cause I was an absolute fan of the first game and for that I will always say the sequel sucks story wise"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-10,"Nope, not single story plotline from 2 is done as well as any from pt1. Gameplaywise, 2 has improvements. The time the  game came out was one of the last times I got money for my birthday and I felt it was a total waste of it. Should've got ghost of tsushima instead"
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,The.. Griffin?
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-13,Right the griffin beast yeah.
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"Yeah.. some people don't remember the beast as vividly as others? I don't know what to tell you, ""Owlbear"" sounded similar enough.

If that is fodder for me being downvoted, then this is truly a Reddit moment."
1go94mn,2024-11-10,2024-11-11,"Lol I don't know about downvoting, but really

I mean, really sir/madam, what kind of monster hunter would you be not knowing the difference

Tsk tsk

(Not being serious if that's not clear)"
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,Do you hear the robots sing-...
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,"Definitely not the first time an old story has been retold for a new medium.
 
The lion king is just Hamlet for kids... "
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,This is a ringing endorsement of Detroit Become Human... :P
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,"Damn, it really do be like that."
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,"Finished it over the weekend. Fantastic experience, no matter what the inspiration was."
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,Is the character model of that dude Dr Jackson Avery from greys anatomy 
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,"Kinda...
Les Mis is more about one man’s redemption, where Detroit is about robots trying to obtain freedom. But I do see the similarities between Markus and Jean Valjean, and Connor and Javert."
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,Why does Conner look so different in that picture?
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,"Damn Connor is a big Javert

I've found this sentiment is most often expressed by those who grew up without being taught or shown the severity of the past's evils. Y'know, the ones who could benefit from seeing it the most. It's a criticism used as an excuse to wiggle away from confronting uncomfortable thoughts and feelings."

8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,"The person you replied did not in any way mean that slavery wasn't/isn't bad. What they mean is that this message is hammered on your head throughout the game when actually the message should be subtle to begin with and then develop more. The second sequence of events you have to do in the game feature androids having a designated place in the back of bus and this is considered subtle by the game and not analogous to the exploitation of coloured people in the US. Similarly the use of ""I have a dream"" and the raised fist is considered proper in the game. Why not come up with new ways of developing this analogy to slavery? OP knows it's handled with a heavy hand specifically because they are already aware and were taught about the Civil Rights movement which in itself counters the point you are trying to make.

And ultimately the game doesnt contribute to the conversion around current racial tensions in the US. It begets this conversation by hiding behind the apparent objective of not handling civil rights per se but actually being about whether the androids in the game can be considered a sentient race and thus deserve equality and justice. So the references to the Civil Rights movement appear to be used not to actually refer to the Civil Rights movement specifically but to just generic exploitation of the androids. It is just a blacksploitation movie and nothing else. 

Please dont get offended on the most minor of criticisms on games you enjoy. People dont enjoy the same things. Come on."
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,"Or perhaps the use of these images in the story is more an unsubtle reference to an issue and doesn't really show the horror of slavery and the Holocaust. I'm not saying that slavery's good, of course it isn't, but telling me that Androids go to Canada to be free doesn't tell me much about American slavery. "

8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,"Escaped slaves ran away to Canada via the underground railroad, so there's that. The Androids fleeing Canada is a reference to that. 

Also there's no rule saying that social commentary is required to be subtle to be considered ""good writing."" I won't say that DBE's writing is high quality (because lol), but just because a story doesn't make you go on a scavenger hunt to understand its themes doesn't automatically make it bad. "
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,I'm just trying to keep it simple for someone who isn't all that familiar with the story. Sorry for accidentally misrepresenting the details?
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,"Then why have such obvious imagery? Like there's some references that are subtle, like Marcus's owner living on a street named after Lafayette, hero of the American revolution and staunch slavery abolitionist."

8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,"...again, the point of the game is the moral dilemma so the creator's felt it would help sell that idea by making historical parallels that current humans could relate to in order to better understand the futuristic scenario.

You're getting really triggered by having history used as a reference. Look, if you don't like being reminded about Jews and black Americans suffering then don't play the game. Just, please, stop whining about."
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,I just said that the matters were handled in a hamfisted way and tried to show how they were? 
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,"I don't think you know what ""hamfisted"" means. 
"
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,"Pray tell, what is the definition of hamfisted writing if it isn't the cramming in images of human suffering in US history by a bumbling racist and sexist writer/director from France to simplify a science fiction idea as complex as 'what is life?'?"
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,"If you mean to invoke the actual definition of hamfisted as in incompetently, amateurishly, heavy handedly, then yes the OP obviously knows what hamfisted means because their arguement fits all of those. Would love to know what about the OP's statement didnt fit with the definition of hamfisted.

The ultimate point being, the development of this android exploitation narrative is lazy with direct references to the Civil Rights movement and the Underground Railroad. Is this game's objective to teach people about the struggle around slavery? Why does it have flagrantly mature themes like sex bots and android rape included in it? 

No, the game is about the sentience of androids and then it also wants to talk about their exploitation through means identical to the ones used during the civil rights struggle. It cant do both. It has to pick. It can be about sentience and include subtle and developing references to exploitation or it can be openly about an android civil rights movement. It is lazy lazy writing with faltering dialogue and portrayals.

Wow. You must either have a very short attention span or a very narrow idea of what we should be allowed to express in an art form.

If I want to spend energy criticising a shitty little game then I am perfectly entitled to, on this platform, and you are entitled to walk away from this conversation and yet you are determined to expend energy counter whining. Please leave if you want.

Edit: Adding more coz I just want to take this to the bitter end.

You seem to have ignored my point on the game developing it's own types of exploitations that are not reminiscent of the Civil Rights movement. And then it can be about both sentience and exploitation. If it's using the tried and tested emotional manipulation through imagery of WW2 concentration camps and exploitation of races in the US then it is most assuredly a game about exploitation, not exploring exploitation of a new race. We all will get easily emotional over these horrible horrible acts that happened to the Jewish Community and coloured people. It will happen because we have a developed sense of sympathy and empathy. The game utilising these senses using direct images from these tragedies is lazy. My opinion all of this. "
8oepii,2018-06-04,2018-06-04,"Ham-fisted means ""clumsy, bumbling, maladroit, idiotic, foolish, etc"" 

You know, as if you were conducting a task with a ham for a hand. 

I wouldn't consider having historical parallels to past tensions of a similar nature being ham-fisted. 

It seems to me that literally any treatment of androids as a servitude class would trigger you because that's what slavery is and we can't have any historical references in our games!

The game is *about* civil injustice and the mistreatment of a class of beings used as servants. It would be impossible *not* to somehow allude to the past in every scene because that *is* the vast majority of human history. 

If you just don't like the subject matter and want to play a shooter with robots then I suggest Titanfall. "

Lots of ""gather resources to make new items to gather new resources to make even more items"" etc. Got to 92.5% done (the game tells you your progress percentage), and just lost my motivation. One item I could make took 500 of an item that is pretty rare - I could get maybe 2-4 per minute, but that means it would take 2-4 hours for a single item of middling value. Just decided to put it down instead.

That was a few weeks ago and I haven't gone back. Probably won't, even though I'm within the final 10% of the game."

I was trying to play through it before Alan Wake 2 and I fell off 80% of the way in. I just lost interest in the story and I really didn’t care for Jesse as a main character. The rinse and repeat gameplay got so boring I just gave up and watched the ending on YouTube. I didn’t miss much…

I’m not sure why this Remedy game gets so much praise other than being a Remedy game. It was really bland."

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Name a large-ish open world game, really. Or even semi-open world. I haven't finished either of the last two Zelda games, have not finished any of the ""RPG-style"" Assassin's Creed games, I stopped Horizon Zero Dawn and God of War for a *long* time but eventually reached enough of a lull to go back and finish them - both their sequels are left unfinished as of now (maybe some day). Never finished Ghost of Tsushima. Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk both had long breaks before I came back and finished them, etc. etc.

I love a lot of these games, so it doesn't mean any of them were bad. But they're just so long, and there's so much to do. Usually what happens is I find myself liking the game *so much* that I don't want it to be over so I run around doing everything other than the main quest (once it's obvious the 3rd act is building) - then eventually get fatigued with the game and/or its genre and get distracted by another new release, or going to a different game, or even starting a TV binge."

Love the game, but act 3 was such a slog for me. I couldnt make myself finish it. Didnt help that I wasnt too invested in the whole Mindflayer plotline and I was kind of tired of my class by then (yes, I know you can respecc into different classes, no need to remind me)."

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Starfield.

Exploring felt pointless once it felt same-y after like 10 planets and I was trying to find and finish as many quests as I did. I eventually stopped right before the main mission to go to earth and the moon and just quit for a few weeks. The game's combat is okay but I still prefer fallout 4 and even 76's shooting compared to it. A whole host of other bugs and just un-fun mechanics of the game made me quit.

I came back to it after a few weeks and actually enjoyed the NASA stuff and the Entangled mission, reminded me of that one mission in Titanfall 2(you know the one lol). And slogged through the rest of it to finish the game.

I saved before starting a new game+, got bored within the first couple of hours of NG+ since I lost my custom Ebon Hawk styled ship, all my stuff and had this crappy suit(my other stuff was super efficient with sprinting and resource hauling) and a weird ship that I didn't care for. I didn't care for any of the powers either because the only one that felt worthwhile was the oxygen/stamina one. I saw how NG+ only affects the main questline and just reloaded where I had saved and decided not to do NG+ and then uninstalled. 

It didn't have the same magic that Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 4 and even Fallout 76(I still play 4 often and also play 76 daily because I genuinely enjoy them) does and I don't know if mods or dev changes will fix it. Only time will tell but until then I have little to no interest in Starfield DLC tbh. RIP $80 lol"

Occasionally, I may come back for another try at defeating an overpowered boss.  Sometimes, I'll win but if I fail more than twice to defeat a boss, I'll quit the game permanently."

The Cat Lady - I am supposed to find something to interact with but couldn't, cba to look at a walkthrough to figure out where it is.

Burnhouse Lane - This I plan to go back to, just not in the mood for it right now cause I've been stressed lately and the theme is very disturbing.

Dragon Age Inquisition - This one I tried on a torrent a few years ago and never finished because it was such a slog and compared to the others it just seemed so uninteresting and tbh I'm not a fan of Bioware's characters in general for Dragon Age really which is a damn shame because I love the art style and lore of the world.

Metro Exodus - This one I actually am toward the end (unless steam lost my progress cause I fresh installed windows, haven't tried launching it again) at the crossbow area. I just sort of lost interest there, not a fan of crossbows I guess lol. Its a shitty excuse, I should finish it. If not its fine I guess since I need to do several achievements I missed in the earlier sections anyways."

ME2 was my favourite game as a kid but I was never a huge gamer, I bought the remastered collection a year or so ago and decided to play the whole trilogy. I played the first game, absolutely loved it probably more than 2, played the second again but then got about halfway through the third and realised why everyone said it sucked lol. I felt like I was watching the story unfold instead of actually having any autonomy over the direction. For a game that is so character based and creates a level of personal investment, this was its biggest flaw for me.

If the forth game comes out as a continuation of the series I will probably go back to it, but I just really don't have that much time to game unless a game is really, really good."

The farthest I got in HL is >!when you fight the head of the wizard-thugs that is in cahoots with the main goblin antagonist. I got to the part where the main wizard-thug cast an avada kedavra on me and I killed him instead!<

I'm with you on Detroit: Become Human too - I was really enjoying the story but there were so many things I kept missing that resulted in unintended outcomes that I got sick of replaying levels. Especially the >!TV Studio/broadcast one!< so I parked it and never did finish it.

Also quit on Stray earlier this year. I think I was maybe 70% of the way through it but got annoyed with the sudden ""running away from things"" difficulty spikes and decided I'd seen enough of the gameplay and deleted it.

I'm more likely to quit early than late, though - once I get invested in a game I'll usually see it through. Even *Spider-Teenager: Whines Morales*. What a repetitive chore that was, but I completed it last week! 😅"

Most of the loot was meaningless and finding all the collectibles was tedious.  

It was fun for a while but it got monotonous after about 20 hours.  When I put it down to play something else I never picked it up again. 

I'm glad it was a PS Plus title because it would have been a disappointing buy."

I beat the four guardians and just got stuck in a cycle of trying to get all of the shrines before going for the final boss. I know I could have stopped, but I just felt like it was a pattern I couldn’t break.

I stopped playing temporarily for a few days to play something else and just never bothered to pick it back up. Years later I’ve sold my Switch so it’s unlikely I’ll ever finish.

I feel like this happens a lot with me with games that give you tons of collectibles, especially game useful ones. I get stuck in that cycle and just fade out of playing."

Great game... got most of the way through it then just stopped playing.  I don't really remember why.  Probably the same reason I've stopped playing a lot of games.  A new game comes out and I get pulled away and just never get back to the other game.

Breath of the Wild

Amazing game... I did just about everything there was to do and just before the boss I just stopped playing.  I played through again on Master Mode only to stop once again before the boss.  I think I just didn't want the game to end."

After I unlocked all of the sages and defeated Gannon (twice), I decided there wasn’t enough interest for me to complete all of the shrines and discover the entirety of the depths.

As a bonus Deus Ex Human Revolution. That one I literally got to the final boss boss, died twice and said I’ll just look look up the end scenes. After losing like 2 hours of progress to respec for the electric boss I was just burned out.

Still a great game but i think the main reason is that i got bored of the bethesda formula (i know its not from bethesda but its almost the same).

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I got really far into CrossCode before I couldn’t take it anymore. Everyone loves that game, but the main mechanic of the game being tedious traversal puzzles is awful for me.

Need to go one screen to the right, but on the top level? All you have to do is go two screens left, three screens down, hop up a level, go one screen left, hop down three levels, go two screens up, hop up a level, go one screen right, one screen down, hop up a level, pull a lever, hop up another level, go three screens right, etc until you finally get there, but then what do you know, you end up on the correct screen and correct level of the topography, except at a chest instead of the door you wanted, which is blocked by terrain and now you have to find another way around and back to that screen.

That’s the game’s main gameplay. People said it was mostly optional stuff that did that, but it’s the bulk of the game’s content that does it."

And then i got to the end mission and it was way more difficult than anything else in the game. I was underleveled and couldnt get through it, so i looked up the ending and turned it off"

Kingdom come deliverance, I did almost everything in the game, but felt burned out by the end and never did the final quest, kind of sad seeing how good this game is but to finish it now i'd want to restart the whole game since it's been a few years, and I don't feel like it yet

Bioshock infinite, did all the achievement but gave up at the blue ribbons one, this shit is so RNG and time consuming so I just quit after a point

The Witcher 3, never even started the last dlc (blood and wine) everytime I start the game all over again, and each time I'm loving it, but by the time I finish the game I feel tired and never start this dlc, I know it's supposedly very good and that I'm missing something awesome, Im sure I'll do it eventually 

A bit more obscure, but I'm only missing one achievement in Dirty Bomb, a fast competitive FPS that was so good when it had players, but now that the playerbase is really low I lost hope to unlock the last achievement, which were already hard to get when a lot of people still played it (reviving 5 players with a single pulse with the merc Guardian)"

That fight was so one-sided though that it made me think either I'm underleveled cause I accidentally skipped some part of the game or I simply didn't understand some core mechanics. 
Either way, it felt like I'd need to waste too much time to try to win it, so I gave up and played something else instead."

I also remember playing Dark Cloud. Got to the final boss and got tired of having to restart the fight from the beginning. I quit that one and still have never finished it.

I kept wondering when I'd get more upgrades and ""wow, this game must be hella long"" and shit alllllllll the way up to the final boss fight of the game. Of course I got completely rofl-stomped repeatedly. 

I started Googling and realized my mistake with the upgrades. I started replaying old missions to find the orbs but it got old once I re-did like 30% of the game after just beating it and still wasn't strong enough for the fight so I dropped it there. 

A year later I started over but this time used a guide from the start just for the orbs, and made sure I got all or almost all of them. I've beaten the game twice more since then.

 Also the first time I played The Surge I quit at the final boss again lolol. In that one though I did have all the weapons, armor, mods, the hidden ones, DLC content, high-ass energy cap - had everything and more needed to beat the boss but it was just too hard of a fight for me and eventually became not-fun.

The attack was just way over-powered in that the NPCs would do nothing to stop you mid animation. 10 guards show up and just mill around while you pounce one after the other. Felt really cheesy but it was easy and kind of funny.

The boss made like 5 illusions of himself and they'd all attack you at once. You could detect which one of the illusions was real with magic sight or just pounce and kill them all.

I thought I had another like 19 days left to go farm up the money I needed for the treasury, but when I did the time jump (usually is only a few days), boom, i'm on the last day and I don't have the money.

Shadow Run Dragonfall - am about one boss area/level away heard it was a bit bugged, got distracted by something else (Hades and then Motorsport Manager) and haven't gone back to it.



Shadow Run Hong Kong - am quite far through it but the changes between Hong Kong and Dragonfall weren't vibing with me and as I understand it I'd missed some sort of side quest thing which was making life harder than it needed to be (might have been Dragonfall I'd missed the side quests in but in all honesty it's possibly both).

And to do THAT you need lots and lots of power. So I got like halfway through trying to construct a self-contained nuclear facility that recycled the Plutonium cores to get around the permanent nuclear waste (because screw stuff that would just put a giant ticking clock on the remaining game time once it became too numerous), but trying to work out the logistics of just making the plutonium cores became such a hastle that it just didn't become worth the effort."

He loved so fast and hit so hard (an entire energy tank per hit) and only dropped any healing items between phases and not much at that.  He had so many phases that all change up the gameplay loop so much, that it was easy to fall prey to the new gimmick.  After about 50 tries I put it down, watched the ending on YouTube, and sold it back to GameStop or $45, so I don’t feel too bad about really only spending $15 on a glorified rental.

I'll give honorable mentions to GTA 4 and Red Dead Redemption 1.  Both games took me about 4 years to beat because of how slow and boring I find Rock Stars game design.

Have the set for everything, by the way it sucks that they put skills on clothes , now you have to change clothes every time the situation demands. Anyway, I was midway on my campaign and my friend ask me to finish his main story, no worries about spoilers since I know who dies, that's all I know. Then we got to the mission by the end it was a let down, everything you did before the final mission is thrown away, narrative was the weakest of game. They really messed up the after credits stuff. Since then, didn't bother finishing my own."

Couldn't find a weapon I clicked with and I tried everyone I could with my specs. I stopped playing for maybe around a year. Then a friend who has beaten ng+9 or something found out I never beat it and asked if I wanted to coop to the end just to beat it. Said sure but remembered I was doing a quest line that I thought was for an ending but couldn't remember where/what I was doing. We ended up missing marrying the armor lady due to not talking with someone at the home base. So I stopped playing again on the stairs towards the final boss since the NPC wasn't there. Fun game but I just couldn't find my feel for it and the quest system is frustrating if you take a break, an issue I have with from software style of quests."

I love the setting, it‘s such a freaking beautiful world. But the combat and the missions, after a while, are a slog and just drag on and on. I wanted to get to Atlantis so badly, played through Elysium and Hades and they were so pretty and cool! But when I finally arrived at Atlantis… i just didn‘t have it in me to continue playing that game.

My little bro gave up before even getting to Atlantis because once he started playing Soulsborne games, he realized how much better the gameplay of those games is."

I could pretty much handle any other enemy in the game, but the last boss was pretty much ""let's give it every boss mechanic at once."" Multiple phases, regen, summons adds, wonky hitbox, short telegraphs or poorly telegraphed attacks, aoe that's hard to dodge, and he damages you when he falls in a stagger."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Yakuza 0. Nearly got to the end and just stopped for no particular reason.

It just didn't suck me in enough to keep going, since I couldn't relate with the main guy and the story stopped me from just wanting to go around and be a cowboy. I may try to play it all again someday. 

Also Dishonored, because it felt like the end was just awful and I didn't care anymore after it expected me to be sneaky when there was so much going on. Neat concept about how it changes based on decisions, but not done well IMO. 

I've never beat a pokemon game, after it being my first game ever, and getting other ones through the years."

In the original I had little mini bases scattered throughout the map, it seemed necessary.

In below zero I made one base the entire time and never felt compelled to build a second one.  By the time I reached the literal end of the game, I realized I wouldn't be needing any more bases and there was really not going to be any new content, just kinda quit.  Very much recommend the first game tho.

I tried to go back to it and I had forgotten too much to even get past the street thugs. I swung around for a bit and put it away forever. Definitely one I'm thinking about going back to and starting from the beginning one day. 

RDR2. I played the first to 100% and really loved the new mechanics in RDR2. I had done a lot of the hunting, plant collecting, animal watching, and was excited to get to 100%.  I was going slow, but the story line really grabbed me and kept playing that, figuring I could go back to do all the tedious stuff that I still liked doing after. But, I don't know, something felt way different after I beat the game. Hardly played at all after that."

Completed storyline, went to grind to get up to nightmare difficulty and it requires defeating a capstone dungeon with new barbarian enemies.

I’d handled everything up to that point by playing very well and actively, and was rewarded for it. But these barbarians just one shot you from off screen unless you grind.

A lot.

And grinding low levels for days to be **allowed** to grind higher levels is no longer the kind of gameplay draw you think it is blizzard."

(It worked for Black Flag but that was a pirate game) Mix in the overwhelming amount of stuff to do in the game, the changes to combat (from Origins) and I just haven't been able to finish it. 

Actually now that I think of it, I did the same thing with Valhalla, and that game has even more stuff to do in it. I've gone back and 100% AC Origins and it's DLC again before finally finishing either one of those games and I feel like I should but haven't gotten myself to do it yet."

Also Cluster Truck, the difficulty spike for the final boss/stage is INSANE.."

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Quantum Break. I enjoyed the game but that last boss was pretty cheap. I gave up.

I played it a lot as a kid and eventually made it to the final boss, but I didn't understand how to defeat him, because I was dumb and also a kid. It's been over 20 years and I still don't know what to do. I barely remember the boss, but as far as I can remember he kept doing some sort of weird invincibility move that I just could not figure out how to counter. Would be interesting to see the boss again."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Dark souls 2. And I'm a fanatic about souls likes and all of the fromsoft games. But that one had me figuratively ripping my hair out with how frustrating it was made to be.

I beat all the main story shit and then they slapped me with a laundry list of end game quests that turned out to be Fable 3 esque chore quests and I didn't want to finish the game without clearing all the content but I had no desire to actually *do* any of those boring ass quests so I just put it down instead."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,When I was a teenager I got final fantasy 7 for the PS1 and I played it relentlessly for a long time. I got almost all the way to the end and for some reason I stopped. It took me 14 years to pick it back up and finish it. I had completely forgotten how high my character levels were and I was way over levelled for the last boss. I slapped Sepheroth around like it was nothing. But it was still satisfying.

Loaded up the game after work and the mission marker was gone. Figured, ""eh, I'll just drive over to where it was and see what happens."" Game warns me death is imminent.

Apparently it's a known bug they never fixed, so if you play Rage 2 and the final mission marker appears, go do it! Do not quit or you will be screwed!"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Alien Isolation.

Fucking amazing game, and right up my alley. The art direction was literally perfection, the gameplay was tight and tense, the story was very good.

But man the stress fucking wore me out. I have no idea where I was in the game, all I know is I had a flame thrower, which I made liberal use of. Ran out of fuel, and it seemed like the AI was holding a grudge. That xeno was on my ass at every turn until I just turned it off one night like normal and just didn't have the gusto to turn it back on."

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Elden Ring. I love the souls games but I just got sick of Elden rings open world. It just wasn't as fun as the more linear souls games to me. I got about 100 hours in just doing one playthrough then stopped. Not touched since.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Final fantasy xvi combat is so nice but the story was kinda not it plus the side quest segments were so dull
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I was so close to the end of Halo 2 but there was a bug in the final boss which wouldn't let you advance and I never beat it.  
The scarab fight. At the end after you beat the scarab the ship flies out. There was a bug which wouldn't let you progress after you defeated the scarab. It wouldn't let you into the next level."

The closest i got was setting up the Knights Of The Round combo a couple times and then i would shut it off. I have seen the ending and watched others beat it, but i have no interest in finishing it ever."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I never completed the most recent star ocean. The game was for the most part very easy, but then there was a massive difficulty spike mid game where I had to drop the difficulty, and there is a massive difficulty spike for the very last area/boss.

...I saved over my long term RPG save file. Legend of Dragoon. Months of playtime, as the younger sibling who was lucky to get the controller for a few hours a week, and it was GONE. I was literally RIGHT before the final boss.

I'm 34 now and I'm about halfway through. I'm coming for that crown, baby."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I keep hearing how bg3 is game of the year but way under 25% have completed it on ps5 and pc. Im sure the modders aren't in the majority here.

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Returnal.  31 hours played.  Loved the gameplay.

Died three times at the final boss.  Boots you back out to world four after each death (which means 2+ hours of playtime before getting back to the boss fight).

I YouTubed the ending and uninstalled after the 3rd death.

I hate rougelites."

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Persona 5

Played since the release date, I was at the very last dungeon, completed every confidant and got most trophies, but never finished the story. 

The reason was that those days me and my brothers made some big changes to our apartment and took us weeks, so I couldn't play anything, when I finally had the chance I didn't have the motivation to finish P5. But anyways I'm looking forward to play the Royal version some time."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"The Last Of Us 2. The game ends like 3 times. Also, Valhalla. I have over 220 hours, and I'm still a few hours into Ragnarok."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Alan wake 2. Really liked parts of it. The horror, the mystery. Then i just felt like it all got very self indulgent. And I enjoyed saga’s character a lot more, so once you start maining Alan I didn’t have much fun. The cutscenes with him are so cringe for me. Maybe it just wasn’t for me. The musical, the self referencing. Tried to go back to it after getting to the final act and couldnt"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Last of Us 2.  Got up to the boss who one shots you if he touches you, died 3 times and wasn’t in the mood for that nonsense, so I switched to whatever else was next in my queue and never finished the last bit."

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Death Stranding. My own fault really. The game is all about building a network and I kinda just made it across the map on foot. You could build highways and drive but I didn’t think it was worth the investment. The final act makes you take a delivery all the way back and I had to do it on foot or driving on rocky terrain. Fuck that. 

I’ve restarted it but got bored and I always think about going back and get exhausted and just the thought. Great game though."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Horizon Zero Dawn.  I got through the story missions and was ready to take on the big bad and just dropped it.  Loved it up until that point though.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I do this all the time. I feel like some games devs know that once you invested a lot of time in a game you have to finish it but as soon as I get bored I stop lol
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Pillars of eternity, got everything done except the final dungeon and the dlc when I realized I could get good ending for the cleric guy as I didn't map at an inn somewhere in act 1, decided that the writing was good enough to try the dlc, couldn't even get to the dlc area as I kept dying to the guys outside the wizard tower and never even got inside"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Witcher 3, had heard so much hype about it being one of the best games ever made but I just couldn't push through the last few quests. Felt like a slog and I could just tell I didn't wanna do it. Mainly becase the combat is pretty boring and bugs/performance issues on console, cause my pc wasn't good enough to run it."

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Rise of the Tomb Raider. Enjoyed the game but I kept struggling with low ammo and dying at the final battle (the chopper and multiple waves of enemies). I simply moved on to something else out of frustration. I should probably try again though since it's so close to completion. Also AC Oddessy - Really enjoyed it, spent over 100 hours playing but couldn't for the life of me beat a large Cyclops."

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I don't if you could say ""completed"" because the final expansion isn't out yet, but after some 6 years of playing Destiny and Destiny 2 with my old work friends, I just completely lost all interest when Lightfall dropped.  I barely made it through the first mission before calling it done.  Haven't touched it in months, and most of those friends quit too.  We went from weekly game nights to just dropping it almost overnight, and it sounds like things have only gotten worse over there."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Fallout new Vegas due to a bug that didn’t let me choose the faction that I wanted to work with. Enjoyed it until that bug stopped me. Zelda is a game that I can never finish like the others
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Starfield TOTK, hogwarts legacy. Had almost 200 hrs in starfield, got bored, didn’t even finish the main mission. A 100 hrs in TOTK and well other games came out. Went on the back burner and haven’t touch it since. Hogwarts I have about 3 hrs into it lol. Just couldn’t get into it."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope. I enjoyed it but it just outstayed its welcome.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Starfield. After about 20 hours, it felt like a repetitive mobile game. Thankfully I didn't buy it (Xbox gamepass)."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.

Made it all the way to the Star Forge, only to discover that it was insanely difficult for a mostly Light Side character with a heavy emphasis on talking their way out of situations. (you're put up against a seemingly endless army with limited resources, and the Light Side skills, or at least the ones that I had, weren't up to the task from what I recall)"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Saw the video game. Huge saw fan but man that game was rough, was disappointed that the ending didn’t use the Hello Zepp soundtrack, could’ve really benefitted from it. Being a huge saw fan, I booted up the second game after, somehow even worse than the first one. I quit after an hour. Normal I’d trash the discs or sell them, but seeing as how they’re kinda of expensive now and I am a fan of the franchise I keep them on the shelf."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,It breaks my heart but Kingdom Hearts. I nearly beat ot twice but always got stuck on the same boss. I refuse to play the other games until I beat it
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey. It's a very neat game with a cool gameplay loop. You evolve from apes in trees to the missing link, walking around on 2 legs with tools basically. Working from the jungle to the ocean on a quest to evolve your lineages 10 million years with minimal hand holding. Seriously minimal. They don't tell you hardly anything about how to play and I love it. 

Spoilers. 

Once you reach the ocean and what is essentially the end of the game the ""goals"" just kind of stop and your main goal is to now nickel and dime your way through the rest of the upgrade web for the small stuff you didn't upgrade to get your clan the last little bit of knowledge they need to evolve. Instead of lining it up to beat the game and finish the upgrade web around the same time you finish the game with the web at like 80% complete and have to do the final 20% in a finished game map you've already explored most of. Just looking for the one type of mushroom you didn't eat 50 of to help your clan eventually be able to digest mushrooms. After you've advanced to walking on 2 legs and killing elephants with spears. 

Bizarre late game planning. I had such a good time getting to that point but once I realized what was left for me I just put it down and called it finished. It was damaging the fun I'd already had by trying to force longevity it felt like."

Got way into it, scores of tries to defeat Genichiro & Owl Father but I did it; murdered every enemy, finally got to Sword Saint Isshin.....and weirdly ran out of fucks. Only tried him maybe 4 times.

Final Fantasy 7. Got to sephiroth underleveled. Realized I wasn't going to beat him without grinding a bunch. I hate grinding. 

Kingdom Hearts 3, got very near the end and just stopped. No reason why, just never finished it. Started playing other games instead."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Batman Arkham Knight. Did all the side activities, got all the riddles, beat the story twice. Never collected every trophy because it's a pain in the ass and I just wanted to do it for the trophy, before realising it wouldn't mean that much."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I recently did the same in TOTK. I felt like by the end I was just playing to finish the game and not really enjoying the experience anymore. I got distracted by other games and have gone back since.

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Me too! One of the best gaming experiences of my life but after 150 hrs and a self imposed rule not to look online for any help I was 8 shrines away from walking into to beat Ganon. I explored the castle a bit but didn’t want to end the game without all shrines found. That far in I couldnt bring myself to look at a guide anymore and felt satisfied with my experience. TOTK one day!
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Same.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"This is how TOTK was for me. I put 120 hours in and was having a lot of fun, and then hand pain caused me to step away for a month. Now it’s months later and I’ve played and beaten 4 other games and haven’t had the desire to return to it."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"You didn’t miss anything - that boss fight was so disappointingly easy after such a perfect game experience, the end boss was a let down. (This was my first Zelda game, so I thought I’d be able to roam around after the boss - I wasn’t, so that was disappointing too)"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I more or less did the same.

After running around all over for a while, I figured I'd just take a stab at Ganon with only 1 divine beast.

Absolutely bodied him. I had so much food and stuff I could have fully recovered 20 times over. Quit before ending it because I wanted to actually do the other divine beasts.

So I beat them and then never went back to the castle... or played again.

Loved every second of the game. It felt like it woke some slumbering part of my brain that reminded me of when I was a kid and OOT felt so very vast and adventurous."

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Everyone I talked to has said something like this, including me. There's a point in the story where the precious little momentum built up just disappears. Some sort of labyrinth iirc"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Same thing for me. But it also happened in mass effect. I felt I could tell I was on the final mission/quest and just never did it. But I did also burn myself out by wanting to complete all the side quests and having the ""best timeline"""
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I've started it like 3 times now, and by the time I get to this desert map I just give up."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I really enjoyed that game. I remember the first dragon fight was just laid out so well, so while it was a smallish zone it really felt like a plain or valley before a mountain where the dragon sat. Really well done fight and wasn't alone. However, my issue was talking to everyone back at homebase in between every mission. It felt like I was talking for 1-2 hours to play a 30 minute to hour mission back home to chat for a couple more hours. I just got tired of the talking and I normally love story and character interactions. I don't even remember where I quit but it wasn't too many missions after you find a new base."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I bought at launch and have never completed it. I could never get into the game no matter how much I tried and have always thought I was wrong because it gets such high praise.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Can relate… was into it for many hours, then just felt like I was barely progressing and didn’t really have any attachment to my characters. Started a new game and never went back."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,It was a good jumping off point type of game. Flying on a broom was fucking awesome. Spell casting was fucking awesome. But the combat and story quickly became so dull and repetitive. I had a challenge with myself where I would walk into a bandit camp and see how long I could stay in the same spot until the camp is cleared.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I just finished this after taking many months off. Some games are hard to come back to; this one wasn't. Worth revisiting if you have the time.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"This is what I came here to comment on.

Bought the game on launch, didn't have too high expectations, and had fun with it, but just completely lost motivation and haven't returned to it since the month it came out. I think I did two of the main trials, or whatever they were, grinded out some of the collectible stuff like the Merlin Trials and had fun messing around with the combat for a while before I just stopped caring for it.

I almost always finish games when I start them. I usually only play one game at a time (sometimes 2 if I feel like replaying a game I've played before), and don't stop playing it until I'm finished. That, or I 100% the entire game before moving on since I'm a bit of a completionist.

Hogwarts Legacy was an enjoyable distraction. It wasn't necessarily bad, but nothing about it was new or great, either. I'm not sure if I'll ever go back to it and finish it. I have too many other games I'm finally getting around to after hearing about them for years or saying I'd try them at some point. I'm currently playing through Dragon's Dogma for the first time ever in anticipation of the sequel, and I can't believe I didn't try it sooner. It's a blast."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I played it for the atmosphere snd puzzles.  Combat was forgettable
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"It’s like someone told the devs they were making a $100m game, so they started doing some really cool shit, then after they’d spend $30m they told then $40m was going to a licensing fee so they’d better be half done.

Also the writing sucks balls except for Sebastian’s quest"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I finished it, but as soon as it was over, I knew I would never play it again haha. If I wasn’t a huge Harry Potter fan I don’t I would have finished it honestly. The story was so meh. The design of Hogwarts was by far the best part."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Yeah, I should have just stuck with the main story quests"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"50 hours in myself and loving it still, but i detest the broom flying immensely bc I'm on mouse and keyboard, and it's clunky. But yeah, clearing out spiders and poachers over and over is a little old. But I'm still hammering on quests."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I finishes the story, but trying to get my level up to whatever the max is, couldn't be bothered lol. Nice game, but I'm not grinding for the achievement"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I'm a big AC fan. Ive played through like 4 previous games and was excited for a Viking experience. Valhalla just didn't do it for me. I think the problem was based around huge hoards of barbarians raiding towns, when I really preferred to always play as a stealthy actual assassin."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Yeah, I don’t remember the last time I played Valhalla."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Me too, but on Odyssey, my interest on the game expired before I can finish the story. There's so much side missions that it sucks the joy out of it."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Bro I’m somewhere between 120-160 hours in and I don’t know if the end is even in sight. I’ve been working on this game since it launched lol
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I did pretty much the exact opposite. I gave up on Odyssey and finished Valhalla. But like you said, it was a slog. Which is a shame because I really enjoyed Valhalla. It just overstayed it's welcome. I've read that Mirage is a much shorter experience so I'm looking forward to that."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,Odyssey was amazing but just...too big. I 100% every AC before that one. It was just too much
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Also massive AC fan here, haven't been able to bring myself to beat any of the new games, so neither Origins Odyssey or Valhalla. Just kinda fell out of Origins, nothing wrong with that game or pacing just wasn't an assassins creed in my mind. Odyssey voice acting was so atrocious to the point I had to stop like 40 hrs in cause I just couldn't take anything seriously. Valhalla just felt like more of the same but with better voice acting so I never really got too far"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I ended up quitting out of frustration when I was very near the end of a pacifist playthrough and found out I somehow killed one person.  Must have been pretty early, someone who was knocked out and slid off a roof or into a river or something."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Great game, but the only game I know that basically says ""using all the cool stuff will result in a bad ending.""  Always felt torn and stressed out, just stopped playing about 2/3 the way through."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,The “stats” screen was the greatest addition to 2 because you could tell if you were spotted or killed somebody before completing the level.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Lmao, this comment deserves 1k upvotes."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Which ending was this,"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,[deleted]
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Opposite for me. The first Dishonored has the singular ….erm…honor to be the only game past the SNES era for me that I immediately started over after beating it one way and went through it a second time. No other game has been able to motivate me as much as that one.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,Dishonored two I did low chaos all the way the. I get to the final boss and my game bugs not allowing me the merciful option.  I just said fuck it and took the “bad” ending it was very dissatisfying
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Ok wait are y'all serious? How are you guys seriously like: ""I killed a guy with a sword, why did I fail my pacifist run??"" Like bruh."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,Thankfully the second game was much better
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Yea this happened with me too. Played it on Origin on my PC the night it released, put a load of hours into it and then one day just stopped playing it for some reason. Was literally on the second to last mission and I ended up beating it about 6 months ago in 30 minutes. Loved the game tho."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I gave up at Malico and never came back
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I finished The Division 1 and 2 like 5 times but never played the endgame. Believe or not I just love the (very simple) campaign and story.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"The thing that broke the Division for me was when I finally got gud, had a fine build, went up in world tier, was doing everything right, and joined a pickup group to do some daily hunts or whatever.  The more players in a party, the more mobs come out of random doors in a fight.

The game turned into yakkidy smacks.  Mobs just pouring out of random doors and running around and us trying to circle behind cover.

All semblance of cover shooter or patient skill based anything turned into a DPS check and 'did you or did you not find cover by the random door we decided bad guys are now coming out of'.

Pssht.  Done.  Uninstall.  The journey was fun."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"From someone who loves The Division franchise, was the complexity of the gear system and gear synergy a factor in it?"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Division 1 had some pretty spongey enemies, but I feel like D2 is a great balance. I loved D2 and still go back to play it with my high level character that I've created amazing builds with. D1 never got me to that point. They refined it in 2"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"This was my issue with it as well. I loved running through the dark zone with teammates, collecting loot, getting stronger, etc. 

But at the end of the day, this random gangster is taking dozens of clips of my best weapon to put down, and it’s just less fun. 

Then Wildlands came out and we switched to that instead. Had so much fun, but still never finished it either."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Yep. 

Weapon and armor upgrades practically don't matter once you get to a certain point. 

Maybe instead of 10,000 bullets to take down a boss it's 9,800 if you upgrade your gear.

And you're still getting 3 tapped no matter what."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,All you have to do to un-join them is start shooting them
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Same. I got bored. The world in Fallout 3 felt bleak and desperate. Like a real post apocalypse game. Something felt too bright and clean about post apocalypse Boston. Especially with the Institute being a main focus. Too clean and futuristic. I want my Fallouts dirty and dark. And no voice acting from the main character.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"I also did everything except the main quest. Last I remember, I was off on some DLC island avoiding the main quest some more. I even started a second playthrough as a crazy person wearing the mascot bear head and only fighting with a baseball bat while maxing out the drugs."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"So you can be allied with all fractions up until a certain point. 
To permanently ally with the RR or the BoS, you will eventually do missions that will kill the institute.

To permanently ally with the Minutemen, you need to simply relay into the institute and Argo all of them. Don't kill Father if you want the ending.

You aren't stuck being part of the institute until you start killing the brotherhood and the RR."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-13,"For me I didn't finish the game, because i was eventually in all factions, and there was no option for a truce which would benefit all. For F's sake, i was running the institute and in high regards of the Brotherhood of steel, and high up the railroad's butt. But i can't make them call a truce?  
That's bonker's. The writing is stupid. the game is stupid. Except for Dogmeat, that's one heckin' good boy."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I put it down because I couldn't decide who to side with

I've never picked it back up"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"I wanted to explore absolutely everything and play as much story as I can but...

after I read up on the different nonsensical endings, my will to complete the game disappeared like a wet fart in the nuclear wind. 

Also I realized that Fallout 4 (or Bethesda games in general) is just not good, it *just* works. Countless loading screens, bugs, illusion of choice (or consequence more accurately), lazy animations, shitty gun mechanics (why does my marksman rifle become completely useless midgame?), constant immersion breaking, bad scripting, radiant quests are bad, bad and outdated graphics, unoptimized game, bland companions with very repetitive dialogue etc.

If someone asked me whether I could recommend FO4 (or any Bethesda game for that matter) I'd probably say yes (under circumstances). Initially the roaming is fun and the atmosphere is on par with the best. With that said, after a while the many faults of this game cannot be overlooked anymore. It's a bad game.    
Rant over."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"The problem with the RDR games is that they put all of the worthwhile outfits behind a complete or near complete playthrough and then don’t give you a New Game+.  I played them out of order, but after spending tens of hours getting the good final outfit in RDR2 only to find I had no use for it; when I played RDR, I stopped once the story finished and I had completed all of the quests.  Fuck the challenges."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I couldn't beat one of the fishing challenges, and kept dying cause I was trying to do it >!as John!< and couldn't swim."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"RDR2 for me but for a different reason, I reinstalled Windows and assumed Rockstar would back up my saves in a cloud (I had it through Steam). I want to replay it but I had around 80 hours in that game, it's hard to start over."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,I genuinely think this is a symptom of ADHD because I am the same way
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"It's not worth it IMO. Yes the ending is different, but not a whole lot considering the absolute headache it is to get all those riddler trophies. You're better off finishing everything except the trophies, then watching the true ending on YouTube. That's what I did and it was a great experience."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Lmao I loved the riddler trophies. Was actually a bit sad when I got all of them, didn't even know there was a different ending until I got that too."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I did it. It took a while but I managed to 100% it. Thankfully, you don't have to collect the trophies again in New Game Plus (I think)"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Do have to admit that the puzzles make a bit of a tone shift right before the end. I also almost quit when they started to get a little too MegaMan but I pushed through to the end.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Exactly the same here. Nothing wrong with the game, just haven't gone back to it even though I know its a short game. I wonder how far from the end I am"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,The exact same thing happened to me! I had quit about five feet from the end and waited ~4 years to pick it back up. I was streaming it for some friends and they all laughed at me.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I remember I stopped playing doom 2016 a few years ago because I was stuck, picked it up a while later and I was literally one area away from the final boss."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Oh me too! I just didn't feel like doing the final puzzle with the gravity challenge. It just seemed too annoying. I looked up a video of the game ending instead.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Lightning was in XIII though. 🤔
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Yeah, FFXV wasn’t a *bad* game - it was worth playing through once, but I’ve felt zero desire to replay it.  I definitely wouldn’t replay the whole thing just to get the ending either."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Man, I thought the game was good with some flaws, but the ending is one of the best in all FFs!"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I did the same... Played the absolute hell out of it on launch... Did a lot of bosses, killed Radahn, . Killed some more side bosses. Did the entire underground area with the big spider thingy with a face. Killed the blood god side boss dude.  Then I sort of went on a 6 month break and picked it up again last xmas.

&#x200B;

Carried on a bit more, more side stuff, killed Godfrey, made my way to Morgott and killed him. Got to the mountaintop and then stopped again, said i'll pick it up again tomorrow.

&#x200B;

That was last New Years Day. I'll probably try again this xmas lol."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"I’ll probably get some hate from all the Elden Ring fans, but it didn’t help that the back half of the game was an annoying winter landscape where it was hard to see, and that most of the bosses at that point were just strait up repeats with a different ability tacked on. The wonder really faded for me quick in the second half of Elden Ring. Did still beat it though."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I took a 3 month break when I got to the capital. I just got bored with it I think due to running around trying to do everything I could, which I believe I did but so many of the dungeons are really lame and boring. I like the game and beat it as well but the open world mixed with mediocre dungeons made it a slog at multiple points."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Same, Elden Ring is one of the very few full priced games I’ve bought and didn’t finish. I had never played any of the Souls games and got caught up in the hype but should have known it wasn’t for me. Put 30-40 hours in and couldn’t tell how much further I had to go but I knew I wasn’t enjoying it.

Still annoys me lol."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Exact same here. Played up through the snowy area and the fire giant boss and realized I was just burnt out and couldn't go on. Plus the last 20% of the game with reused bosses and such felt kinda lazy and phoned in. Nowhere near the quality of everything prior to that.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"This is why ER is one of the weakest from soft games for me tbh, it drags way too much. Never felt like that with any of their other games."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,They don't call him The Glock Saint for nothin
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Can I suggest you go back and try again? With these kinds of games sometimes a break is just what you need to find the win.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I finished it, but damn do I agree"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Same. “Push through this boss battle and you get to see what new parts of the game come next” got me through the earlier fights but after losing to Isshin a dozen times I realized there would be no new parts afterwards and my motivation kind of evaporated.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,Gave up Isshin after 200+ tries (I counted them). Still feel salty about it.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I have a framed pic of the screenshot I took years ago when I beat him still hanging over my hobby desk. No other souls/like has done that to me.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I quit for a year then went back, loaded the same save and beat him after 3 attempts. It all just clicked but not replaying the game anytime soon."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"If you need motivation just this weekend I came back to this game after taking a month long break cause I couldn't beat the swamp monster. 

Changed my build and beat him in a couple of tries....now I beat the game but accidentally got the bad ending so I'm doing it again on ng+ lol"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Things like this always remind me how different experiences can be even for people who are heavily into the same genre.

For me I thought Sekiro was considerably tougher than Lies of P. Granted, Lies of P isn't a cakewalk either. It just doesn't have Issin in it.

Were you running a heavy build or a light build?"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I had a strength build as well, I disagree with you. You said it yourself ""You're supposed to be adapting to the game."" So, adapt and change tactics. 

I used the Live Puppet Axe the second I got it.
The hardest boss for me was NP"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Hmm…I’ve been holding off on getting Lies of P, so this is good to know."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I’m also stuck at the green monster, his second phase is just nuts."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"That's fair but also Lies of P is SINGIFICANTLY easier to alter builds with than any of Fromsoft's Soulslike titles. I had a boss I was stuck on for 30 minutes, changed my build to match his weakness and first tried him. This was the solution almost every time I got hard stuck. The main exception being the last gauntlet the game offers."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Oh man I totally know how you feel! I’ve only played Cyberpunk 2077 and Baldurs Gate 3 in the last few years, but sometimes it’s just so hard to find the time to finish the games. I am in a similar boat, working a lot and I have two kids. So there isn’t much time. I finished Cyberpunk, and I’m about act 1 or act 2 in BG3 so far and loving it. But sometimes these games feel like they were made only for people with much more free time!"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I have gotten to the end of Act 3 in Baldur's Gate 3, 200hrs on one playthrough... and I've ground to a halt.

>!My Tav got turned into a mind flayer, sacrificing himself so that Orpheus didn't have to. Tav is a Paladin who would never let anyone else make that sacrifice. ...But now I don't like playing as a squidface 😞!<"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Totally understand and have the same issue here.

We have a 10 month old and a 3 week old. I'm still at the beginning of BG3. Have a handful of Batman games. Also have games on my PS4 as well that I wanna play. 

But work, the kids, time with the wife. Just can't seem to muster the drive to play."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"By not finishing CP2077, it's just like you suddenly left Night City. The only true way to win and beat NC"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"On the other hand. When you finally come up for air, all the games you missed will be on sale. r/patientgamers."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I was debating getting cyberpunk2077, but I just don’t finish games like I did when I was younger. 

I play more Apex if anything because it’s a nice quick game and I’m done."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"This is when you should be getting your gaming done lol, that 3 month old is gonna be mobile in a very short time and your game time will take a nose dive.   
That being said.  Doom Eternal, you can finish this if you arent a completionist in a rather quick time, like over a weekend or two with a few hours on sat / sun.   
I just restarted Cyberpunk 2077 and its a blast this time around.  I had quit it about half way through when it first came out.  I have 4 kids so I find time to play but yea I hear ya, if you want to keep enjoying gaming you have to have a different mindset than what you did before kids and a family."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,[deleted]
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"I played as a gunslinger and absolutely loved that game. But ya, the end was a bit slow"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Which mechanics may I ask? This game was great in every facet. I beat on hardest difficulty and enemies were never a problem for me.. Even the later game monsters. I love the fighting mechanics.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,That's a shame. The ending is really poignant. Only video game to ever make me tear up.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I love the game and the dlc, but there are way too many collectibles and just repetitive content. There are way too many fox dens especially, and they don't really add anything to the game for me. I'd just prioritize the main quests if I replayed the game, and whatever questlines of the side characters I liked. 

I definitely understand why you'd get burnt out trying to do everything in each area before continuing as a lot of the collectibles and freeing the encampments and such didn't add much to the game overall for me. The game really shined in the main storyline for me, with the exception that I did really like doing all the haikus as well."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Similar experience for me, except it was shortly after getting to the 2nd main area. I actually really enjoyed the 1st major area, but I had already unlocked all the skills I wanted and had fun with the various world activities. I wasn't necessarily sick of the game, but the novelty had worn off, and outside of the story itself (which I was only partially into), it felt like I was just going to need to do all the same things 2 more times, which didn't appeal to me."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"This was me, too. I tried 3 different times to play this game. Farthest I’ve made it was partly into Act II before I fizzled out. Combat was good. Raiding enemy camps was fun. But i kept getting so bogged down by mindless side quests that by the time i dove back into story missions I was tired of it."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I think this is the one I agree with most. I've never loved a game so much but been just so absolutely tired of it by the finish. Beat the game and stopped collecting collectible half way through, I had bought the dlc but have never even had a desire to start that since finishing."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Beautiful game, fun combat, and I felt side quests did a great job introducing you to the characters that essentially fight with you to the end. I beat it, but I was so burnt out by the end I wasn’t sure if I could play another open world game (ended up playing HFW and had a hard time putting it down, but that’s a different story). The biggest issue I had with GoT was the progression of the quests. Talk to quest giver, walk to horse, ride on horse, get off horse and inspect things, follow footprints, fight baddies. Rinse repeat. It got real fucking exhausting by Act 3. Love Sucker Punch, and loved GoT regardless; but I can totally understand why people got burnt out."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Starfield felt like it was missing the “magic” Bethesda managed to capture in Skyrim. Between the lifeless world and the dated mechanics, it’s a surprise how it made it through the playtesting phase"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I found the game much more fun once I stopped treating it like a Bethesda game. Normally (Skyrim, Fallout 3/NV/4) I just wander, do the side quests I find, etc. Like most people. In Starfield, I realized I had more fun if I gave myself an objective. Going to random planets was not rewarding. I don't mind the travel mechanics, I don't mind that most planets are fairly empty (that's just realistic), I just didn't enjoy it. So I did the faction quests. I explored special and unique locations (shoutout to The Collander, I loved that), but just did the story. 

But yeah, just not Bethesda's best. I enjoyed it, but it made me go back and play Fallout 4 and Skyrim more, and I already have hundreds of hours in each of those. So it is disappointing that Starfield won't get into that list."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"This was my exact playthrough experience. I like to do all the side quests first in an RPG so I have better gear and it makes the Main more interesting. Apparently this is the opposite way to play SF. By completing all the sides and making an OP ship early I felt like I kinda saw everything there is to see. I didn’t even feel like finishing the Main and was probably about 160 hours in, let alone NG+."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I saw the writing on the wall with Starfield when they did the 30 min. showcase of it back in late spring.  I played it on GamePass for a couple hours and that was enough for me.  What an absolutely average game.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I got about 4 hours into Starfield and it was incredibly boring.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"lol I did the exact same thing as you. A did a bunch of side missions and explored a couple planets but after a couple main missions, I lost interest"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,What a brave opinion thank you for sharing
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I uninstalled starfield for baldurs gate lol.  Then went and bought cyberpunk on sale and have been having 17x more fun than I had with starfield.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Nah dude... so many people for whatever reason (myself included) have played hundreds of hours and just b4 the end boss just hard quit.  It's a real phenomena with that game.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"the only thing i have left to do in botw is actually fight the last boss, but i haven't"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Has it put you off of Tears of the Kingdom?
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,It's a weapon durability simulator. Don't understand why they had to do this mechanic to cause weapons such as the Master Sword to break after using it for a few minutes of combat.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Nah I played it for like 10 hours and then just...stopped. I didn't think it was bad or anything...just like....I felt like I had seen everything I wanted to see and was already way burnt out on open world games.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I have gotten so close to the end of that BOTW twice then just dropped it. No idea why
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"to be fair, Zelda BOTW is a long game! and it isnt for everyone"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Me too . Quit before the end
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I love the game, but man Balteus makes me want to rip my hair out. I know the end bosses are crazy so I’ll probably stop there too unfortunately. I don’t have time anymore to fight a boss for six hours a night."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I thought that game was impossible to beat, that it's just ""git gud"" like in Souls. But no, with right equipment for each mission, it's a cakewalk. Like seriously you can tank everything with your face and you'll be successful with fights.   


Ever since I started to read online about missions and equipment I had no more issues with difficulty spikes."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Control lost me about 15 hours in. The combat started feeling samey. The maid were unclear.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,It would be a great way to end it and idk if you’ve played the sequel but now the story doesnt have to end after the dlc
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"The best part of the DLC, imo, was finding out where you were. The story was meh. The new enemies and weapon were fairly lame too. The setting was pretty cool though and the smoke was pretty cool visually."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,You should definitely finish it! The last boss is quite cinematic.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Completely forgot.. but I also never finished this one. To be fair, I had just moved to PC, but never felt like returning to it.

I'll probably play it again if the new one ever comes to PC."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Finished all of it on PS5, but not all of the Frozen North --- still have one more mega-bear to kill, and a half dozen miscs tasks to meet minor characters I don't GAF about. 

I started Forbidden West because I was tired of Zero Dawn - and I positively HATE the whole new skill system."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Oh yeah the performance issues especially in act 3 on both PC and PS5 made me not play it for like a month until I decided to finally just finish it. I’m hoping future patches will address this if they haven’t already.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,I'm struggling to get through the first act. I feel massively underleveled. Idk if I did a quest before I was supposed to. I went from the Grove to the guy who turns into a bear area and am stuck. I can't fight any of them or complete the missions he wants me to and when I went into the swamp to go to another mission I'm ambushed and killed.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,I stopped at act 3 as well. It is so big I didn't know what to do next. And then when I went back to play more a few weeks later I was totally lost.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"That sounds like snowrunner for me. Once you get majority of the vehicles and upgrades unlocked, you're kind of...done. and then I had performance issues where the game would stutter once every second, for 2 seconds, randomly throughout the game. Doesn't matter what kind of hdd/SSD it's on, just stutters and it drives me insane when I'm trying to haul a gigantic load up a slippery mud trail and the game stutters, which also cause any commands from the controller or keyboard to stutter as well."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"It took me a while to get through Disco. Love the game but similarly, things kept me from progressing at a brisk pace. Fortunately I was able to keep up with what I was doing but it still took months of slow playing to finish it. It was well worth it, so I hope you are able to find the time eventually."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"I feel you on this one. Kids and life make it hard to soak in all the details you need to really experience the game. 
One of these days I’ll get back round to it."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"To be fair, if you were trying to play it completely blind, some of those last steps near the end are really hard to figure out. I tried for hours to find out what I was supposed to do after killing Rom, I think, until I finally just looked it up. Getting to the end itself wasn't very intuitive."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I really liked this game up until the first 2 headed guy. Just couldn't figure it out, and the fact the save point was like 5 minutes behind, I just gave up."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I highly recommend finishing days gone. I thought it was whatever until the ending

Don’t get me wrong, it was fun, but the gameplay and missions became repetitive. The last few missions are so badass and emotional that it’ll fuck you up

I downloaded that game for free thinking I’d play it and forget, but it’s in my top 10 for sure"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Hanako has been waiting at embers for years on my OG save. She's waiting right now on my new 2.0 character, and will wait until Phantom Liberty is complete."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Same for me the first time I played the game at release.  The game asks you if you don't want to finish any sidequests before progressing and I realised I didn't care about any of the quests I had been doing so I just dropped the game . I recently went back to it though and ended up beating the game. I think the gameplay and rpg mechanics are much improved now, those patches really turned the game around for me."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"SAME! Lmao, but I went back and finished it before the new update came out and then started a new play-through, this way I can see a different ending."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I just started skipping cutscenes and mixing up the spells just to keep it interesting. It had very little sense of accomplishment.

Ohhh a big fight. Earn sword. Replace sword with better sword in 5 minutes.

Spent time honing my combat skills to have to do some crazy long “QTE” using skills you never had and never get a chance to master."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I beat bahamut, and even from the mission before you go to the kingdom to get this point, it was a slog. I beat him about 2-3 weeks ago and I really have no inclination to finish the game."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"This is my answer as well.  I played it on the PS3 and really enjoyed it, until I was turned into a vampire.  I found who can develop a cure, so I went out to gather all of the ingredients.  When I returned with everything in hand, I was told I was missing something even though I clearly had it in my inventory.  Turns out it was a bug in the game.

I looked online to see how to fix this, and the answer from Bethesda was that I needed to load the Game of the Year edition of the game to get past this.  I only had the standard edition.  I was furious.  I gave up, got rid of the game, and haven’t touched anything from Bethesda since."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,You missed out on the final step in the main quest being an escort mission...
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,For me it was GoW3. Couldn't get past Zeus
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"I finished it, but I totally agree. There were really good emotional parts, but the story was really held back by it's ties to the actual mythology. The first three games said ""fuck it"" to the mythology, but Ragnarok was a slave to it. The ragnarok battle was lame anyway."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Same. Got to the kids new friend who fights with chalk dust. Then just sort of stopped.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Same here tbh, while I won’t say it’s a bad game it’s certainly my least favourite in the series so far"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Black Flag is good, but I think it's greatness has been really over stated. I'm not a big fan of ship combat, but it works in that game and the story is just ok. My favorite part of that game was building up your pirate community. Getting to the end and having your own town that you've build up is really satisfying. Having a base/home city kind of thing is something the newer games need to do better. Valhalla has it but it's just meh. 

Try playing AC Unity. It's amazing now that it's been patched over the years. Also AC Origins is my favorite of the newer RPG style games. It's amazing as well."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,i struggled with this fight for like 48 hours with sleeping breaks in between
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Every player on Steam! Lol! I know it's me too, ha!"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I'm surprised you managed to finish you sente
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"When I finally beat it, I had no feeling of accomplishment. I was still mad."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"I have over 400 hours on this game, and it's one of my favorites, but I have never beaten it. I've been close like 5 times."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"This is what I do in RPGs specifically. I avoid the final boss. Grind until I’ve dominated everything else and then never go back to beat the main story villain. If I know I was going to beat him at level 65, there isn’t going to be any point at 99."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Are you me? Am I you? 

Can't even count on how many times I just did not want to/did not finish a game, because it was *so* good."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I beat the final boss in hogwarts legacy but hadn’t leveled up enough to get to the “final ending” and didn’t want to grind out side missions to get there so I stopped. But otherwise I enjoyed the game!
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,Doesn’t help that the whole game was a slog. Such a huge disappointment.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,Tina DnD knock-off feels like it is trying too hard.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"- Plin plin plon -

 - parry sound -  

- riposte sound -  

Repeat."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"if you passed through Ornstein and Smough, you can do the last one... it's pretty easy..."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I was struggling with him until I put on tanky armor and repeatedly parried him. It trivializes the fight.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Act 3 killed my enjoyment of the game. I struggled through but it was pretty miserable. I'm glad they're still patching it for people but I had such a bad time I don't even want to touch it again. Buggiest game I've played in a long time (mostly just in Act 3).
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I think a recent patch has fixed a lot of this! 

Disclaimer: I am only still in act 2, but my buddies say it ran well for them. Good luck!"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I put like 90 hours into it and I quit. Never finished the story. Xbox stats says my total progress is 79%
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Same, put a good 100 or so hours into the game, but after spending a few days on the stupid jelly dragon I was like “eh, fuck it.”"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"The concrete corridors and “its offices all the way down” can definitely get tedious; but I think the lore and combat mechanics really made that game special.



That and the Ashtray Maze."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I've replayed it a few times just to see some of the other options. I liked being Marcus and going fucking terminator mode at the protest
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Winter is not the last stage. You should give it another try!
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"The game really shines when you're playing as Arthur. If you ever feel like replaying it, I'd highly suggest spending a good amount of time in Chapter 2 or 3. Don't just progress the story; spend time in the open world, explore, go hunting/fishing, and do side quests/challenges. The best way to play, in my opinion, is to progress as far as you can in either Chapter 2 or 3 but leave Micah in jail or at his little camp after you rescue him. That way, you get access to most of the basic equipment unlocks, and most of the world is open to exploring.

The game definitely loses a lot of value once you start playing as John. He's a great character and was awesome in RDR1, but as a playable character, he just doesn't have as much life as Arthur does in this game. You're not really missing out on much with the epilogue besides the main missions. I think it's worth doing the epilogue up until the last mission at least once, though. It brings a nice finality and closure to everything."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Uncharted is my favorite series but God damn do I get annoyed when they bring some supernatural bullshit at the end of 1, 2, and 3. Was so happy they didn't do that in 4."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,Boy was that disappointing. I hated it. But found 2 and 3 much more enjoyable since I was already expecting some supernatural twist.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Try the select trick. Hit the boss. Pause. The bosses invincibility times out. Unpause. Repause.

The elec beam works best because it is so long."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Same. I wanted to do all of the shrines before the final boss, got burned out, never finished. 

Very fun, got my money’s worth plus some, but probably never gonna finish it out."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Happened to me with both games. I just can’t finish them for some reason.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Both games focus way too much on the mechanics of the game rather than the story imo.

The open world gets tiring unless you are into using the same mechanics across the world essentially. The building mechanic is fun but kind of takes away from what I wanted from the game which is a fun and cohesive story.

Seems like a fun project more than a great game. Once you play like 10-20 hours of the game, it’s all the same"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,The end drags a lot more in TOTK.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,You should finish it and beat Gannon!
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Oh man I have done this too many times in different games. Get to the last boss. ""Ah! I didn't finish all the sidequests!"" Sidequests aren't as interesting. Stop playing. Months later, realize I never finished the game."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,That 100% completion rule hinders you from experiencing the end of a great game.

Lol what"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Yeah.  I pushed through and beat the game but didn’t really care about the ending, just checked it off of my list."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I played ME1 2 times, ME2 8 tomes, ME3 1 time, Andromeda I never finished"

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I was pretty hyped on the spellcasting at first. There's a ton of room for neat combos and creative strategies, but the way it's used currently just boils down to the same three combos and you just apply the ""right"" combo to the ""right"" enemy."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Agreed. The core of the game is very strong and cool, but the environment, story and lack of difficulty just made it incredibly boring. Would love to see it used in a Shadow of Mordor type of game"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I really hope the second game focuses more on the school and exploration within it
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Yeah that’s just how AC games are. 

My favorite AC is the 2nd one, I haven’t been able to finish another since."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Same here but I actually preferred it included naval battles at sea that I really enjoyed a lot on odyssey as switch up from stealthy assassinating, all I seemed to ride the ship on rivers on Valhalla to land and pillage…tbh it’s little boring."

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I was so pissed because I didn't realize the assassin who attacks the empress in the prologue counts. I killed him but you are supposed to just keep blocking and he eventually gives up or something. Was so mad at the end
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"If you knocked out the ol lady near the end, it counted as a kill. Fucking pissed me off as I was going through pacifist and the fact that she glitches the save file, you had to start new and do it all again. Needless to say, I didn't."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,My wife has a hilarious story about dishonored. She was in the party and trying to knock someone unconscious on a pacifist run. She kept having people come into the room and having to knock them out too. Eventually she had a pile of bodies and still couldn't knock out the person she was there for and so in her frustration she decided to stop time so she could think about how to stop people from coming in the room long enough for her to knock the person out. It took her a second before she facepalmed and got it done xD There were a few more funny moments she has told me about and I wish I could've been there to watch but it was well before we met. She had a moment where she says it felt like Ave Maria should have played because she slowed time as a body she accidentally threw careened off of the balcony into the river and she tried everything to catch it and failed.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"This happened to me. On the very first mission a guard can die if they’re too close to the escape explosion. Mine was knocked out in a nearby dumpster, didn’t notice till no Cheevo popped"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"I finished the game when it first came out on console years ago and was disappointed that I got the high chaos ending.

I decided to pick it back up last year on PC after getting the game on sale and wanted to do a ghost no kill low chaos run, but when finding out that someone somehow died in a mission that I took days to complete (either high overseer or the cat brothel) and the last save point I had was at the very beginning of it, I essentially gave up out of frustration."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,Did they get eaten by rats while knocked out? I think that can happen and is probably the most common cause too
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Can't you still get a good ending but you have to minimize casualties? It doesn't have to be 0 kills
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"For real. I was getting the Clean Hands achievement and had the joy of watching as my stun mine killed a guard instead of knocking him out. 

This happened because the guard had seen a body, and came over at full sprint to investigate. He triggered the stun mine. Because he was running at full speed, the game kept his momentum going, which the game then treated as him being violently thrown onto the floor while unconscious, killing him.

I only noticed when I checked my stats - 20 minutes of gameplay later - to see how many coins I had for the level, and noticed. Couldn't figure out where I went wrong. Went back and searched the level for dead guards and found the pool of blood that had spread from the corpse. 

Thinking back on it the whole scenario makes me laugh"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"I think he is meaning when the guy who was helping you betrays you and takes Emily? He thought that was the end. Not sure if that's the part he means or not, but that's my guess."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Yeah just using the heart on them in the first half reveals that the royalist leaders are all really awful people so it’s not much of a surprise..
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,I recommend you try the first 3 Thief games + Fan missions. Dishonored is heavily influenced by Thief and has a bunch of easter eggs in it for Thief

27 times"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Yikes, complete opposite experience for me. Thoroughly enjoyed the first one, felt like a perfect Star Wars game in my eyes. But the second has been a major slugfest, and I've abandoned the game several times. Would love to finish it but I genuinely don't know if I ever will."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Honestly, I preferred the first."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Division 2 campaign was soooo fun. End game. No.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,I tried the raids in the division 2 when they came out. It was fun but definitely not worth continuing to grind for. My old mmo days are long behind me.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,I know the missions were repetitive but it felt so smooth in this game.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Not at all: I’m quite used to that kind of system from other games. It was purely the power creep and sponginess of enemies that made it not fun anymore. 

Id upgrade weapons and armor, be a level up on enemies, and be good, then go two missions and get curb stomped again."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Maybe I’ll give it a chance then!
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Div 1: The atmosphere is just amazing and better than in Div 2. 

Div 2: Better in every other aspect."

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I actually really enjoyed it, moreso than any of the other modern FF games. The character bonding I think is what sucked me in because all my boys left me irl 😢"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Aint that the truth. I enjoyed my time with it, and have wanted to do a new run now that all the dlc is out and I can play it with virtually no load times on my PC, but just... don't have any desire to."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,">annoying winter landscape where it was hard to see

That's literally just a small part of an optional late game area. Could go through that in what? 5 minutes?"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"It's as if the game wasn't meant to be played consuming all the content. I usually like to make sure I don't miss anything, but that backfired with Elden Ring and made it boring for me too.

On my next playthrough I literally only did the main quest with all the main dungeons only and that was way more enjoyable."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"So many times I have fought a boss 50 times in a row til I'm either going to smash my console or stop trying. 

Come back the next day and hit it on the first try.

Similar thing with guitar riffs or drum parts sometimes. It's a weird feeling."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,There are also ways to cheese basically every boss in Sekiro if you really can’t do it
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Sekiro was solid on the first playthrough, you’d constantly need to be better and actually learn some rhythm, but after 4x playthroughs (I did 3 playthroughs this week to get the platinum) it’s actually a lot easier than I remember - but I put that down to muscle memory, learning where things are, boss techniques and the fact that playthroughs 3 and 4 were NG+. Isshin was dope af, but that second phase still wrecked me.

Lies of P was like an easy version of Bloodborne up to the halfway point, then it cranks things up tenfold, to the point where it surpasses Bloodborne and DS3s DLC difficulty, it just didn’t feel balanced and every encounter became stressful, that was my problem, really.

I did a heavy/strength build."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I tried different methods, looked at videos etc - but no matter what I did and how much I practiced I couldn’t get a sense of progress. Tbh it was the last straw after going through that same arcade/mall, which was stressful. I might pick the game up again one day, but for now it’s being shelved."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I wouldn't let this one comment turn you away from the game. I had a hard time with that boss but got it after a little while of learning its patterns. I loved Lies of P and had a lot of fun with it, through and through"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"To be fair this is my personal experience and not everyone’s will align with mine. I’d say it’s at least worth trying, I just had a bad time after the halfway point. I’d look at reviews and other comments too."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Exactly! I don’t mind it being a difficult boss but at least make it fair - improve its patterns, improve its telegraphing and maybe get rid of the weapon break status. As a strength build I only carry the one weapon and I don’t have the time or energy to repair it every 15 seconds. Was a shame as I liked the design - reminded me of some of the beasty looking bosses in Bloodborne.

Oh and I nearly quit at the jester mini boss, you know the one."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"My man, you have like less than an hour left. May as well finish at this point."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"My dude, you're at the very end. Just finish it and start a Durge run lol"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"As a father with plenty of other things to waste my time on, I just went back to Cyberpunk 2077 this weekend and it is such a better game now that they updated it.  I think you could pull off finishing the game if you put a few hours in a week and still not lose interest in the setting / story."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,It did an excellent job building a world but also made you travel everywhere to complete quests. I feel like they could have shortened the main story a tad and i would have but much more motivated to finish it. I hope with Greedfall 2 they change some things
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,I played a mage and dabbled in guns. Mage is actually a lot of fun
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"The main one was that in order to pass some skill checks you would need your companions with their maxed skill sets. In one zone i got pretty far into it only to find that i needed to go grab a different npc and some of those zones were a slog with the loading zone far away. I also had my npcs always die playing on hardest difficulty, so it was a lot of running around. Thats why i turned the difficulty down which also made the game less fun. I’ll probably go back to it at some point, cause i did get close to the end (was about to crown the new high king)"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"One of my favorite story in gaming tbh, absolutely loved every bit of it, cried a bit too lol"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I heard that from a lot of people. I think I just wasted my time getting bogged down in other stuff in the game and just got burnt out. Maybe I’ll give it another go.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Truly felt like it lacked a lot of the love put into other games. Fallout 4 seems like the start of the downward slope in quality for Bethesda games.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"It’s not that the Bethesda magic is lacking, it’s that it isn’t magic anymore. People put up with bugs because they were making HUGE games that were far more interactive than everyone else. Now everyone is doing that and Bethesda is still doing Bethesda ass shit, bugs and all, expecting it to still be charming and funny. It isn’t. Your engine sucks, your way of making games doesn’t work anymore, and no one is chuckling along with Todd when he gives his lame ass excuses."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"This is how I was trying to make Starfield work for me. 

I didn’t dislike it but for all the hype that game got, it just isn’t worth playing more than once. 

Thank goodness for Game Pass, would’ve been a waste of $70"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"After playing Starfield for 9-10 hours, I went and played FO 4's DLC. Also made a new Skyrim file. So 100% get what you are saying  :)

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,oh damn i really thought i was the only one ahah
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"That interesting because I did the exact same thing.. for some reason once I started the trek into the castle, seeing rooms filled with difficult enemies, and the maze like map of over lapping levels I just didn't want to do it. I think that's the reason so many people quit. The difficulty and confusing areas in the rest of the game somehow feel more rewarding and less annoying maybe? Because it's not all crammed into a long labyrinth you have to preserve through."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,The last boss is arguably the weakest part of the game and pretty anticlimactic if you’ve done everything else so… you aren’t missing a lot other than checking the box.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Nah. Im planning on playing that soon during winter break most likely. i just feel like zelda requires SOOO many hours of constant play time and since ive been in college i just dont really have the time!
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,This was exactly the reason I got frustrated and stopped playing. Enjoyed it until this aspect was too much of an annoyance to me. totk looks great but I can’t bring myself to buy it after not finishing botw
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Equip the pulse rifle “bubble gun” melt his shield then get up close in his face and bash the fuck out of him. They’ve also nerfed him a bit since launch so it’s a little easier to beat.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I would say Balteus was the hardest wall in the game. Other fights were hard for me (and maybe some were harder in a vacuum), but by the time I reached those fights I had more tools to play with. You're also better able to make an AC that really fits your playstyle by then as well, and that helps immensely"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"He's intentionally hard bc it teaches you how you should approach most AC fights, i.e. be aggressive as hell.  Do all trainings and arena fights to get all OS upgrades (get the kick and thenbget better resistance to damage and/or stronger damage output).  

When you fight him, stay close, use hard lock, and never use boost to the point that you can't dodge incoming shotgun or bazooka hits.  You can always cheese it by building a high AP build + gatling guns.  

Once you get better weapons and OS tunes, you will realize he's super easy to beat.  You WILL get better once you implement kicks, boost management, hard locking, and OS tunes."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Oh damn balteus isn't even that bad. It's a DPS check at worst.   


The real motherfuckers of AC6 are the ""Protect this building"" missions where you have a structure to defend with enemies coming at you from multiple directions and if you fuck up slightly the mission is done."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"In that game you pretty much decide the difficulty slider with each part your build has. It's normal that people can't Balteus bc the garage doesn't have much stuff to assembly yet, everything else you can trivialize with just the right build"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,That's your own fault.. You have different powers for different approaches. Combat on control is amazing.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"I haven't yet! My gf has, and she liked it. I need to see if i can check it out from the library. I'm in a stage where I am not letting myself buy games very often right now"

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Fuckin rip, my dude. Oblivion is such a great game despite the bugs. I had gotten this bug many years ago. Luckily, I had a dlc house that had a separate cure for vampirism, if I am remembering right. Skyrim is also a solid game, of course. But I get it."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Gow3 is the greatest gow in my opinion
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Totally agree. The sailing and the looting ships is fun for a bit but I’m starting to get bored and the main storyline isn’t doing much for me
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"It benefited a LOT from being an ok entry when the previous and next  AC entries were controversial at best. Remember this came out between 3 and Unity. Not hard to look great up against the rush job and amazing faceless revolution.

Add in the ship combat and exploration and you've got a game that was really good at the time but really hasn't aged well. I tried replaying it last year and only got maybe 6-8 hours in."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I feel you. I don’t know want devs can do. I wouldn’t want them to scale the final boss. But after reaching level infinity, and the game keeps trying to sell me on the boss being the most dangerous thing in the land.

Maybe if the villagers started saying things like “hey thanks for finding my 58 dust mites, but it would be great if you can save my entire world. Then come back and help me mow my lawn.”"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Yeah same here

But I now got into the habit of playing them after the hype train has departed and a major patch has been issued. It just can be a bit difficult to avoid spoilers tho lol

But this way I do have a smoother gaming time, and less games being ruined by bumpy launches that makes me meh about a game I would have loved if I waited. But yea, I do miss the hype trains sometimes tho lol"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,One of my favorite games all time. Control's atmosphere is simply unmatched. The rest is also very well put together.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Same, except I DID do all of the shrines and explored all of the Depths before burning out. Oh well, evil can roam unchecked for all eternity, I guess."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"If you ever get the itch again, start a new game, play for an hour or so and then go back. Helps to refresh the old vibes."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"I recommend skipping the last few shrines and doing the boss though, otherwise you miss one of the best sections of the game. I couldn't be bothered with the last 15 shrines, as after over 130 of them, plus the ones in BoTW, they are too samey."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Same here. Personally hated BOTW (hot take, ik), but still filled out the map and pretty much locked in the “go to the castle and finish this up.” Just didn’t care enough knowing you just fight the same 4 lame bosses again then Ganon. 

Absolutely loved TOTK… happy that the bosses and dungeons felt unique again, just never finished it. Got to the same point of “go to the castle and wrap it up.” It’s a shame since I absolutely love the Zelda series, but the new open world motto burns me out before I can actually *beat* the game."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Is it because you are trying to complete everything before finishing the game? This seems to be where a lot of burnout exists for people. But those elements in the game don't really exist to be 100%'d. I mean, sure, if you're having a blast and want to keep going, then get it all done. But a lot of it exists purely to ensure that no matter where you go that there is something to do. 

I found myself just chipping away at exploring the world in BOTW and then had to snap myself out of it, because I never would have actually gone after the final boss. 

So with TOTK, I do a fair amount of exploration, got through all of the temples and then went after the final boss. Then, after that, I realized I still wanted to play the game. So I went back and did a lot of the side stuff that I had skipped until I had had my fill. Ended up playing for 150 hours, and I'm satisfied with that."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Probably because the main content isn’t all that amazing and kinda secondary to the experience
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Definitely agree, I miss the stronger emphasis in story and linear progression in the games. It’s a shame this open world motto is so highly regarded, since I just can’t get into it as much as I could the other games."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"This happened to me in both botw and Totk. 

Played them , explored, beat all the “dungeons”, but never cared to finally beat the boss in either of them. 

 by the time I’d played everything and seen the world I wasn’t invested in anything to do with the story so just lost interest by that point. 

Their good games, but their not good zelda games imo. They took all the open world aspect and none of what made it zelda. You don’t even have to “play” the game to beat the final boss, you can just roll right up to it. 

Those games are truly the journey is the experience, and that leaves no motivation to finally reach the destination."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Doesn’t help that it’s very, very easy to completely spoil what little story there is within the first few hours. And then you spend the rest of the game being annoyed by it."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"For both Dragon Age and Mass Effect, I finished the first 2 games optimizing the storyline to what I would like to happen in the respective worlds. Then in the third game I would try to optimize and follow through on those plots in game and finish all the side quests and DLC before going into the ""endgame."" But everytime without fail I'd just lose interest by that point. 

As an added factor of difficulty picking it back up again, I can't really recall the story when I do revisit the save files. I'd try to pick it up with new characters with the save data of the two previous games but also just lose interest. One day I'll put aside the shiny new games and force myself to finish it 🤞🏾"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,It just feels like a watered down rpg for a non-gamer audience and this is fine but I couldn't finish it either.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Soo your complaint is you used three combos? Instead of the others and that's what your crying about. Honestly nothing worse than dumb criticisms. ""I don't like this game cos I used only 3 combos"""
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"As far as environment is concerned, I have to disagree. They did an incredible job building Hogwarts and Hogsmead. I can agree there definitely isn't as much love put into the outer surrounding hamlets/outdoor areas, but the main areas were lovingly well crafted. Hell, if you're a Hufflepuff you get a glimpse at Azkaban. 

It's a great jumping off point for the game, and I hope they're able to put in as much work and attention to the rest of the world as they did at Hogwarts and Hogsmead."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I couldn't finish the second one. Literally couldn't. 

Got the final map piece. Walked into the room. Put the piece on the map. Went to talk to them. ""Go ahead, put the piece on the map."" It was waiting for the action of me putting the map piece on, instead of the map piece being on the wall. I was locked out. And it had autosaved.


I wasn't going to play it all the way through again for the ending. Sucked so hard."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"I bought everyone from Origins on during the PSN sale in like end of 2020. Played about 10 hours of Origins and just got overwhelmed. Almost like ""I have to play 3 more games? I'm not into this."" And just never went back."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,I almost gave up on AC after Valhalla and was unsure about Mirage. But I have to say I’m enjoying Mirage and how they went back to what I enjoyed about AC
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Yeah, I prefer Odyssey over it for that reason."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"To each their own, but that is the reason I quit playing. Just not for me."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"The raids got boring after doing a couple of them because they were all the same. And some of them were buggy, it would take forever for someone to come over and help open the chests."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Yeah, the premise of this franchise was stealthy assassins. Thats why many people fell in love with it. That died after Syndicate, Origins was pretty good, but Odyssey and especially Valhalla were just atrocious, dull and boring with a dead map for the sake of having a big map and nothing else. I still love the AC franchise for the historical lore and everything, that has to do with Assassins. But to blame people, that want to play Assassins (!) Creed and not For Honor is not a good look."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"This happened to me in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, enemies in the tutorial count when you don't really have non lethal weapons during that segment. I even managed to save the pilot when you have the option of abandoning her :("
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,This might have been it for me.  I remember checking a ton of saves and couldn't find the kill.  I just figured it happened on the first couple levels.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,Lol that last scene is amazing
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,To be honest if you use the heart on pretty much anyone it shows them and sketchy at best
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Right? I respect people who play PvP and endgame but I can't really find a way to enjoy them. 

I am a first responder and emergency manager I don't know if that is why it hits me different"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"If you were playing around a certain time (I can’t remember which update, maybe 1.3-1.4) it was BAD with the bullet sponge and almost made me quit too actually. So I feel your pain lol"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,That’s one way to do it. Another is to betray them when on missions
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Challenge run
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Open up console, ""killall"" close console"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Thats what the X-01 armor is for!
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"That’s when you have to abuse the glory that is Bethesda’s AI, find a room and kill them one by one as they come to the door as if you were a pro wrestler fighting off 20 guys… and If you’re on PC the handy “debug” console can be readily abused to do all sorts of stuff."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"They basically decided to lean into their bad reputation after that one synth shot up Diamond City's noodle stand. Like, yeah, that's rough, can't bring back the dead, but maybe fix their decrepit infrastructure and they'll understand it was an accident.

Would probably take like a weekend for the sparkling white labcoats to fix their water situation so that a literal kid wouldn't have to."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,I hate it when games do this. Why put the best loot/gear/guns all the way at the end? There's no point in getting it if you can't use it.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Rdr was the first game I've ever 100%. I got the legend of the west outfit and was then thinking ""OK, what do I do now?"" Then I shut it off until I played undead nightmare, 100% that one too, got whatever 100% completion prize it was then did the samething ""OK, what do I do now?"""
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I know it’s “lore accurate” or whatever but it’s so dumb that you can swim for the first 90% of the game and then touching water = insta death for the last 10%.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"John can’t swim in either, right?"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,r/whoosh
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,The party dynamics and how they all interacted was just amazing
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Is the world still quite empty? The lack of npcs made me feel so lonely in the world. Was such a shame
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-13,"Once you run through an area as fast as you can, skipping everything around *there's something very clearly wrong*"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I agree and I should have done it different. I'm a bit like the dog who chases the car though. If I see it I chase. I didn't want to miss anything quest wise or even dungeon if they dropped and item etc. Glad you had a better experience that way and if I play through it again I might have to slap myself to stay in line and not fall off the main path for a better experience as well.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"I got lost at every turn and did everything the wrong wqy around.

I'm at the end boss, which is a big blob I won't enjoy fighting so who knows if I'll ever finish, and I still only have the one half of each elevator key. I had materials to upgrade many weapons from good to insane but none for meh to decent. Seriously, I had to look up three dungeons just to get a second weapon past useless.

Many times I got stuck until I finally found a path I hadn't taken before and it turned out to be the sensible way to pøaces I had already been! Then there are all the npcs I've never met before that greet me with ""I see you took my advice about the horrid bridge"", which wouldn't be so bad if I didn't spend hours searching in vain for ""along the oath east, then past the shack"".  
Apparently I couldn't find shit in my ass with a feast and a colonoscopy but I can stumble into the hidden lair of a secret society without performing any of their sacred rites.

My exploration has been both rewarded and punished, and both are so frustrating"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Ya I enjoyed subsequent playthroughs more then my first, mostly because I would know what kind of build I wanted and which dungeons would have stuff I actually wanted.

So many dungeons and caves would just end up being a waste of time, as the reward for doing them would end up usually being something I didn't need."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"it wasn't. It made things verry optional and out of the way. Even the opening of the game is driving home the fact that you dont have to do everything.

I didnt do the tutorial area until after i was at luneria. and half way through steamrolling everyone i realized it wasn't even necessary and kept it trucking.

I didnt do mt gelmir and the volcano manor until ng+. On on my second playthrough i sidetrack even less."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"In souls-like games, I've always had this weird tendency to do really well on my first attempt at a boss and then struggle for the next several or several dozen attempts. I think it's because when you haven't seen the mechanics before, you play a lot more conservatively and cautiously, and once you understand the fight, you can become a bit overconfident and take unnecessary risks. It's probably a similar idea when you spam a fight for a while and begin pressing too much. Sometimes a break is what you need."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,I feel ya then. Just give it a break and come back to it. Im sure you will smash that green fuck in due time
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"If you need it to be easier that’s fine, but don’t frame it as though the difficulty is unfair and something is wrong which needs to be set right. The game requires practice and planning"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I think about this game so much, it was such a unique setting and such a train wreck of facial animations"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Yeah.. You miss out on alot of things with companions if you don't do this, go there, it is a slog when it comes to companions. I never had them die though. I may have this was a while back. I'm first nations so this game really resonates with me. Glad you enjoyed."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Tbh man don’t start over. Just finish where you left off and do it in NG+. If you have to start grinding for skills again you’re probably gonna burn out. I’ve done up to NG+3 and also started a fresh run and the fresh run is the only one I didn’t finish.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"I think if you enjoyed playing in the world and those early areas so much it wasn't a waste. I definitely felt the same slog coming at the end. 

That said the third area is very short and just finishing up the story/zone would probably take only a couple hours. 

It is worth seeing to the end."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I completely agree. While Fallout 4 wasn’t the beginning of procedural generation via radiant quests, it relied on them too much. Starfield takes it a step further with procedurally generated maps that lack personality"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Nahhh, I played Oblivion for the first time in 2021 and that games an absolute banger, love it to pieces. They've shifted the focus away from that juicy mix of tailored content and living ecosystems and so it's stopped being fun."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"It's missing the random wandering and finding new things to do, explore and pickup. You just load instead."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Same here, literally quit just before Ganon at his tower, I can't explain it. A few years later I watched the final boss on Youtube."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Definitely a fair point, I'm very much the same with just not having enough free time to commit."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"There is a ton of content but you don't have to do a lot of it to beat the game.

In both BotW and TotK I did a lot of optional stuff, got most of the shrines, upgraded some armors, and then the final fights were very easy. I'm not a completionist, but I also know that once I beat the game, I'm pretty much done. So I basically played as much optional stuff until I just started to get bored then decided to wrap things up"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Too many Zelda sycophants out there who defend this nonsense. The Master Sword is a legendary sword that shouldn't break in ordinary combat, period."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I can get him down to 20% health if everything goes well, then it’s one mistake and I’m dead."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Maybe it's the hardest based on the fact that players are still beginners by that point of the game, but IBIS and the last boss of the FoR ending (I won't say its spoiler name) really get players stuck too"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I platinum’d ac6 and now think he’s a cake walk. But I’d be wrong to say he isn’t probably one of, is not the hardest boss in the game. No one took longer than my first run in with him. It’s done on purpose and with reason."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Insert shrug emoji here
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,By the end the only effective combat is throwing shit at enemies. Takes too long with even the most upgraded weapons otherwise.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,Yep performance on Ps5 is a LOT better now!!
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"See, the sailing and ship battle/upgrading was peak fun for me. Plus taking down the legendary ships was a legitimate challenge. I spent most of my time sailing (and drinking rum IRL). Having actually sailed in the Caribbean, it was also slightly nostalgic."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Add me to the list of people who got their money's worth but didn't finish.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Ugh the depths are what made me quit, I hate them so much. Still want to fully explore them but it feels like such a CHORE"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,[deleted]
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Slight spoiler for BotW, but if it makes you feel any better/more motivated to finish. You only fight the blight ganons prior to calamity ganon IF you didn’t defeat them in the divine beasts. Otherwise, calamity ganon’s total starting health gets reduced based on the number of divine beasts you completed"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"It’s the shrines for me. Looking for them and completing them take up a large portion of the game, and I don’t care for meaningless puzzles. I’d rather be out and about fighting monsters or navigate through crazy looking maps and dungeons. There seemed to be way more stumbling through shrines than actual adventures."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I can understand that completely.  I see it differently (especially the sequel), it's the sandbox experience that I've been waiting for since I was a kid & a technical darling."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"On the positive side, it was my wife's first action-rpg type game and it was absolutely perfect for her, it taught her some basic video game fighting mechanics and opened up her taste in games quite a bit."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"The environment was great but every quest took you away from the castle or hogs mead. Add in the fact they canceled Quidditch and it was a little frustrating.

All the cool stuff I loved and wanted more of was the castle, teachers and classmates. Each quest kept sending me to some cave/dungeon not in the castle. 

Went to one class for each professor learned a spell and you were done."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"For me, the environment also includes the NPCs and how lively and believable it feels. The nature and buildings are incredibly beautiful, you're right. But the people feel dead and uninteresting."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I have a handful of playthroughs and saving Malik was always a pain for me for some reason, even going in with heavy guns."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,I was so fucking mad the first time I beat the game and that achievement didn't pop.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Always save malik, best girl out there."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,I wish I could have watched it happen but I have to settle for her recounts of it.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Oh this was like the last few months. It went on a stupid sale with The Division 2 a few months ago for like $10.
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-13,"Uh, not really? It's an open world game, and this is a purely optional late game area. The player is free to explore it thoroughly, or to try and get through the snow storm as quickly as possible. Both are completely fair methods, and neither method is punished.

Now sure, if *every* player just wanted to get it over with asap it's an issue, but that absolutely isn't the case."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Yeah breaks sometimes make all the difference. The amount of Souls bosses that I’ve been sweating over all night only to get it first or second try the following day are uncountable. 

I might go back to it one day, but it won’t be anytime soon. Will probably get it on sale as I played it on game pass (which I no longer subscribe to)."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"I dont think the facial animations ever bothered me, because the outfits and the world design was do good. But im also a person who like Mass Effect Andromeda with all the janky animations, so…"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"If you follow his advice go to setting then gameplay (I think this is where it is) and at the bottom you have an option to reset tips.  It'll really help you get back into the game.  Don't go into a camp or anything, just run the roads looking for random groups and practice combat.

Also most skills/attacks are unlocked with points, so go to the points and read through everything you already unlocked.  Not all at once, but go through them trying everything out."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Oh look, another abandoned factory...

Great, a bunch of junk laying around that's useless?

Level up skills to build.. shitty factories that aren't really useful."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Stay close to him so you can either jump up or go underneath his fire swords.  Being mid range allows his tracking to hit you, which usually one shots weaker builds.  Hard lock so it's easier to dodge his attacks"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Oh yeah those gave me trouble as well, but I felt better equipped to deal with the challenge so it didn't *feel* as brutal.

But obvs that's just my experience"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,True.. Very true
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Something must have been wrong for you... My pierce, grip, and charge especially the charge forms were enough for all enemies even in the DLC I stopped throwing things unless needed be. Even in the hard ass arcade mode my guns were doing huge damage."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Botw I can say the ending is not really noteworthy, but the last couple of hours of totk are worth it for the music and spectacle alone"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Dude told on himself, seems they’re more a “lookin it up and complain” sorta player I guess."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"Been awhile since I played and am pretty much in the same spot as the earlier comment, need to do one more divine beast and then Gannon. But how do you... not fight the boss of each beast? I thought they have to be defeated for the beast to shoot it's laser at ganons forcefield?"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"My wife is a huge Harry Potter fan, and she was/is so excited to play it. This is her first action-rpg video game as well. She's on her 2nd play through and still loves it. As someone mentioned below, I may show the Horizon games because I love those games."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"What's up next for her? I imagine maybe Horizon would be good from there. Witcher (esp 3) is great, but I think that might be a bit of a jump from HL. Maybe Jedi: Fallen Order? Could also go classic with KoTOR....Fable maybe?"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,"That's super true and kind of the biggest issue. I really hope there is a sequel that goes deeper into actual classes and using their well built areas more in quest lines. A lot of us (myself included) went into it wanting a bigger focus on actually participating in the Hogwarts student experience, and it was very bare bones."
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,I would have been more than happy if the entirety of the game took place in the castle and hogsmeade. The outlying areas were cool kind of. But I wanted way more in depth story taking place in the grounds

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,Maybe. Pierce was also somewhat effective. I was pretty bored of the game by the end.

It doesn't return. There also is no force field around Ganon, you can go to te castle straight away with 3 hearts and your undies to ask Ganon what's good. What they're doing in that cutscene after defeating the blight is taking aim. Think of that laser as a laser sight."

18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-11,"Great choice! Have you guys tried Deep Rock Galactic yet? It's a great co-op game! Also, if she likes more actiony, could get into Gears of War co-op with you. God of War could also be a sp rpg for her at some point!"
18fw2f2,2023-12-11,2023-12-12,My girlfriend loved watching me play the original Gears of War. She'd get so psyched whenever I chainsawed a locust.

c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,"After last the last few months of really cool free games, I was pretty bummed about July's lineup. But if what you say is true...Dayyyuummmm!"
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,Its bullshit. Looking forward to PES as im sick of EA and the bollocks on fifa. They should give you two picks from a choice of 3. Everyone would be happy then.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,Oof. I like Quantic Dream a lot but I was excited for PES.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,You’re free now
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,Not when you already own Detroit: Become Human
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,Awww yuss! It was on my buy list!
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,I just fucking bought Detroit Become Human. Damnit!
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,"Bruh, I bought this game last week only to get it for free :("
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,"I haven't plugged in my PS4 yet, what?"
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,Literally just spent 7 bucks on this. I was ready for PES.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,My ps4 died while i was downloading Detroit :(
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,"""Throw your hands in the air, like you just don't care!"""
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,Everyone slightly interested either already played it or watched Jacksepticeye do a play through
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,Took me a while to realise what PES is supposed to stand for. Kept thinking of [this](https://youtu.be/dNJdJIwCF_Y)
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,Already own the game. Happy others get to experience this gem as well. If a game needed dlc or a sequel it would be this one.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,That sucks. Was way more interested in PES
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,Have you ever tried pes
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,What kind of game is Detroit? Is it a walking story sim or is it more like the telltale games?
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,That game is trash and boring
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,"Give us multiple choices and let us pick two, so we’re not forced to pay £50 a year for a shitty David Cage game and a mobile port."
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,F
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,Good I mean Detroit become human is whatever but it is better than any fifa game
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,TWENTY EIGHT STAB WOUNDS!!!
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,**STRESS LEVEL CRITICAL**
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,He was stabbed 28 times..........with a bat!
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,You can easily get an older FIFA game at GameStop for like 10€/$.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,And it's the Digital Deluxe version with Heavy Rain included!
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,"Yeah, I just added it to my library!"
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,"Konami is even worse than EA, so no thanks."
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,Take it or leave it
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,"Yeah but you can still have fun playing Detroit, whereas the rest of us can't have fun playing a sports game."
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,"PES is good, but I don't think games that have annual releases should be on ps plus. PES even has a free Lite version that you can download."
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,I was excited too. Long time since I had a football game to play.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,PES 2019: Pro Evolution Soccer. Rehashed annual release of sports title got replaced for a high quality game.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,It did not want to Become Human.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,I haven't
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-14,"Wrong.  I got to the washing dishes part and sent it back to Gamefly but my son, an avid FPS player claimed it was really good.

So I got it for free and he was right, it is awesome."
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,Go watch a fucking youtube video.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,"It’s like a walking sim with a lot more QTEs. The graphics are quite nice, but the story is laughably bad especially at the climax."
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,"Detroit Become Human? Yes I agree, it’s one of the worst games I’ve ever played. PES is quality too so this is a shame. Oh well, it’s free can’t complain about that part of it but it is a massive downgrade."
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,Long-eared or Pipistrelle?
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,[deleted]
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,Cool! Although Heavy Rain was free last year at some point. Still great to grab for us lovers of story driven games.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,Ive added it to the library still. Might be a great game but I wanted to give PES a go before new fifa out.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,Hence they should give a choice. I enjoy sports games and that was what they announced so they should stick to it or at least tell us why they changed it.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,"That's a fair point. I like PES for the moment to moment gameplay, though I can probably still play 2018 and not miss much. It's fun to jump on and play for half an hour or so, whereas Detroit: Become Human seems like a more enduring experience that will stick with me long after it's over. My wife is excited for it for sure. I was personally pumped for PES 2019 and I didn't know Sony had changed the lineup until I saw this thread so I was mega disappoint."
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,"I meant what as in, Sony have free games?"
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-04,"I don’t want spoilers, so I thought would ask the friendly community lol"
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,"Imagine thinking PES, an annual repetitive sports game, is better than Detroit Become Human"
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,"Yeah it should have been always free, I paid $60 for that game, but for this community is a master piece."
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,FIFA 16 used in most places is ~2€. 17 is ~5€. If that's too much then I don't think it's worth being even mildly upset about.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,"If you just want one to play VERY rarely then I can definitely understand being reluctant to pay for a copy.   
  
If you DO start to think you might want a more recent one then there are some cheap options; my local CEX has FIFA 17 for £1, Fifa 16 for 50p or PES 16 for like £1.50. I don't know anything about these games (I'm not a football fan) but I always notice how cheap they are when I go into the store."
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,"I was absolutely enthralled by Heavy Rain. Can't wait to play this, it was next on my to buy list!"
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,"I picked up PES a few months ago cheap on steam, it’s probably the worst feeling football game I’ve ever played, but then again I always preferred fifa so maybe that’s what’s hindering my open mindedness with that"
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,Yeah PES or FIFA are games that you can just jump onto whenever you're bored for like 30 minutes. Or if you're waiting for something it's a fun time killer.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,If you subscribe to playstation plus ( which you'll need to do to use most games online features) you also get 2 games per month for free as long as your ps plus membership is active
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,"If you have PS Plus membership they give you ""access"" to certain games.

Basically you need to be subscribed when it's made available, and claim it, the titles change monthly.

You also need to be subscribed to play it."
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,Imagine defending the pile of shit that is Detroit Become Human.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,Did you play What Remains of Edith Finch 🤤
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,Heavy Rain was next level storytelling. Loved every second.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,"Im probably a bit older than you but from about 2002 until about 2006 PES was miles ahead of fifa. So much, that i still use PES button layouts on fifa."
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,Also: Rocket League. Games are only 5 minutes long so you don't have to be invested for any real amount of time.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,Gotta look into it now
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,How much is it ?
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,So probably better to buy the games I plan to get instead since I only plan to get a few solo games for now. I prefer keeping my games.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,"I have not, I completely forgot it existed. Now I’m even more behind on things. 😱"
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-04,"I stopped playing fifa when I went active service, so the last game I played was World Cup 98 and then came back in about 2009ish to fifa games, fifa16 is still my favorite but missed out the last few since my team got relegated from the epl and only just got back in so I’ll be buying the next one in a couple of months lol. I like the sound of these old pes games, which was the best in that era?"
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,Depends on where you live. Have a look at your local price comparison website and see what they can offer.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,If its downloaded to your system you keep the game. You only have a month to download it. But it stays on your system and you can redownload it later on I believe. But once you cancel playstation plus or don't have internet access you can't play the games.
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-03,"You also need to subscribe to play games online, like Xbox Live. It's $60 for a month but there are a few times a year you can get it for $50 or maybe even $40. I'm set to May of 2021, myself.

It's pretty good. If nothing else if you've nothing to play at least there is something to try each month. The games can be hit or miss but there is the occasional good surprise and it can be nice to try something you might not normally buy. It had Yakuza Kiwami late last year and I hadn't considered it before but after playing it recently I'm going to get the rest of the series eventually."
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,"Heh no worries, it was a free game for...May I think? It's a sequel (prequel?) [loosely related?!] to their previous game, The Unfinished Swan. Awesome Easter egg in there if you've played Swan."
c8dk03,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,"I might have grabbed it and just not dloaded it then. Either way, onto the list it goes!"
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,"Well, just play the previous games then: Fahrenheit, Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls "
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,"I have always liked Telltale and their games. Their biggest problem is that your choices don't really affect the story that much as in the Detroit game. But still the experience with some of their games are unique. I recommend The Wold Among Us and the first season of The Walking Dead   ( this was even voted as the game of the year back when it was released).

Life is Strange is a good alternative too."
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,"Until Dawn is amazing, its by far the best game of the Dark Pictures anthology. iirc they are remaking it too? A couple of those games id say are downright poor though. Man of Medan for example was pretty ass"
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,"Any game made by Telltale, Quantic Dream, or Supermassive."
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,"If you are ok with horror, I'd recommend looking into Until Dawn, or games from the Dark Pictures Anthology. To be honest, I haven't played them myself, so I don't know how good they are, but in terms of games where you are playing a movie, similar to Detroit: Become Human, they are a pretty close match."
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,"heavy rain, made by the same devs"
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,The Wolf Among Us would probably be my favourite in that sort of genre.
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,"Indigo Prophecy is made by the same team, although, it is quite a bit older. Still holds up imo."
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,"The guys that made that game made a few others that are good, beyond two souls and heavy rain."
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,Plague Tale
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-28,"As Dusk Falls is a recent one, worth checking out. It’s from people who worked at the developer of Detroit and created their own new studio. 

Trailer: https://youtu.be/nWY_XLn2TR0"
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-28,"Jason?

…

Jason?"
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-29,What remains of Edith finch
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,Sounds like you'd love the Uncharted franchise. It's like 90% cutscene (sometimes with QTEs).
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-28,"Honestly, what is the pleasure playing interactive movie games with little to non gameplay?

I think that´s why Telltale went bankrupt because they had too many of them which bored players after some time."
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,Well damn! I feel silly now. Thanks for this!
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-28,Isnt beyond two souls the really bad one that everyone hates or was it one of the other early ones.
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,Right on! I forgot about Life is strange. I have both on PS5. Thx!
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-28,"Until Dawn was so fun to go into mostly blind. They released a new game called ""The Quarry"" which seemed okay? I watched a youtuber play it, and it was okkkkayyy. Like even if I had played the story would have been mid. 


As for the others, Little Hope and House of Ashes interesting, if nothing else. Vastly different games tho haha."
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,Great idea. My buddy mentioned this one to me this weekend.
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,Shaun!!!
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,I’ll take a look. Thx
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,Yes! Loved that one. I should start the new one.
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,Yes I do!! It’s great but haven’t played the newest one with the female lead. I wonder if that is any good?
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-06-01,"it's a genre lol. it's choice based , so it's not going to be the same as a FPS type game. Also, in the game detroit become human there is actually a lot of gameplay in it"
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,Unfortunately Detroit is kind of the best of the bunch for David Cage movie/games. The rest are definitely worth playing (Heavy Rain is almost as good narratively as Detroit I say) but the quality will be wildly variable.
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-28,"It was the one before Detroit with Willem Dafoe and Elliot Paige. I thought the story was good enough just like the other games. Heavy Rain was the one that spawned the ""Shaun"" meme, and Fahrenheit was the janky PS2 game that tried something new."
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-27,Np! I really like this genre of gaming and I'm kinda disappointed that bigger companies aren't releasing more games like this :/.
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-28,One of the best!
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-28,"I really liked Heavy Rain at the time, it just happens to have the single worst plothole I've ever seen"
1d1w6nz,2024-05-27,2024-05-29,"Yeah I've watched someone play Heavy Rain, the Shaun thing is hilarious"

8nbssj,2018-05-30,2018-05-31,She goes nuts and shoots up the joint.
8nbssj,2018-05-30,2018-05-31,Curious on what you mean as a nose dive?
8nbssj,2018-05-30,2018-05-31,"I was really loving the game up until it shifted focus away from the Connor/Hank buddy cop and the Kara/Alice aspects to Markus. From there the game kinda went a bit over the top, unfocused, and the theme was kind of lost. Which is an absolute shame, because there's so much the game does right, and, again, I was pretty much loving it up to that point.

Spoilers below:

[My biggest problem is how Markus is granted the power to 'awaken' fellow androids by touching them. At the same time  it seemed like NPC androids behaved more like, well, machines instead of slaves. Prior to that, when the focus was mostly on player androids, it felt a lot more like androids, like Kara and Connor, were fully sentient and had simply had to come to terms with the fact that they felt emotions and were just as 'alive' in a sense as the humans around them. Compared this to the NPC androids who acted like simple machines and they just don't seem human. It really takes away from the idea that androids are just as alive as people and deserve the same respect when a character literally has to imbue them with sentience. The fact that they act as mindless drones that barely even react before Markus 'awakens' them directly contradicts the idea that they are innately thinking and feeling as we are. ](/spoiler)


There were also some smaller things that felt off, but that's my biggest single complaint with the narrative."
8nbssj,2018-05-30,2018-05-31,"Quantic Dream games are infamous for falling apart later in the story even if they have stellar parts.

I haven't yet beat this so I can't say how crazy it gets but I'm waiting for the story train to jump the tracks."
8nbssj,2018-05-30,2018-05-31,[Test comment making sure I have the spoiler tag right](/spoiler)
8nbssj,2018-05-30,2018-05-31,"[One issue is that your seeing it as awakening them rather then breaking them free. As you can see anytime an android becomes able to think for themselves they have to struggle to break down a wall rather then wake up so in theory they are all able to think on their own just not able to act on them unless there is some stimuli that gives them the strength to break down the wall. Another thing you need to think about more is that in the story, as to why markus and connor can awaken other androids. They are both the only RK model prototype androids in the story and markus and connor are both shown early on as having the ability to think and act for themselves while having much more freedom before they became a deviants. ](/spoiler)"
8nbssj,2018-05-30,2018-05-31,"I agree for the most part. It really threw me off when >!the androids would just leave whatever they were doing before, and just follow whatever Marcus told them to do. I get they didnt want to be slaves to the humans, but ironically it just felt like they were exchanging ownership. Leaving the humans, just to do whatever Marcus told them without question. !<

>!However, I get how/why he has it, considering he and Connor are some type of special model. But, the writing for how the power was used was subpar for sure. It's the biggest problem narrative wise in my opinion, but otherwise I thought the story was pretty well done!<

>!With Kara though, I think theres some lore in the previews basically insinuating that she was deviant to begin with, before being sold to Todd. When he busted her up, she kind of forgot that she could feel emotions, and she had to relearn. From my understanding, Deviancy basically only occurred when the androids were under significant stress, and couldn't follow their programming. Marcus/Connor/Kara had to break their programming walls the hard way, same as the founders of Jericho. The recruited androids didnt have to break their walls, because Marcus could.. open a door I guess. Marcus and Conner were also some kind of special model that could help others break their walls for them, without them having to go through the turmoil before. But before that, the androids didnt have feelings. Or maybe they did, but not as strongly as they did post program-breaking!<

Edit: Added some stuff in"
8nbssj,2018-05-30,2018-05-31,"Theres only one really major storybreaking component in my opinion, but otherwise I think this one has its shit together. Though to be fair, I haven't seen **EVERY** timeline"
8nbssj,2018-05-30,2018-05-31,"I speculated that there would be an additional twist that  [the androids really were just exchanging ownership and Markus was unwittingly turning them into slaves of his own, just mindlessly supporting his revolution. They followed his orders because he was an advanced type of android that could control them, not because he opened them up to freedom. This was kinda hinted at with his conversation with Kara when he said 'they do everything I say..."" which only really led to ""that's a lot of power to have"".](/spoiler)"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"One of the things I hate about E3 is that I can never watch it thoroughly, so I end up just finding out about games in snippets of disjointed information later. Putting all the trailers into one concise post is incredibly helpful. Keep it up!"

That'd be cool. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"A lot of great games, but the ones on my watchlist are State of Decay 2, DeadRising 4, We Happy Few, and Days Gone.

SoD was phenomenal, despite its bugs. With SoD 2 going full on retail, it will be even bigger and better.

DeadRising 4 looks like stupid, crazy fun.

We Happy Few is creepy and extremely satisfying.

Days Gone. The Last of Us + World War Z (film) = A badass fun game overall. Hopefully, it's got survival mechanics too."

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I think it's safe to say that Sony absolutely kicked Microsoft's ass at E3 this year

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Death Stranding really reminded me and solidified that Hideo Kojima is the greatest gaming artist ever

Fucking EVER

He's also probably the first one to make art out of his games and have it be playable and fun and profitable. IMO he's a legitimate genius and we'd be 10 years behind if it wasn't for him.

He is like Kanye for Video Games but not an asshole 

He is one of the few geniuses still alive and still creating

I don't know what's better, the fact that he's doing this or that he said he has multiple games and just picked this one for now

It all almost makes me forget about RDR 2.... Almost.

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Sony absolutely killed this year at E3. Wonderful selection for the next year. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,No PC section?
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"As a whole this year's E3 was rather boring, with only a few games that seemed interesting."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Sony wins, and that's it. Very little marketing bullshit talk nobody gives a crap about."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Maybe it's just me, but so far this year's E3 seems like a disappointment. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"I never thought I'd say this, but Sony fucking **owned** E3 this year. Well, at least for the day. I mean, Ubisoft is never spectacular, and Xbox didn't really have anything to talk about this year (except Mafia 3, but meh). Meanwhile, Sony got to present the new Resident Evil (the closest thing we'll get to PT) and Hideo Kojima's return to the video game industry (complete with a fetus and Norman Reedus' ass)"

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"My personal TL;DR:

New Xbox, didn't mention much. I don't know why I need an S or when I'll need the other S word one. 

We Happy Few looks good, like Bioshock-ish

South Park will be awesome

A boss battle in ff15 with no news, a bit disappointing but w/e I'm still down for the ultimate collectors edition.

Horizon delayed until 2017.

Pirate game on PC looked cool albeit slow at parts, I don't remember the name. 

Nothing Kingdom Hearts yet. When TF can I preorder the CE?

Zelda looks cool, but I still won't get the Nintendo system because I dunno. Reasons.

Everything else I wasn't excited for because they were either not in my genre or generic"

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"It was cool, it was a big announcement, and in the end I agree it was a mistake. I was in love with MGS V when they announced it and so tired of hearing about it when it launched, I didn't even play it until a few months later.  After this announcement, this game needs to disappear and not say anything until they are close to being done. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Until 2019? Hell, that's forever away. The hype will never live that long, it'll be forgotten about until the next ""leak"" comes along about the game."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,They announced No Man's Sky at the 2014 E3 and that's just an indie project.

Also, since they're doing multiple sports, I hope they spent enough time on every single one to make it fun to play. If not, it would mean some of them are there as filler, and in the end, useless.

Overall, I'm just happy to see a new snowboarding game, it's been long since I've heard of a new one."

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"So in the demo/teaser, one of the guys gets left behind on an island... I want to know what happens to him.

Can he teleport back, build a raft, or just swim around until someone picks him up?"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"It is very Guns of Icarus, which is a fantastic game. That, paired with what appeared to be islands and the potential to board other ships and possibly take them over by force has me very interested."

I do hope it's great though."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I might be behind on the times, but I keep seeing these sorts of comments, why is everyone so keen for this particular game? "

No shit bro. 

>Blue lightning giant beam coming towards players

I'm not blind.

>Thing is literally still alive

No! I thought it would die on its own.

If anyone saw that Sequelitis video on Megaman, and how it teaches you the game without having to tell you anything, it has a great part about how annoying that becomes. [This is what I'm talking about](https://youtu.be/8FpigqfcvlM?t=2m56s). This is how I see this ""WATCH OUT FOR THOSE ITS POISON!"" yelling."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Yes me too. The trailer gave me a real bioshock feel then i watched some gameplay and got sad. but on the other hand the steam store does mention an story mode sooo maybe there is some hope?
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Really? Isn't it single player?
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Yup.  I went from so hype to no hype real quick.

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Just wondering, if MS says Windows 10 exclusive, does it mean it will only be purchasable via their own market, and that we won't be able to buy it on Steam?"

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Can you give me a quick summary of this Berserk game you spoke of? 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I think Sony was the winner because of their presentation and showing lots of cinematics instead of yammering on about stuff. Xbox and Sony however felt the most professional and most enjoyable to actually watch because of the smooth transitions.

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"What really got me about the Xbox One S is that it has a UHD Blu-ray drive at a $299 price point.  You can't even get a standalone UHD Blu-ray player that cheap right now. This thing is that, and an Xbox One. Bravo, Microsoft.


Now if Sony can offer the same, I'll be in business. Getting an Xbox One S with a stout Win10 gaming PC right here seems pretty pointless, I'd much rather get the PS4 refresh and have that whole backlog & future lineup of exclusives at my fingerprints. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Sony already has play anywhere....

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"When did gamers start talking about who ""won"" E3?

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,">Just out of curiosity, has any heard any legit estimates of the things I hate about E3 is that I have to give credit to Aisha Tyler though as a host..

TL:DR I'm high as fuck right now!"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Looked like a decent blend of Uncharted, Dark Souls and God of War Norse Edition. As long as you control bearded Kratos and not that weak kid. I really like that they changed the setting, I've kinda had enough of beating the shit out of everyone and everything in Greek mythology.

Looks like I have to get a PS4K now"

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-16,"Hawken got bought up by another company. Uncertain as to true cross-platform abilities, but the ""update"" based on what information we have appears to be a fucking joke: UI changes, economy changes and release of models that were finished by the previous company and unreleased, along with an unlooked-for, unasked for and really ill-considered set of changes to what mechs exist.  

As in identifiably stupid from the one gameplay video we've seen."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Yes and yes to both of your questions. It will be available in the Windows 10 App Store.

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"They didnt mention FF7 yet either...

Maybe it's on the mainstage on one of the other days? I Hope so anyway... and KH3 as well."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Hope that they just showed that as hey this is how the game works. Not like actually just a bunch of cut scenes you have to just figure out.

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"This shocked me too... I uninstalled after the company got bought out and nobody logged in anymore.

I'm rather surprised to be honest...  I don't think there's enough maps/game modes to keep console players playing.  Unless they go the FTP model on consoles too, and even then I doubt it'll gain traction."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-16,"There are an average of 500 (annnnnd dropping!) unique logins per day.  

The fact that I've done more outreach in 24 hours than the new devs have done in a year is telling.  

Essentially the console release is leveraging existing assets left unreleased in the game by Adhesive, the previous development company as well as some UI and economy changes. The devs appear to have ignored pre-packaged and extensively feedback to make changes of their own which are demonstrably unworkable in the one gameplay trailer we've seen so far.  

I wish the console players the best. Those of us left on PC are going down with the ship."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-16,"It appears to be a port to PS4 and XBox with some changes and release of unreleased models and cosmetics, possibly with ""new"" mechs. But given what we've been able to piece together from the website and a gameplay video, the new devs have butchered the mechs up and don't really understand how the weapons play together.  

The utter lack of communication from the devs (the one *specific* thing the entire community unanimously agreed upon) is not helping their case.  "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-16,"4 years come 12.12  

PC players will be here until the servers go down, but holy shit, those console changes are bad."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,I reallllllly want this game to be good. But I reallllllly have my doubts
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Seriously! Last time I saw gameplay it was pre-alpha and looked like garbage which had me worried. Now I'm all hype for this game. Can't wait.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"If you're on PS4 or PC, I highly recommend you try FFX. I'm mega hyped for the new one as well!"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Seriously. Here's hoping it's good. I've wanted another decent SM game since SM2. It's about damn time.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,I was thinking about back in the G4 days when that was the only outlet to see E3.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Let that die. We all agreed to let it die.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Thought it looked good too. I know it's a trailer but something felt off with the second half with the characters walking. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I like both and have owned every system to come out since N64 and I'm happy to see someone else agrees. S being cheapest 4K player on the market, Scorpio, Windows/Xbox cross play, and PLENTY of games was huge for me and stole the show. Though, Sony killed it also and the VR looks great. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"This is from the SP trailer, don't bash the poor guy :p"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,So hyped for South Park
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"That probably depends on what you were expecting from both conferences. I personally Like Sony's the most, however I know people who liked Microsoft's more."

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,So basically you'll gush about him no matter what he puts out.  Dude no one even knows what genre this game is in.  You're right though.  Guy's a genius.  Next you'll tell me all the MGS games were flawless and made perfect sense.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Yeah it was a launch title for Xbone and honestly everyone forgets about it for some reason.  Frankly it was one of the more enjoyable games from this gen for me.  
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Every non-Nintendo console since the PS1 has eventually released a ""slim"" version a few years after release. That's all the Xbox One S is (with the addition of a 3D bluray player)."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Right? And I don't even have a current gen console or a PC, so I just have to look at all these badass games I won't be able to play for a while. Doesn't stop me from enjoying the trailers though, cause there's already been some really interesting stuff announced."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"If it's legitimately scary I think it will sell well, P.T. Was extremely well received and popular just for that fact"

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I, on the other hand, can't wait to piss my pants with fear!"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Maybe you can use VR in the regular game? Kind of like how some PS3 games have Move support.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,It's not a separate version
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Some will probably buy it, play for 5 minutes and never touch it again"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,There won't be a separate VR version. The game can be played both ways from a single disc.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Idk, I found the demo to be underwhelming but then I realized it'd be pretty amazing in VR."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"It will probably be included in the game by how they are describing it, just as an additional mode"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"My wife is 100% on board with upgrading to a VR capable system after seeing that trailer. 
"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-23,And how did it go?
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Look at Mr Fancy (30$) pants over her.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Also the Kojima controversy is big and in people's mind's right now. If they waited a year or 2 it would not have been as huge of an announcement. As it stands, it's easily one of the most talked about announcements at E3 thus far"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I would love for that to happen.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,You mean that cash cow that doesn't even have a complete story
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,If you still own a ps2 then go online and get yourself a second hand cheap copy of ace combat 4 and 5. Trust me!
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"VR...  God, that would be awesome..."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,They havent promised anything.  But it seems every year there's rumors out that get my hopes up :(
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Rockstar announce their things in their own damn time, without risk of being obscured or overshadowed. They like the mystique of not being at E3, I think. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Damn Cliff-Racers...
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Zero substance in your comment. If you want an interesting and actual discussion you could explain why you might not like the game from what you've seen.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I just down voted you because of your edit asking why you're being downvoted :)
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I agree, very forced/cringey. The actual game looks cool though."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I'm one of the few people who liked halo wars. It could have done with some improvement and I would prefer base building but for a console RTS it was pretty decent, and the story wasn't half bad either. 

I've downloaded the beta and watched the videos and I'll agree it looks like more of the same but it looks like there are more tactics to deploy.

Although I'm not interested in multiplayer so I hope they haven't put all their eggs in that basket. I only got HW1 because the coop possibility!"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"That's exactely what I wanted to hear, Halo Wars was an almost pefect mix between simplicity and complexity."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Plus it may have got better but that game was massively unoptimised (on console). Didn't really get time to enjoy the game as it was constantly child minding missions for my moronic survivor's who broke their legs daily
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Phil said the GPU would be like the GTX 980. So it will be a little pricey.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Sounds about right.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I'm expecting $700+ but who knows. All I care about is Red Dead Redemption remaster and sequel, but so far...nothing..."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"How so? Considering there is an Xbox ""family"" now consumers should understand it's the premium version. If they think it's too expensive then they can go with the more than capable Xbox one S. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Whoa why are you already jumping on calling it DOA? Xbox one was 500 bucks and the PS3 60gb was 600 bucks. Both are still extremely successful. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,That would be Xbox One S. Project Scorpio is the 2017 Xbox One.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"I mean, my Xbox One is about 2 years old. Back in February, the Kinect just stopped working. So a new system for however much, I just need the damn thing to work..."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"It already kind of sort of existed in FF Type-0, and that game was well-received overall. 

I just hope it's responsive."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"The Last Guardian is made by the same people who made Shadow of the Colossus which is widely considered to be an amazing game.  This game can be considered a spiritual successor to Shadow of the Colossus.  The Last Guardian has been in production for almost 10 years and was later announced as abandoned, then back burner, then back into production.  So it's been roller coaster of anticipation."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"It's the follow up to Shadow of the Colossus, a highly acclaimed work of interactive art. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"All hyped has died inside me,at least now i can't get disappointed"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,It will deliver like duke nukem forever. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,i really enjoyed xiii. xiii-2 was an incomprehensible convoluted garbage-heap though
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Seems pretty cool that when you die, that's it. Reset."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,We can hope! But unfortunately I can't think of any good single player game that would need an early access model to support it.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Their [steam page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/320240/) is ambiguous, and promises a few things, a story mode included. Still, based on it's description, early access model, and early alpha game play it is evident it is not focused around a single player story, which is worrying at best."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I'm a little afraid that this will go on forever.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I'm specifically referring to the windows 10 part. It was for regular windows PC, meaning any windows. Not just windows 10 "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Not completely sure, I guess we'll find out. :/"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Correct 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Yeah I just got the Elite and am jealous. I almost bought a 4K player too so the S playing UHD justifies my purchasing. Cheapest 4K player on the market is a HUGE selling point and a top 5 moment of E3 for me. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"That's definitely your own fault. Rumors of the Scorpio AND slim have been floating for a while now. Also, you can return it."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,I think you totally should if you can
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I'm confused what Day 0 means. Many of the trailers in the post were revealed yesterday but what what I'm talking about sans Nintendo stuff happened on Sunday.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Here is the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUbLtc8tT4w).

Since it's just teaser level, I can only guess from the title that it's a Dynasty Warriors type game using the [Berserk Anime/Manga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserk_\(manga\)). It's a very dark storyline set in medival europe with deformed/mutant beasts everywhere (e.g. dog with human-like face). Have you played Dark Souls? A **lot** of inspiration was taken from Berserk, even if they won't admit it."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Sony had more games, Microsoft had a lot of community oriented stuff and tech. Neither had too many games that interested me. Detroit Become Human really interests me, and the creepy one Microsoft showed with the ""joy"" pills looks really cool. 

Ubisoft let me down except for For Honor, the only game that still looks decent from them in my opinion. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Cinematics shouldn't decide the winner. And even with the ""yammering"", MS showed more games."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,[deleted]
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"See on reflection, I actually preferred the Microsoft format. Why even have a conference if you do it the Sony way, just release the trailers. It felt a little too stiff and theatrical to me and didn't give itself any time to breath. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Because Sony had 1 hour. If they had 2 like ubisoft and Microsoft they would have had people talk about all the games. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,You can play games from your PS4 to pc? Buy it for PS4 and get a free copy for pc? I didnt realize
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-16,Because streaming a game is the same at running it at a native 1440p 144hz?
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Is this seriously the first time you've heard that? Dont be naive gamers will argue about anything. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"It was about the time everyone started thinking their personal platform preference indicated superiority over someone else's.

Gamers (as in, we care about the toast, not the toaster) have just been getting drowned out by the loud mouthed children."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-16,"It's dying, boy howdy. The past 5 hours have killed a lot of interest from what PC players remain.  

What changes we've seen from the console preview and website update are leading to the conclusion that the devs in no way listened to the feedback of the community and don't really understand the internal balance of the game.  

I wish console players good luck."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,That's one of the few I'm hesitant on. I just find the whole premise to be odd. It is a gorgeous game though. I'd list my most anticipated games but there are just sooo many.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,FF XV is there though.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-16,"It will be FTP, they've confirmed that much. The plan evidently is release on consoles for a cash grab and then come back to PC ""to give it the love it deserves.""  

All the while ignoring feedback and making changes that make no sense, aside from questionable financial sense."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-16,"That is really unfortunate, it was a fun game 

Too bad they had to mess up the micro transactions that much, and it's sad that they are just haphazardly throwing this together to try to get money from console users "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,I'm not really a fan of the turn based combat which is why I have avoided the others.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Was Ultimate Spiderman good?
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Too late, people dont get it :/"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"As long as those remakes aren't in Skylanders fashion. I honestly never follow these type of things, my friend simply linked me."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,^^^nanomachines
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I mean his track record for now is pretty much flawless so why wouldn't I? I never said the game was GOTY or anything but just that putting out a trailer like this in the middle of E3 is crazy, artistic and unprecedented, and that's why I love him

Oh yea MGS 3 is my favorite game of all time but they did have very small flaws (didn't play 4 or 5 yet) and the story is confusing but worthwhile IMO "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Ah, I don't have anything new gen except wii u yet :("
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Same, I hope I'll have one soon though @_@"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Well the consoles are starting to get a lot cheaper, and the Xbox S is a good example of that. Ideally, everyone who had a previous gen console should start getting a current gen console in the next year or so. I can't believe devs are still making games for the previous gen, I think its time to move on so that mainstream titles can really push new features and better graphics."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"You should really get a ps4, PC or a wii u. Since xbox games will launch on pc too there's no reason to buy one."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Was PT VR though?... I think people are underestimating how ""fear for your life"" scary VR horror will be... That kind of scary isn't fun..."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,P.T?
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I've played all the Silent Hills, Eternal Darkness, Alan Wake, most of the RE's, etc. To the idea of PT in VR, I say ""FUCK THAT."" Too much. I don't mind being scared, but that seems terrifying."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I played the RE7 demo and didn't find it that scary. You have to escape the house and the scariest bit for me was finding the key to leave and then running to the door feeling like someone was chasing me.

I didn't play in VR, but it didn't feel scary really."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,What is PT?
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"PT was a cerebral, evocative, interesting mystery novel, though. Resident Evil is just... zombies, afaik. Silent Hill is a great candidate for video games as art, and RE is just a popular video game."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I remember the first time being scared to progress in a horror game. The dreamcast version of alone in the dark a new nightmare. There is a section where you can pick the guy or the girl and If you pick the girl, she doesn't have a weapon. She only has a flashlight. Once you leave the room with her, outside in the hallway are these little monsters. That I believe was the first time I encountered a game where I couldn't fight back against something that was horrible to me. Unfortunately now, I know better in games with this scenario that I have to run through. Or more than fact I know I can just restart if I die.

Back then though, I didn't want to die or chance dying. That was when games were great for me."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Nah.  Alien Isolation in VR would be the best game to increase sales of those brown trousers that the clothing company you own shares in makes.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,You are probably underestimating what real horror is. Its not a genre. It is the fooling of your brain into experiencing mortal risk. It is literally trauma.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,It's sounding like you can play it on a flat screen or VR either/or.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-23,"Waited in like, ran out of tickets :("
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,As it... strands?
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,That would be the one yes.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Interestingly enough I heard another rumor that the trailer involves shooting up a saloon. They were supposed to show at the end of sony, but because of what happened in florida, they felt it would have been in poor taste. 


Cannot verify this in any way, just what I heard. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,E3 isn't R*'s style. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Oh don't be like that that's not nice
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Of course it's forced, they need to get it done smoothly because everything is dependent on time on such a show,it's not the best thing but hey doesn't matter that much it's better than no commentary whatsoever"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I liked the game for what it was, and I'll be playing 2 primarily on PC where you have much more direct control. Instead of all units, I can group my marines as one, flame throwers as another and direct their attacks better. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Unfortunately I generally like more in depth RTS games. I still like Halo wars, but missed out on stronger control. Hopefully having it on PC will fix that. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-16,Not really. If they can get ahold of AMD's new cards then it should be cheaper.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Patience young padawan.

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I have the opposite opinion haha. But I have a thing for time travel.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Meh nothing special there are many games that do that. But a nice thematic story in a world where everybody is on happy drugs sounds amazing
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Hi a little afraid that this will go on forever.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Gotcha! It's gonna be an interesting few years for Microsoft and the store... 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Hm, that's worrisome. I don't mind using both, it's just that I've heard Windows treats the games as apps, as in you don't have access to your own files on your own PC."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Now the only expensive part of 4K is the display. Seems like the price is still waaay too inflated.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"E3 technically started today, but the big companies have their press conferences before then. Bethesda and EA were the day before. OP is just copy-pasting the recap in /r/games for the day 0 recap, but you can find the [Day -1 recap here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/4ntx17/e3_day_1_recap/)."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I've watched Berserk so that's why I was interested. But I not sure how much I'd want a Dynasty Warriors styled game. I was hoping for more of a dark souls almost, travel the world and defeat weird ass demon things while trying to find Griffith. But maybe more hack and slash like Final Fantasy. It's PS exclusive anyways so I unfortunately won't be able to play it.

Thanks for the link and description though. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Sony needs to complete giant enemy crab
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"To me, that seems about par for the companies.

I'm just a dirty casual, but I feel like my XBox One is more of an entertainment system to watch movies on, listen to music, socialize with friends, and also play some kick ass games...  where my PS is mainly just for games. 

NOt that the PS can't handle movies and such... it's just, it seems like the XBox wants to be the center of your living room entertainment system, while the PS wants to be in a bedroom to game... and then watch movies on after. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"For Honor looks like a carbon copy of Ryse, but with Vikings and Samurais instead of Romans and barbarians. Same type of fighting style, same type of enemies to fight against; peons that stand there and watch you kill them, captains that require you to block/break through blocks, and then the cinematic boss that fights like the captain, but doesn't die as fast. Seems like a game you will love the graphics for, play it and beat it, then unistall it."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Na it was how Sony went about it. They showed lots of trailers wheras MS did a lot more talking. This is just my preference in terms of what I want to see though. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Based off what's listed here, Sony showed far more games. Microsofts list is longer but half of it is hardware, consoles and features. They did have that one point where they fast forwarded through a bunch of other games that didn't make the big cut but those shouldn't necessarily count since there's no details, gameplay or trailers for any of them."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"That's a bad ass analysis. Never knew that was the underlying motives. Makes sense now why Sony did what they did. I think that consumers are everything for a company and not as much corporate. But what do I know, Im just a silly CS major
"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,They have as much time as they choose to have. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-17,is that what you get from your ps4?
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,People will argue about anything.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Yeah but I admit it's the first time I've paid much attention to E3 in a decade. Also the first time I came to /r/gaming to get the scoop. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Thanks! I'll toast to that! 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Yeah that's understandable. 

What appeals to me, besides those gorgeous graphics and animations, is it's something new. 

Most of the games I've been playing have been series games. It's the first ""new"" game to get me excited. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,I understand that. It isn't so bad once you learn how to use characters effectively. The random encounters definitely become somewhat tedious but you can blow through them if you level up properly.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Never played it because the reviews were pretty bad. Gameplay videos didn't make it look to compelling either.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Its not
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Which are you planning on getting? 8] 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I'm planning on getting a PC someday but unfortunately I'm kinda broke at the moment.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Well it's not going to be for me, but considering how much money horror movies make, I think a truly terrifying experience will probably reach the status of infamy, in a good way"

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"That sounds fun as fuck, I'm sure many other horror fans will agree"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Hell yeah it's fun and immersive.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I'd love that. To be really, genuinely terrified, but not actually in any real danger!

Might give some people heart attacks, though..."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I'm willing and am excited to see for myself. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I think there is a butter zone. Like horror works because of the suspension of disbelief, but you still know deep down that it's not actually real. I think at a certain level of realism/immersion it can become too much for anyone. I haven't tried VR yet, but I still think there will be some level of ""yeah this is still a game"" because I'm assuming there is some area inside the headset that is just black space. And stuff like having to mess with buttons as controls, and having a heavy thing on your face.

But seeing some people freak out at stuff like falling of cliffs and such in VR makes me think that some people just won't be able to handle that jump, even if they actually like scary games and movies."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I play with headphones for maximum spooks, but usually take one headphone off one ear when I think something is going to happen.

Do you think playing in VR completely would make us overcome the fear or just give us a heart attack? "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Maybe for you. I know some people would totally dig vr horror. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,People are also vastly overstating how scary VR horror actually is. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"No kidding, i still cant play ZombiU unless i have 2 other people and the lights on"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"I can barely play normal scary games that are actually decent, screw vr versions... lol."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"I think some people enjoy that sort of thing. Like having a deeper connection. Certain people do not enjoy haunted houses at all, others try to go to as many as possible. It's all based on the person."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,First Person View is VR just without the goggles
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Was a demo by Kojima under a different studio name. Was horror and scared the living shut out of the people playing it. It doesn't exist anymore on the PS Store anymore as far as I know though.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Demo for the (now defunct) new Silent Hills game.  It litterally means Playable Test.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"I think Silent Hill 3 would be the worst of those in a HD VR remake. 
Especially that fucking mirror scene.

It's just.. disturbing."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"How is it so different from freaking out after watching a horror film or playing a game? It'll be more intense initially, but the brain adapts. 

Just as when you were a child and gore was frightening, but you grew desensitized. 

But the sweet initial fear and adrenaline are pretty great. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I've been through some real world trauma on more than one occasion and so far I've found preoccupations with the events can develop that lead to mentally reliving and ruminating on the events. Its not always pleasant but as a result I have a sort of morbid interest in them and can seek similar situations that provoke similar feelings from past experiences. A virtual simulation would be a safer environment to get those feelings that some of us may be after. Kind of like people in Remember Me who just want to experience memories again and again. 

Danger and a true sense of horror can illicit responses that can only be reproduced under certain circumstances. I could see how it would be unpleasant for someone who has not had an experience like that or is otherwise unprepared but the desire for those feelings are present in people for a variety of reasons."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-23,Lol that sucks. What did the people that got to play think?
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Warthunder for those who don't know.  I like it, though it's pay to play like a motherfucker"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"I want to believe thats true (it it very well may be), but it's tough with  all the ""leaked"" plots, maps, characters, etc over the past few years ha"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Shit, I've just realised that with the whole PC compatibility thing I will be able to play this on PC most likely....."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Young? I'm 33 guy! I needs my games!
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,What about this is a minor upgrade?
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Isn't Scorpio supposed to be 4x as powerful as the Xbone? That's seems like a huge leap. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,The Scorpio is supposed to be almost as big of a jump as the XB1 was from the 360 in terms of power. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I don't think price is the only factor playing into why consoles are popular versus PC. I would be willing to bet there is a pretty large crowd that you can offer a PC and a console to that have the same power and same price, and they will pick the console."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Ease of use is something the gaming community keeps forgetting about. The majority of people want plug and play and consoles provide that. As a former pc gamer who's too busy for that stuff anymore, I just stick with consoles and will buy the Scorpio. I don't have the time to bother with drivers, compatibility issues, controllers not working, hardware issues, etc. I just want to come home after 12 hours of work, turn on my system and play. There is a premium for that and I think most people are comfortable with that (plus, do you think joe shmo really cares about 1080p 60fps vs 30fps vs 100hz vs 4K? Most can't tell the difference). "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,You don't think Microsoft knows this? They're probably going to take a hit off of console sales and profit off of other things like Xbox live. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Apparently so does everyone else. I personally just couldn't stand it. It was *too* out there for me. All the time travel stuff felt like more of a chore than actual fun exploration 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Don't worry I got u fam
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,That's also correct. It's console gaming on PC 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Yeah my 70 inch TV was 1800 when the 70 in non4k version was 1000. Pretty big difference. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"What the hell? Day -1? Lol, why can't they start counting from 1?"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Ryse is more of a hack&amp;slash with combos. For Honor looks to be more precise in combat maybe.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"More of Chivalry to me. Though the combat seems less than it was last year. The real game is in multiplayer I think, not the campaign. It was a show as well.

But the fighting is far better than Ryse. There is an actual directional attack and defense system which makes it more like Chivalry. Expect quick reactions to block an enemy, feints, parries and ripostes. Typical chivalry stuff in a flashier, hopefully more fluid, style. "

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Really? I counted more games on the Xbox list. Not even including the ID@Xbox segment.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Not really, I mean each 'way' has its perks, however what really helped sony this gen is the reactionary thingy, if you pay attention to the last couple E3's (not so much this one) they pretty much take every negative side of microsoft's conference, stress it and then look we don't do this shit,I don't really like it but it works"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Nintendo send their greetings.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-17,"What? Remote play is just a PS4 game being streamed on the internet to a different screen. Play Anywhere is literally having a separate PC version that syncs progress and other stuff like that. A full fledged PC version running at PC level settings and framerates, that's the difference here."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Very true. But with the E3 stuff there's always all kinds of news after about who ""won"" "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"No, they won't"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,It's been a thing since PS4 reveal.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Well thank god then x.x They ruined Spyro that way =v
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Well I don't think I'll have the resources or knowledge (or knowledgeable friend) to build a decent PC for a few years so probably PS4 for the exclusives.

Always been a fan of God of War so I'll want that, Horizon Zero Dawn looks amazing, Spider-Man for sure, Watch Dogs 2 seems like the AC2 of the original, For Honor, Kingdom Hearts 3, FF15... man and that's not even including all of the games already out."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"I bought my pc 1 part at a time over 4-5 month span. Bought my Graphics card last since you can get by with integrated graphics.
"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Horror's a trick thing.  Being IMMERSED in an experience makes things WAY more scary than just watching scary.   I can watch youtubers play scary games all day.  I have to be in the right mood to watch a scary movie...  and The last time I tried to play a scary game, I whimpered, sobbed a little and hyperventilated a lot even though I KNEW that nothing would jump out at me at that point in the game (amnesia).  That said, everyone has different levels of immersion and scare-factor.  I had to take a break in the middle of watching someone play Alien Isolation.  My husband was like ""whatever, this isn't too scary"" while playing it.

but VR makes you feel a LOT more like you're THERE and in the story and like there's REALLY a zombie coming for your face.

There's a line between 'this is scary and fun""  and ""OH MY GOD I AM GOING TO DIE WAIT THIS IS VR BUT I AM GOING TO DIE"""
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"It will be interesting for sure. My prediction is still that horror VR isn't going to take off, but if it does, I think it'll be in a big way!"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I am right there with you. Games like this in VR is what makes me want to play VR. Traumatize me! I can always take the thing off. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I'm a 35 year old man and PT made me jump out of my chair like a frightened little school girl. I can't imagine what that game could've been like in full VR. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Same here, absolutely fan of the horror genre. I love movies, games or shows about Zombies and Horror itself. Nothing scares me anymore tho, ran through Alien 1 on Playstation 1 way back when I was a little kid. I got kind of numb to be honest and whenever I watch or play something new I always compare them to the best ones in their category and think about everything thats wrong. I need something fresh, something that actually shocks me and makes me feel alive again. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Fuckin A pal. I don't do so well with horror personally but absolutely I would play something like Dead Space or Condemned in VR if just for the novelty. To me immersive VR is perfect for 2 things: survival horror and motor sports.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,[deleted]
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Yo, have you played Alien Isolation? "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I love scary games and have a vive, not scary shit is scary in VR and scary shit can cause you to run into walls really fast. you have the normal fear of scary stuff with the odd fear of being completely unknowing of your actual surroundings or if someone is standing near you. with my vive and earbuds in I can't hear or see someone right next to me.

Also it would never be bigger than GTA because over half the population is already not interested in horror games simply by name."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,1. i'ma get stoned as fucked and hopefully not shit myself playing this in vr
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"I'm with you. Depending on how the next year goes in terms of horror games and quality, will depend on if i purchase a VR unit or not."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,I wonder what an open world horror game would be like...

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"*as I sat the sand slowly shifted over my boots. I felt the heat radiate into my toes. My feet felt like swamp ass. Out from the distance I hear the whistle of an incoming mortar. We heard them all the time these days. You never know where they land till it's too late but in most cases the enemy can even hit the side of the barn in daylight. So I strained my ears listening for the following explosion so I know which way to run. The boom was close. I felt the shockwave hit me in my chest. i felt hands loop under my arms and yank me down. Someone ripped the my helmet off. Then I remember I was only in VR but in Syria as well.

""Is this the real life...."""
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,FPS games won't die so long as people like to sit down to game. I foresee exercise games undergoing a revolution though.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"It's more likely FPS will decline in VR because they're absurdly nauseating. I think a lot of these games will fail simply because the VR market is small, and then only a small percentage can play without nausea."

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,That's why I said relatively small. Compared to my previous comparison of PC. $600 is a massive upgrade for a pc.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"well yeah, it's not the only factor and that isn't what i'm arguing. I'm also not arguing that PC is more popular. Factually it's not. Of course more people will pick the console because the majority of people do not want to deal with spending 20-30 minutes setting up a computer. But that doesn't mean those same people are willing to shell out $700+ for a new console this early in the XB1's lifespan."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I can see them doing that but in todays market a console that costs $500 is a major risk, I can see it being that and still working out but if it is anywhere over $600 It is going to sell like ice cream in Antarctica. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I'm with you. I liked FFXIII and Lightning Returns. XIII-2 made me *so* angry, it ranks at the bottom of my list for FF games."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I just liked the more varied fighting. I thought capturing and ""raising"" monsters would be gimmicky but I spent much more time doing that than playing the rest of the game lol"

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Conferences are always Pre-E3 technically.  Showcases to help the media in attendance understand what there is to see and where they should spend their time when E3 starts.  E3 is the ground floor booth set-ups with swarms of people bouncing all over the place and some hands on experiences.  

So EA started first on Sunday (Day -1) since they are doing their own thing at a nearby venue which isn't really E3 (but might as well be), Bethesda followed since they are smaller than Microsoft and PlayStation so they took a time slot advantageous to them.  Monday was the ""Day 0"" with most of the big name conferences and stage shows that highlighted the big topics for all the attendees prior to Day 1 E3."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Hey, I made the original threads. E3 always opens on Tuesday and up til last year conferences started on Monday. Because of that Monday was called Day 0. Since now conferences start a day before that Sunday has become Day -1. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Hope so. Love the graphics, but hate when games give 0 replay value."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"It comes down to personal preference, of course, but it could be argued that the talking they did in the other conferences was a bunch of fluff. ""Rich, immersive environment,"" ""community focused experience"", ""revolutionary, innovative development"" etc. just sounds like repetitive buzz words to me after so many years of watching E3 press conferences. I personally liked Sony's straight-to-the-point format with trailers and gameplay."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Well, Minecraft doesn't really count and there are some duplicates for trailers/gameplay and a couple others like the Killer Instinct one is just a new character being introduced into an old game."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-19,"Oh I get you man the only reason I got a ps4 was uncharted. However having full fledged yada yadda yadda is not really the prime concern if you spend a lot of time playing the ps4 version. I mean unless its because you are coming down from your ivory tower to deign your friends with your presence while you play on their system before going back to the holy land, but i could be wrong so whatever."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,It's been a thing since at least 2009.

And yeah the exclusives are always a draw for playstation. Don't forget Bloodborne! 8] "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,I'm actually concerned about the ability for these games to cause heart attacks or whatnot.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"I watch a lot of scary movies, but I don't scare easily in real life. However, when I watch those moviesy heart rate rises and my senses get over stimulated, raising my guard up until I get busy with something else to lower the intensity. I don't think it's fear for some people, but over stimulation. 


That's why I think VR with be amazing for horror games."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,">  Being IMMERSED in an experience makes things WAY more scary than just watching scary

True but a lot of made for VR games don't let you walk around using a controller but instead use a teleporting system, so that immediately breaks immersion and tension. We'll have to see how they intend to do it with RE before we can really speculate on if it will be immersive."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,It's gonna be like version 2.0 of people jumping out of their seats at a movie where the train is coming at them. 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"I mean...I like to let my imagination get away with me, but there's not gonna be a chance where I just ""forget"" a VR set is on my face. That knowledge alone is enough to take away some of the fear. I always assumed people played for the suspense. Being scared of a movie or video game seems....contrived to me to be honest. It's like knowing ghost's aren't real, and then being scared to go into your kitchen for fear of ghosts. "

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Think of how fun those high budget special effects haunted houses are. With movie quality demons and murderers chasing people down irl. Add the scope that VR would provide that. I'd do it. Granted for short periods at a time like I play amnesia or outlast but I'd definitely be game.

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"PT scared the shit out of me as well but I really, really wanted it in VR, nothing better than that feeling of helplessness! It's like the only thing I find fun anymore when it comes to gaming."

That and it is pretty clunky mechanically which I do feel adds to the suspense but not so much the fear factor."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Amnesia is the only game I straight-up can't play because of how scary it is. Maybe I'm just a giant wimp, but the first time the monster shows up I just nope the fuck out of it. It's a shame too because I really want to play Amnesia."

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I can't imagine it being like that. In VR you know its VR...and you don't  fear for your life in the same way 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I agree with you, most people probably don't want to be truly terrified - but some of us looking for this extreme thrill are excited by the prospect. 

It's all about what you are looking for in a horror game. I mean it's subjective and all, but I feel like for me horror gaming becoming more widely popular, the less 'scary' it has actually become as a creative artform. Which makes sense if you want something to sell, you want to make it more accessible aka 'fun' for more people, and most people can only be scared so much to a certain degree before they don't find it fun anymore.

Will be interesting to see how this kind of VR horror will be received for sure."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Yeah but overtime people would get used to it, especially if they can tell the difference between real and fake. Think about how useful VR could be for military training as well"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,It's kind of pay to play. The majority of vehicles are going to be behind a paywall.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"So what if it doesn't exactly hit 4K. Isn't the point that it's way more powerful than the current Xbox, definitely not a ""minor upgrade"" like you put it. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,I'm wondering where you're getting your information from. Because they haven't really said anything about specs.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,but i like ice cream and i will eat it anywhere 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Yeah 'it' can be a very devastating condition if not treated accordingly, I don't see why you'd bring that up when we were talking of U fam though."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Sounds like ""it"" is a more serious condition than u fam if it killed your brother."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I run a U fam memorial service, we shall honor your brother forever. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I agree completely, which is why I think this will be mostly multiplayer. And if it's as fun as chivalry, I'll find myself going back to it frequently. It seems to be sword fighting only though, hopefully they add in some other melee weapons like spears.  They throw in a campaign because of the reactions to battlefront is my guess. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,And what about the FFXV gameplay showed at the MS conference?
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,yup me too.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"very true.  That said, GOOD controls and interface could work past that.  we'll see!"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,did people used to do that?  how awesome.  I didn't know that!
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"are you deliberately ignoring the reality of phobias or do you actually not know they exist?

also you dont seem to be aware of the degree to which vr messes with peoples perception of reality.

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Really?  I mean...  here's an example....  I""m not a very good first person shooter player.  My reaction times are not very good.  But I end up 'reflex killing'  a lot.  The startled 'come around the corner' reaction.  

NOw think about that.  I'm startled.  My reaction isn't to  jerk away from my monitor, but to push the 'shoot the thing button' and aim up the crosshairs.  

I can translate this ideas like 'shoot, then melee while jumping around frantically'  without really thinking about it.  I'm not actually punching my screen, I""m clicking my mouse, or tapping 'e' or something.  Here's an example of how the brain rewires itself.  'game thing scary, use game kill button to kill game thing'  y'know?

Anyway, back to my point:  You don't 'forget' that a VR set is on your face.  jsut like you don't 'forget' that you're not actually a survivor in the zombie apocalypse, etc.  However, your brain has certain expectations.  that what you SEE is what is around you is one of them. Of course you don't forget that you're in your bedroom.  But the more instinctive part of your brain says 'you are here in this place, doing the things' ...  because that part of our brain is responsible for making sure we don't fuck up that whole 'living' thing, by ignoring danger.  

Which is all to say, it's not that you're going to forget that you're playing a game.  Just that the game is going to build in more vivid reactions... because you're not sitting in your bedroom, with your hands sprawled on keyboard and mouse or controller,  watching a collection of pixels on your screen, with your belongings around you.  You're seeing nothing but the game world... and whatever method you're using to control said game world.  (for example, those vive controllers and guns?  whew.)  ./... in some cases, you might have nothing BUT the memory of the fact that you ARE wearing a headset to remind yourself that it's 'just a game'

....all that said, everyone spooks in different ways :)  Suspense and fear are not that different honestly.  They're both nervous anticipation.Just one is a little stronger than the other.

That said, it sounds like you're pretty good at not getting scared by games.  Just remember everyone's different and some people are a lot more affected :)  nothing to look down on them for or anything.  They're just different. :)"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I think that guy is wrong, but if he's right it'll be big time"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I think the Cavaliers will win the finals, but if they don't, the Warriors will win in a big way!"
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Did you blatantly misquote him on purpose. I feel like a joke is going over my head
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"How long does it take you to feel immersed? I've tried the Rift and was underwhelmed, it felt like tv to me. I wondered if it just takes longer for some people to feel immersion."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"This will give you an idea - good luck trying it yourself though, as the PS4 demo was pulled by Konami a while ago.

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,It IS an abbreviation : Playable Teaser.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Depends. I never had any issues with testing my teams VRFPS practice. It didn't have too much realism to it but it still felt like all fun and games, even with explosions popping next to me. The real issue is trying to find a movement method for FPS games that doesn't suck."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"You say that, but I've heard from people who say they still reflexively panic when the skeletons swing at them Forgotten Realms. Making your brain stop trusting your eyes can be tricky."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,But full immersion is REALLY hard to talk yourself out of.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I think that's something that will work for some of us, and not for others. Most people can all too easily forget that it's all fake and will be scared beyond reason.

It's a lot harder for me, and even in a VR situation I think I'll quickly get acclimated and stop feeling that gut-wrenching panicked terror. I really, genuinely, would like to be scared to the core, but I doubt it'll work for long. For me.

But then, I've been in real life scenarios that terrify others and they don't effect me until days later when I realize how close I was to death or what have you. And even then, it's tough to really be afraid when the moment has passed.

Except for heights in precarious situations--those get me. Like a rickety ladder swaying while trying to pry something loose a few stories up, or being at the edge of a sheer mountain drop off and feeling your feet start to slide under you from the loose gravel/shale and having no handholds around, while a strong wind is pushing you off balance. "
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I find this to be absolutely true. The majority of people don't want to be actually scared, and so most ""horror"" is toned way down for that reason.

Also, I'd prefer more cerebral, creeping horror. Stuff that sticks with you long after you've stopped playing. Because it's an idea, a notion, that doesn't go away just because the game is turned off. That stuff is rare, but pure horror gold as far as I'm concerned."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Just imagine if P.T was VR... I want to be scared but that would be piss your pants  terrifying 
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Yea, pay to win. Pay to play is just a normal game with an upfront price like overwatch or csgo."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I said relatively minor for the price.

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,I would just assume someone with a phobia wouldnt be playing horror games. Or whatever phobic games they avoid. There is no ignorance here. Its a decision to play a video game. If you put on a VR helmet thats an active choice.

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Yes I have, and I secretly hope PS VR works with it when mine comes later this year. 

For some of us horror is more than a curiosity or a mild form of entertainment. I love it as an artistic medium, as morbid as some might consider."

4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"im just saying you said that knowing something is non existent yet being scared of it seems contrived, yet it is a real observable condition. i used phobias as the extreme case but its fully possible to not have phobias and be scared of something while knowing its not real. your fear response is not fully controlled by your conscious mind."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"The demo I used showed you various real world places and I had trouble differentiating it from television. My cousin tried a few shooting games and said he would have preferred it as a regular game with a regular controller, the VR didn't leave much an impression. I heard so much about people getting really into it so I was disappointed, but now I wonder if there is a contingent of people who try VR and have an apathetic enough response to it that they never even talk about it (compared to people who love/hate it)."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,they're not
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"They're never releasing a full version. It was a teaser for 'Silent Hill' which got cancelled due to a souring of relations between Hideo Kojima and Konami. Konami *  more of a profit margin coming from their Pachinko machines and mobile, so they've seemingly abandoned big budget gaming and alienated themselves from the gaming community at large due to consistently disrespecting Kojima who has been their golden goose for a very long time.

Apparently Sony are giving Kojima the freedom to do what he wants and his next game ('Death Stranding') looks fairly artsy."
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,I def agree. My point is it is easy to tell people to not get wrapped up but some that get pulled in completely.
4o1tov,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,You are right. However while many assimilated there is still people who get caught up in the immersion available from TV/Movies.

The whole game puts you through the struggle Amicia had to go through to save Hugo. At the same time you get to see and understand intimately how much she loves her little brother and why she is willing to go to such extreme length to achieve that.

Towards the end of the game I thought I was tired of it (game is challenging at times) but that also reminds me vividly that Amicia must be tired AF of it as well. The hopelessness can be unbearable towards the end of the game.>!And in the end it was almost like it was for nothing. Hugo can't be saved. Amicia had to kill Hugo with her own damn hands to end all this.!<

It's not my favorite game but like a great movie, when the credit rolls you can't help but sit there and think about characters, and what had transpired."

Finally, all shit breaks loose then the game ends after two sudden gameplay shifting bosses. You don’t get to see it iirc, but even the NPC teachers half of whom are veterans fight offscreen. One hell of a cliffhanger. Literally has you on the edge of your seat then the credits roll basically.

The first one is a bit sad and has its moments

The second is a path straight to the World of Depression

And the Third one is simply too good to make you feel confortable

And perhaps you'll find what you are looking for

154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Did they retcon the ending or something?

I remember when it first came out everybody was bitching at how terribly it ended and how it completely destroyed the Mass Effect legacy"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I was about to comment this
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"OP probably meant speechless in the positive sense but ME3 left many speechless for all the wrong reasons. 

Three games worth of building decisions on top of decisions, only for the trilogy to end with what was essentially a ""everyone lived happily ever after"" in three different colours. Even the DLC that expanded the endings didn't really make much of a difference. 

ME3 as a game was great, but that ending left a sour taste in many people's mouths. And that bad taste was only intensified with how mediocre Andromeda was."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,This. Can you come back later though? Still calibrating my thoughts on this.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Same.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Man I always skip ending credits, but for ME1 and ME3 I watched them entirely, chilling to the cool music and reminiscing om what I had just played. What an experience"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I think it's >!ending... 3? Where the OPENING CREDITS start rolling. And you just sit there like well fuck!<
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I concur. I felt empty and delighted at the same time when I finished this game the first time. I wish I could relive that moment.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I like the game but the constantly shifting perspective has thrown me hard for a loop. 

Just started playing after having gotten the steamdeck."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,Which ending lol?
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,"To this day, I still have the soundtrack saved to my playlist and will have it running as ambience for my day. Everything about that game is so amazing."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I finally had to stop playing when I realized there were an entire alphabet's worth of endings. I forget which one I hit and I was like, ""I can't do this anymore.""

Fantastic game."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Take my poor mans gold fellow inter of the Rift 🎖️
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Absolutely! My jaw was on the floor ... how it all made sense in the end.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"There's always a lighthouse, there's always a man, there's always a city."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Yeah I was going to say one of the BioShock games.  The first one was really good that way too.  But Infinite did leave you just thinking... ""WTF man..."""
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Constants and variables...
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I felt betrayed
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Same
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Fuck that jump scare though. That came out of no where.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Yeah. That twist ending really caught me off guard.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Wow. You‘re right I remember how floored I was. First bioshock too.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"This was my first thought, was happy to see it here st the top"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Oh yeah 100% after seeing the epilogue where everything is connected🤯
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I should finish this. The twist in 1 was phenomenal.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Yep, that was my reaction to the final two hours - which just flew through in a blur."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,The  2nd time round was better IMO. Especially when it came to the twins
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,Just commented this one before I scrolled far enough to see your post. That ending hit hard
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,Big time
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,ngl i started with bioshock 1 remastered because of this but I was toooo bored after first 3 hours in the game that I never completed it. so I never reached to infinite!
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Legit my first thought
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Best bioshock game argue with a wall
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"The first time I experienced that kind of plot twists was when watching Predestination. My mind was blown, for sure. But watching Dark and playing Bioshock, both of which have similar kind of plot twists, didn't blow my mind anymore."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Twice. With the ending and burial at sea that put a bow tie on everything at the end.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,Burial at sea is just perfect book end too. Love that series
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Yuna's speech, then credits.

Stare into the abyss and contemplate life. Feel sorrow. Hug pillows."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I've been summoned. 
My heart sank when you see her standing on the pier whistling for Tidus."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I still hate my ps2 disc till this day. I spent months trying to finish the game, got throught the dad boss and there was another boss but you cant save after you beat it cause it will show the end credits. Then that's where the disc decide to stop working. 

So all my months playing wasted and i cant watch the ending and we dont have internet on our place back then. Probably just learned about the ending 5 years ago."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I always hear Tidus’ forced laugh when someone mentions FFX
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Was about to write it, replayed so many time though the years, even bought the remastered when came out"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I didn’t cry.  You fucking cried!
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I'm actually replaying it on the PS5 with the enhanced upgrades right now! Haven't touched it since the initial release (or since they added everything from the definitive edition).

My mind is just once again blown away by EVERYTHING in this game. The graphics, the environment, the swordplay, the quests, the story....it's legitimately perfect. 

I want it to come to PC so badly so others can experience it. Easily one of my top 10 games of all time."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Some of the lines in that game hit hard. ""You have no honor."" ""And you are a slave to it!"""
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,"Jin’s final words to honor his opponent, promising how he’ll be remembered. Those very last moments, leading into the credits roll. 

Good god, that was a powerful ending. Jin’s pain was palpable."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"""just everything about it"" - never a truer word said"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Is that the actual name of the game, or just the advertisement.

Because if that's the name, that's hysterical."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I was scrolling down to see if Spec Ops popped up because this was definitely going to be my first answer.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Spec Ops: The Line is the right answer.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,Do you feel like a hero yet?
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,My friend i wasn't even blankly staring at the end. I started blankly starring after the water raid. I think it was at that point you realise exactly what you've done and I just started to accept everything that was happening.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"In Witcher 3, I ended up all without a maiden, in a dusty old home all on my own. That... cut a little too close to the bone. 

I immediately had to Google which specific choice I'd made that resulted in that; and immediately started another full playthrough. ....I still ended up alone, but at least the second time around I was a better father figure! :)"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Mayyyyy iiiiiiii. Stand unshakennnnnnn
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I was in the dumps for a few days after beating that game. Even though I knew where the ending was heading (especially after visiting the Dr in chapter 6) I was still so sad after finishing it.


Edit: spelling"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I had to take a day break before starting the epilogue.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,That's the way it is
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,This! I was so impressed by this game that I was staring at the credits absolutely frozen.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,More blubbering like a baby for me but yeah...
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,After finishing the epilogue the last thing I did was finally ho around and visit all the character graves. I obviously saved the best one for last and was playing select songs from the game while riding through the map with no fast travel. Very satisfying way to end the game.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I meant to put this on my list.  This game was a masterpiece.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,So glad I was alone when I beat that
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Yeah it was so boring I was staring at screen with my eyes closed
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Good one. Absolutely accurate!
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I was in literal shock. Everyone else is gone. It's just you and your ammo isn't recharging..
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,My god yes! That was such a banger of a game.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"That game was really good and the final fight was intense as hell.

The final cutscene felt like i had sren it before for some reason i got bad dejavu"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,That's an amazing answer.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I mean when you get something like this you can get that reaction: https://ibb.co/VDLjyPQ
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"The worst is when there’s an awkward combo of remaining letters, and you suspect it’ll be some obscure word, but then you miss all 6 guesses and figure out the word was basic all along"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,"When you have to come to terms with the fact you got so obsessed with phonics that you forgot that Saute was a word, and didn't recognize it even after you guessed it via brute force attack."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Hit me in such a 4th wall breaking way, when I realized that neither all my powers n the main game nor being able to reload in the prequel would ever let me change one of the most tragic events in the game (the death of a certain NPC)."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I agree. Especially when you realize all that time was suddenly just erased and Chloe...well, yea."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"The scene where you change the past n go visit your friend and at the end of the day she asked a favor from you... Holy shit, I just couldn't even touch my controller for like 2 days after that... Also the try true colors, it's one of the only good sequels."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,"Was looking in here to find a ""correct"" answer and this is it sir you win. That ending legit killed me that final decision alone took me like 10 minutes just not wanting it to end like this either way. Never cried so much over a piece of media."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,Those end credits left jaw hanging. Beautiful & heartbreaking
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I literally posted the same thing. I just played the first season for the first time last night. I bawled my eyes out.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Was about to put this as well. One of the most profoundly sad/emotional endings to a game. 2 or 3 minutes? I'm pretty sure I sat there staring at my desk for an hour.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I wasn't staring blankly at the screen, I was bawling my eyes out"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Damn can't believe this didn't come to mind and its definitely like top of my list of best stories in a game
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Took waaaaaay too long to see this one. That ending was just so strange
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,inside was awesome. i was laughing in disbelief
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"scrolled way to much to find this. 

if you manage to get anyone to play the game without telling them ""the secret"" ,the first encounter can be absolutely mind blowing"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"The game tells it's story through visuals, Music and companionship with other players and to this day I continue to cry because of this. Excellent game."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Honestly I was blown away by the ""bad ending"" it was so well done. Other endings great too but that one shook me to my core."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,THat little huddle before the final mission and the final mission really got me.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Me too but for other reasons. I didn’t even realize I was doing the final mission. When it ended I was in disbelief. I’m guessing I got the bad ending
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,"This ! everything felt so nihilistic for a while afterwards . I had to watch something uplifting as even the good ending left a hollow feeling .  
Then i watched cyberpunk Edgerunners the series and again was left speechless."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I have tried twice the game is still broken. I’ll never beat it
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,TLOU2 specifically for me.  The first game may have been overall better but #2 was emotionally draining like no game I’ve played before.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"TLOU 2 was truly an emotional rollercoaster. It's the only game I've played where afterwards I had a feeling of, ""that was one of the best games I've ever played, but I have no desire to ever play it again."""
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"The Last of Us 1. This was my answer. 

""Swear to me that everything that you said about the Fireflies was true.""

""I swear""

Aaggghhhhh!"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I only played TLOU1 (remastered) very recently on PS4. I think I already knew the ending but when you realise he's lied to Ellie and he's going to live with that decision... Damn.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,You’d just come after her
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Borh of The Last of Us games are works of art. I've never been as emotionally drained by a video game as I was after finishing part two. I hated Abby and was so annoyed when I had to play as her. By the end, when her and Ellie fight, I couldn't do it. The game kept killing me because I just could not make them kill each other.

I need to go play it again."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"1 really got me at the end. Was just sitting there staring and processing.

2 for some reason didn’t hit anywhere as hard. Probably due to all the drama outside of the game and that took me out of it and saw it more as a game that tried to conjure up emotions, rather than just a pure experience. Like I saw all the cues that should’ve made me emotional, but didn’t."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"""You made me *happy.*"""
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Was gonna say this, but specifically thought of Blood and Wine in particular. The final scene is such a good send off."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,That one ending with Geralt alone…. I also felt alone and shocked
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Lol did it like 5 different times while playing jt
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Achieve it again in FFXIV :D
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Probably dumbfounded that Sony could fund such a mediocre game.

Edit: I love how every person in this sub that tries to debate me ends up deleting their account from getting owned so hard."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I still get chills when I listen to the soundtrack
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,That sound track hits you in the feels. Amazing game
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,After the DLC too
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"It's the kind of thing that makes you glad you stopped to smell the pine trees, you know?"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,😭😭
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"That was the first game that hit me hard. When \[redacted\] died, it was like the entire resistance took a major hit. And the voice actor for Alyx's reaction just floored me. Still one of my very favorite games - easy top 3."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Going into the credits with just the sound of Alyx crying.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Upvote for HL2:E2. Have not tried HL:A yet
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Goddddd Alyx leaves you desperately wanting more... I was just stunned.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,Came here to say this myself
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,For me Elden Ring after the Godfrey fight. Not so much that awful Elden Beast fight.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I feel like I remember there being a fast forward button
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I think it can be more impactful with playing Asylum first then City
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Absolute masterpiece. It's too bad AK was such a shit show.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,This is the leveled up answer.  I questioned my whole place in the universe as the credits rolled.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"The universe is, and we are."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"That game broke me. No piece of media has ever made me as emotional as this series did. And Requiem specifically made me cry in a way that only life has done before. 

As you said... Just Jesus Christ man."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"That voice actress for Mary/Maria is **so** good.  The letter and that hallway scene almost left me in tears, and I'm not one to tear up easily.  


Which ending did you get on your first playthrough, btw?"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,All legacy of Kain games are dirty cheap on GOG. Are the games worth Playing? Never played Legacy of Kain before
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Shadowbringers was rough all the way through. My very favorite moment was the dialogue choice (towards the end of 5.0) ""Call him by name."" The tears well up just thinking about it."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Same, that last fight is so intense and they really build up this ""I can do it. I can break the cycle and keep him there"" then BAM!. 

What always got me though, seeing Yuna there whistling for him."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"With gears i have no idea what the fuck is going on with the story anymore, like after gears 5 i just wondered what the hell i just played and then just forget everything"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,lol
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I literally said ""What. The. Fuck."" together with Desmond. I remember spending a few minutes trying to understand what had just happened."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I legit sat there for a few minutes processing what just happened. Even better, once you realize that all of the events in the game actually happened with the Auditore family being complete fiction, you start to wonder what the Vatican is truly hiding."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Such a fantastic yet utterly soul-crushing experience. I hope more people find this game as the years go by.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Scrolled way too far for this.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"For me it was after the intro level. I felt that shit, literally sat and took deep breaths for a few minutes before continuing."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Of all the money that err I had…
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Cried like hell to the Sad FM during the boat ride. After all that transpired, knowing his backstory, the pale, wife, church... I just let go.
And then the island, the picture, omfg I'm crying right now remembering all that. That game is a masterpiece."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,i was about to write it. still can't get over the experience of disco elysium.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-22,"How is Disco Elysium not being blasted in the inner empire right to the top this list?  I’m sure some will say it’s due to the implied sense of inherent socioeconomic inferiority.

Then again I haven’t finished it yet. 

(“But does anyone ever finish anything?  Think about it, how would you *know* is was finished? Never mind. Shake it off. What were they talking about again?”"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Same, I finished season 1 for the first time last night. I felt so invested in these characters, I cried a few times not going to lie"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"And Future Connected. And Xenoblade Chronicles 2. And Torna. And Xenoblade Chronicles 3. And Future Redeemed. 

Gosh. This whole series truly is amazing."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Damn
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,To be fair... I feel like this right now in a real life situation.. I feel you.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I wonder why people love this game, I don’t remember much about other than the reviews when it first came out being meddling. What’s so good about that game?"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-22,"I kept scrolling down, hoping that someone would say DA:O

154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,You means years
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Yessss. I wish I could forget the game simply so I could play it for the first time again.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I'm glad its up towards the top maybe more people will get to experience that game nowb

154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,And then we see we would never win that coin flip.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,What difference would that make? Were they people?
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,I haven't played the game. Is that from the game or a poem quoted in it?
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Thats odd, it runs great for me on PS5."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,What's going on with the DLC? I finished both DLC a long time ago so I got to do it but why would it be prevented now?
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,Just bought Alan Wake Remastered on Epic games for $13
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,It was the only copy I had for a few years. And I still never got the bounty trophy.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"At least they patched it up A LITTLE with the DLC…

…*a little*"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I was late to the party and got the Legendary Edition for my first playthrough. I know it was worse before and the DLC addressed some of the issues, but the color-picking at the end still seemed so frustratingly random. Especially after all that buildup towards Destroy over the course of three games. I know the indoctrination theory has been officially debunked but..."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,"I played it on release. Video games are my favorite thing to do, not a day goes by that I don’t play something - even if it’s just 30 minutes on my phone or something. 

After finishing ME3 for the first time, I had no motivation to touch a single game for two weeks. I still can’t believe that’s how it ends."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,normandy felt like home!
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Even Andromeda?
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I bet you say that on all the threads 🙄 /s
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"What are you waiting for?  I finished recently the entire Mass Effect Legendary Edition games. And hands down one of the best game series I have ever played.  Absolutely amazing. You will laugh, and  you will cry, but mostly you'll have a blast. 

I'll leave you with this quote:
“Every mother, every son, every unborn child. They’re trusting you. Depending on you to win them their future. A future free from the threat of the reapers. But take heart. Look around you. You’re not in this fight alone. We face our enemy together and together we will defeat them.” – Commander Shepard"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I had very mixed feelings about the ending, but was ultimately content with the Destroy option. It accomplished the goal that all three games were leading up to, yet it came with a sacrifice >!of EDI and the geth!<. The other two options honestly felt like obvious traps, and in my headcanon, they were. ""TIM couldn't control the Reapers because they already controlled him - but *you* totally can control them, trust me bro"".  

And we don't talk about Andromeda."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,A B C D & E are the only essential endings
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Spoilers for how endings work in the game

>!A-E are the only actual endings, but you don't actually have to play through it 5 times to get those; you play through the A route, then the B route, then C-E are all obtained in one playthrough. The F-Z ""endings"" are just unique game over screens.!<"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"To be fair, the primary endings can all be attained through only 3 play throughs. A in the first, B in the second, and C through F all through the third."

154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,"Thats brings me back, must have been in my early teens (2002, so 15) and that scene was the only game before or since that brought a tear to my eye and a little lump in my throat, the whole game was just magical..  
  
Also this scene https://youtu.be/Zbv6KrO_13A I had just met a great girl (now wife!) and just wow, for some reason I still hymn to that song while out fishing"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I would be 😡 as hell!
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,HA HA HA
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,"No, I didn't fucking cry! You cried!"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Shooting the bow in that game with the triggers on the ps5 is one of the best feelings I've had in gaming. Such a great upgrade!
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,*you won't last 5 seconds playing this game!*
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,There is actually a challenge where you're supposed to jerk it in rhythm while being shown more and more explicit things while picking the tempo up to see how long you can last.  I forget what the name is.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Amiiiiiiidst, amidst a crashing wooorld"

154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"That's the brilliance of the writing in Red Dead II. It's no surprise or shocking twist. We know what's happening to Arthur, what's going to happen, yet it still breaks our hearts when we get there."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I knew shit was going down so I set my steed free. It kinda lessened the impact though >!when the horse fucking dies because Arthur was sitting there saying thank you to a horse he knew all of 5 minutes!<
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"The ending got you like 😢 

The house building got you like 😊"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Are you human
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,but true
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Yeah, it just leaves you lost when you choose one word and find out the other word you had wanted to choose was actually the right answer. Just makes you rethink life"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,That shit gets HEAVY...that entire episode...oof
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,I did the same thing...like maybe if I choose neither there's a happier hidden option that becomes available 😅
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,Happened to me. And it was.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,For real I posted a hate post on tlou2.. because i was to much of a bitch to handle it.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Im sure the people who hate on the game lack emotional depth. They can't understand that Ellies rage filled revenge was never going to make things better. This is what Abby learned and paid for by killing Joel. It only brought more harm and destruction to her. Ellie fortunately stopped her cycle of violence and she can now move forward but the costs of her decisions up to that point are still real: she lost Dina. She lost her connection with Joel through her ability to play the guitar. The price of revenge is forever trumped by the act of forgiveness.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,It was one thing after another. And I never wanted to put it down. They did a great job of making you feel conflicted and dissecting tribalism.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"The overall story was better in 1, but the gameplay in 2 was better imo. The absolutely visceral combat added so much to the emotional element the story conveys. I'll agree to this 110%"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"TLOU2 didn't do much for me, lost it's magic from the poor writing."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Agreed it took me ages to work through how I felt about every character and everything that happened. I mostly settled on pissed off at Ellie for destroying her own chance at happiness.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,For me it was the only game ever that I picked up 2 days after finishing it and then completed it again. Best game I ever played.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I was initially pissed and torn about playing with Abby. I wanted to see the end of Ellie’s story. Then as I kept playing that irritation disappeared.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I never felt the game “tried” to do anything. It felt earnest and authentic to me. It made you see that life and right vs wrong isn’t always black and white, similar to the first game. 
The quality of life gameplay additions were great too. It’s a masterpiece. But it’s ok if that wasn’t your experience. Not to diminish that pov"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,And you made me >!drive off a fucking cliff!<
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I got one of the good endings and I stopd there clapping. Games of this caliber can't ever be replicated. The world is so rich and stories/characters are so real
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,"""Literally almost every gamer is in favour of Microsoft. I'm not alone my dude. PlayStation is experiencing a complete fall from grace right now and frankly, it's the best thing to happen for gaming.""

Phil isn't going to date you."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,There was but then it became more difficult to shoot everyone's name lol
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Nah AK gets too much hate, that game is great"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Boooooooooooo
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Nothing can recreate my awe and wonder as I experienced that game. I was not expecting it to be such an experience. Watching their sun slowly die while in my spaceship counting the minutes pass by until we all die. Scary stuff
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Leave ending. Best one imo but I think in water makes more sense.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I love ‘em to death, personally. They’re all written and directed by Amy Hennig, who wrote and directed the first three Uncharted games. As wonderful as the writing in those games are I think her work in that department shines brightest in the Kain games

The gameplay was also quite innovative for its time, with the exception of some old tried and true block puzzles in the first game. 

Would highly recommend"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"The story, setting, and aesthetic are brilliant. The games show their age, but if you don't mind older games with some janky controls... Well worth it. 

Legacy of Kain is the most dated, but the story is important and is a little convoluted. You can probably read a synopsis or watch it on yt. 

Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 and the soul reaver series are less dated, still hard to handle but are some of my favorite sleeper hits due to story and setting etc. 

Legacy of Kain: Defiance ties everything together in what I feel is a masterful work of art."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"its really hard not to get feels when she whistles at the end. Q\_Q

such a Gdamn great game."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Same it’s so forgettable… I don’t get why AAA developers are so out of touch with the players…
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Yeah the intro was pretty sad too
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Yup. My favourite series :D
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Well the gameplay isn't anything spectacular. It's a third person shooter with awesome action and fun co-op but that's about it for gameplay. It's the story that really stands out
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,It’s a poem one of the game’s characters wrote.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Huge legal issue with publishing and distribution rights between dev and distributer.  Dev argues they didn’t have the right to distribute the DLC but the distributer was already selling complete editions so now I have a digital copy of the complete edition in which I cannot play the DLC.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Bounty trophy? 🤔
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"If they released what was in the DLC right off the bat, it would have lessened the blow considerably, at least for me. It was definitely so... deflating.  
I had to wait till my brother finished it too where he was like ...""is there more?.."""
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,It’s still bull shit. Just a fragment of a cutscene added to acknowledge a choice you had made.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,Indoctrination theory is the truth and nobody can convince me otherwise.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Yeah, even Andromeda. I'm not saying it's a perfect game but the main story line was still really good, and when I finished it for the first time I did stare at my screen blankly for a while watching the credits roll. The song playing at the end was really good too, so that probably helped."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Andromeda was a great game

Was it the Original trilogy, nope, but it was still a super fun, great experience"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,"Alright you convinced me, actually buying right now!"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Yeah, there's a lot of joke endings like the one you get for removing your cpu chip."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Sure - if I remember correctly. You are Booker, tasked to retrieve this girl Elizabeth from this city floating in the air, held by guy named Zachary Comstock. Long story short - time travel and multiverses involved; you end up finding out that Elizabeth is your daughter that you gave up to some multiverse travelers for some money ... and you are ALSO the main antagonist - in a different timeline you adapted name Zachary Comstock and worked to rule the city. Essentially, you are the hero, the antagonist, the savior of Elizabeth, and her betrayer. And to close the timelines ... and end everything - multiple versions of Elizabeth end up drowning you."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,"“That’s just bad game design”. 

-Shigeru Miyamoto (probably)"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I probably wouldn't know they call that cock hero.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Cock Hero!

^(this task was done automatically. I'm a bot)"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-25,Best choice is to just put the game down and assume it all worked out.😂
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Eh.

You aren't a bitch. It's a kick the dog ending with little thematic integrity to it.

The more mature ending would have been for her to flip the guitar over and try to play it left handed, showing that when you are at your lowest there is always a path back. Hell, she could listen to a song somehow. People act like a ""severing"" is meaningful, but if you want to write a game about grief, it doesn't end with people broken. It ends with people buckling their belt and moving forward as best they can, keeping the people they care about in their heart in whatever way they can, learning to forgive.

There wasn't forgiveness at any point. For anyone. So it really is just a game about hate with absolutely no catharsis.

But Druckman is really attached to the ""Empire"" idea of a sequel. I suspect the third game (or the TV show) is going to walk that back a bit."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I think people have a point regarding how painful it was to play as Abby. You need a lot of empathy to see Abby's perspective and that happens over time, and you don't have to love her or her actions but you can understand them and apply them to Ellie. I don't know that everyone is equipped to do that nor that everyone would find that experience fun, and I think that's ok. However, I thought it was brilliant, but boy was I emotionally drained by the end."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Sounds like they just mashed a bunch of pop culture tropes to create this monstrosity
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Pretty similar for me. It’s been a long time since I’ve played a game back-to-back. This time I started the first game immediately again, then back through 2. Even then it was hard to move on to another game"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"…so, it was all her work?"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Nah, it was good, if batmobile sections were better then yeah, but they were just bland and Deathstroke boss fight was criminal"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Ah so it’s the story that makes the game a classic. I never heard anything at ALL about the story. Maybe I’ll take a look into it
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,So. What is stopping you from playing the dlc if you already have the complete edition.  I am curious as I am about to play?
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Holding a bounty of 1000 gold in every hold. The vanilla game made sneaking way too easy, so getting caught was always hard since my characters were always stealthy."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Take my upvote, I'm so tired of the mouth breathers who auto down vote Andromeda.

It was a good game.  It just wasn't the main series and people couldn't deal with that."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Puh as much as I agree on me 1-3 
Andromeda lost me after 25 hours generic planet sites with generic repetitive quest and map markers."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,You guys have to watch Crowbcat‘s video on Andromeda
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I thought the exploration was a lot of fun
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I don't think Andromeda is a bad game, I can see why some people enjoy it. But did it really leave you in awe at the end? Honest question, because I picked it up twice but never actually finished it. It was pretty to look at and the combat was fun, but the gameplay felt too repetitive, the dialogue and voice acting weren't always great, and I found most characters either annoying or forgettable. There were too many quips and jokes that took away from the tension that the game was trying to build up. Got as far as the final mission and realized that I wasn't emotionally invested at all. That's just my experience though."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Or eating a fish and throwing up to death
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,There are some great ones for killing NPC’s as well. Honestly the only ones that are hard to get are the 2 involving Emil
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"We have reached the era of the cycle where any criticism of part 2 is downvoted. Buuut, fuck it. 

To me it's just the trap a lot of stories fall into of ""subverting expectations"". I always feel like this whole aspect of. ""Sometimes things don't have a good ending. Not everyone has a heroic death."" Like yes. Sure. In reality, yes. This is fiction, there needs to be a balance. If you entire story is. ""Life fucking sucks. Just hope for a quick death."" Well. That's not very enticing to me. 

Of course my opinions are my own. And anyone who did enjoy it, good. Glad you did. Just not for me."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Yes, I think the issue is that you come at their perspective from two different starting points. You see the worst of Abby and have to see why she did it. With Ellie, you understand why she was filled with anger and wanted revenge. For me, going back with Abby to know her before and while she became what she became was emotional storytelling: you hate this person for what they had done. Now understand why they did it and why Ellie is following the same path and can she change the path she is on. I know that people can play the game and not understand it but they choose to hate on the story and the developer for it instead of understanding the issue is with their own inability to empathize another view/person/story beyond a basic level of Point A to Point B."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"It was definitely an interesting and unique approach to the storytelling. I personally absolutely loved it, but I definitely agree that there's a level of empathy needed that many people don't have.

Definitely the most mentally exhausting games I've played. Once I get a PS5 it'll be one of the first games I replay. I just don't want to replay it on my PS4 Pro."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Not in my opinion. It's one of the most unique stories I've experienced in any medium and goes way beyond ""dig two graves"" typical revenge tales."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"The batmobile was dope and unique. Problem was they made you use it way, wayyy too much. Otherwise fantastic, beautiful game."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,The DLC areas are not activated and are not accessible.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"Oh! That one… Well, tell ya what: Sneak kill guards, each one should get you that 1,000. 🤭👍"
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I didn't play Andromeda until 2 years after release and I liked it more than ME 2 and 3. I feel like its poor state at release really poisoned it for a lot of people.

ME 2 was one of the biggest disappointments of any sequel ever. I don't understand how it made so many ""top 10 RPGs of all time"" lists. I know its an unpopular opinion but I will happily die on that hill."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,I fell off of that game but the planets were not the reason why in the slightest. The environments looked really good and were most of the enjoyment I had with it.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I didn't like the companions either. Very forgettable compared the the mainline crew and the whole dynamic was off. It was one of those rpgs where every party member wanted to be your friend.

Edit: immediately, like right out the gate want to vomit their backstop at you."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,Yeah I wholeheartedly agree with you. It's powerful to be guided from hatred to understanding. Full disclosure my first act playing as Abby was to try to kill her lol.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,[It's an old trope discussed way before TLOU2](https://www.neogaf.com/threads/i-really-dislike-the-heroes-shouldnt-kill-trope.1163132/)
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,You can't sneak is the issue. You have to be witnessed killing the guard to get the bounty.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,ME2 was the peak of the trilogy for me. ME1 was okay but something about the gameplay/inventory was weird to me. I felt like ME2 was more streamlined and let me focus on the story more.
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,"I'm not trying to be snarky but genuinely asking whether you've played the game?

The link you've sent is about the heroes don't kill trope.

I won't spoiler as much as I could but in no way does Ellie keep her moral compass or refuse to kill anyone. She tortures people to death, murders a pregnant woman, sets dogs on fire, whatever it takes. She's not a hero at all and the game goes out of its way to make that clear.
When she doesn't kill the reasons are complex and ambiguous.

Having said all of that, it does have building blocks from other stories going which date back to Greek tragedies. All stories have some roots in what's been done before and I'm good with that."
154nqka,2023-07-20,2023-07-21,"One of the reasons I loved ME1 was that so much care went into world building. Every game mechanic had an in-universe explanation for why it was that way. Additionally, Bioware had a very clear goal that they were vocal about from the beginning: Mass Effect would be a trilogy where player choice would have a significant persistent effect across the entire trilogy. 

I was so excited. I played through ME1 4 times total. I made 3 different characters that all had different personalities and made different choices.

Then ME2 came out. They changed a bunch of the mechanics but because those mechanics were tied to in universe explanations, they had to come up with new in universe reasons why it was different. They failed. The explanations didn't make any sense and didn't line up with what was actually happening in the game. 

Also, all the classes just became generic. The soldier class in ME1 was all about passive buffs for weapons and being able to use the right weapon for the right situation. Biotics were direct damage dealers who could force the enemy out of cover. Tech specialists buffed their allies and had defensive techniques. In ME2, all the classes could do anything. It was just a question of which particle effect you wanted to see.

And finally, I don't think I have to get into how they completely failed to implement player choice in any meaningful way. The only difference any of your choices made was which NPC gave you a quest. Wow, what shining example of persistent and meaningful player choice.

The final mission of ME2 was fantastic and well executed but that doesn't make up for the entire rest of the game completely falling on its face.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk. /rant"

2. The Witcher 3. I tried several times to get into this game. Not sure why I don't like it, something just doesn't click and its not that satisfying to me.
3. Elden Ring. I don't find dying over and over again that fun.
4. Dave The Diver. I liked the idea of a restaurant sim but the exploration is tedious and I can't stop trying to min/max every aspect.
5. Terraria. Makes me just want to play Minecraft. I respect that they are different games but maybe I just have a soft spot for MC.

But I cannot stand games that are designed to fuck you in the ass. I get absolutely no enjoyment dying again and again and again and again and again and again. And I get no satisfaction when I finally kill the boss that's downed me so many times because I know it's going to happen again. And again. And again."

Give us Forza 4 with better graphics, what is hard to get in that, no metrics, no 'ground up', no more lies, no more missteps, no more blaming the community. Playtest your damn games. If any other team had launched a game that busted and not ready for competition they'd have seen massive layoffs or a studio shutdown.

The games are 95% gameplay and sound design, everything else is pretty weak. From us like the new Bethesda I'm this way, where they're very good at 1 or 2 things, so people just ignore all the flaws.

Coffee- A term referring to something that one can acknowledge as being good or of high quality, but you simply cannot enjoy because it’s just not your thing. No matter how good the cup of coffee, if you don’t like coffee, it’s still not your thing.

The opposite he calls Sushi.

Sushi- A term referring to a game or work that just clicks with you in a way that’s hard to otherwise describe. It may not be the best, and may be overshadowed by other games you like or that are better, but a Sushi game just fits you perfectly."

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I’ve tried and failed to get into BG3. I think it’s incredibly healthy for the games industry as a whole, when we’re looking down the barrel of a sawn-off shotgun loaded with live-service games and battle passes. 
I agree it’s a fantastic game and get how people have dumped 300+ hours into it but I work full time and have a toddler; I just don’t have the time investment available. I also dislike how the game makes me feel like a complete moron. I’ll agree that there is a skill issue on my part but it still got frustrating where I just about failed every combat encounter without quick save/load. Majority of my skill checks outside of combat would fail, despite skill proficiencies and low DCs and in combat, a huge majority of my attacks would miss. 
I post a stealth archer in the rafters of a large indoor area; they have a 98% chance to hit a standard goblin who is threatened by another of my team members. The goblin is in range and not obscured. The archer is in successful stealth, doing a stealth attack at a height with stealth and archery proficiencies and misses on three separate quick save/loads. I know 98% isn’t 100% but this is one of many examples of when my timely setups were punished or didn’t pay off. 
I still enjoy watching streamers or gameplay clips but I’ll pass on playing this again for a good while."

I didn't know it was early access for years before officially coming out in 2023, I find that not fair for so many other games being judged by comparison but I understand the game itself probably deserve every single award it did.

Also, the combat is really not for me, but again, I understand as a representative of its genre, it's probably the best thing yet."

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Hollow Knight

I adore the art style, the story from what I know of it is great, it has the same rewarding gameplay as souls likes. They're the reason I got HK, since I platinumed the actual 7 games (DeS, DS1 2 and 3, BB, Sekiro, and ER) and wanted to try another challenge. I could also immediately see the care put into the game from the start. First thing I did when I got my copy for PS4 was sit down and look through the manual at the map, the lore, the characters, and some of the enemies.

I loved the game when I played it, but it was so much of a chore to go through because it's a Metroidvania. For one, fast travel barely exists. There's a few spots you can go thanks to the stag stations, but you're mostly on your own in the gauntlet of areas. And they're very big so, say you're trying to find a charm you found out about online. It's gonna take you a good 5 minutes to get from the nearest stag station and through all of the platforming to get to it, hoping you don't die to the same set of spikes over and over again trying to get to that next bench. I really hope they let you fast travel between benches in Silksong, even if it would ruin the aspect of the large world. I don't have time to keep running through the same area, even if I dealt with that in souls gamess.

I would love to go back and 100% the game, but I don't think I can take more of it even after half a year since I beat it. I suck at platformers, the metroidvania aspect of running around for hours I don't like, the mechanic of taking damage just by touching an enemy boils my nerves to no end, it's just... Ugh."

I hate that I can't control my character freely, the turn based combat is just awfull. I know Baldurs is the CRPG of CRPGs, but it's not for me, that's for sure. If it would have been ARPG styled, I would totally play it. Everyone is hyped about it, but I don't really see the reason, I played older ARPGS that had better story and controls."

The sound makes me super angry, and I purposely turn the sound off whenever I hear it. I mention Zelda: BotW, but any game with this sound makes me irate.

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Baldurs Gate 3 is undoubtedly and indisputably one of the greatest games of all time. And I don't like it. It's a personal preference and not the top down task queuing style of gameplay. It is ironically the dice mechanic. 

If I make decisions and plan battles and think out decisions leading up to an interaction hoping for a peaceful outcome or optimal combat and the dice at any or every step of the way just say ""no."" Then I find that arbitrary and unenjoyable. At a table with a DM the DM can take that ""no"" and do something cool with it. In Baldurs gate 3. A low roll is a no or fail absolutely and a pass roll is a blanket pass except in combat where a high roll will do more damage. I'm sure there is far more to it than that but in my time playing. The arbitrary ""no"" because dice said so just takes me out of the experience. Every single detail of the game is immaculate and well thought out the ways you can interact with npcs and levels is so versatile in its crafting I am in awe. But the dice lock me out so I don't like it."

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Persona 5. I love the themes, the story & characters, and the OST is phenomenal but I've always disliked turn based combat. I gave it a good try ~15hrs and the enemy recruitment is easily my least favorite feature. It wasn't intuitive to me so I'd fail a lot, and every failed attempt also means you forfeit all XP and money from the fight so I'd just feel like I'm wasting time and resources and screwing myself out of xp/$ I'd need the next day. Overall I still think it's an amazing game I just wish I liked the combat more.


Edit: also compared to older turn based rpgs I've played, P5 has lots of QOL and does turn based combat well objectively, I just still don't enjoy it subjectively"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Honestly… RDR2. It went on a sale about a month ago and I knew there was a lot of hype surrounding it so I was like why not. At first I really enjoyed it, I probably spent about 30+ hours in it but quickly I found myself not really engaged in the story and kind of finding the controls and movement a tad annoying. 

Don’t get me wrong, I completely understand why it’s such a revered game and the details in it are amazing, but I think for me right now it’s not what I’m looking for in a game at the moment. I’ll definitely come back to it when I’m ready to give it more of my time because I don’t hate the game, just not something I’m willing to pour my time in right now."

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West. Far and away some of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played but I just don’t like them. I powered through Zero Dawn on my PC and got about 15-20h into Forbidden West before I quit.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I'm sure Witcher 3 is great but I cannot get into it no matter how many times I try.

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Celeste is a challenging platformer, but my experience with it was just infuriating. Comparing it to Super Meat Boy, I find Super Meat Boy's difficulty fair since the levels are short and you're relatively fast so it's almost like you're speedrunning the game, but Celeste's levels are just so long and vast, its difficulty is hard to praise when the levels are so long. I like the music and its artstyle but I generally disliked the levels and the infuriatingly hard stunts you \*have\* to do in order to progress."

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Any shooters that don’t have realism. Cod, battlefield, valorant, siege, CS. I only play fps games like squad, post scriptum and hell let loose, due to all the other games being so monotonous to me. Running around an arena mindlessly killing things without an actual objective is so boring, but I have friends who love it, so it’s just not for me."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Apex Legends is just not my thing
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Horizon Zero Dawn. It’s like a Ubisoft game done much better and competent.

The story was just so predictable but pretended it still had mystery after being accepted by the clan at the end of first act. The gameplay loop got old halfway through."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Metal gear solid series, God knows I tried more than one, but they just don't click for me."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Blood borne & Dark souls series. Love their gothic art styles, cool looking monsters and I’ve played each one just to try to get into them but the difficulty just doesn’t appeal to me. Never understood why they couldn’t put like a guided mode or something for players who want a more enjoyable route."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I am having a very hard time getting into Baldur's Gate 3.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Baldur's Gate 3. I just don't really like games where you have to manage a party and everything revolves around relationships. I just want to go on a nice solo adventure, not manage 4 inventories, worry about everyone's approval and have my party members flirt all the time because they really like some random thing I did.

It's the same reason I never take companions with me in most games and pretty much the whole Bioware library is out of the question."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Elden Ring. I love everything about it, except playing it."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I cannot get into any GTA game. I tried really hard with Vice City and San Andreas but certain missions just stopped me as a kid. Admittedly it probably won't be an issue for me now but I can't get into that genre at all now.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I can appreciate the time and effort that went into Grand Turismo 7. It's a great racing sim, but it's so grounded in reality that I find it boring. Give me some Hot Wheels Unleashed and I'm good."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Weird thread start because you don't like racing games. It would have been different if you like racing games but don't like for a although you can admit it's good.

The game isn't the issue, it's the genre. It's like saying ""Everyone likes snickers and it looks pretty good, but I don't. Also I am allergic to peanuts and don't like chocolate"""

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Hi Fi Rush. It's a perfect version of a type of game I don't like (ie. I suck at rhythm games and I don't love beat em ups)
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Baldurs gate. Amazing games just find the gameplay boring
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Probably all those FromSoftware games. Your Demons' Souls, Bloodbornes, Eldin Rings, Sekiros, etc. I really just can't stand how they look or feel to play, or how the rpg mechanics work.

I despise the combat, and not merely because it's difficult because I've played tons of difficult games that require quick reaction time and memorization of enemy animations. It's just annoying and unfun. You just roll around and wait for an eternity to get some hits, then repeat. All that after lots of trial and error deaths, assuming you haven't just binged YouTube videos beforehand.

Character builds are pretty simple, and leveling is just pumping stats in a certain order. Equipment variety seems pretty absent. Balance isn't present either - some options are plainly superior to others. But please feel free to correct me on these points because I haven't played the games extensively.

And, I'm sorry, but a lot (not all) of those games are hideously ugly to me. I strongly disagree with folks who love the aesthetic. I've been over dark for dark's sake since my late teens. Let's not even go into the bizarre dialogue and purposely convoluted storytelling, also big pet peeves of mine. It comes across as pretentious, not deep.

But I recognize many people adore them and consider them some of their favorite games of all time, so I respect them. I'm sure they're wonderful, they're simply not for me.

Source: lots of YouTube let's plays."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Twice, I tried to get into Shadow of Mordor - I get why people really love it, but for whatever reason, I just couldn't continue"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Most of the valve stuff, I know it's fantastic and has done loads for gaming in general but I can't stand playing them."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,The Last Of Us. Story-wise these are some of the absolutely best out there but I know I will never want to play them because of how the actual gameplay is designed.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Elden Ring. It deserved GOTY, but it's not the game for me. As much as I like reading to get lore, I much preferred playing through God of War that year"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Hollow Knight

I'm not a metroidvania person and I got really lost and couldn't get past any of the first bosses. I gave up after a couple hours

I might try it again someday. But while I admit the game is really good and I'm happy for people who like it, it's just not my kind of game."

I can't stand Tidus"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"i dont understand why people dont like racing games, maybe you dont feel the thrill of speed while going 300+ kph?"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Elden Ring. It’s just not for me. I don’t have a huge amount of time to game and the learning curve is too steep for me personally.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I’m a racing fanatic and I think the new Forza is a complete turd. The driving is an upgrade over prior games but the rest of the game is terrible. Graphically as well, it doesn’t even look as good as GT7 which came out 2 years earlier and only features ray tracing in replays whereas Forza has it in gameplay and looks worse. There is a mountain of bugs in Forza as well. I honestly hate the game and I’m a long time Forza player. I could go on and on about what I don’t like about this game."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Metal Gear Solid V is very clearly a well-made game… It just never quite clicked for me as someone who’s garbage at stealth and tactics. 

In fact the only game in this series I ever completed was revengeance because it’s got entirely different combat and pacing."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I can’t really admit (in my opinion) that the game is super good because I haven’t played it much at all, but I know everyone praises the NieR: Automata. From what I’ve heard, it sounds super fun and interesting, but I just can’t get myself to sit down and play it. Unfortunately, I get bored really quick playing it, but I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad game by any means. It just wasn’t for me."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Any Hitman game. Tried Absolution some time ago. Didn’t find it exciting. 

Red Dead Redemption II, I don’t have enough patience for all that."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Horror games in general.

Jump scares don't do anything to me and I just can't get immersed in whatever way you need to to truly enjoy them."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Zelda. Fight me.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-22,"Elden Ring. Baldur's Gate 3. Most AAA titles these days. CoD. 

I can admit that my gaming preferences have become a lot more limited over the years and that just because a game isn't to my liking it doesn't mean it's a bad game."

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-22,"Last Of us. It's a pretty, dialog rich, walk though a museum of set pieces. The combat is sparse but decent. They were decent experiences I find over rated."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-22,"The Witcher 3

Also any soulslike games"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-22,"Alan Wake 2 for me, I know its incredible, the story and visuals particularly but not my cup of tea. Gameplay was too boring."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-22,Skyrim. I just don’t like the style of gameplay. I understand why others love it tho
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-22,"A lot of people love Breath of the Wild and ToTK, I cannot stand them.

I've really only heard good things about Control, but I found it so boring and the story so unengaging that I dropped it forever

Also the entire Uncharted series, they never seemed better than a typical action adventure game to me"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-22,"FF14

I can see why so many people like it, I just... dont."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-23,Cyberpunk 2077. It looks beautiful but it didn't click with me unfortunately.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-24,"Maybe GTA, for me.

I get the appeal, the fluidity of the gameplay (especially when driving), and it being a large online sandbox to exist in with other people. *It is cool.*

But I don't super love the set-up of heists. It just kind of feels like a lot of slow set-up for something then kind of rushed and stilted. But really more so what I take issue with is the tone of the games, I guess? People really do be serious about just wanting to shoot places up .\_.

I never was one for larger graphical upgrades or ""woahh how big is the world"" kind of thinking. I'd rather something quaint and qualitative. Which I understand in some ways GTA can be, at times. But when I saw GTA VI was announced and was trying to understand the hype, someone said ""I just want it to be more realistic and there to be more people on the beach living more believably full lives when I mow through them in my car.""

What... *why?*  
It's very freaky that people not only have such a necessary urge to do something like that (violence in video games is fine in itself) but that they be frothing at the mouth just to get it as close to the real deal as possible. That'ssss a little too far for me.

Very well made games. A substantial and well sustained audience.  
I don't think violent video games make violent people at all. But violent people will still flock to it, and I'm not sure if enacting those things is really such a good pastime."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,"Understandable. Personally I like them but I see your point.  
You either want to hold a controller and do something or just watch a show.  
It‘s a weird mix"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,I've tried and I start to doze off. I just can't do those either. It's something I can maybe put on someone's playthrough of in the background; since they will read all the dialog. But playing myself is such a struggle.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Detroit: Become Human was like this for me.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"There are some visual novels that just can’t be told through a show, though. 

Doki Doki Literature Club comes to mind."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Ive been struggling with dialog heavy games the last few years. Triangle strategy, for example, was really cool with FFT being one of my all-time favorites, but 45 minutes of dialog between 30-minute fights made me happy it was over."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Same. Unless they're fully voice acted and let you make numerous choices that influence the plot. But if the story is fully predetermined I might as well have the same experience without having to press buttons.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I like to think of them as enhanced books rather than an incomplete TV show. I mean it's in the name. But yeah I totally get it, not my favorite genre either, though I've thoroughly enjoyed more than 1."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,Dark Souls is the gaming equivalent of black coffee. It’s a miserable experience at first but eventually something in you just breaks and you find yourself craving it
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,"Same. I have a lot of games I wanna play and just don't want to commit a lot of time to learning them, though I hear the feeling when you start to get good is amazing."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Elden Ring was my thought. I played it quite a bit, had a good time with it, and put it down because I find repeating the same boss fight over and over gets tiring (because I struggle with memorising attack patterns). It’s still an incredible game, well deserving of all the praise it received, and I understand why lots of people consider it to be one of the greatest games of all time … but it’s not for me."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Exactly. I know why other people like it. I just don’t. But funny enough I like the genre the souls games coined. I’ve played other souls like games. I just don’t like the original
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,So glad other people feel this way. The dodge roll then strike video games just don't excite me at all. It's such a boring game play loop for me.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,"I felt the same way, and then I started playing Lies of P. Free download on Game Pass. Thought I'd give it a try. I love it!  And I'm not the biggest fan of Souls games."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Yup, and I'd go a bit further and say pretty much anything by From. Very competently made games, but something about their aesthetic just rubs me the wrong way."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Agreed.
Having played Elden Ring and beating it then trying to do alot of things on the side. I get the appeal. But God I don't want to go through that again in terms of difficulty"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Yeah I hate them hate demon souls dark souls elden ring I can play them and I'm good but they bore me to death. Its just not fun.. 


I really dont see the appeal .."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I agree completely. Watching people that are good at these is a blast, but yeah, not my cup of tea."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I want to like them so bad, but I don’t.

And it’s not a difficulty thing. They’re not the hardest games I play"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Sekiro? Took me YEARS of attempts before I ""got"" it and was hooked."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"The tricks to those games are learning the equipment you need for each boss, the routes to get places, and which openings you can exploit for attacks."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I played the first one and finished it and had a pretty good time with it... but had no desire to continue the series.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-22,"Exactly. Personally if a video game requires hours and hours of learning, I'm not going to bother playing it"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"To me, they are a large departure from what I loved about previous Zelda games. BOTW felt to me like a natural expansion and exploration of something a bit new, and I really enjoyed it. But TOTK took it too far away from what I like about Zelda. Perfectly executed game, just not what I am looking for in a Zelda title"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"This whole chain is almost word for word how I've described these games. By no means bad, even very good (though I do think not as good as people say). It just doesn't feel like a Zelda game to me, and isn't what I want when I sit down to play Zelda. The worst of it all being the breaking weapons. I could get past literally every other problem I have with BotW, but I hate that one mechanic so much that it singlehandedly made me quit the game, never finish, and refuse to give TotK a chance."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Durability ruins them for my personal enjoyment. But at least emulation and modding exist to fix that issue. 

But I really do hope that Nintendo goes back and makes more traditional Zelda titles. The open worlds for these last two titles are just way too big and open. I actually really miss linear Zelda with explorable overworld spaces. 

Plus dungeon design has really suffered."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,It was weapons breaking for me. I checked out almost immediately lol
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"This is my answer too! I did eventually enjoy Breath of the Wild, but it wasn't what I was hoping for. I just got Tears of the Kingdom recently and honestly I'm really just not into it. It's just not what I'm looking for in a Zelda game."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"It took me a couple of hours to get into TOTK, but as soon as I stepped playing I was pretty confused wtf I'm even supposed to be doing, every enemy defeated me in one hit, the puzzles were confusing, but now I quite like it. There are still many thing I'm just ignoring because I don't know what and how I'm supposed to be doing, but I'm having fun.

But yeah definitely not the kind of game I'd usually play."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,The repetition and lengthy traveling and climbing made this a snore fest. More so than the sailing in wind waker.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Yep. The lack of audio recall from the soundtrack tied to big story beats just killed it for me. It's the biggest part of Zelda imo. Memorable scores that are bound to specific moments in-game that you never forget. 


Everything else can get criticisms but this was the killer for me. Lack of dungeons, focus on collectables, and weak weapon durability didn't help at all. But the lack of good story beats is what pushed me away from these games."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I beat botw and I'm willing to say it's pretty shit tbh. I really had to force myself
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I've been gaming for 24 years and can probably still count the games I bought, started, but didn't finish on two hands. Especially full-priced ones.  
Breath of the wild is the one that always comes to mind first.

The world is empty, the combat a chore because of the weapon durability, and whenever it rains I just contemplate putting the thing down because the one thing I do find awesome, traversal, just becomes impossible for a period of time.

I imagine it's the same as Hogwart's Legacy. If you're really into the IP then it's a dream come true to just walk around in a world you love. I get that, but Zelda is not that for me."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,They're really really good games. They're OK Zelda games.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Took me so long to see another comment like mine. Absolutely respect those games and people who enjoy them. I just can’t do it. I can’t sit through the time it takes to make what’s in my head happen.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Yeah... I'll buy some of them and just watch someone else play them on YouTube. I can't do that for any other genre. Lots of these stories are amazing, but super stressful."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I took me ages to get into it. But then i didnt want to put it down.
So many amazing details, so much random stuff to do. 

And i'm not even into wild west stuff."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Fucking finally. I got to that first town, started talking to people, and realized I was bored to fucking tears."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Im kind of in the same boat. My game bugged when you repair the wheel on the cart, i whip the horses but they don't move. I get that it's a slow intro but I haven't found the will to start the game since."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Same, I pushed myself to play about 12 hours before throwing in the towel. It's a beautifully made game with an excellent cast. I didn't find it very fun, though, and controlling Arthur was a pain."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Same I just cannot get past how janky the character controls. It’s essentially Niko from GTA 4. It’s so loose, delayed and disconnected from the controller."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I finished it but it took two years, three separate attempts and was a struggle. 


I'm okay with slow gameplay. 


I'm not okay with the controls feeling wonky, the gunplay being poor, stale mission design and the narrative pacing making some sections of the game way out stay their welcome.


I get why so many love it but for me personally it's the most overrated game I've ever played. I've never played something so universally praised that I found an actual chore to finish."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-23,"Play the various Call of Juarez games and call it a day. They are shorter, better IMO, and more ~~gun~~ fun."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"It’s a game I’ve never played and probably never will, along with the last of us. I think they are two of the greatest games made. But I have no Desire to ever personally play them

That said I will watch someone playthrough them like once a year or so because the stories are so damn good. And I can skip through all the running around and somewhat underwhelming combat"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I thought it was more fun to play RDO than the story, although I also enjoyed the story. It's more interesting and fun to have a posse"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Rockstar needs to start a high quality movie/tv production studio.  It’s so much more in their wheel house than actual games in my opinion.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Yeah never was obsessed with cowboys
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Same! It just feels so clunky for some reason, gta5 and Witcher 3 also have ""clunk"" but I finished and loved both. But smt about rdr2 clunk is different. I got past the snowy bit and into the town, then I stopped. 

Perhaps there is a mod or something that changes how it feels to play."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Fair awnser. One of the worst best games.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Even as someone who loved it and played through it, you gotta admit that the story and the atmosphere (and the visuals) is what makes it good. The open world is very meh and the gameplay is incredibly basic."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I've put about 50 hours into it twice. I love the world and hate the missions. Everything is so slow. Looting a house takes 5 minutes and it's just not worth it.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I have to say, fortnite is one of the best games I don't play. 

I totally get why people play it, but it just isn't for me."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Getting decent, not even good, at 1 fighting game ruined all other fighting games for me. Now the fun doesn't start unless I have a basic knowledge of all characters and mastery over 1 enough to physically input the stuff I envision in my head. The real fun doesn't start til its a mind game, hitting flow states, reading attack strategies, etc. It's just way too high a barrier of entry. I'm not good enough to improve to that point quickly, and I don't enjoy casual matches where idk what I'm doing much anymore after seeing how fun it is to be good."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"funny, those are the only two i ever really liked as well"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I'll play the older ones, but the quality of the games has been on a steady decline for years imo."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I’d say it’s the opposite for Pokémon. Many people like it but the games are really really bad
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Most people don’t like them anymore. I think it’s very widely agreed that recent pokemon games are really bad
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Most people just grow out of Pokémon. It’s not meant for adults but adults are the ones keeping it alive now. The games are so easy and “competitive” is basically mathed out to the point they ban huge swaths of the Pokemon to the point you can’t use all your faves.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,…they aren’t good anymore.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I just watch JRose or MahDryBread, they make Pokemon fun with their challenges. Red/Blue/Gold/Silver/Snap, that was it for me lol."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,This is my exact response but I think I can point to the combat as being just 'meh' for me
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"This was what I was going to say for me as well. I love The Switcher universe, but just couldn't get into the game. I understand why it is so highly acclaimed, but I like having RPGs where I can develop my own character. I also am not a fan of games with endless side quests that I don't feel invested in or forget what they're about by the time I get around to them.

I think that's why I liked Elden Ring so much. It was an open world for me to explore without getting bogged down by a quest log."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"FF12 really suffers from, “who’s the main character?”syndrome."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Exactly the same with me. I loved TA and was so hyped as a kid for XII, but I feel like the story/characters just weren’t interesting enough to make me care."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"That’s why I usually only play with friends or mod packs. I need a direction to work towards, and those often provide one."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,That's why i treat it like factoria and always end up with a factory instead of a house...
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,"For the longest time, Souls games never truly clicked with me but I would beat them just cause. Then I finally learned how to parry and dodge instead of just tanking everything with a shield and man it is such a game changer. It feels like a dance instead of just getting lucky now. Parrying is SO satisfying once it finally clicks"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I like a lot about elden ring, I can appreciate a hardcore setting. It definitely be satisfying to finally beat a boss after hours of struggling.

But I really can't stand some features being almost maliciously bad. Like the vanilla co-op functionality in its entirety.  ""Oh you want to play with friends? - f*** you""

Trying to play it with my girlfriend was just needlessly complicated until the PC co-op mods came out. We enjoyed the heck out of the game after that."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"To me it was the lack of story - it’s first game in the series I try and I didn’t research it, I just jumped The hype train and bought it. Played a few hours, but I struggled to get immersed into the game, I didn’t feel anything for the characters or the enemies. I know it’ll probably come, but it made me loose interest pretty fast.

Then I tried multiplayer, but not being able to progress together made it uninteresting to me.

But I absolute acknowledge that it’s a solid and beautiful game, and understand much of the hype - it’s just not for me."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,elden ring is the easiest of the series
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Yep. Great game, well made, does everything it is trying to do really well. I just have no interest in what it is trying to do."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I loved that game so much and to me the touches like having to clean your weapons or brush your horse really added to the experience. So it really stuck out to me that to change a costume all you do is go into a menu, click a button and all of a sudden Arthur is magically wearing different clothes. With all the other adherence to realism you'd think they'd make you do it in a bedroom with a wardrobe or something."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,"Red dead 2 fans love to pretend their game is perfect and better than everything as if half the game isn't riding a horse 35 miles across country in silence.

I fucking love the game a lot, adore the story and characters, but it's nowhere near as good as people like to say it is."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Death stranding is definitely not a game everybody will enjoy. I really liked it, but I absolutely understand why not everyone does."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Same here, clearly executed really well but it's just not my cup of tea.  

Couldn't get into the lore, didn't like the protagonist, and found the combat and tactics to be too complicated.  

I've played and enjoyed many other open-world RPGs  and keep coming back to The Witcher every year or so to see if I can come around and I just can't get into it."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,There are many things t o like but I don't like Geralt. 
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,Can you elaborate a bit more what you don’t like but acknowledge?
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Really? Feels like once you get into it, they all become the same and are beaten by the same formula."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I’ve beaten all and love them but Elden ring. I’m up to Morgott the omen king and I made the mistake of playing other games. I’ve tried to come back but always forget the controls. If I just kept playing when I first got to him I’d be fine but now I can’t be bothered to relearn and finish the game even though I’ve beaten them all.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,Even the most skilled make mistakes sometimes
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I think it’s about reprogramming your mind about expectations for those situations. “Failing” a check is simply one of the potential fun paths toward the next phase of the adventure. 

Think of any good story, the main character doesn’t succeed flawlessly at everything. That would be absurdly boring.  Checks in RPGs like that aren’t win or lose, they determine where the story goes from there. You have to be willing to go along for the ride and witness the potentially disastrous consequences, like a good story."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,That’s a good example. A lot of people praise the game for all its details but don’t like the gameplay-loop.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Yes, and the turn based combat is such a slog and kinda confusing if you’ve never played DND. So my sword does D8+6 but my knife does D6+2 I’m like wtf does this shit even mean. It doesn’t ever explain it to you"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"You just live with the consequences. There's nothing in the game where failing a check means game over, at least not in modes that isn't honor mode. But even then you have a chance to fight back against a failed check, and this mode isnt meant as a first playthrough."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,"And the combat, it takes like an hour to finish a fight. I feel like I have to set aside an entire weekend to get anything done."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Especially how the chances are like... 60% hit, 3-30 dmg. Like it's designed to maximize the effects RNG."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,Quicksave quick load is your friend
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Don't try Fire Emblem then, especially the old school ones. That 97% hit missing answered by a 2% enemy crit that causes you to reset the whole map and lose 1 hour is peak gameplay 👌"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"It's also so frustrating since that's a change from DnD rules. Outside of combat, 1s and 20s don't automatically fail/succeed."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"That's the fun of dnd
It's not suceeding that feels good
It's seeing what silly thing the dm now has to come up with causes your character somehow failed at the one thing they are supposed to be good at"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"That 1/20 chance of a critical success/fail is a qualm I've had with D&D 5e for a while. Just seems too frequent. When I ran a game I would have a player reroll to see if it was a crit failure or if they just treated it like a normal die. Another 1 was a crit failure, with some consequence. 1/400 chance felt fair for ""major fuckup"". Would do the reverse for crit successes."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"It isn't really like that,  there are lots things that can influence your rolls."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Yup. Same reason I never got into Xcom. The outcome of my game play should depend on my skill, not RNG. Obviously, every game has some element of RNG built into enemy movements, gun accuracy, etc. But, my ability to maneuver and respond to events should determine whether I win. I finally rage quit Xcom when I had run a mission super cleanly, had the mission almost wrapped up, and then missed two point blank 95% shots in a row, and lost because of it. No thanks. "
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I like BG 3 but it really suffers from using the DnD 5 rules imho.

I play tabletop RPGs and while DnD is very popular I really don't think it's a very good system and it's a poor fit for a video game.

Larians home made system used in divinity original sin is so much better for a video game."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I got unlucky with that one. I did the trial, it was going fine, then I got one shotted in a combat encounter an hour in and then somehow surrounded by about 15 enemies so even though another character could res me, it was for someone reason at 1 health because that’s a non shitty design decision so they got killed before they got a turn and my resurrecting character got killed because they didn’t get a turn.

And then the trial ended.

I should love it but what appeared to be a mainline quest encounter simply shouldn’t do that an hour in and it’s not a skill issue because my character was dead before I even got a turn, I failed a speech check, I got attacked, I’m dead."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I just save scam the game for that reason. Bad luck isn't interesting. 
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,just save scum
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Wait, so you can go out there and score a 30 yard free-kick over a 5 man wall in front of 90 thousand fans?"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,Okay but how do you admit that it‘s still good…?
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Meanwhile most games with real time combat are just too zoomy and stressful for me.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Play the south park games, problem solved"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I really want to get into BG3, but the combat is ruining it for me. It completely breaks immersion to suddenly take turns and roll dice. It's simultaneously boring and complicated."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I loved final fantasy 7-10 as a kid/teen but now I can't stand anything with turn based combat.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Lol valorant is nowhere near a top esport, in terms of viewership it’s one of the lowest."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I tried to play it too long after release - the graphics aged so poorly I couldn’t get past them.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Basically,it was one of the first 3d rpgs on console so I won't ever experience the level of excitement the first time I played it"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"That's why I've held off on buying it - I just finished another run through Cyberpunk and everyone was telling me BG3 is the perfect next game. But I've never been a fan of turn-based combat. I may give it a shot, but only once I find a cheaper used copy"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,What exactly is it that you don‘t like about it? And why do you think it‘s still a good game?
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I'm surprised no one has developed a souls like game designed for a lower skill level. It really seems like there's a hole that could be filled in the market by someone.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,"As a souls fan, I appreciate this. So many people who “don’t get” souls games will do any amount of mental gymnastics to say the games are terrible because their design philosophy is incompatible with what they’re used to. I too struggled with them initially, but getting over that hurdle was one of the most rewarding gaming decisions I’ve ever made."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,The expansiveness is why it's so good imo. It's soo big and there's soo much. There's the main continent which is the size of most games. Then there's the underworld area which is the size of that. The. There's the place up the lift which is a pretty good size and then there's also the place below the loft it's insane.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,"Hmm interesting.  
I‘m not so familiar with the genre and only played the latest game for about 3 hours. Some friends of me played it a lot though.  
They seem to love the game but that doesn‘t have to mean anything.  
Thanks for your input."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-22,"I personally really loved the original tracks. Like Maple Raceway, Bernese Alps, Amalfi, and for some reason they took almost all of them out in FM8! Why would they do that"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,The game can be super punishing. Especially when you learn that some runs are doomed because there are stages/battles where the only way you can win is with 1 health setting you up for failure on the next battle.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,When I saw this comment it was downvoted and I’m realizing you have to put this thread in controversial since some people downvoting don’t understand the prompt.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Have you tried Tale of Two Wastelands? It takes FO3 and New Vegas, and merges them into a single game. You get New Vegas' QoL things like iron sights on 3, and you also get to keep the same character on both games."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Stardew is so fucking stressful. I'm on the clock all day, fuck off with that clock in my ""relaxing"" game!"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,That’s a lot of games with different genres. You sure you like games?
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,[deleted]
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"For me, it's the 2. Again for me, it was a snooze fest game mechanics wise, other than that it does still deserves the respect it has."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Same thing happened to me. When Skyrim came to Switch, I figured I’d finally give it a try, but I just couldn’t really get into it. I remember the main thing I didn’t like was the combat and I don’t think I got much further than getting to Whiterun."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Controls can be janky definitely but so can Mario 64 and that’s one of my favourites too. You don’t have to like Witcher 3 but you also have to be somewhat fair.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I can respect this because I love elder scrolls games but can’t get into fall out games. Gave it a good shot but something never drew me in to the setting properly idk.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-02-22,"""Objectively""

Lol, you are so porn brainrotted."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Man, I bought Doki Doki on Steam. Played it for a couple of hours and got put to sleep by it. Years later it came to Xbox and I bought it again to try. Got to the same point as last time, but this time I managed to push through the boredom and sleepiness. Then bam. The story takes off and goes crazy. Loved every second of Doki Doki.

It's funny to think I stopped playing the first time when I was maybe 10 minutes away from getting to the interesting twist."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Yeah, I definitely appreciate the medium and get the appeal, I just haven't enjoyed it."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"This is the bleakest possible outlook lol, it didn't break me, it made me realize every other game had already done that. It set me free."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I think far too much emphasis is placed on the difficulty of Fromsoft games (I blame DS2 for this), to the point where it ruins the experience for a lot of newcomers to the genre. Sure, they are punishing, and every death is a lesson, but they aren't *unfair* for the most part. The absolute best facet of Fromsoft games are their level designs. Intricate, hand crafted areas with lots of secrets to discover for those who are careful and curious. Finding secret areas, powerful weapons, bosses, upgrades, all kinds of stuff can be found. It means that the game not only rewards you for learning from your mistakes, but also for being curious and explorative. You can play each of them in innumerable ways with different builds, different routes, different self imposed rules. With enough world knowledge you can trivialize any of the games with proper planning and routing for the right items. 

This focus on difficulty of soulsborne games really does a huge disservice to the real selling points of these games, and shoves new players into rabbit holes of guides and walkthroughs that should really be avoided for at least a playthrough or two. More than black coffee, Dark souls is the gaming equivalent of sake. It's not for everyone, but there are definitely more traditional ways of serving it that make the experience much better."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Soon you wonder how you used to like those lattes and mochas.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,As a fan of both black coffee and dark souls I feel this
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Can confirm, finally bought elden ring and racked up 34 hours on my three days off, game is seriously good and the amount of content is insane. Yeah it’s hard at times but i feel like it’s more forgiving about letting you level up and become stronger to beat those difficulty spikes"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I have a buddy.

He hated it. He played Elden ring with an easier difficulty mod. He then played dark souls 1.

He is now a huge dark souls fan, played Elden ring though maybe 4 times. He now calls the game ‘leisurely’ and ‘fun’

He also says he had no idea that the game could be so fun that basically just death.

That’s the thing. The game IS just death….

And then all of a sudden you’re playing through them with using nothing but a broken sword and loving it.

The trick is with dark souls isn’t ‘getting good’ or anything like that. It’s accepting that you WILL die, learn a lesson or say ‘ah I have to approach this a different way’.

You just accept you die and that the souls you lose mean nothing anyways."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Idk man demons souls just instantly clicked with me and they've all been day one purchases ever since lol
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,The clunking sound your armor makes as you walk eventually becomes asmr 
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"When you roll you're invencible. It doesn't matter where you roll, just when.

If an attack is coming, roll. The attack will pass through you. Then attack but don't use all your stamina, leave a bit for dodging

With that info you know the trick. They used to be hard until I learned that"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Are you willing to dump 100 hours into an RPG? If you are, you have the time to learn a souls game and beat it."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,Honestly? Just give it a try and see for yourself
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Honestly I would love a dark souls game thats made to be easier.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I swear man souls games would be more popular if they added a difficulty slider. But then that would upset the elitist of the community. Its just so stupid that enemies can kill you with 2 3 hits.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Then parry
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,It‘s a great start to the genre.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Sekiro is one of my favourite games of all time, but dark souls felt too clunky for me to really get into. I started playing lies of P this weekend and it seems like a good middle ground between them. I booted up lies of P this morning and then suddenly it was 5pm"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-22,"Their games have a dark and gritty aesthetic, which is just not my thing. I prefer the aesthetic of Ghost of Tsushima or Kena Bridge of Spirits"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Biggest part for me is the atmosphere in those games. No other game even comes close to the feeling I get simply from just standing in the world. 

The enemies and essentially every boss encounter demand your respect and it keeps you engaged."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I just couldn’t get past the weapon breaking mechanic and constant pausing the action and changing equipment or eating food to heal
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I'd say this is spot on because for me Zelda is the game series everyone loves but I can't get into yet I loved botw and totk
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Summed up my opinion well. I enjoyed botw but it didn't feel like a Zelda game at all. I know a lot of people enjoy that style but I do hope they still make some Zelda games like those of the past.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"If I have to mod my game to fix your game, it’s not a good game and I’m not paying to promote the mechanics in it.

I just want Zelda games like Twilight Princess back, linear, but open."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"This is it for me.

The world felt empty. I never wanted to explore because I knew the reward would be: a Korok seed, a weapon, or another mini puzzle room. And to find that thing, I'd have to run/climb through an empty, boring world, with one or two enemies in the way.

It just felt like such a chore.

The weapon breaking sucked, the dungeons were hugely unsatisfying, I didn't enjoy the story, but it was exploration that was the nail."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"The most recurring complaint in this thread is weapon breaking, so in its defence: 

Weapon breaking is a fundamental mechanic, it reminds me of halo in a way. You run out of ammo constantly and you pick up new weapons constantly, it’s part of the combat loop and the game would be very different otherwise. Same thing with botw/totk. 

People’s issue is that they want to hoard every weapon instead of adopting a mindset that you’re suppose to use and break them, the game will literally always give you more. 

Also another intended purpose is more strategy, you can’t just spam your strongest weapon the entire fight (well you can) but it may break quicker then you want it to. And it makes you switch up to weapons you may not touch otherwise."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Same.  First few hours were like wtf am I doing in RDR 2? Should I have played the old ones first? And then the story gets going and once that happens it's unputdownable!

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"They really aren't tho. People seem to forget rdr2 is a simulator first and an action adventure game second. I have become so accustomed to the controls through practice over the years that I can control Arthur like he's a gears of war character. It requires practice. It is the way it is on purpose, and its not for everyone. But in no way shape it form are the controls bad once you understand the intention behind the design and work with it as opposed to against it."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Yep! And I hated managing the inventory. Never got the hang of it.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,This so much. The controls are super janky.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"i cited the same 2 games, honestly i'd rather watch a movie from these stories, i don't know what would be the best format to make someone play a story but that's not it"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"> The games are so easy and “competitive” is basically mathed out to the point they ban huge swaths of the Pokemon to the point you can’t use all your faves.


I'm sorry but that's just not true in the slightest. VGC is the official format and bans nothing except cover Legendaries and event exclusives. You can play anything you want, it's just that obviously the best Pokémon will be the most common picks, but that's how all competitive games are. Every few rules rotations even legendaries are allowed. 


Smogon rules instead divides all Pokémon into Tiers based on usage % with very few being manually moved one tier higher. But even in Smogon there is no such thing as a ""banned"" Pokémon, everything is legal in the right tier. This was made specifically so you **can** play with your favorites and not just have them die instantly.  
Your favorite is Great Tusk? Cool, go ahead and use it in OU. Your favorites is Rayquaza? That's way too strong for what's in OU, but go ahead in play it in Ubers. Your favorite is Kricketune? You could bring it in OU, but it would do better in a lower tier.  
Saying you can't play your favorites in Pokémon is like saying you can't bring your Ford Mustang to the bicycle race - yeah you can't, but there's a muscle car race you could use it in instead"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Lol what? If you wanna use your faves just go play in the tier they're in
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Awesome brooding ambiance, cool story and lore, great monsters and protagonist and everything is held back by janky, shitty combat.

I don’t like riding for 5 minutes to a location just to do something that takes 3 minutes and then ride back. Can’t deny though how absolutely stunning and full of life the world is.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,There's fast travel if you're not interested in riding your horse everywhere. It works just fine. Trains too.

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Yeah the point of the post is that i understand the game is good, i just don’t like it. I can’t RP as a character who’s good at something when i fail at the exact thing im good at. 

To me, it incentivizes just playing a chaotic bard that just improvises his way through the whole game, kinda like Chris pine in the DND movie. That’s just not how i prefer to play. I like to be in control of the situation, which dice based gaming goes directly against."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,"I think this is very dependent on your class and your familiarity with the rules/game.

But a fair statement if you've never seen somebody speeding through fights. 

I can do my own and my party's turns quicker in my solo playthrough faster than my friend can get through just his turn on our multiplayer playthrough."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,"Yeah, I really wish that the game was ""real-time with pause."""
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Tabletop DnD is like that, too. Not defending the fact that Larian didn't change it for ""rule of fun"" reasons, because I know they changed some other rules. But it's very much a problem with the way DnD itself is designed (and d20 systems in general) instead of a Baldur's Gate problem. 

The thing is, with tabletop DnD, the live dungeon master can adapt on the fly. I had a combat once where no one, friend or foe, hit anything for two rounds in a row. The players were visibly losing interest in the combat. I asked my players, ""Hey, are you cool if we don't roll to see if melee hits anymore? Still roll accuracy for ranged, but melee is a guaranteed hit for both you and the enemy?"" They all enthusiastically agreed, we finished the fight in three more rounds, and then we continued the adventure with normal rules back in play. As a living person, I was able to ask my players what they wanted to do to alleviate the frustration of constant bad rolls. The computer can't do that, so the player is stuck going through the rounds where everyone misses (especially at lower levels)."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,You do you but save scumming for re-rolls completely defeats the purpose of DnD
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,I don't know how that is playing a game. That's reading a novel.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Dude if you roll a 1 even with a plus 20 bonus you critically fail. You literally fail 5% of all checks and succeed 5% of all checks regardless of stats.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I feel the same way about xcom.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,">I like BG 3 but it really suffers from using the DnD 5 rules imho.


This is why it's not high on my priority list to play.  I got it on sale and with a steam gift card but I have no idea when I'll get around to playing it.  Not much interest in playing 5e or its derivatives."

Now I wish square would go back to making AAA quality turn based final fantasy games. XIII and its sequels have their story and pacing issues. But man are they actually fun and beautiful games to play. At least in my opinion."

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"The biggest obstacle to me is the time sink. There's so much that's appealing about the series, but the time it takes to learn each boss, and then the need to replay the buildup to each boss... man, I have five kids and a job, I don't have time for that!"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,How are they even that challenging? They just require more patience and awareness. They’re not that much different lol people are just used to their walk in the park games.

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Just to make it clear, emphasis on difficulty was due to the marketing of ds1 and it's ""Prepare to Die"" themes. It was marketed as a very tough game and for a while elitists also made it seem like it was all about how tough it was. That got perpetrated by everyone who heard it and people still believe the games are ridiculously tough."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Lmao ds2 is always getting the blame. Ds1 literally had the tagline ""prepare to die"" and you are still blaming ds2 for the perception of them being hard."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"On the contrary, there are lot of ways to make the game riddiculously easy, which can ruin the experience by making it unmemorable. Only sekiro doesn't suffer from this which is why it is regarded as the hardest. The difficulty and stranding makes any side aspect of it a lot worthier. The issue is when the difficulty is unfair, which is rare because the games are well designed.

It is a bit like books films and series, the story and accomplishments of the protagonists can be easily tarnished by incompetent or riddiculous antagonists."

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"This is the first time I’ve seen someone say “you just don’t understand it” to game controls. People have been complaining for over a decade about Rockstar’s clunky, sluggish, movement and controls. RDR2 was the worst of it.

I understand why the controls are the way they are, but that doesn’t mean the controls aren’t awful and makes Arthur act like a drunk toddler, who accidentally punches someone and shoots their horse in the face.

They purposely added a high input lag to the controls too, which doesn’t help. It’s like you’re never fully in control of Arthur — sometimes it’s like he’s doing his own thing, which is very frustrating. It’s a constant reminder that you are playing a game, meaning it ruins immersion — you have to constantly pay careful attention to the buttons you’re about to press.

Rockstar’s controls have felt clunky since LA Noire and GTA 4.

Then you play something like Last of Us 2 and the fluid gameplay overshadows RDR2. It’s slow, but it’s smooth, responsive and it’s rare you will accidentally do something you didn’t want to do.

Just goes to show that, “it’s for immersion” or “it’s for simulation” is not an excuse for bad and outdated controls."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I mean. You can make that argument about the awkward walking, sure. I think that's a bad decision, but whatever, that's okay.

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Unlike the vast majotity of modern coop games, where you'd send a party invite to a friend, and they'd just join you..

You first have to use one of a few methods to sync up first: 

1: head to a predefined area where people can place their sigils.  Have your friend use an item and you have to (hope it shows up), find their pile of pebbles, and accept them into the world. 

2: collect an in-game flower and craft a summoning tincture. As long as the two of you are in the same spot on the map, you can use it to see summon-able players around you.  If your friend is there, they have to use their finger to put their pebbles down, you have to select it, and summon them. 

3: at the start of the dungeon, there is always a statue to use #1. 



Then, you can play together for the dungeon, boss, or even roam around in the open world.   Until one of you dies.   Then repeat the above steps. Each time. Also, if the summoned friend dies, they get shunted back to their world without being able to watch and enjoy the fight with their friends. 

If you want to do certain activities (like special enemy spawns or cut scenes for bosses (lol) you need to first experience it first THEN follow the above steps to spawn a friend.   If you're in an over world area exploring together and come across one of these zones. You have to remove your friend, do the action, then resummon your friend. 


Of course, by opting into playing with a friend, you open yourself to PVP invasions by some of the sweatiest people I've ever met.  It may be controversial. But as a casual elden ring enjoyer, I don't appreciate ""professional"" PVP players just popping up all the time.   They kill one of you, then you have to go through the whole respawn and summon dance for you or your friend using the above options.  



So, how does the mod address this?  You activate a toggle with the mod on, and your friends with matching settings just join you. The world then works as a big dungeon.  If someone dies, you revive them at the bonfire."

In a lot of games I know exactly what clicking attack will do and can plan my risk reward around it, like getting an extra hit in.

If your character who has no chance in hell of succeeding can pull something off with luck then it makes perfect sense that your god of a character can get an eyelash in their eye or some shit and mess up.

19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"i get your point, but in what way is quicksaving like reading a book lol"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,The game is VERY liberal with inspiration though. Failures never really stopped me from achieving my goals.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Honestly. The solution to puzzle thing is overstated in my opinion. Usually it’s very vague statements about one object or tool being involved. Something like ‘see that pot’. Basically making sure you see the main relevant object and not just wandering around completely aimlessly. You still generally have to figure out how to use said object once you see it. 

I felt like the newer tomb raider titles and some other games were far more egregious about spelling out exactly what you needed to do. Saying stuff like ‘I need to use that pulley system to raise this box’. Much more direct and verbatim about directions."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I mean, depending on the consumer's tastes, that could be said about most mediums: movies, books, paintings, games as a whole. No need to shit on VNs specifically :/"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"The 1st entry is not a bad game, it bloody hard at times lol but not bad.  Nioh 2 is absolute garbage though and I'm so glad I got that one for free on ps plus."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"That wasn’t until the DLC released, which chose that name because so many people used to more casual games were claiming the base game was really hard. 

Then, from what I understand, they really leaned into the idea for DS2."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-24,the difficulty slider is called summoning
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-22,"idk about other souls games but elden ring has way points you can rest at and checkpoints when you reach certain mini bosses but thats about it. The game would have been miserable if it didnt let you fast travel too. I get wanting a hard game but that would have just been absurd. This is what I hated about the highest difficulty settings in bethesda games.

Skyrim and fallout 4 both disable fast travel and its just such an awful choice that most sensible gamers agree on being terrible aside from the ones that are pretty much yes men for bethesda."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,The fact there's no equipment or ability to mitigate the rain climbing penalty is actually brain dead. I loved BOTW but good god damn did the rain almost ruin the game for me. Like waiting for several days in a row and it was STILL RAINING was also a massive problem.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I didn't like it either, but it makes sense within the context of the game. They want to give you reasons to keep exploring, and weapons breaking gives you incentive to go find more of them."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Because you can't reward players linearly with upgrades in an open world game, which makes exploration inherently more difficult to incentivize, which means they needed *something* to have you look around for."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"What a Strange series of things to dislike a game over. 

Its a simulator. So Arthur moves in an extremely realistic manner. All of his actions have weight like a real person would. Every single action you make in the game is accompanied by a likewise slow and realistic animation. Everything. There is no bad decision being made, you just dont like games that try to simulate how a real person would move when said movements are mapped to a game controller. 

You can change the button config on Xbox and PlayStation. On PC you can just remap the controls. There is also no standard for what button should be reload. Play halo, gears of war, cod and then rdr 2 and notice how despite each of these franchises being goliaths of the industry they all have different mechanical executions of similar gameplay elements such as reloading. I dont know and dont want to know what its like to be so inflexible that I dislike a game because I press a different button to reload then usual. 

Anytime someone starts talking about why they hate rdr2 it always seems to boil down to them either not having the patience to enjoy the slower pace of the story, or them being upset the game doesn't control like other games that aren't rdr2. It is so incredibly odd."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"balthier is the leading man, after all."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"The mod, while perfect for a seamless co-op, basically defeats the purpose of what the devs intended. The whole thing around Elden Ring's (and other Soulsbornes') coop is that the coop is ""mission-based"", so to help you clear a cave, dungeon, catacomb with defeating the boss being the objective. It's supposed to be higher-stakes than typical co-op in that if your partner dies, you're stuck until they can somehow place another sigil for you around where they died. It's a bit janky but a seamless co-op experience isn't a thing because it's against the game's design philosophy. Honestly never found it an issue until you're trying to be summoned to Leyndell if your current playthrough is at the Ashen Capital point.

Also:


>1: head to a predefined area where people can place their sigils.  Have your friend use an item and you have to (hope it shows up), find their pile of pebbles, and accept them into the world. 

>2: collect an in-game flower and craft a summoning tincture. As long as the two of you are in the same spot on the map, you can use it to see summon-able players around you.  If your friend is there, they have to use their finger to put their pebbles down, you have to select it, and summon them. 

Literally easy to discern your friend's sign among the others, all you have to do is set your passwords the same as each others' in the multiplayer menu on the ""pause"" menu.

Honestly, the one big issue with the current coop is that you can't
backtrack with your friend in areas that are actually part of the area that the host had completed, but that specific part can't be accessed until you beat the area and you take a detour that loops back around, with hidden loot, to the previous area. Raya Lucaria comes to mind here, cos there is a rooftop-jumping sequence that takes you back to near the beginning area, from which you eventually pick up the second Academy Glintstone key for Thops. Problem is that the only way to get there is after beating the Red Wolf of Radagon, but then because the entire rooftop section is technically part of the area preceding that boss, it's totally walled off during coop.

I don't believe the current coop system is heavily flawed in particular, given the entire design philosophy behind the summoning system, but it is still rough around the edges and its shortcomings are even more apparent in a game of Elden Ring's scale."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"The game is 5 years old and still looks stunning. That's a great shelf life, I'd say."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Are you trying to convince someone to not like a game they enjoy? I don’t get it. Whats the point?
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Triss is goated anyway
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"You said it exactly. The best word for it to me is ""floaty."" There's no weight to Geralt, it feels like he's just whooshing around"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-22,"I agree. Geralt's movement is really odd. Worse yet, I played The Witcher 3 right after BoTW. It was a night and day difference, as Link's movements are silky smooth. 

I really wish I could take Link and warp him into The Witcher 3 world. That would make it probably the best game of all time."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-20,Exactly this is what I’m fuckin saying lol
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-27,"I agree, in a video game there is absolutely no reason to be using a d20 except for tabletop gaming nostalgia. It’s an outdated system."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-27,"My point is that it’s hard to role play as a calculating “lawful” character with these intense highs and lows. Planning things out feels pointless because eventually you will fail a critical check. 

The d20 system incentivizes chaotic neutral bards that just fuck around and find out and laugh at the result no matter what."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,I guess but Messi isn’t also forced to do charisma saves on the field. Everyone else on the field with him is good at strength and dex and he’s the best.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"And failure in the game is also fun if you play through it and the game has enough ways to approach the problem, which bg3 does. All it takes it not slamming the load button the second that something doesn’t go exactly to plan and thinking of a plan B. Shoot this can apply to any game, for example you would never experience an awesome high intensity escape in a game like metal gear if you just loaded a save whenever you were spotted. If you play through mistakes then it might not have been what you intended but it’s still fun"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"To each their own. The Tomb Raider hints may have been more on the nose, but the rest of the game was fun/engaging enough to forgive them for it. For GoW, it was one more annoyance piled on an already annoying game.      
        
And it's been a while since I played them,  but iirc the TR games at least waited until it seemed you *might* be stuck before giving hints, instead of barely giving you time to survey the puzzle"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"But the Ds1 dlc was released before ds2 so therefore ds1 emphasised the difficulty first (and more heavily). 

In terms of gameplay, ds2 was more forgiving than ds1, even with the adaptability stat."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Luckily they did add some in tears
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Except you keep finding the same things over and over.  My biggest gripe with those games outside of weapon breaks is that they have 0 replay value.  They’re too arduous.  Great first play through, never want to touch them again."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Plus, true to being a master warrior- it gives you the chance to become equally good with multiple forms of combat as Link is supposed to be. Regardless of whether the mechanic is appreciated by the player, it's a well-thought out concept *and intended mechanic* that maybe just wasn't executed as well as it could've been."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"But Elden Ring showed you can have both, though? Fun weapons to find while exploring and none of that stupid durability nonsense."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Is that something he says? it sounds like something he’d say.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"But that's the thing, many coop fighting games just prevent you from re spawning if you died. Similar games in the genre, like remnant just have your teammate permanently dead until you use a bonfire and reset the area. We've had basic party systems for over a decade. There's no reason why they cant be using it and augmenting it to be as ""hardcore"" as they want. As it is, there's way too many steps to reset after failure. And I see no reason for it other than artificial friction to punish coop.  


Elden ring lets you play 95% of the content with a coop partner, yet it has asinine restrictions on where and when those partners can exist. They could just lock the coop partner in the cutscenes. They could just bar them from areas with temporary fog walls until something was slain. 

There are much more creative ways to create risk and rather friction-less coop experiences, but they chose to do none of them.  I dont know if it was to just keep the meme going of making their games ""unforgiving"" or what, but god bless the coop mod. For some reason i've seen elden ring get the pass on the whole topic because they kinda blazed the genre into existence.  But just because it's the way it was done a decade ago doesnt mean it's the way it should be today."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"No, it looks great now and makes it a great experience. I actually like how it plays other than the controls & having to sit through looting/skinning animations. I'm saying long term a game can't rely on its graphics for it to age well if the gameplay isn't there. Games that have good art direction like Mario 64 & Windwaker can still look good long term."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-27,"How dose being calculated and lawful have anything to do with failing? You can be the most alert person and still slip up, or overestimate your ability. Lawful just means you have a code that you follow, it guides intent, not result. You can easily roleplay lawful and make decisions on said code, it’s just you have to accept that sometimes that code may not be the best choice and will fail. 

The whole point of rolling is to have not everything go exactly to plan, so saying “i don’t like how it messes with my plan” is silly because that’s the point. If you want a chose your own adventure style thing then you might as well disable ability check dice rolls entirely."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Haha i didnt mean to derail it like this but, are you sure? 

I can think of multiple situations where he could be making charisma saves, both outside and on the field

Like outside: asking for better wages or asking his wife if he can go out with the boys (lol)

And inside: giving order to his teammates as team captain or explaining to the referee why a fault made against him was clearly a penalty"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Been a few years since I played them personally. But I’m currently in the middle of ragnarok. So that’s why I was so surprised. I remember hearing those complaints all the time but I don’t think I have had a single puzzle just spelled out for me despite being at least 2/3rds of the way through all the content. 

Maybe Santa Monica patched that to be less obnoxious. But I also wouldn’t be surprised if it was just another aspect of a game that was overblown. Have seen it often enough throughout the years. Heck. Just this past year there were several examples I could pull from."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,That's good to know. Haven't gotten around to that one yet but I was hoping in the back of my head they would fix that stuff.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I finished only one temple in BotW, did three in TotK and just can't bring myself to keep going. You did better than me!"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Just take 5 years between replays like I did.  I played through BotW on Wii U and then felt like I'd never play it again.  I re-purchased it on Switch (I know big N loves me) to prime myself for TotK and had a lot more fun playing it a second time than I thought I would.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,If that’s the case then Skyrim would have 0 replay value and we all know that’s not true at all.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,yeah it was a running joke throughout the game :)

Except that in Elden Ring, the coop partner isn't permadead until revived, they're just banished to their original world. Exactly why the sort of mechanic present in other fighting coop games simply do not work. The partner isn't someone from the same world as the player, the partner is from their own world.


>Elden ring lets you play 95% of the content with a coop partner, yet it has asinine restrictions on where and when those partners can exist. They could just lock the coop partner in the cutscenes. They could just bar them from areas with temporary fog walls until something was slain. 

I don't understand the whole barring from cutscene issue, because I have no clue what you mean nor have I had any cutscene issues of any kind in coop."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Yeah and the game is beautiful. It won’t be less beautiful if other games have better graphics.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"I think you're talking about artstyle and graphics.

For me, RDR2 still have a great artstyle or great art direction even past decades, regardless of gameplay."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-27,"I just think how you build your character should impact the result of certain things more than random chance, that’s all. In my experience, the dice roll matters more than your stats.

I prefer games that lock checks behind a specific skill value because it rewards players for preparing for that check, vs randomly getting lucky or unlucky."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Lol i would really hope that the referees aren’t susceptible to charisma checks 

Diving is a charisma save for the ref"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"That could definitely be the case - I played Ragnarok when it was first released, and it was downright obnoxious. I looked online and there were reddit threads/other sites asking how to tune down/turn off the companion hints. SM may have patched it since then. If so, good on them."
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,"Weapons still break like dry spaghetti, sadly"
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Ah... the other thing I was hoping for. Either sturdier weapons or a way to spend resources to repair them. Its not so bad to be forced to hunt for new weapons and stuff but some of those swords broke too easy for how rare and thick they were. Guess you cant have everything lmao
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,You can repair them in totk. Instead of cleaning rusted swords koroks now repair weapons and change their stat bonus.
19bo32r,2024-01-20,2024-01-21,Not to mention the fuse ability extends longevity. Add a rock to a sword. Add it to a stick! Weapons lasted considerably longer in TOTK due to this mechanic.

here is the hack david cages words


“The story I’m telling is really about androids,” he told me in an interview after the demo. “They’re discovering emotions and wanting to be free. If people want to see parallels with this or that, that’s fine with me. But my story’s about androids who want to be free.”


Imagine saying something as fucking dumb as this in a game where the androids have to literally go to the back of the bus. 
Are you supposed to take a coward like this seriously? 
writing something so on the nose yet pretending it's just about the robots?


Respect yourself, dont engage with trash like this."
xz164u,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"It's not that deep. People look for anything these days to get offended by, you can look back at all films, games, music, or whatever and if you want to find something offensive you will. I played the game and not once did racism come to my head, did people say the same when iRobot came out? I don't think they did, but these days, Jesus, people just want to make everything about race. People need to stop being so damn offended by everything. It's boring now"
xz164u,2022-10-08,2022-10-08,"This has nothing to do with being offended. 

I'm just saying it's bad writing and David Cage is a well know awful person, and a coward for not acknowledging his own shallow tropes he put in his own story.


iRobot is much more clear about it being a story about A.I and what it means to be concious without using obvious slavery tropes."
w1nedv,2022-07-18,2022-07-18,He can say it because presumably he thinks it's good PR to insist that his games aren't political.

By lying"
w1nedv,2022-07-18,2022-07-18,"Because of ppl who place social politics over story telling.

Saying it's political would imply that the writers have an intention to push their ideals. It's just simply a game taking inspiration that ties into questioning/thought provoking/choices which is a goal in good writing, easily ties into the fact that you have gameplay choices in the game as well."
w1nedv,2022-07-18,2022-07-18,I think he couldn’t think of a good story so he just copied 1960s America. I still enjoyed the game tho.

w1nedv,2022-07-18,2022-07-18,"Does anyone really care for it being political even if it's the smallest bit, just enjoy the game."
w1nedv,2022-07-18,2022-07-18,"Definitely ironic, braindead is certainly a term I'd use to describe people like who who try to claim some deeper meaning in every game, song, etc, instead of letting them stand on their own merits."
w1nedv,2022-07-18,2022-07-18,"David cage can say that his game was a whatever he wants. We all know its political, doesn't matter."
w1nedv,2022-07-18,2022-07-18,"You can enjoy it and realize it’s political too, it helps me get into the story and world"
w1nedv,2022-07-18,2022-07-18,"Ah yes, people who analyze media are brain dead lmao sorry I like to think about things"
w1nedv,2022-07-18,2022-07-18,"He could say this game is about rats with 12 heads, it would be just as untrue as saying it isn’t political 

I just wanted to start a conversation about this, and DBH in general because I like the game"
w1nedv,2022-07-18,2022-07-18,"You aren't analyzing anything, you're just imagining shit."
w1nedv,2022-07-18,2022-07-18,"I’m also imagining the concentration camps?

That isn’t political?"
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,"Really enjoyed it. I'm sure it has a reasonable amount of replay ability but I felt like one playthrough was enough for me.
Storys were rather good and the graphics were quite pretty. Decent length too but nothing game changing with regards to story, ideas or visuals"
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,There is a demo aviable of the first level. So you can try it for free to see how the mechanics would feel to you.
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,"I had fun. It has its ups and downs. Connor and Kara's stories are the high points, but Kara's sort of loses its teeth at the end... I don't wanna spoil anything. But if you like the Telltale/Quantic Dream subgenre, and also robots, you'll have a good time."
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,"Great game. Lots of replay value too. You could spend months trying to experience every possible variation in the story.

Amazing characters and soundtrack."
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,I pulled the trigger a few nights ago and would say yes. If you like very engrossing story/choice games it is definitely that. Mixed with a little west world style future it’s that special combo that creates a time warp and teleports you to 4 in the morning
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,"I thoroughly enjoyed playing it. The gameplay is really simplistic though, it’s closer to a tell-tale game than an action RPG but the story was really cool."
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,"I love it, got all the achievements and multiple playthroughs. Some of the levels are pretty bad though."
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,"I have seen plenty game plays of it to say this:

The story line looks rather cool and the characters well made. The game play isn't bad. I would recommend it."
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-16,"that's a good game, but just notice that it's more of an interactive movie than a game so you might not gonna love it. but if you do love this type of things this game is just for you. also, you can play it a few times and just change your choices trughout the game wich can give you some extra time on the game."
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-16,Good game. Buy it.
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,I enjoyed it. I recommend having someone else play it concurrently to you to compare your experience to theirs.

xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,"Amazing game, played it a bunch of times there are so many endings"
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,It's probably one of the best games in the last 20 years in my opinion
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,OMG YES!!! You will wish to erase all memories After playing TO play it again
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,"It's fantastic, I played it on PC earlier this year. Just know that it's less action and more exploring the environment, finding clues, talking to everyone, with some quick-time events sprinkled throughout. You will absolutely agonize over some of the choices you have to make. It's worth it, especially on sale."
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,"Yes, it is very worth buying.  Try your best to play it without any help.  Make the choices you would make.  It has soo many different outcomes that you can replay it again if you maybe did not end up with the ending you wanted.  It will take you on a emotional roller coaster too lol."
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,I enjoyed my playthrough but I don't see myself going back to it. Worth buying at a discount.
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-16,Best game David Cage has made but I personally don't like the idea of giving him money
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-16,"It's a good interactive story game. I didn't finish it, but I think I just grew tired of those kind of games. Had recently played heavy rain and beyond two souls."
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,"Yeah, I want to get the Platinum trophy for the game, but one playthrough was definitely ok

I did do another playthrough where I intentionally got everyone killed and felt guilty about it"
xf34oh,2022-09-15,2022-09-15,"There is a way to get around that issue but you have to revert your card to a specific patch...but yes, its really a pain."
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-16,"Vastly different games. If you want dialog and role play experience go for D:BH, if you want combat and adventure go for LoU2"
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-16,last of us 2
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-16,Last of us 2
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-16,Two different games but one is the obvious choice by a mile. Last of Us 2.
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-16,"Both are good, but they’re vastly different 

I much prefer TLoU2"
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-17,Last of Us 2
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-16,Tlou2 by mile.
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-17,Detroit!
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-17,"Last of us 2 can give you an actual depression, if your into that kinda stuff 😂… Detroit does have a decent story and replay value, the endings depending on your choices can be vastly different"
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-17,Days gone is a nice blend of both just saying 👍🏻
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-17,"If you want repetitive sneaking segments and a good story, TLoU2, if you want a more unique experience, with repetitive choice making and QTE’s and a good story, Detroit. I found Detroit and a few other games like it (Supermassive’s games) to be a welcome break from games like TLoU."
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-16,does the last of us 2 have the same sort of combat as rdr2 or?
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-16,Similar but TLOU2 is miles better
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-16,I hope people don’t start comparing everything to RDR2 because what even was that question🤦🏽‍♂️
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-16,It has a lot more adaptability. RDR2 does gun slinging so well. Last of us 2 is more realistic combat overall. I use stealth and speed but theres so many ways to fight and so so many satisfying parts of combat.
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-16,"damn, i only asked it because i dont want to buy a game with the same sort of combat as rdr2 because ive played it"
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-17,"thank u, this is really helpful. im buying the last of us 2"
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-16,Valid question. Disregard haters.
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-16,"No you didn’t it, you asked it because you wanted to play a game with similar combat as RDR2. That’s the truth. And they’re nothing alike other than you can shoot or punch people that’s it. Stop using RDR2 as a measuring stick, that game is overrated anyway"
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-17,"whats up ur arse tonight? think what u want, im not abt to try and convince u that i meant otherwise. and im not using rdr2 as a measuring stick, u should check for one up ur arse though"
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-17,You must be obsessed with my ass if you keep asking about it. I guess people like you like lying online just so they won’t get proven wrong. It’s ok though we all know the truth.
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-17,are u this delusional in ur every day life? why would i lie when im literally asking abt the game i have an interest in buying
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-17,"It’s ok bro it’s over you lost it’s not the end of the world. You were comparing it to RDR2, which is a dumb question, got called out on it and now it’s over. It’s ok we all make dumb mistakes you’ll make it through this I promise."
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-17,what an absolute brick u are
wq5ug3,2022-08-16,2022-08-17,I’m sorry sir but I’m not an object that is used to build structure. But name calling is not going to change the fact that you’re still wrong.
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,Perhaps the mass effect trilogy.
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"You may not initially think of it as a fit - but then again neither did I, until I played it: Life is Strange. 

The game is well done, well acted and has some interesting mechanics. You have lots of choices you can make - and all of them affect your outcomes. The story is great as well. I honestly wasn’t expecting to like it as much as I did. The emotional impact of this game was stunning. I don’t think a game has hit me that hard before in that way. 

I went on to play Life Is Strange: Before the Storm which was also great (even got to play an in-game version of D&D and *those* choices even mattered). 

Working on Life is Strange 2 now. 

I love the way the stories reveal themselves and how much of the stories are not quite what they seem. 

Worth a shot - I think the first episodes of each are free to play and I knew before I finished the very first ‘freebee’ that I was going to get the full editions of each."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,Absolutely God of War 2018
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"I think it's a bit cartoonish, short and scripted for you but you might like Firewatch, I loved it, the interactions with the other character, the story and the ambiance were perfect for me."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,Undertale true pacifist playthrough.
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"If you like games in which your choices change the story’s outcome and / or change your relationships with characters, I would recommend Telltale’s The Walking Dead series. The Walking Dead is an episodic story-driven video game series with four seasons [Season 1, Season 2, A New Frontier and The Final Season], a special episode [The Walking Dead: 400 Days] and a mini series [The Walking Dead: Michonne]; all of which are based on the comic book series written by Robert Kirkman [It is also worth noting that The Walking Dead: 400 Days and The Walking Dead: Michonne both take place between certain issues of the comics, with 400 Days taking place between issues 66 and 67 of the series and Michonne taking place between issues 126 and 139].

There are a lot of intense moments throughout the series as well as some sad ones. There are also times where you can only choose one of two options at certain points in each season, such as revealing information to people in your group, trying to break up a fight between two people in your group [this impacts who you end up staying with or if you decide to leave and survive on your own], etc.

I won’t spoil anything that happens, but I will say that there are one or two scenes in a couple of the seasons that near enough mirror each other in terms of the situation [I won’t say which as this may spoil certain parts of the series].

If you decide to play The Walking Dead, I suggest buying the definitive edition as it contains all four seasons as well as 400 Days and Michonne."

hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"You might like Sleeping Dogs. It's an undercover cop story set in Hong Kong, with gameplay similar to GTA but with a focus on fistfighting instead of guns. The story is one of my favorites in gaming, it's got plenty of emotion and some great voice acting. It's also got some great DLCs, although they don't take themselves as seriously as the main game does."

hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,Hmm if you don’t mind games from Japan Yakuza 0 has a really emotional story and amazing voice acting the only thing being that they’re obviously speaking Japanese with English subtitles.
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"L.A. Noire is a solid pick for this type of game. The ending is a bit rushed but otherwise it's solid. I also would recommend Murder Soul Suspect. I think they're made by the same studio. They're not the best titles for having your choices effect the game greatly, but they look good and the writing pulled me in."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"As long as the story is emotional I might get the games.
Do you think it is?"
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"Thanks for the answer.

I played Life is Strange 1 episode 1 and I watched all the episodes of Life is Strange 2.

I might give all of the first game a try."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"Thanks, I played that one and I mostly liked it."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"Thanks, from what I saw of it I don't like it much but maybe this will eventually change."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"Thanks, Undertale doesn't really look like my kind of game."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-02,"Thanks, it seems like I might enjoy the story but past Telltale games I played seemed like Detroit Become Human.
I consider them interactive movies."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"I tried Death Stranding and I didn't enjoy the story because it confused me.
Do you think the same can happen to me with MGSV?

Judging from what I watched it doesn't seem like my kind of game."

hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"Thanks, I don't love how it looks so I don't think I will buy it."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,Thanks I might give it a try.
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"Thanks, I might get the game."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-20,"Thanks.
I don't like qtes much and I think that game has a lot of them."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"Thanks, I don't like reading subtitles much so I sadly will most probably not get the game."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"Thanks, I may look into these games."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"They certainly were to me. I felt like I had a big impact on the story, the characters were well written, and choices you make in 1 effect certain things in 2, same with 2 to 3. As long as you import your character which is really easy to do. Just a slight warning, 1 is a little dated as far as graphics and certain gameplay choices but I still enjoyed it."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"That is subjective. In my opinion, the mass effect games have writing that can evoke emotions. 

But also Death Stranding can evoke an emotional response from me too, mostly anger, cause I think it's a bad walking simulator. 

Just because the story is ""emotional"" doesn't mean it's always a positive."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"It rly rly depends the story is pretty forward for a metal gear but has some issues especially later on but this is part of the emotional part. 


U have two choices u either watch a recap of all games and decide if the vibe of the story is ur thing. This will be confusing and most fans haven’t understood every aspect of the story. 


Or u can just pick up metal Gesr solid v ground zeros the epilogue of v it is super short and gives u a guess on the gameplay and it introduces the characters a bit. 

The main story of v is pretty much a own story and needs not to much context if this worries u"
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,The whole series is great but Human Revolution and Mankind Divided are easy to get into and you don't need to play the previous titles.
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"Seconding Sleeping Dogs. Gameplay and controls are pretty intuitive and fast-paced. It feels like you're playing an action movie, instead of interacting with one. Story is great too! It's like $4.50 on PSN, it's worth much more than that."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-21,"Gotchya, well I'm interested to see if you are a fan of any of the suggestions. I need something new to try."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"Thanks, I might get these games."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"By emotional I mean a story that makes me feel happy about the ending

of the story but sad that the game is over.

Thanks for the answer."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"Thanks, I may look into MGSV."

hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-21,"I ended up getting Ghost of Tsushima.
Yes it is open world but the world isn't boring to me.
The story so far I find good."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"If you enjoy them, and want more bioware RPGs (these are less realistic and older and more dated) Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2, and Jade Empire are also quite enjoyable. Again quite a bit more dated however."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"You'll probably enjoy the first 2 games moreso than the 3rd. They had a controversial ending that is still talked about to this day (In terms of how poorly it was designed). The games story is great, even mass effect 3 untill the last 15 minutes."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-22,I'll have to give that one a go.
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"Thanks, I may get these games too."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"Ok thanks, if I remember correctly I heard they fixed that ending."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"""fixed"". It's still a far cry from what they had planned originally. Some of the concept works have since been released and their originally ending sounds way better IMO. The ending ""fix"" was a band aid over a serious wound. Still one of my favorite series in it's entirety."
hje7fj,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,"Oh ok.
The games still seem interesting to me."
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,"It's good. Definitely not ""best of all time"" material, but it's solid."
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,"As someone who actually liked and enjoyed DBH, the game is not that good.

Visually it's great, and the story*telling* is fantastic. The *writing*, however, is sub-par at best, especially with how much the game shits the bed when it comes to the majority of the endings.

I vastly prefer most games Telltale has put out comparatively. Maybe slightly more simple gameplay and your actions don't affect the story as much, but the writing is just *way* better, especially for The Wolf Among Us and their Walking Dead games."
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,"It’s a good game, but there’s plenty of games with better story and even more with better gameplay."
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,"It is a really good story. But imo to be in the running for a best story game, the gameplay needs to be used as a direct storytelling element. Sure, there's multiple choices but there's also choose your own adventure books that do the same thing. I'm thinking more along the lines of gameplay mechanics used as metaphor. 


Hellblade: Senua's sacrifice uses the gameplay to bring you into its protagonist's perspective in a way that only a videogame can."
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,"It was a good, not great game - that fell apart somewhat in the third act. Stunning visuals, a mostly engaging story, but a lot of repetition and QTE's"
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,Can you press x to Jason?
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,"I just played it recently, it's a really fun game with tons of choices and branching outcomes. The controls were a bit wonky and took some getting used to. The writing was a bit hit and miss with some of it being really corny. I definitely would not consider it as one of the best games of all time, but it's good. Connor's story was definitely the best of the 3 by a wide margin."
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,I enjoyed it until all three storylines ended in the protagonist dying. Left a bitter taste in my mouth and didn’t care to retry one bit
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,"This is just my opinion but Connor and hank were the only good part of the game. Without them this was easily one of the most mediocre games I've ever played. Which is disappointing cause the Kara demo in, I believe it was Beyond Two Souls, was one of the most memorable scenes I've ever witnessed."
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,You should check out the Girlfriend reviews (on YouTube) of this game. They break it down pretty well.
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,"It really depends on how many other games you’ve played.

I really loved Heavy Rain because I hadn’t played anything like it before. I still think it’s a better premise and execution than Detroit, but that doesn’t mean Detroit isn’t great. I just preferred Heavy Rain so Detroit wasn’t as memorable to me.

Also if you enjoyed Detroit you might enjoy Quantic Dream’s other titles, and some of Telltale games too (I loved The Wolf Among Us and The Walking Dead from Telltale)."
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,"A lot of people love that game. And that’s great! I’m glad you love it. But since you’re asking, David Cage games come across as very hamfisted to me. As far as story-focused games go, I got more out of Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice."
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,David Cage is the biggest hack of the industry and only making games that act like movies because he lacks the talent for making real movies.
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,I can agree with that Detroit become human is so good
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,It’s pretty fantastic
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,I would not say the best game but its a great game
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,It’s ok
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,I guess it’s a good game.

It's only decent for a bit of meme material."
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,Definitely not THE best but I personally thinks it’s one of. Mainly cuz of its storytelling
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,I feel it mainly depends on how you play it and the approach. I can understand some people not enjoying it for specific reasons
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,I mainly said that cuz of the story telling as a whole. Gameplay for most games isn’t really an issue for me as long as the overall story is intriguing. Kinda like Cyberpunk
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,You didn’t get an ending where the 3 of them lived?
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,"That's the best thing about games, they're subjective. I personally don't think it's even close to a mention when talking about the greatest of all time, but that's just me.

You clearly have a different opinion and that's fine."
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,"So for you, it's one of the greatest of all time - and that's ok!"
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,"Detroit Become Human has a pretty cliche and unoriginal story tbh, but I think what makes the game good is all the different choices and consequences there are and the branching paths you can go on"
v0npga,2022-05-30,2022-05-30,I meant all three protagonists died… it was depressing

cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,Memories of perfect dark suddenly came flooding back.
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,Glad I upgraded to a 1tb ssd a year ago... I have had none of the problems with texture loading that others have experienced with certain games.
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,It's one of the free games this month isn't it?
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,"My friend had the same thing happen on her play through, but with Alice at the very end after they cross the border. Made that scene 10,000x better seeing her turn to Alice and her square face go, ""We made it, Alice!"""
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,"is that game worth downloading? i remember having played the demo or something, but i dont remember if i liked it or not..."
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,I originally said PS1 but it doesn’t look pixelated enough for that. Definitely more N64.
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,"Haha! Same here. I was prepared to say ""Nah, that's just textures that haven't loaded fully yet,"" but, alas... :)

It almost went full Goldeneye."
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,"I upgraded to a 1tb HDD exactly one year after I got my PS4, which was about 3 months after I got tired of having to juggle installs because 500gb when games routinely top 40gb BEFORE PATCHES AND DLC is a fucking joke."
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,ssd for the ps4?
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,Yes. Totally worth it. You get the PS4 remaster of the awesome heavy rain with it!
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,"It's got an amazing story and probably one of the most emotionally involving games I've experienced, but it's not your typical game and it isn't for everyone. Personally though, I can't recommend it highly enough."
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,It’s definitely worth getting (especially since it’s included in your PS+ price). It may not be for you if you don’t like slow dialogue heavy games. But I loved Heavy Rain and this is even better IMO. I’m loving it.
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,"If you liked Heavy Rain or any of the Telltale games, you’ll like this one."
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,"It's called LOD, when models are distant the number of polygons are reduced to gain memory. Some kind of glitch triggered this behavior in your case.

cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,SSD or HDD?
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,Yes... I installed a 1TB ssd into my ps4 pro.
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,"For fucks sake, it's free this month? Why pay for games if I can wait a year and get em free"
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,"Shoot, you should try Telltale's The Walking Dead or Tales From The Borderlands if you're looking for more emotional storytelling.  Skybound's StillNotBitten Team (some of the developers from Telltale were hired on after Telltale Games shut down) is releasing a compilation of all four seasons on current gen consoles, and I'm sure 2k will have Tales back on storefronts soon."
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,I thought it was called ‘billboarding’. Making things further away less detailed to save memory.
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,HDD
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,"honestly can't tell if you you're sarcastic or not, but I'm guessing you are"
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-09,Cause they want everyone to see ps+ and xbox live as a games subscription service. Can even launch the ps ones unless you have +.
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,I've heard lots of good things about those games! Thanks for the suggestions!
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,"Billboarding is part of the LOD system, it turn models into 2D flat planes that always face the camera (thus the name ""billboard""), in most games it's usually only applied to vegetation (like trees/grass) because it is most efficient on repetitive models (avoid multiple instances).  
[https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/amplify-impostors-beta-119877](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/amplify-impostors-beta-119877)

Other models use multiple LOD detail meshes that blend as you get closer."
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,Now why in the hell would that be sarcasm? Installing an SSD into your ps4 or ps4 pro is nothing new.
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,"Taking a stab here, dude probably thinks you're yanking a chain or oblivious to the Sata II speed limit found on the PS4 that made installing an SSD no different than an HDD, while also being oblivious him/herself that the PS4 Pro doesn't have the same limitation and can utilize SSD speeds quite well with Sata III.  

Just a guess, and all that said I didn't see any hint of sarcasm in your posts so..."
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,Yeah that would be the only way I could see why he may be confused.
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,"i didn't realize it was a possibility to change into an ssd, unless you do like an ""unofficial"", diy thing? sorry for not knowing, no need to become fucking rude"
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,"Oh brother, man up and stop being a drama queen.. I wasn't being rude but now I will since you want be a little overly sensitive cupcake who wears his wittle feewings on his wittle shoulders."

cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-08,">if anything, you seem to be taking me calling you rude extremely hard lol

Project more cupcake.. that's another millennial overly played but easily predictable tactic.  The only thing Im doing is reminding you of how silly you look getting offended over a simple answer.

Younger than that but still old enough to be your daddy which in fact would be the best thing for ya seeing as the one you have now did a pretty shitty job unless he has mistaken you for a daughter. ;-)"
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-09,"Guys, guys, can we get back to the topic? That 1tb SSD though! How much of a performance boost are you getting after upgrading? I still have the 1tb hdd that came with my pro but I'm contemplating an upgrade and want to see if It's worth it."
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-09,Far better load times and no issues with texture pop ins or anything like that in certain games that are reported to have problems.. even Days Gone ran great for me day 1 before any patches.
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-09,Awesome. I'll go for it. Thanks.
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-09,"Dont think you'll be disappointed.. everything is snappier, especially the dashboard.. its way more responsive when you scroll around, sounds dumb but you'll see. The HDD in the ps4 is first rate trash.. 5400rpm with a horrible low cache of like 12mb.. lol."
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-09,Haha yeah. I have a 2TB SSHD just lying around. I'll pop that in for now and get an SSD next month. I was surprised to see how cheap SSDs have become. I was expecting it to be more expensive than the console itself.
cajxlm,2019-07-08,2019-07-09,Oh yeah.. 1TB SSDs fall below $100 now often.

xbblxn,2022-09-11,2022-09-11,"Honestly with the timing, Spider-Man would be your best choice. It's the most linear game out of the three story wise (without any alternative choices being available), and with the DLC it should be done within that time frame. Even with collecting all the collectables.

RDR2 is just alot of alot. 

And Detroit Become Human has alot of different avenues to replay. Branching storylines depending on what you did at point x affects point y and z and 1 2 and 3."

vmdxz5,2022-06-28,2022-06-28,Try an earlier game by the developer called Heavy Rain
vmdxz5,2022-06-28,2022-06-28,"well, there are a lot, just like people have mentioned previously;

More games from Quantic Dream: 

* Fahrenheit Indigo Prophecy
* Heavy Rain
* Beyond Two Souls

Games from Telltale games:

* The Walking Dead Season 1, 2, 3 and 4 (aka The Final season) *(and an unrelated Spin off called* **TWD Michonne***)*
* Batman The Telltale series season 1 & 2
* The Wolf Among Us, *(there's one season which was amazing, the second one will come up next year so.. think about it lmao)*

The people who made **Until Dawn** and **The Quarry** made something called **The Dark Pictures Anthology**, with 3 individual games with their own separate stories; ***Man of Medan***, ***Little Hope***, and ***House of Ashes***

and these are not super cinematic or impressive, but maybe give a go to those old and new Point and click games, like the **Monkey Island** series, **Full Throttle**, **Day of the Tentacle** *most of those got remastered for pc.* Maybe **Whispers of a Machine**, **Chinatown Detective Agency**, **Kathy Rain - Director's Cut,** and even **Paradigm**.. 

and finally, just because I find this one extremely cute and charming, check out **Later Alligator** 

who knows maybe one of those small point and click games might caught your attention"
vmdxz5,2022-06-28,2022-06-28,"All of the other David Cage games follow that formula - Indigo Prophecy, Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls

Telltale games also function the same way"

vmdxz5,2022-06-28,2022-06-28,"All of the Life is Strange games have a choice driven story. Although they don’t have the same gameplay style as Detroit.

Also, imo it’s better to play them in release order."

Now I've put way over 100 hours into Odyssey, the cinematics are way better, I loved the location more, and I actually liked the story more. Kassandra was a much better protagonist than Eivor. Ancient Greece was so cool and now I want to go there for real.  
  
Also didn't play Mass Effect trilogy until a year or so after the legendary edition came out, so relatively recently. I probably played through all 3 games like four times.  
  
Can't really think of any others. Those are the only games I've been playing all year basically.  
  
AC Odyssey, Mass Effect Trilogy. Awesome games"

wuy6r1,2022-08-22,2022-08-23,"Definitely check out Ghost of Tsushima, it’s one of my recent favorites"
wuy6r1,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,I just started smt 1 like last week.  It's a bit archaic but still a really fun nes game(im playing the snes remake).
wuy6r1,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,I doubt two souls is as good. I haven't played DBH yet. Heavy rain is better than beyond two souls. Also from the same company.
wuy6r1,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"I have never heard of those, I’ll check those out!"
wuy6r1,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,I didn’t even know there was a Sex with Hitler 1!

wuy6r1,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"I got the fan translation of SMT 1 for GBA.  It's not a real good game.

Maybe it just hasn't aged well.

I have SMT 3-5.  Those are a lot of fun.  Still looking for SMT 2.

That is awesome that you are playing on original (close enough) hardware."

vwa5ds,2022-07-11,2022-07-11,It's a masterpiece in my opinion. Check out Beyond Two Souls and Heavy Rain if you want a similar experience both are made by the same studio as Detroit Become Human.
vwa5ds,2022-07-11,2022-07-11,"I am with you! These kind of games are not for everyone, they get called walking simulators and/or boring, but I love this genre!

I really liked the story and enjoyed the story a ton! I am glad you're having so much fun! Where abouts are you in the game?"
vwa5ds,2022-07-11,2022-07-11,I like this genre. Chill and sit back. The Wolf among us by Telltale is one of this genre’s best.
vwa5ds,2022-07-11,2022-07-11,Heavy rain is their first hit. Beyond is kind of a flop. But I followed that developer for a while that game is good though.
vwa5ds,2022-07-11,2022-07-11,"It's definitely the greatest game I will never, ever play again. Too traumatic."

My enjoyment comes from the YouTubers I like who make fun of them and talk about their wonky stories, so to me everyone wins, those who like them and those who like making fun of them.

vwa5ds,2022-07-11,2022-07-11,Not to spoil but there really aren't spoilers.  The game has a stupid amount of different possible endings.  It is more about your experience than it is about an experience.
vwa5ds,2022-07-11,2022-07-11,"David Cage is the director of this game.

Alt stands for alternative.

He is implying (jokingly) you are a second account of the game's director trying to make us play the game.

This is because the way your post is written sounds a little like those fake reviews that companies put on their products."

rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-03,Great game.
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-03,I was so immersed in this game. It felt like someone made a game just for me. It was perfect.
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-03,"First few minutes were....wtf am I playing, person simulator? Rest of game.....omg....freaking awesome."
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-03,"This is one of the games I really regret being unable to play, but I have watched/listening to dozens of playthroughs on YouTube. The story, character development, music, direction, everything was stellar. I found myself so invested that I actually gasped when bad things happened to them."
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-03,"I played this ~a year ago and I absolutely loved it. It’s such a unique idea having a human (me, the player) control robots that become sentient.

I’ve actually just started playing it again and I’m having a completely different experience from the first time I played it. It’s been a year but I’m sure most of the storyline has completely changed in this play-through. I think maybe one of my main characters died half way through my first play through so I am seeing an extra 1/3 of the game for the first time. That, and I’ve taken some different choices this time around that I remember I took last time."
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-03,It reminded me of heavy rain and was refreshing from my usual line up of games.
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-04,"I got it as part of the PS+ collection and likely wouldn’t have played it otherwise.  I feel the same way you do, it was such a great story."
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-04,"Demo!?

*Begins Download*"
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-04,The branching of different outcomes and events is just ridiculous in this. But completed all of them back in the day anyway. That's just how good it was.
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-25,"I really enjoyed this game in the beginning, but as the story progressed, the racism symbology that I found so beautifully handled became so overt and gaudy that I felt like it was being shoved in my face and moments that were supposed to be moving fell flat. I found myself completely uninterested in Marcus’ story and really only cared about Connor’s relationship with Hank and Kara’s escape (although I absolutely despised the Alice “twist”)"

rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-03,I loved it bought a PS4 to play it
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-03,It's by the same developers
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-03,Exactly why I was avoiding it initially. Not the kind of game I usually play. But it got me invested from the get go!
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-04,"That's what was so compelling. There were real choices to make, with real consequences.

Although 'gameplay' was mostly quicktime events, it was a lot of fun to revisit certain choices and see how it changed things."
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-25,"Marcus' story was definitely the weakest. And I didn't care enough to get a good ending for him.

Cara's was the best and Connor's arc was interesting as well."
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-04,Why would you do that? It hurts as a fellow low profile GTX 1650 user :(
rv844z,2022-01-03,2022-01-04,And I mean. I'm a chart nerd as much as the next person. I just loved to whole graph showing all the outcomes and all that.
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,Androids! I love this game :) I got plat under 36hours. Didn’t sleep after I got the game when I pre-ordered it! No regrets
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,I was playing this on a 15 year old TV and when I bought my new oled it was the only game that actually blew me away with the difference in graphics. Its perfectly linear so that the mouth animations are so tight and actually believable. I think Quantic Dream is going to make some games for ps5 that will become as close to full simulation as we know it. Im hoping for their next game to be on psvr 2.
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,This is spot on.  Only one play through months ago and am kicking myself to start another.  Damn good game.
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,And you can play this over 5 times and still have different outcomes
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,Plus a homescreen android that will judge you on your choices and make you feel bad
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,This has been on my wish list for ages
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,Felt more like a choice-based movie than a game. Still solid tho.
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-14,It looks so fluid because they do full motion capture of everything with the actors
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,Its only been 2 years
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,28 STAB WOUNDS!!!!
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,I agree but theres one more game (that i can think of rn) where your choices matter. And that is METRO i prefer the last light. Bassically your every kill matters.
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,"Dear God, the graphics, texture-loading, story...all of it is miles better than CyberPunk. It's not even close. And it's 2 years older."
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,The story was kinda meh though.
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,"Quantic Dream really makes some great games, Beyond: Two Souls was also amazing to play through and the stories in all their games are just very moving and impactful. The style of gameplay may not interest everybody, but I was definitely engrossed by the stories in them from the get go."
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,To this day as if it's some 25+ yrs game.
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,That game was nothing but a rendition of the civil rights movement.
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,Link?
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,"*Androids

You're right, my head isn't as clear currently lol
I remember playing it for hours at a time into the night, it's that good. It has been a long while for me so I'll probably play it again soon."
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,I wish they continued with Beyond Two Souls. Ellen Paige + Willem Defoe were absolutely fantastic the entire game
kc6194,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,Yeah it explores nothing. The director feels like a person who sniffs his own fart and enjoys it.
zq3i0b,2022-12-19,2022-12-19,If you like decision-based games then Detroit is one of the best in the genre. The gameplay is QTE-heavy with lots of cutscenes.
zq3i0b,2022-12-19,2022-12-19,"I was surprised. Those types of games aren't usually my cup of tea, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is most definitely not for everyone though."
zq3i0b,2022-12-19,2022-12-19,Good game
zq3i0b,2022-12-19,2022-12-19,"
Really damn good graphics and some excellent stuff in there but for the most part the game is not the best. I have the platinum for it and I overall liked it enough but there are major issues. It’s the furthest thing from perfect, but it deserves a try despite that. Be warned that if you mess up, you MESS UP. If Kara gets into a boo-boo and gets rammed by a car or Markus gets shot a few times in the chest, say bye to that character for the rest of the playthrough. There is no menu that shows up saying “return to checkpoint” or whatever when someone dies, all of their missions just don’t appear in that playthrough and they’re *dead*. In this regard, Connor could be viewed as a main character, as he will get replaced if he dies so long as he’s at a point in the story where he is viewed as useful by his higher-ups.

There are 3 main androids you control; Markus is the guy with the buzzcut and heterochromia, and his story involves him becoming the leader of an android revolution which can be either violent or peaceful - his is by far the worst story and the ham-fisted allegories to slavery in the game are prevalent throughout the stories but Markus pretty much being a metaphor for MLK/Malcolm X makes his story way worse. His missions are occasionally a little over the top and take themselves just a little too seriously. He has a pretty bland, boring and unenjoyable tale. 

Kara is the woman with short hair, her story involves her and a little human girl escaping from the girl’s abusive father - be warned that there are some pretty graphic and potentially shocking scenes of domestic violence near the start of her story so keep that in mind - as they traverse Detroit attempting to cross the border into android-friendly Canada. Kara’s story is 10x better and more enjoyable than Markus’, however it’s still not infallible; for example, a really bad (minor semi-spoilers ahead) >!plot twist that pretty much detracts from all the overarching themes and message of Kara’s story.!< But still, Kara’s story isn’t necessarily awful, just not the best.

Finally, Connor is the guy with the brown eyes and generic brown hair. Connor stands head and shoulders above the rest of the stories, and his is far and away the most compelling and enjoyable. Connor has an enjoyable, albeit slightly generic buddy-cop dynamic with Hank (played by the legendary Clancy Brown) and both him and Connor’s actor, Bryan Dechart, knock their roles out of the park. The others have good acting, yeah, but here it’s outstanding. Connor gives you the most player agency; he begins as a blank slate and you get to choose if you want him to ‘become human’ or stay a machine, unlike the others which force you into being a human. He convincingly portrays Connor as an unfeeling machine, a proper human, as well as something in the middle, unsure about its standing in the world. Connor and Hank’s relationship ranges from hilarious to heart-wrenching, and Hank will either learn how to move on from his grief or sink lower than ever depending on what Connor does.

In conclusion, Detroit is an okay game; it has really great stuff in it but other stuff kind of just falls flat on its face. It’s basically The Last Jedi of gaming in this regard. It tries to incorporate a lot of high-minded and complex concepts into its story but whether all of these go in well is a matter of debate."
zq3i0b,2022-12-19,2022-12-19,Best one of those that Quantic Dream has done to date
zq3i0b,2022-12-19,2022-12-19,"It's basically a Telltale-like game where your choices matter, but don't.

In my opinion, the story falls incredibly flat due to a few different factors, but the main one is that one of the key plotlines involves the question of ""Can a robot love a human"", and rather than address the question or use it as the basis to discuss some transhumanist themes which are pretty fucking basic to any dramatic sci-fi genre stories which involve human-like AI in human-like bodies, it sidesteps the question in the most David Cage-esque ""twist"" ever.

It's very pretty and dramatic in the moment, but dumb as a box of hammers if you take more than a few seconds to think about the plot and the themes going on with it."
zq3i0b,2022-12-19,2022-12-19,There is an absurd twist about one character that made me lose all the interest in the story and keeping them alive.
zq3i0b,2022-12-19,2022-12-20,"It uh....doesn't really have gameplay. David Cage doesn't really do ""gameplay"". Its ""cinematic"" and ""artsy"". I enjoyed Indigo Prophecy though. I actually rented the game from Blockbuster lmao. I still have the copy in a storage unit because my Blockbuster closed down like a month later"
zq3i0b,2022-12-19,2022-12-20,"It's a good game, long .... But good, I have to actually replay it, I've only beat it once. I want to change a lot of my decisions to get a different ending.  I think it's worth buying"
zq3i0b,2022-12-19,2022-12-20,"I mean it's pretty enjoyable, it's like a Choose Your Own Adventure book but it's a game. And I enjoyed walking around the environments looking at every little thing to try to find something that maybe might be important later on it reminds me of those old adventure games"
zq3i0b,2022-12-19,2022-12-21,Imagine blade runner but it sucks and you don't even get to play a game.
zq3i0b,2022-12-19,2022-12-20,Nice review
zq3i0b,2022-12-19,2022-12-20,In terms of your choices mattering it is by far the best David Cage game to date. But the writing quality and story is bad just as his games usually are.
