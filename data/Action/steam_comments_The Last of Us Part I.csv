Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,"this is the best way to experience one of the best games of all time! the last of us will always be one of my favourite video games of all time, ive lost track of how many full playthroughs ive done of the originalremastered versions of the game, but ive probably beat the game around 30 times and ive put over 400 hours into the remastered, and i think the game was very close to perfect, and this remake allows the game to become even closer to being perfect. in 2013 naughty dog was limited by the technology of the time on ps3, but now with this ps5 remake they were able to fully reach their original vision for tlou. i completed the main story for the remake already, and i loved every second of it. the last of us part i shows what the last of us wouldve been like if it released in 2022 instead of 2013, and its beautiful. the added accessibility options are incredible as they allow more players the ability to play this game, because some people might not have been able to play the original game due to the lack of accessibility options at the time, so this remake definitely justifies its existence for many reasons. this remake keeps the same amazing story, performances, and soundtrack as the original, while improving every other aspect of the game. the last of us part i is the definitive way to experience the last of us, the graphics, attention to detail, sound design, gameplay, ai, ui, character models, accessibility options, and more are all way better than in the original and remastered versions of the game. also the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are awesome, they definitely add more immersion to the game, same with the 3d audio. people shouldnt be leaving reviews of the game without playing it, even if youve played the originalremaster if you havent played the remake you shouldnt review it because the remake technically counts as a new game, so if youre someone whos thinking about getting this game please only listen to the reviews from people who have actually played and completed the last of us part i remake, as someone who completed it i think its amazing and worth it. 1010"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-16,"the last of us has been one of the game that i'm really eager to try. finally got to try it after a year and multiple patches. safe to say, the game runs great now and it has one of the most stunning graphics to this date. it has great character details, environmental details and even the lighting and reflection. the story is one of the most highly praise singleplayer game out there and let me tell you it's really justified. the story is really well written, it's slow buildup all the way to it's ambiguous ending is really interesting. the additional dlc also does contributes more to ellie's background as a whole. the soundtrack also compliments well with the overall game and in terms of the gameplay, it's really impressive. everything from the body movement to the gunfight. it's just so satisfying. there's actually bodyweight on your character and the resources are limited making you think before using them. the body explosion and even ragdoll animation is fantastic. also, here's something ubisoft should take note regarding their infamous collectibles. make them related to the characters so there's a reason we would want to collect them. i would actually go out of my way to explore and look for collectibles and sometimes, the collectibles can even form a storyline itself. that's what i call great storytelling. for me, the last of us is definitely one of the most immersive game that i have ever played. the whole game just felt like watching a long movie and it's really heartwarming watching joel  ellie grew closer and closer as the story progressed. the game has everything right, great characters, great story, great soundtrack and even in terms of gameplay it's definitely one of the best out there. it's a solid b1010b. it has some minor bugs but it's definitely worth the money and you should definitely try it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-13,very good game with rich story. sometimes too sad honestly. but real. excellent balance between action and exploring. very good graphics and animations. with my super notuptodate 531.79 nvidia driver for gtx 1660 ti i had stable 60 fps in fullhd for majority of time and majority of setting set automatically to moderate. game lead you through difficult situation giving you suggestions. its up to u will u use them. one thing hurt me  the price even though it is worth it. i bought it for 30 euros.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-06,"this is a breathtaking game full of heart, action, and drama. the solid storyline and spirited characters raise it to the next level and make it a game that i won't soon forget."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,"the last of us part 1 is an experience i will cherish for many, many years to come. this game will change you. although its concept is simple and has been done a million times, it still feels vastly unique. the story is breathtaking, and the visuals match it perfectly. however, when loading in for the first time, the time it takes for the shaders to load is far too long, and it definitely puts a strain on your cpubut its most certainly worth it. the voice acting, gameplay, zombies, and even something as simple as the title screen are all exceptionally well done. im aware of the issues the pc port faced when it was first released, but most of them have been patched since then. throughout my 100 completion, i experienced no issues, no crashing, and no glitches. now is the perfect time to experience this masterpiece, especially with the upcoming series and the pc port of the last of us part 2 coming next month. with the steam sale on march 13th, i hope this game is includedwhat better time to try it? i highly recommend it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-28,"one of my favorite games ever. i've loved this game for so, so long and only just got around to playing it mostly cause the only platform i play on is pc. the story is amazing, the characters are so well written and complex, the scenery and visuals are breathtaking, and the music is just so emotionally packed throughout the entire game. the actual gameplay itself is super fun and satisfying. wonderful, deeply nostalgic and deeply loved game. highly recommend."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,"the last of us is not just another zombie game. its a beautiful story about loss and what it takes to survive and to protect the ones you love. the beautiful world shows how nature takes over during an apocalypse. everything looks so realistic, the face expressions, you can clearly see the emotions in the characters faces, the voice acting, the nature and buildings but also the combat. there are limited resources you find during the game, like ammo and health, which makes you think before acting. you can choose to play the game aggressively with guns and melee combat or choose for stealth. the game has a lot of collectible you can collect. each collectible tells you a story which adds more realism in the world of the game. the left behind dlc is also included which i think was a beautiful add on to ellies story before the events of the main game. also the music alone is just so beautiful. i listen to the music regularly and i think i can say its the best soundtrack i have ever heard. i played the game on my steam deck and it played pretty good. nothing really to complain. i do have to say that it looks better on ps5 and the haptic feedback plus adaptive triggers was something i missed during my play through on the steam deck the last of us is definitely the best game i have ever played and i think its a must play for every gamer."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,great thirdperson cinematic action story game from the creators of the uncharted series. i finished it entirely on a steam deck lcd with the frame rate locked to 30fps and otherwise default graphics settings.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-04,"i don't know whether if the developers optimized this game or if nvidia's new dlss technology is simply magical, but the game runs smooth like butter now years after i purchased it when it was a graphical stutter fest that made me question my purchase. all that is in the past now. the game runs on max settings at 3200x1600 after toggling dlss super resolution not dlaa and turning vsync off in game but on in the nvidia panel. this is the best game for grown ups out there where a grounded story, beautiful looking graphics, character design and superb motion capturelike animation merge together except maybe for the banshee or screamer, not sure what's its name which kinda breaks up the immersion, giving the gamer an unforgettable gaming experience that will be tough to emulate, especially now that developers appear to be so unskillful in creating an experience like this one. please buy this game and another in physical form so you can put it under your pillow and sleep well. i hope more games"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-15,after three playthroughs i can confidently say that this is one of the greatest stories ever told in a video game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,story 810. the gameplay is boring u are waddling around in a crouch like a goose or spend plenty of time for searching ammo.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-11,"wrote a review a while ago when this game was still unplayable. it used to have horrible problems with loading shaders, and would run at 12 fps on a moderately powerful laptop. devs put their nose to the grindstone though and fixed the issues. the quality of the story in this game has never been questioned, and still remains one of the best games of all time, and i'm glad it got ported over to pc. still worth it's weight in gold all these years later. buy it, you wont regret it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-12,"damn, sony's exclusives are good. can't wait for the second part."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-27,performance isnt too great but this game is an epic journey and my favorite story game ever
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-16,"my score 9.510 without a doubt, this game has successfully revisited the horror survival genre. a different resident evil if you will. one with great depth, story telling and atmosphere. it has established itself to be one of the best games in that field, if not one of the best modern games that combines a great gaming experience with solid well written story telling. i do like the game, at least part 1 a lot better than the tv series. positives  incredible atmosphere  amazing up to date graphics  amazing novel like quality writing  you get to kill other bad humans which adds a whole new factor and experience into the horror zombies genre  the game allows superb tactical depth you may go stealth and attack from behind. you can also knife zombies from behind  shooting has a more realistic touch  great finale  negatives  insufficient footsteps, or it might be my ears. especially human enemies feel like they are wearing rubber shoes  it packs a lot of content and world environment, however, it did feel a bit short   the finale was pretty solid. some parts felt rushed and unanswered. although the ending was generally good, like a movie ending, i felt a bit unsatisfied. maybe in my subconscious i expected a giant final boss or something i highly recommend this game, even if you are not familiar with survival horror or anything. it is like a great book or movie that you should not miss. i'm thankful for the game and i would have loved the pc port to come out sooner. happy to pay full price for high quality games, period."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,"to answer the question of recommending this game. maybe, leaning more to no unless you are patient. i want to emphasize by saying i only have one system that has a 13700f cpu and a 7900xt gpu and 1440p120fps monitor. the biggest reason i did not return this game after a short play session is because of the story, the world, and the beautiful environments you explore, solid game just for that. the issues. one thing i hate in games is when you are completely engaged with the story and the world then suddenly yanked away because of having to fight the game engine or the controls instead of focusing on shooting the clicker charging at you like a linebacker in the super bowl. the list of issues i had during the combat sections of my play through made the game very frustrating. sloppy controls i am not sure if this is the norm but i never had a game that had overly sensitive yet mushy controls. i understand that joelellie are not soldiers but this was bad. in third person shooters i have played i never had the aim down sights get more sensitive than when you have your gun down and are exploring. i had to use the precision button that reduces sensitivity on my mouse to actually aim at anything. i did not look at the settings to see if there is something to change but out of the box i don't see how this is right. wonky bullet magnatizm i am not sure how this is a thing in a game that was released in 2023 or even 2014 for that matter. there were multiple instances where i would be aimed fully at a target and fire only to see another enemy say 5 feet away take damage. in a game like the last of us missing your target can be the difference between living and dying. being punished because the game decided to send your bullet somewhere else is not a test of a players skill but more of what feels like rng. the game decided you needed to die so you die. canceling animations multiple times when i was attempting to melee an enemy have it be with a wood board or a pipe i would see the animation cancel leading to a death reload checkpoint or taking damage because the game decided to end joel's animation before dealing damage. this isnt the end of the world when fighting the enemy factions but the infected you miss you pretty much can expect to be reloading a checkpoint because you died. game engine stabilization i saw on multiple occasions where the textures were not loading correctly as well as crazy frame dips. i am not looking for performance to be in the 100s of fps but the frame dips would go as low as 70fps or worse at times. at the best time i would get a 120fps where i lock my frame rate. this is coming from having played indiana jones and the great circle that held a solid frame rate of 93ish fps through the whole game. this is with having ray tracing forced on, which the amd gpus do not excel at. i fail to understand how this game which is a remaster of a game made in 2014 has such bad gpu performance. i do understand this could be a mix of the hardware i have. i do not have an nvidia gpu to see if the performance changes but at the same time why should i be punished for buying a 7900xt? a lot of this reminds me of an overloaded game engine. i am not a game developer so i obviously do not know what was changed with the engine to support the new textures and resolutions but it just feels the engine cannot handle the higher resolutions and or textures. i will play around with settings to see if this is the issue. glitches and crashes thankfully i never had a game crash and the small amount of glitches were at times humorous. one instance joel was rushing through a door at the same time ellie was. ellie stopped moving but phased through the door and started floating up the door just to reset back on the ground where she was suppose to be. glitches like this are humorous to me. on the other hand though there were a few instances where i was fighting and got killed because an enemy shot me through a wall or a piece of geometry. conclusion i understand it is way too high of an expectation for any game to be perfect. at 60 dollars at the time that i purchased this i would have expected the combat to be a lot more polished than it is. i did try to keep in my mind that maybe naughty dog were trying to make the combat the way it was to show that joel is an older guy and not a hardened soldier but to have bullets not land in the target redicule and melee animations cancel makes combat frustrating. i do get that this is more of a stealth game first and combat second. there are times that the game makes you have to go out of stealth and that is where the game play would fall apart for me."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,amazing story is good and animations are smooth killing feels great and looting is fun
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,"damn, this was my second time playing since 2013, still got me fucked up. please don't rely on the show to experience this story. it's one of the better stories out there with zombies and you get to experience it firsthand which is admittedly pretty damn terrifying at parts. its a little samey same throughout, but its worth getting through just to experience part 2 which refines the best aspects of this game and is coming at the end of the month. sad to see there was no multiplayer in this version because the crafting element carried over into a pvp deathmatch worked on so many levels, and probably had my most fun moments in multiplayer gaming ngl. naughty dog, it's not too touchy a topic anymore you can bring it back, i swear."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,"after watching the playthrough of this game many years ago on youtube when it first released on ps3, i have been a fan of this story and franchise. this was a great experience overall on my rx 6800 and i711700k at 1440p, they really did a lot to improve the textures and graphics of the game vs the original and remastered versions while still staying true to the original game basically the gameplay mechanics and levels are identical, they just look much better now. there are occasional crashes, but you can normally pick up right where you left off as the game has very frequent autosavescheckpoints. it requires a lot of vram at higher settings 1012gb or more, so keep that in mind. i also run into cpu bottlenecks and frame rates dips at times, but optimizing the settings can help a lot with this. speaking of which, the settings menu is one of the best i've seen, you can really dial in graphics settings and hud elements, etc. id recommend turning off effects like film grain and chromatic aberration, but this is just personal preference. the photo mode is also really nice, and you can change the directory it saves the screenshots to. as for the gameplay experience and story itself, its amazing 1010. one of the best gaming experiences ive had, the story and character development is just so beautiful. even after watching the ps3 playthrough and season 1 of the tv show, nothing really replaces experiencing this for yourself. it can be pretty intensescary at times but once you get the hang of the controls it's much easier. i played using an xbox controller and that worked well. now i find myself going through again for achievements and challenging myself with higher difficulties. you can do a new game which allows you to keep your weapons upgrades and such from previous playthroughs. there are even some really cool extras like concept art and behind the scenes stuff, and gameplay modifiers you can enable after your first playthrough like infinite ammo, slow motion, etc. 60 is pretty steep even though they seem to have put a lot of work into this, i picked it up for less than 40 on a steam sale and i'd say it will go for cheaper than that over time."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,"amazing story and atmosphere. great and believable zombie design. 18 no disney bullshit does not feel linear even though it is a linear game. shooting and inventory is a bit clunky, but it fits the game. gives a challenging feeling in a positive way. played on sofa in front of big tv with keyboard and mouse."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-06,"one of the best games of all time. naughty dog truly made a masterpiece with this one. if you know nothing about the story, keep it that way until you play the game. trust me, this game is worth it. you'll have fun in the game's immersive combat while getting to experience a story worthy of standing next to greek epics. if you're sitting on the fence on this game stop. just get it. you deserve it. everyone should experience this masterpiece."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,"love this game. worth the money if you like good story telling, and tense gameplay."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,"this game hits different. i doubt anything, even from the team that made it will ever quite cut so deep. not a masterpiece in any way, but if you truly cannot give these characters, their struggles, and their stories a chance, you are really missing out. it is however, a massive shame the overlords holding the writing are greedy bastards to put it lightly, meaning this story is really the third console seller for an honest to god flock of sheep. i love you gamers, but days gone remastered who the fvck asked blooooooodborne now"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,"after finishing this game i fell this weird emptiness in me and i don't know what to do next. amazing game, easy achievement, great gameplay, lovable character, excited to see joel again in part 2. fighting human  fighting infected"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,"the last of us has been with me since its first release on ps3. then i played the remastered version on ps4, and when i found out there would be a remake, i didnt hesitate for a secondi had to get it on pc to enjoy it in the highest possible quality. in 4k on ultra settings, it looks fantastic. but the graphics arent the only thing that blows you awaythe incredible story and great gameplay make this one of the best ever. 1010."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,game ran good for me on my recent playthrough. it's stupid how pretty this game is. i played apocalypse rising on roblox as a kid and this game is like that but on crack. very fun
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-04,the ammo is very scarce. there is a lot of hiding and going around enemies rather than fighting head on. for me it feels like the combinations to perform certain actions feel kinda awkward. other than the the story line is greatly entertaining.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-04,best game ive ever played better than any fps or rpg out there. it has the most in deapth story line and it is truly the best game out there
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-04,one of the greatest games i have ever played. few bugs but nothing which would affect enjoyment of the game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-03,"my favourite story game ever. plays great on mk, the game will tell you to use a controller before you play but it feels good on mk."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-03,"finally grabbed this on pc and it was totally worth it. i have had a blast and am on ng plus mode now. incredible graphics, story and gameplay. 1010."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-03,"first of all i was skeptical because of the performance problem it presented at launch and i have to say that although the port is not perfect and hyperoptimized and still needs improvements, the game is a work of art, on a visual and narrative level, let's go with the problem i had with the graphic settings this game is necessary or mandatory to run in 2k or at least upscaled from 2k the reason is that it needs dlss technology to have the necessary fps boost if you have a midhigh range computer by configuring the dlss well and with the game all in ultra and high i have been able to have very good stability and it has been a delight to play it in this resolution and with this quality. about the story, there's not much more to say, narratively it's beautiful, every environment, every place, every situation will stay in your mind, the game has one of the best environments i've seen in a video game, it's not just good graphics it has an art design that no matter how many times you go through an area you'll want to go through it again and imagine what would have happened in the area before the apocalypse had happened. the soundtrack, although it's really short puts the right sounds and sound style in certain situations and makes you remember those short melodies or instruments because it puts them in memorable moments. anyway, it's a work of art and it's really worth every penny for it, they fixed the game and now it's just perfect, waiting for part 2 on pc with great excitement 3"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,its good i like the story and game play it reminds me of a less like creepy resident evil
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,great game lots of acton and a good story line
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,"very fun game, havent finished it yet but very fun and cant wait to finish!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-28,"beautiful, emotional story game. i love the gameplay. the mix between combat, stealth, agility, puzzles, and horror is great. the graphics are stunning. ive played tlou1 3 times.i love all the gamemodes and customizations too."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-27,"great game, playing in 2025 and it is a very fun and captivating game! worth the hype!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-26,the game is so much better then the show. if you think the show is better. then you are the kind of idiot it was made for.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,"best story based video game i've ever played and i've been gaming for 40 years! bravo to the team, keep single player games alive."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,"as a game, this game is like cinema compared to the other games out there.. this is my first time playing the remaster, but not my first time playing this amazing game. this game is so good it makes me shed tears at its marvelous story, and i'm excited to play the upcoming last of us part 2 port coming to steam soon. my final verdict from a fan of the original game, this is like eye candy and i love playing it and can't wait to continue doing so.. so i rate this game a decent 9.5  10."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-24,a gripping story and gameplay settings that can fit your desired playstyle
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-24,"very immersive, graphics, dailouge, and audio are great"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-24,"truly an incredible game. the art, story, acting... all beautiful. gameplay is engaging if a bit repetitive at times and challenging without being frustrating. there's enough to scavenge, manage, and modify without being overwhelming or intrusive. i know it was buggy when it launched, but i experienced zero issues and it ran very well on my rtx 4060ryzen 7 7000 series. but really, it's all about the story with this one. if you've watched the hbo show, you're already familiar with it, but it's quite different to experience it this way. i think i'll wait until i play part 2 before watching the next season."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-24,"one of the best crafted games i've ever played. it is very graphic and has a lot of profanity so just be aware of that but to be honest i think for the most part it is appropriate for this subject matter. this also has the best story of any game i've ever played, in my opinion of coarse. made me tear up many times, even on the second playthrough. i really can't wait for part two. the developers really did a good job making joel and elle feel like real people and i really have come to love these two characters. good job naughty dog, you got me. it's time to check out your other titles."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-23,"excellent movie like game, very enjoyable, except one small issue, in certain sectiona of the game theres this weird black texture floor bug. quick hardware spec ryzen 7 5800x3d 4ghz all core under volted. nvidia 3090 16gb ddr4 3440x1440  144hz with hdr, high settings 144fps lock"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-23,"i started off wrong. i am downloading this game again to see how the developer designed this game for my model. but this was a dope game. shout out to my friend that bought this game. i believer his brother stole it, but his brother told me it was a kick ass game. his friend actually bout it though shout out to the homie kyle. i been calling him quel since i was a child. they just let me have it. shout out to the homie."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-23,"i understand of negative review due to bad optimization on this game. the truth is, i don't have a playstation but when it comes to pc, this is my only chance to play this game. this game is one of the best storyline and combats. it is way more better stealthier than others. the last of us part i is one of my favorite game i have ever played."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-23,great game and story. would be good if it was optimised better but its good enough
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-23,probably some of the most well written characters out of any game ive ever played this games actually beautiful
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-22,"this game truly was a masterpiece. knowing i will never find a story based game quite like this one is heartbreaking. everything was perfect, the story, the scenery, the graphics, the fights. this game is my greatest treasure."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-22,they fixed most of the bugs. feels good to play finally. great story and gameplay!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-22,"the graphics and story were very well done, i thought."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-21,great game and great story line. i am glad i picked this one up on sale and several months after the initial release which was plagued with numerous issues. this runs flawlessly on my modest i5rtx3070 ti setup. highly recommended and looking forward to part 2.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-21,"this game deserves a genuine place in the single player hall of fame and whilst this port has its ups and downs. i would buy this game and 100 it all over again. i ran this game on a 7800x3d  4080 super at 4k res native, no upscaling at a constant 70fps pretty good!. pros  game is very fluid, minimal crashing only crashed 2 or 3 times at the start when i first uninstalled afterwards flawless, stunning graphics  dlss 4 looks just as good at native in most cases  fsr 3.1 implentation gives more fps than dlss 4, even on a 40 series card cons  first things first, this game is very vram dependent, but if you turn down textures it should fix it  the gameplay, you're very locked into whatever move or keybind you press, no canceling a action.  on grounded mode, the human ai literally have aimbot and whether you pass the encounter or not depends on luck and if you figure out how to path the ai to sneak around or line up for you to kill them.   fsr 3.1 has noticable shimmers in water and certain corners  no frame gen  upscaling implementation  some places in the starting city and stairs you can pass through that flash bang your screen with glitched no or all white textures  some optional conversations in pittsburg can glitch out and not count causing you to have to go back through and retrigger them  amazing game 1010, can't wait for last of us p2 in april!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-21,"great story, you have to play in your lifetime!! it really makes you love joel and ellie as characters"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-20,"its awesome game, nice graphs, immersive, dialogues and story are great, various modes for harcore and regular players, difficulty adequate, money well spent for me."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-20,"the main game is great, nice combination of a rich story line, good action sequences, and challenging puzzles to solve such as finding the way out of an area. difficulty options can be customized so you get a challenging game without it feeling like an impossible slog. the included dlc, left behind, is far worse. the developers worried way too much about the story line with the dlc and not enough on actual playability."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-20,"played the game when it came back way back. always has been and will be phenominal, the better graphics only make it better"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-20,"greatest single player game of all time. 1010 in every way. remake has some glitches for sure, but nothing truly terrible."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-20,this is one of the greatest written stories of all time. now i can add its newest remaster to my collection!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-19,"it does have a few issues with performance but its probably my pc. but the story is absolutely a 1010, and gameplay wise is more fun than god of war 4 and ragnarok. deluxe edition isn't worth it imo as you get these things later in game."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-19,"captivating storytelling , one of the best in gaming history . 1210. i luv it"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-19,"amazing story telling, gameplay and progression is good, characters are top notch. only took about 1213 hours to beat, another few more including left behind. had no performance issues on a 8086k8700k, 3060ti with 32gb ram 1080p. 8.510!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-18,"when it comes to sigma alpha wolves in gaming, joel stands at the top of the food chain. this man isnt just a survivorhes a lone predator, a force of nature who operates on instinct, intellect, and pure, unfiltered dominance. from the moment you step into his boots, you realize joel doesnt follow the packhe leads by refusing to be led. he moves with purpose, speaks only when necessary, and lets his actions do the talking. hes not some idealistic hero hes a hardened, pragmatic lone wolf who understands that in a world gone to hell, only the strongest survive."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-18,"while the port for this game experienced a disastrous launch back in 2023, and much of the criticism it received for that port was certainly well deserved, i feel that sony and naughty dog have done a decent job of fixing this port. while all the crashing issues and general gameplay bugs have been fixed i experienced only one crash and few gameplay bugs during my time playing this over two systems of varying power, i still think this port doesnt quite perform as well as it should on lower end hardware, but that seems to be an issue across the gaming industry these days looking at you, ue5. having played this on my somewhat dated gaming laptop with a 6 gig 3060, this game performed rather poorly at 1080p low settings, and my nearly maxing out my vram usage i could get 6070 fps mediumhigh settings with frame generation enabled, which is decent but it's clear how out of reach these games are becoming for budget gamers. now, on my new system, this game runs at an easy 100 fps average at 1440p ultra on a 7900xt. so i applaud the devs for doing their best to fix the game post launch, but i can help but feel bitter that they managed to botch this game so badly at launch, and i have to wonder why they can't just port the original to steam, also, so budget gamers can still enjoy this amazing work of art without having to worry about their systems overheating when they launch the thing. but, in any case, this review is not about the technical aspects of the pc port, though they are worthy of a discussion. for me, having never played this game before or having never played a naughty dog game in general and only being able to watch people play it for many years, it was a pleasure to play this game after the devs spent some time fixing it up. the last of us, no matter how you slice it, is one of gaming's greatest accomplishments and has influenced many of the best storydriven games of the past decade. it's influence can be felt all over, from these new star wars games to even god of war. it is difficult to imagine gaming in the modern day without the influence of naughty dog. the last of us needs no explanation. if by this point you haven't played the game, watched a playthrough, or seen the show, you must've been living under a rock. the acting, the dialogue, the writing, the level design, the pacing of the game, the soundtrack, the visuals... the entire experience is a masterclass. while the last of us and its kin have never been a very gameplayfirst sort of experience, the actual gameplay loop is still fairly satisfying, with most of the intrigue coming from the level design and less so the actual combat itself similar to halflife. but even so, with combat arguably being the weakest aspect of this game, it doesn't taint or diminish the experience. you play last of us for the story. and what a story it is. i won't ramble on for hours, mostly because steam won't let me and because many people more qualified than me have already said all there is to say on this game long before i ever even played it. but if you have a decent system and some extra cash, then play this game if you haven't yet. it's an experience you won't forget, and i have certainly had this game in the back of my mind for years ever since i first saw others play it way back in the day. one of my favorite games of all time, and perhaps the best video game narrative besides rdr2 and witcher 3. 1010, though i still wish we had the original and that this port was more impressive than it is."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-17,"great story, great music and the only game so far that shows emotions on animated characters so well"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-17,one of the best story telling games i have played. plus the new graphics from the main game on ps4 is a plus.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-17,if this wasn't full of optimisation issues and texture bugs left right and centre then this could probably up there with the best story games out there. the bugs that occur with every launch of the game and the hair looking like playdoh make it a really annoying tedious process to get to the end. i imagine if i had played this on a playstation and not a terrible pc port i would have enjoyed it more. however i still recommend this because it is a truly great story and when it works it looks brilliant.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-17,"1010 game play and story. if you have yet to experience the last of us, you are missing out. i have seen many reviews talking about the compiling shaders and constant crashing and fps issues. let me give you some tips from my personal experience if you have an older graphics card, say 10 or 20 series, you will need to be ok playing on 1080p lowmed settings. personally i have a rtx 3080 with 10gbs of vram, ryzen 9 7900x with 32gbs of ddr5 playing at 1440p 2k getting anywhere from 90120fps at ultra with some of the very demanding vram settings on high. my vram as well as my ram is getting eaten alive most of the time, with even 10gbs of my ram being used while i play the game. i realized through some trial and error that the game likes to crash if i don't allow for at least an extra 11.5gbs of vram. for example, in the game settings it tells me i'm using about 8.5 total. now i still have experienced a single crash upon chapter changes. meaning, i'll play through a whole section of the game just fine hours of game play only to be ctd upon a transitional cutscene to a new chapter of the game. another note is i am using the amd fsr 3.1 with frame gen turned on. i do not know if that works with rtx 20 series cards. however, the game would be unplayable for me personally if i did not use amd's frame gen. the game still looks amazing and i have all my settings on native resolutions for everything. as far as the compiling shaders issue, i don't quite know. i have the game installed on a samsung nvme m.2 drive and it only compiled the shaders once taking about 5 mins total. i have been playing the game regularly the last week so i don't know if i took a break that the shaders would recompile or not. to be clear, i have cleared my ram and shut my pc off completely between play sessions and my game has yet to say it's compiling shaders since the first time i launched it last week. my final conclusions are, i probably wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have at least a gpu with 10gbs of vram. my rtx 3080 would struggle if i didn't have the amd fsr 3.1 turned on. in my personal opinion struggle means gets less than 60fps at highultra settings in 1440p. i originally played this game on a ps4 pro and it doesn't even compare to how amazing it looks on pc. a totally different experience. in my final conclusion if graphics are king to you don't bother buying this game without at least an rtx 3080."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-16,the last of us is a towering achievement in terms of narrative focused video games. this remastered version truly lets it shine in all its glory. incredible game. it has also seemingly been fixed on pc.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-16,always a great story line game to go back on. from ps3 til now it is still a classic!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-16,an amazing and impacting game with a compelling story. gameplay and game physics is damn near perfection. naughty dog has created something special here.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-16,excited for part 2 to finally come to pc fingers crossed honestly but game is great just like the original version! i finished the game within like 24 hours but i was also hyper focused on it! overall great game!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-16,"amazing graphic, scenery, game play and story line."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-16,"h2the last of us is a great example of how games should be made h2 everything in this game is done perfectly, you will never have the feeling that you are playing a game. the graphics, the music, the concepts... are amazing. all the mechanics correspond to locations that are different from each other and have a unique atmosphere. it is very interesting to see how the relationship between ellie and joel develops, from mere strangers to family relatives. and to watch how the world around them is cruel and affects their journey. you will need a few days or weeks to think about the game after you finish it, and i think that is the best metric for how touching and unforgettable the story is. if you are the type of gamer who enjoys singleplayer storydriven games, you should definitely play it. p.s. the remastered version still has some bugs, but not so critical."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-16,this game is a great game! d very very happy my friend reccomended me this and well it has a great story line to it and is a bit challenging at moments 1010 reccomend
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-15,"great game. after a while the monsters were a little boringrepetitive but great animations and noises. i loved the gore too. it did challenge my 3060ti even on mostly high settings, but excellent graphics. swapping between weapons is super annoying, so be sure to fill up both longshort gun holsters for easier swapping."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-15,"average story game, ellie is very annoying. joel tries to carry it, but it's still not enough. i don't like the game. on the other hand, i didn't find any bugs, so overall it's not that bad."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-15,"i waited for everything to be fixed before trying and am so glad i can enjoy a much better and updated version and am playing on legiongo, high settings with fg3 help it further more. great story, great gameplay, great graphics and fun, so recommended and my old time fav game i can enjoy playing portable."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-15,"graphics are really good, story is great, some annoying in game mechanics and qte's. overall pretty decent game."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-15,"not a very long game, and the story is totally linear. but very atmospheric and at time exciting."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-15,this game is one of the most cinematic games ive ever played. absolute s tier game! id say it is comparable to metro exodus
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-14,great storyline and overall a fun game to play
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-14,"this game is perfect with story has great mechanics, amzing graphics there is not a single thing bad abt this game, its a masterpeice"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-14,"just played this for the first time. took 13,5 hr for both story modes. 2080 super on ultra. games looks fantastic! had zero bugs or issue throughout entire play through. good story and dialog. lot of good aspects to the game from fighting with bottles, sneak attacks, bows and guns."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-14,"ive always heard that the story of tlou was amazing and even knew how it ended to some degree because of spoilers. i didn't know anything about the middle until playing. the story is amazing with characters that heavily affect the relationships and progression of the main characters. the game is also beautiful. stealth is pretty much forced upon you in many situations and it is quite a good system to play with. the game is pretty much what everyone agrees, a 1010 masterpiece."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-13,"phenomenal story and game play. i had no game bugs or frame rate issues. while yes i have a pretty high end pc, i9, 4070, 64gb ram and 8tb of of ssds. this game is absolutely stunning and fun. the left behind is very short. my wife is not a gamer and the tv show we watched together then the she watched me play through the game and she is impressed how well the tv show is to the game. worth 100 of the cost. even though total play through time is definitely not 1hr of game time per 1 spent. however the quality is amazing. the extra features are really cool i played with mouse and kb as im very bad at aiming with controller. however the game works just fine. i will say to match muscle memory with other fps or even 3rd person shoorts you will need to do a lot of button remapping as the multiple weapon types they are not keybord designed. the game is yes originally console they put no effort in making it for mousen in kb. so that will take some at the beggining to remap and make it feel mroe kb friendly. other than the that 1010"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-13,"i absolutely loved the last of us. the story was incredibleemotional, gripping, and just beautifully told. the gameplay was fun too, but what really stuck with me were the characters, the world, and the stunning visuals."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-12,yeah its a very good story but its let down by its repetitive game play a stupid limits on collecting ammo and resources. for me its average  really wish we have stars as it would be about a 3 or 4 out of 5.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-12,game is fun its my 2 time beating the game. im on steam deck btw
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-12,amazing and beautiful game the story is just as good! def worth it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-12,"despite the poor optimisation on launch for the low to midend systems, the words are worthless describing this masterpiece, just experience it for yourself if you haven't already.. story  10 gameplay  10 graphics  10 level design  10 sound  10 dialogue  10 realism  8.5 optimisation  8   96"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-10,"this game is amazing. it honestly rivals halflife 2 and resident evil 4 remake. has pretty good combat, with the best fictional story ive ever seen. the only reason this game has low reviews of all time is because it was super buggy at launch, and while its still mildly buggy for some people, but its a lot better now."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-10,"words, scratch that, paragraphs cannot describe how amazing this game is. just play it, trust me. 1010"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-10,"it is a great fucking game, on pc and on ps. both parts have literally changedf my perspective of things and i love this game so fricken much totally recommend!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-10,"wow!!! is something that the last of us had me saying countless times! this game is not for the weak, i personally am a huge fan of naughty dog and their previous ip's shout out to jak  daxter and uncharted but these games are tremendously different while all being great games in their own domain. tlou uses the same engine utilized in the uncharted games, a phenomenal 3rd person perspective that it's so well done, it makes you feel as if you too are dodging the clickers with joel and ellie. the melee combat is very intense, i feel the weight of each swing from joel's fists, each filled with such anger and vigor, so much pent up aggression. however this game is so much darker than i could have imagined, the themes of sorrow, sacrifice, love and survival are heavily explored in this game. the game jumps you right into it! be prepared for an intense opening prologue that is ruthless, a great taste of what is to come in this game. so many actions that these characters do make me question my moral's and what i would do if i was thrown into a post apocalyptic world. a cruel and unforgiving world where my family is long gone and i am fighting every day for my survival. all in all, whether you feel that their actions are justified or not, the writing is so well done that you can't help but reason with the choices they commit too. i love tlou, it's a game i wish i could play for the first time all over again because of how traumatic the weight of the climatic moments in this game are. they can not be recreated, play it for yourself, hell it took me 5 remasters and the game being out for over a decade to finally try this masterpiece but i finally did it and i do not regret it one bit. all in all, this is a game i would easily recommend to even the most casual gamer who is ok with mature elements depicted in a story. rating  1010 game play length  6 hours or so. visuals  movie like if your rig can handle it"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-10,this game is beautiful and amazing. its incredibly gritty and i luv it.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-10,"one of my favorite games. after being obsessed with the walking dead, i set out to find any games with the same concepts. this one isn't very similar in terms of walkersclickers, but i love it sooooo much otherwise."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-17,"played this when it 1st came out, hated it, too linear, full of bugs and laggy bits. now its smooth as butter, havent seen a single bug. really enjoying it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,"i bought the game after watching people play it for ages, but when i actually bought the game, it wasn't even able to boot up and i had to search up things to toggle and ways to make the game playable. and when i did actually play, i was only able to meet ellie, before i gave up. and mind you, the game could only run for about 5 minutes before it crashed. i kept pushing through all the way but eventually, got frustrated. i spent at least a full hour just trying to get out of the prologue as there were so many variables needed to be loaded. it's an amazing game and i still want to play it, but there's a big part of a game that needs to work. actually being able to play it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-28,highly recommended!!! i never seen the tv series but this game is less scarier than i expected

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,a masterpiece of storytelling and modern game design. the last of us is truly what a game should aspire to be. too bad we never got a true sequel to this masterpiece and only got a horribly written fan fiction.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-04,"i don't know whether if the developers optimized this game or if nvidia's new dlss technology is simply magical, but the game runs smooth like butter now years after i purchased it when it was a graphical stutter fest that made me question my purchase. all that is in the past now. the game runs on max settings at 3200x1600 after toggling dlss super resolution not dlaa and turning vsync off in game but on in the nvidia panel. this is the best game for grown ups out there where a grounded story, beautiful looking graphics, character design and superb motion capturelike animation merge together except maybe for the banshee or screamer, not sure what's its name which kinda breaks up the immersion, giving the gamer an unforgettable gaming experience that will be tough to emulate, especially now that developers appear to be so unskillful in creating an experience like this one. please buy this game and another in physical form so you can put it under your pillow and sleep well. i hope more games"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-17,"ok so i was absolutely loving this game, graphics some of the best i've seen but then when i got to the graveyard part of the game my game would crash out of no where and i haven't been able to find a fix so currently i cannot recommend this port of the game just for that alone. but i will be getting it on my ps5 instead so i can play all of it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,my pc can run modern games with full raytracing with no issues yet this game stutters and lags constantly. i really don't get it. i unfortunately can't really recommend a port that doesn't run.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-20,"the main game is great, nice combination of a rich story line, good action sequences, and challenging puzzles to solve such as finding the way out of an area. difficulty options can be customized so you get a challenging game without it feeling like an impossible slog. the included dlc, left behind, is far worse. the developers worried way too much about the story line with the dlc and not enough on actual playability."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-19,"game audio is so low it's almost inaudible. i have no problems with audio in any other game, but i can't even understand the characters' dialogue in this game. i'm applying for a refund."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"giving this a negative review, because the last of us part 1 is not region locked and 2nd is, i cant preorder. i love the game, i played it on ps3. but i hate what sony is doing with region locking."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,i loved this game since 2013. i've since moved exclusively to pc and this has been a wonderful experience.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,i hate games where you can carry 20 rounds. when i go to shop i have 45 rounds with me and there is no problem to put 100 in your pockets. don't mention it is aisle type of game. you don't have options here.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"timeless game. but why in the world are you guys remastering part 2??? it came out in the year of our lord two thousand and twenty, why does sony love remastering brand fucking new games, like seriously they will remaster horizon zero dawn five more times before we get even a simple 60 fps patch for bloodborne....."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-14,best storyline ever in a game hands down
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-12,"this is this best game i have ever played in my whole life, i 100 percent recommend getting the last of us part 1 and 2. this is such an amazing game! i would not recommend if you do not like shooting or scary stuff."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,"how can i start describing this game? no, sorry! how can i describe how good is this game!? no spoilers. i started playing this game just last year, finished a couple of levels, then got busy with life, yeah... back to it in the last 2 months, what an adventure it was! a great adventure through the postapocalyptic america. different locations, different enemies, different landscapes and views what great views this game has omg!. the characters are well written, the good, the bad, every place you go in has a backstory to it, and every story is unique and interesting. in my entire playthrough i haven't seen a single similar place, all are different! it really immerse you the way you expect a game of that kind would do. the infected were great, the ai was top notch, humans and infected. you just had to be surprised every time you faced some sort of enemy! the ui is clear and simple, the weapons and there upgrades are cool. the collectibles are rewarding to some extent. the downside is the performance, it's really heavy on any pc hardware, not well optimized."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-07,im only leaving this comment mostly before the part 2. reviewing everything before i actually see the second game for myself and reflect what went wrong. and before i get attacked by the woke for not being a fan of this series which is most likely done for good now
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-07,"with the combination of an engaging story, fun and challenging gameplay loop and a gutpunch of an ending, the last of us is a nearperfect game. there's a pervasive sense of danger and death around every corner, but the characters often introduce levity with small talk and moments of hope. having only played the original ps3 version, the graphical overhaul made it feel like a new experience. very, very impressed."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-07,"this is a well made game. art, voiceacting, gameplay, story, all topnotch. i saw the show first which no doubt took some of the emotional impact away for me, but there were still connections with the characters. standard difficulty was fine for me, though this meant it was too easy a good part of the time, i didn't much mind. highly recommended."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-07,"it might just be me but, the aiming zoomaim on pc is really bad and locks up and doesnt alow you to fire or aim which results in the zombie killing yo ass. however overall the rest of the game is very pretty. extremely clunky controls tho atleast for me. still i wanna keep playing its a cool story but it feels broken on pc mouse and keyboard, and control my aim is so shit i cant hit anything."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,it's a timeless game. but it crashes now on my steam deck that i just bought
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,runs perfectly fine for me and is still is one of the best games ever made.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,best game ever made of all time in the world 10010 recommend play it now you will love it and enjoy it and have the best time of your life
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,it crashed every time as soon as it loaded in with a gpu crash nothing i did helped fix it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,"amazing game. what else to say that hasn't been said yet? one thing i don't understand is why a 4gb gpu as minimal spec if the game uses more than 5gb of vram on low settings at 1080p? it runs smooth on my rtx 3060 oc in high settings plus dlss on quality either at 1080p or 1440p. but running this game on my gtx 1650 laptop is painful. everything on low and fsr on performance damages the visual fidelity so much and creates such an input lag that doesn't allow you to enjoy this game fully as it was intended. it is pleasant if played on a steamdeck, locked at 30 fps, as with the small screen and lower resolution helps with that but at 1080p with a gtx 1650 forget it. by all means play it, if it's the only gpu you have, but bear in mind that it needs at least 6gb of vram to make the experience enjoyable. games like days gone, uncharted, detroit and god of war run better on the gtx 1650. even cyberpunk with fsr 3 on native aa runs better."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,"overall, i enjoyed tlou but with some caveats. to be honest, i hated it for the first few hours. you don't get many weapons or much ammo, which is fine per se, but it plays like a stealthmelee based game for a while there... while lacking much of any decent stealth or melee mechanics. the camera pans slow, there's no block or dodge button, and enemies clownhouse around you. they don't give you many decent places to hide. enemies don't follow movement patterns and will randomly turn around and are very aggro for melee. you can throw objects to distract them, but you can only carry one throwable object at a time. all this had be pretty frustrated for the first few hours. once you get more weapons, you're more free to shoot your way out of the situations, but at best the combat mechanics are pretty flat imo. past that, the story and setting develop into an immersive experience that leaves you thinking. characters are notably expressive this story is all about learning to find meaning again, to get close to another person emotionally, and watching those characters develop towards that concept. the world design is pretty great too, especially with the changing seasons and varied scenes. i loved progressing through the world and its struggles. both friends and foes are designed with depth and it is not uncommon to blur the lines of good or evil, friend or foe. moral ambiguity always makes a story and its characters more interesting, and tlou does this beautifully. in terms of graphics, i was able to run it maxed in 4k no issues on a 4080 super, using dlss 4 which wasn't a compromise given the honestly offputting sharpening effect the visuals had at most times anyway. it wasn't as noticeable during the winter scenes, but this game really could have been a 1010 on graphics if not for this fact. this becomes more apparent on a larger screen closer up, and higher resolution doesn't help the issue the way it does for taa blursmear found in a lot of other games. the image was probably meant to be viewed on a tv as distance. i don't know why they used so much sharpening, perhaps to fake detail back from some kind of taa implementation. in sum, at the end i found myself craving more of the plot despite having had enough of the combat. tlou is one of the few games where the cutscenes and more passive, cinematic segments are the strongest points imo, and those points are strong enough to outweigh the weak areas."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,amazing game i love the last of us i'm super happy that the next game comes out on steam in 5 weeks

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-21,storytelling is incredible. i am so glad it got released for nonplaystation gamers
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-21,i absolutely loved this game and the storytelling was immaculate. i truly think everyone who plays games would love the last of us and i am excited for part ii.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-19,"it's a masterpiece, a treasure for generations to come, that everyone should play. nobody makes games like this anymore."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-26,"story mode too short. paid 60 for less than 19 hours. i liked it a lot, but should be half price"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-03,"i only bought this version of the game because it was on sale and i thought it would be convenient to play it on my computer. i assumed that years after the release of the port it would be cleaned up and run well. it does not. why does this port have so many crashes and longer loading screens than my ps4 copy from 2013? sure, it looks nicer, but it runs worse. eta i do not regret buying this version of the game  when it works, it is a very enjoyable experience. i just wouldn't recommend it due to the performance issues  i will admit that the patches since release have helped, however, they just haven't completely resolved the issues like frame rate and load times."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,"well gameplay is ok, it is nothing revolutionary that i haven't seen in days gone, resident evil or the evil within, but the story is very captivating and good. game is very short and expencive, and i found out about the plot in sequel which made me upset. if you watched tv series in hbo max, well they made everything from game in that show, they ruined mine expirience of this game. i haven't played the part 2, but judging from the plot on wikipedia i see that they ruined this series, so i will give negative review. do not buy this, it will touch your soul with the first one and then squash your heart in the next one. it is full of lgbt propaganda, and they kill main protagonist. i just don't want to play games where main protagonst die."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,"nunca jugu este juego en sus inicios, pero tena tantisimos premios y buenas referencias que realmente cre que me maravillara pues eran tan apabullantes las buenas criticas que mis espectativas se fueron a los cielos. ahora que finalmente lo estoy jugando, me resulta un juego de lo mas lineal y repetitivo en sus batallas ademas de acertijos absurdamente faciles y lo peor recursos tan limitados que tristemente es lo nico que hacen complicado el juego, y justifica un esfuerzo. solo dame un arma con balas infinitas y paso el juego con los ojos vendados. basura de juego con falsa buena publicidad y premios comprados"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,"i imagine this was good for 2013, but the gameplay mechanics are pretty limited, the allimportant stealth mode is pretty limited as well. i played this for the story, but to be honest, there is not much effort at developing the characters in a meaningful way, and there's not much to the story except constantly running from or killing random zombies or human enemies. no real interesting choices, and side characters come, and then go. there is a reveal eventually, but it takes a lot of slogging through very similar kinds of scenarios to get there. if you're looking for a rich story in a beautiful setting, this isn't really what you're looking for."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-19,"wow, what a great main story only to be ruined with the addition of left behind. leave it up to naughty dog to ruin an amazing story by adding woke nonsense nobody asked for in the extra mode. when i finished the main story of joel and ellie, i was actually really excited to play left behind, up until that lesbian mike tyson soundalike of a firefly ruined it. its really not needed and the liveaction counterpart of the down of us was ruined by a godawful casting of ellie. way to go, making one of the main characters look like somebody who has down syndrome rather than immunity to the cordeceps virus."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-01,this happens when you trying to port old games on pc. 100 crushes even with good equipment. so much time passed and still no optimised patch avaliable. dont buy this raw material. i haven't seen such a broken portation for a long time. keep on sony.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-17,"i have long awaited for this game to be on steam. unfortunately, this game will not launch from my pc and yes, i have the correct specs. i played this game growing up and highly recommend it. for steam, i recommend buying on sale and seeing if it will launch  if not, return. hopefully, it will get fixed one day..."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,"the last of us part 1  a timeless gaming masterpiece when i first played the last of us part 1, i honestly wasnt prepared for how deeply it would impact me. from the gripping gameplay to the emotional storytelling, this game set a new standard for what video games can achieve. gameplay the gameplay in the last of us part 1 is so wellcrafted that i found myself fully immersed in the survival elements. i love how the game combines stealth and combat, making every encounter feel different depending on how you approach it. the tension of sneaking around clickers or making tough choices in combat keeps you on edge, but its never frustrating. the controls feel tight, and theres just enough challenge to keep you engaged without feeling overwhelming. managing your resources, crafting items, and navigating the environment all come together in a way that feels rewarding, and i love how each decision can have such a big impact on the experience. graphics visually, the last of us part 1 looks absolutely stunning. it does an incredible job of enhancing the games world. the environments feel alive with detailed textures and lighting that immerse you fully into the postapocalyptic world. every characters expression and movement is so realistic, i often found myself just marveling at how lifelike they look. the ruined cities, overgrown nature, and atmospheric weather effects are visually captivating, and they make the world feel so real and livedin. its one of those games where you almost forget youre playing, because everything feels so tangible. storyline but its the story that really sets the last of us part 1 apart for me. the relationship between joel and ellie is central, and watching their bond develop as they navigate the horrors of this world is nothing short of brilliant. there are moments in this game that hit you right in the gut, and its the kind of narrative that sticks with you long after youre done playing. its heartbreaking, raw, and beautifully told. the pacing is perfecttheres just enough action to keep you hooked, but the quieter, more emotional moments are what really make this game so powerful. i have to give major credit to the voice acting, too. troy baker as joel and ashley johnson as ellie bring so much depth to their characters that it feels like youre watching a film rather than playing a game. sound and music the sound design is something i cant overlook. from the chilling noises of the clickers to the ambient sounds of nature reclaiming the world, everything in this game pulls you deeper into its atmosphere. and the music? gustavo santaolallas score is simply haunting. it perfectly captures the tone of the game, amplifying the emotional highs and lows in a way that makes every scene feel even more intense. the soundtrack is one of those rare ones that, even outside the game, i find myself listening to on repeat because it evokes so many memories of the journey. replayability and features though i havent finished the game yet, i can already tell that the last of us part 1 offers plenty of reasons to come back. from what i've experienced so far, the game is filled with hidden details and collectibles that im excited to explore further. i can already sense that the world is rich with things to discover, and the multiple difficulty settings mean ill likely revisit the game to challenge myself in different ways. plus, the new accessibility options make the experience more inclusive, allowing a wider range of players to enjoy it fully. im looking forward to seeing how the game evolves as i progress and how much more there is to uncover in this incredible world. final thoughts although i havent finished the last of us part 1 yet, im already incredibly impressed by what ive experienced. the gripping gameplay, emotional storytelling, and stunning visuals have left a lasting impact on me, and im excited to see how the journey unfolds. i can tell that the game is going to stay with me long after ive completed it, and im eager to dive deeper into the world and the relationship between joel and ellie. while theres still much more to discover, its clear that this game is a true masterpiece, and im looking forward to experiencing the rest of it."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,"tldr very beautiful but overrated and overpriced mediocrity. overall 410 plot 110 the plot can be described as you need to go from point a to point b. now that you are at point b, the thing that you needed here is not here, so you need to go to point c. rinse and repeat. mario did it much better. the characters, which there are only two because all additional characters appear on screen for anywhere from several minutes to one short mission don't really get any development, because most of the time they are silently shooting bandits and when we finally talk it's about something meaningless like a movie poster or a few words about which point in our journey we need to go now and why. only glimpse of character development of joel you get in a final mission, before that it's just journey for the sake of the journey. gameplay 210 the game starts as a mediocre stealth. you have only three stealth mechanics hiding behind objects, strangling or stabbing your opponents from the back, and throwing bottles or bricks to get others attention. strangling takes very long and stabbing works only ones, after which you need to craft a new shiv. at some point it gets better shivs now can be used up to 3 times and you get a bow. and when you get some better stealth gearskills the game transforms from mediocre stealth to mediocre shooter. now you have enough ammo to fight a lot of enemies, so the game gives them to you dozens of bandits or zombies, which makes stealth around the middle of the game obsolete. shooting is not satisfying and feels clunky. the only good thing about this part is gear upgrades, which have pretty nice animations and make you care about certain weapons more. game also have a rudimentary survival elements. you need to run around looting rags, alcohol, mechanical parts etc. from this you can craft bombs, medicine kits, shivs etc. and use it to upgrade your weapons. the main mechanic here is cap on everything from rags to ammo. the only thing which is somehow not capped is weapons. by the end of the game in your tiny backpack you are carrying 9 different weapons, among which a flamethrower, three types of rifles, bow and four pistols. but god forbid you have more than 7 rounds for each weapon for some 20. if you think the game is about zombies, you are wrong the game is about bandits, who if they tried to fight zombies instead of pursuing some dude and a kid probably would end up winning, cause there are at least 34 times more bandits in the game than zombies. graphics 1010 the game is really beautiful, the picturesque landscapes of a ruined world are truly breathtaking. i would love to immerse myself in this world and explore it for hours, but alas except beautiful picture there is nothing here to explore. i didn't have any crashes and overall quality problems, but i have a nice computer i714700, 32 gb ram, rtx 4070. value for money 310 even if you take it on sale for 50 of the price it's still pricy to pay 30 bucks for a 15 hour mediocre adventure with zero replayability. for the full 60 it feels like a daylight robbery, when games like baldur's gate 3 with hundreds of hours of content exist."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-08,greatest story of all time
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,beautiful story game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,"if you've never played the original on ps3 back then, this is the best way to experience one of gaming's greatest stories! 1010"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,"the last of us part 1 is an experience i will cherish for many, many years to come. this game will change you. although its concept is simple and has been done a million times, it still feels vastly unique. the story is breathtaking, and the visuals match it perfectly. however, when loading in for the first time, the time it takes for the shaders to load is far too long, and it definitely puts a strain on your cpubut its most certainly worth it. the voice acting, gameplay, zombies, and even something as simple as the title screen are all exceptionally well done. im aware of the issues the pc port faced when it was first released, but most of them have been patched since then. throughout my 100 completion, i experienced no issues, no crashing, and no glitches. now is the perfect time to experience this masterpiece, especially with the upcoming series and the pc port of the last of us part 2 coming next month. with the steam sale on march 13th, i hope this game is includedwhat better time to try it? i highly recommend it."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,while this has to be in my top ten favorite games of all time. i can not recommend this pc version. it is full of bug and glitches. like joel's face hair making him look like a wookie due rendering issues. gates that won't open and the e won't appear. even the sound track seem to be out of sync compared to the ps version of the game. save your money and play the ps34 version.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,"the last of us part i isn't merely a game, it's a breathtaking emotional journey that stands unparalleled as my absolute favorite game ever created. i cannot stress this enough this game is a masterpiece in storytelling, character development, and immersive gameplay. joel and ellie's journey is profoundly human, navigating a shattered world filled with heartache, hope, and haunting beauty. every encounter feels meaningful, every quiet moment resonates, and every twist cuts deeply. naughty dog has crafted characters so authentic that their struggles become our struggles, their victories our victories, and their losses unforgettable. yet, it's not all tears and tragedy, there's humor in the absurd practicality of survival. ever wondered how joel calmly stores lit molotov cocktails in his backpack without causing fiery destruction? or marveled at the unexpected lethality of casually tossed bricks and bottles? and let's not forget my new reallife hoarding obsession inspired by this game, endlessly gathering crafting materials like tape and broken scissors, because you never know when they'll come in handy during the apocalypse to make a terrible shiv to bust open locked doors to even more crafting supplies! from the raw intensity of survival to the quiet intimacy of its emotional moments, the last of us part i remains unmatched. it's not just entertainment it's a transformative experience that elevates the medium of video games into genuine art. simply put, this isn't just my favorite gameit's an essential experience that i believe everyone should live at least once."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,"this is the best way to experience one of the best games of all time! the last of us will always be one of my favourite video games of all time, ive lost track of how many full playthroughs ive done of the originalremastered versions of the game, but ive probably beat the game around 30 times and ive put over 400 hours into the remastered, and i think the game was very close to perfect, and this remake allows the game to become even closer to being perfect. in 2013 naughty dog was limited by the technology of the time on ps3, but now with this ps5 remake they were able to fully reach their original vision for tlou. i completed the main story for the remake already, and i loved every second of it. the last of us part i shows what the last of us wouldve been like if it released in 2022 instead of 2013, and its beautiful. the added accessibility options are incredible as they allow more players the ability to play this game, because some people might not have been able to play the original game due to the lack of accessibility options at the time, so this remake definitely justifies its existence for many reasons. this remake keeps the same amazing story, performances, and soundtrack as the original, while improving every other aspect of the game. the last of us part i is the definitive way to experience the last of us, the graphics, attention to detail, sound design, gameplay, ai, ui, character models, accessibility options, and more are all way better than in the original and remastered versions of the game. also the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are awesome, they definitely add more immersion to the game, same with the 3d audio. people shouldnt be leaving reviews of the game without playing it, even if youve played the originalremaster if you havent played the remake you shouldnt review it because the remake technically counts as a new game, so if youre someone whos thinking about getting this game please only listen to the reviews from people who have actually played and completed the last of us part i remake, as someone who completed it i think its amazing and worth it. 1010"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-12,"this is a great game you don't need me to tell you that. this is more of a port review, as it was a pretty controversial game when it came to pc back in 2023. i'm happy to report it runs great now. i was playing around the recommended system requirements and was getting roughly 90120 fps throughout on highcustom 1440p! so that's pretty pogchamp"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-21,"h1one of the best games of the playstation 3 erah1 the last of us part i is an actionadventure game set in an post apocalyptic setting. the remake is visualy stunning with a very well written story and unforgetable characters. the pc port runs very well after the recent patches, you still need a pretty beefy computer to run it properly. this was, of course, not a problem for me after i got my new rig. bpositivesb  the whole game feels like a movie, loading transitions are seamless.  great protagonists and acting performances.  amazing story with a lot of twists and turns, there is a lot of emotional depth.  after completing the game once you unlock the game modifiers that allow you to use ingame cheats for an easier experience.  the dlc left behind is a nice addition to the game and comes included in the pc version. bnegativesb  a few minor bugs here and there ellie can block you if you get stuck in a tight spottechnical glitch  there is no easy way to get collectibles if you miss some, you'll have to load the manual save if there is one. boverallb a game that every gamer should experince atleast once. it clocks at around 12h  2h for the dlc so i would recommend to get it on sale, atleast 50 off. httpssteamcommunity.comsharedfilesfiledetails?id3388774574"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-28,"one of the greatest singleplayer games i have experienced. i was immersed in the story from start to finish, its brilliant"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-06,"the last of us part 1 was a game that at first i was sceptical about buying. after reading several reviews on this game i can to the conclusion that it was a game riddled with bugs, performance issues and also had many crash problems. however i still had high expectations for this game. after maybe a year of the game rotting in my wishlist like most of my games there do i finally bought it and i have zero regrets. the last of us part 1 is story telling at its best. i think i heard somewhere on the internet that the game has a simple story but complex characters and i think this is what makes the game story so great. throughout the game you see ellie and joel's relationship changing as they first hate each other and then start to like each other and end up see each other as family near the end. the exchange of dialogue in this game feels like actual conversations you would see in real life with each characters face having realistic human facial expressions and body language. they speak like real people, with interruptions and pauses and imperfections in their speech which makes the conversations feel more natural. the game goes into great detail in these exchanges of dialogue, for example when joel and ellie are talking, joel gets reminded of his daughter sarah and glances down at the watch she gave to him before the apocalypse started. there are countless more details and definitely more that i have not even noticed but might in a second play through. as mentioned the story is simple which is great, because its easy to follow along and engage your self in it. a lot of people say that graphics don't mean anything in a game, and its all about gameplay and story. and i agree to an extent, but the graphics in this game are mind blowing and it really immerses you into the environment. i am sure i would still consider this game to be a masterpiece with much more toned down graphics, but the graphics really excel the game. i could not tell you the amount of times i stood in an area to look at the details in the environment. i must of taken 100 screenshots of the environment throughout my playthrough. however there are a few small issues that i noticed throughout my play through. i did notice that some of the mirrors in the game reflected my character in a way which made it look quite pixilated, however i do specifically remember in the introduction in this game before the apocalypse the mirrors reflected the character nearly perfectly, however this is such a small issue where i simply do not care. i did also find it a tiny bit odd how the puddles of water would reflect the environment around it but not the player. this is another really minor issue that i really think does not matter in the slightest and it might of even just been my settings. the gameplay i think is the weakest part of the game, but i would say its still great. the combat is nearly perfect and feels smooth and satisfying. the game almost always gives you the choice to either go guns blazing into an area or go as stealthily as possible, slowly picking off enemy ai. crafting items and choosing when and what item to use in a certain situation adds some more depth to the game play and you can also upgrade your weapons at an upgrade bench, however i did find that i did not use this too much and i had more than enough resources to upgrade my weapons even on the hard difficulty. and if you are struggling to find items and are finding the combat scenes too hard, you can easily turn down the difficulty to suit you best. personally i stuck on the hard difficulty throughout the playthrough as it felt perfectly fitted to me. some of the game play does feel very the same throughout the whole game. for example in the water sections you will almost always need to find a raft to bring ellie across a body of water since she cant swim. it does get repetitive but its not a deal breaker and usually the post apocalyptic environment around me would distract me from getting bored because of just how good it looked. i also need to quickly mention that the transitions of game play to cut scenes are almost seamless. anyways, the last of us is an amazing game in blending storytelling with gameplay. the story is incredibly gripping and easy to follow along. this is a must play game for me for anyone who is considering it. the game has few bugs throughout and the few that i experienced did not effect my experience with the game a whole lot. the game is definitely in a lot better place when it first launched on pc. i would also say that the 50 price tag is a bit too much. i bought the game on sale for 24 and i would say that, that price is fitting for the game. i just don't think you get enough play time for the money spent. aside from that, this game is a 9.510 for me. play it if you can."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-21,"brilliant game, even years later. can't wait for part 2 to release on pc and part 3 at some point on playstation. the hbo tv series is great too."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-16,"the last of us has been one of the game that i'm really eager to try. finally got to try it after a year and multiple patches. safe to say, the game runs great now and it has one of the most stunning graphics to this date. it has great character details, environmental details and even the lighting and reflection. the story is one of the most highly praise singleplayer game out there and let me tell you it's really justified. the story is really well written, it's slow buildup all the way to it's ambiguous ending is really interesting. the additional dlc also does contributes more to ellie's background as a whole. the soundtrack also compliments well with the overall game and in terms of the gameplay, it's really impressive. everything from the body movement to the gunfight. it's just so satisfying. there's actually bodyweight on your character and the resources are limited making you think before using them. the body explosion and even ragdoll animation is fantastic. also, here's something ubisoft should take note regarding their infamous collectibles. make them related to the characters so there's a reason we would want to collect them. i would actually go out of my way to explore and look for collectibles and sometimes, the collectibles can even form a storyline itself. that's what i call great storytelling. for me, the last of us is definitely one of the most immersive game that i have ever played. the whole game just felt like watching a long movie and it's really heartwarming watching joel  ellie grew closer and closer as the story progressed. the game has everything right, great characters, great story, great soundtrack and even in terms of gameplay it's definitely one of the best out there. it's a solid b1010b. it has some minor bugs but it's definitely worth the money and you should definitely try it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-12,"this game is more than a decade old now and it easily beats the majority of games that come out today. in terms of storywriting this is such a heavy hitter, it really can not be overstated. there's really very few games that you hit you in the guts like this and are so close to realism and relatability. you can really tell that the game is basically made with an actual filmmaking approach in every aspect of it. the amount of work they have sunk into this is astonishing and the only other game company that we know this kind of quality from is rockstar games. h3immersionh3 it's always so much detail where you wouldn't normally expect a game to have it, which makes it such a rich experience. the way the characters reload and handle guns, how guns are dismantled on a workbench, how tense dialogue becomes during fights. the entire game is acted by absolute professionals. lots of minor things all add up and come together to really pull you in deep. the melee fights are so messy that they sure seem very real, because there is always that random factor of taking an unexpected hit or missing a swing, symbolizing how chaotic and frantic a real life fight to the death would be. the death scenes are also very disturbing, because they made no compromise on how unforgivingly vicious reality can be. h3 the graphics  sceneryh3 the visuals are incredible in this new version and look pretty good even on lower settings. it feels very scenic with these huge locations and how the backgrounds are woven into the scenes make this single pathway game feel like an open world game for a lot of it. the maps are constructed in a way that there is always at least 2, if not 34 ways to advance, basically never giving you the feeling you're just channeled through the experience on rails, even though it technically is a strict one way path game. h3the gameplay mechanicsh3 the gameplay itself is so fluent and polished. there is never a way that the characters move in a weird way. they have gone over this thousands of times to ensure that the way items are picked up look natural and every character move happens in a natural motion. the whole gameplay just rolls. it's so smooth. buand againub the only other game that i know that feels this polished and smooth is rdr2. and this game came out a good 5 years before red dead redemption 2. h3my expectations going into ith3 having only played the last of us part ii when it came out, i was going into part i with the expectation of it having to be like a simpler and downgraded experience in some ways, since it came out a decade prior to the sequel. bbut it actually wasn't at allb. this still very much feels like a fresh and new game and is absolutely in line with most of the gameplay from part ii. h3the performance can be very problematich3 i think the way it used my system for fps was quite optimized, but for me the game just didn't run stable for long periods of time. the game kept crashing on various occasions, making me play it in 20  30  45 minute increments sometimes. in the end i had to remove all my overclocks on cpu, gpu and ram to play this in 1 hour increments basically. essentially downgrading my performance from 1440p almost ultra settings in 60fps to 1080p high settings on 50fps. it was very annoying, because i could not figure out what exactly it was and all online threads about it were just as clueless. i could not fix it entirely, but it didn't keep me from enjoying and finishing the game. fortunately it does have a very good autosave feature and it does save fairly often and quickly. basically before and after every single cutscene and action that takes place. so at least i never really lost any progress. if i wasn't so crazy for this game, i would consider this an actual dealbreaker and i'm sure many people do. so only purchase with caution. i'm not sure how much of this is related to my hardware, because i've seen many posts from people with basically brand new systems having the exact same issues. i really hope part ii doesn't have these kinds of issues when it comes out. bujust for reference, this is my gearub b  cpub iintel i99900k 8core 3.6 ghzi b  gpub isapphire radeon rx vega 64 nitro 8gb  amd adrenaline edition 24.9.1 released 081924 i b  ramb ihyperx predator 64 gb ddr4 3600 mhz, later reduced to 2400mhz loli b  mainboardb igigabyte z390 desginarei"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-04,"h1a masterpiece with a few hiccupsh1 the last of us is an absolute gem that delivers a breathtaking experience from start to finish. heres what makes it stand out  stunning graphics  the level of detail in environments, lighting, and character models is simply topnotch. every scene feels alive and immersive.  satisfying gameplay  the shooting mechanics are tight and responsive, making every encounter feel intense. plus, melee combat is brutal and impactful. taking down enemies with powerful weapons, like a shotgun, is especially satisfying...the way bodies tear apart feels just as cool as slashing through foes in rdr2. ubisoft should take notes and learn to create proper effects like this. however, a couple of things slightly hold it back  fewer enemies than expected  i was expecting for days gonestyle massive hordes, but the enemy count felt lower than anticipated. while each encounter is intense, i wanted more zombies to fight.  shader compilation takes ages  the first launch and if there's any update felt like i was booting game on a floppy disk from the early '90s. seriously, it took forever and it's not a peasant's rig i9  rtx 4080  48gb ram."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-23,definitely a game that lives up to the hype from a story perspective. it is slower paced on the game play front since it encourages you to conserve resources like ammo but i had no problem doing that as the story was really well developed and flowed better if you focused on stealth. you can feel the growth of joel and ellie individually as well as their relationship over the course of the game and i think everybody needs to play it through at least once. i didn't have any issues performance wise so no complaints there as well.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-28,"the last of us is an amazing game on console however, on pc, it is a different story. my pc meets the requirements for the game to run. however, the last of us constantly crashes at the graveyard. i implemented the fixes that people suggested on online forms, but the game still crashes. my system runs a ryzen 7 3700x and an rx 6600, which should be more than enough for medium settings, but the game keeps crashing."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-13,very good game with rich story. sometimes too sad honestly. but real. excellent balance between action and exploring. very good graphics and animations. with my super notuptodate 531.79 nvidia driver for gtx 1660 ti i had stable 60 fps in fullhd for majority of time and majority of setting set automatically to moderate. game lead you through difficult situation giving you suggestions. its up to u will u use them. one thing hurt me  the price even though it is worth it. i bought it for 30 euros.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-15,one of the best games to ever be released in my opinion. it has beautiful scenery and amazing story as well as characters that you will fall in love with. can't wait for the pc release of part 2
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-30,"fantastic game now that it's patched up. runs flawlessly, story is really good and the updated graphics breathe new life in a game over a decade old."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-10,"initially having played the game back in 2020 on my ps4, this pc version also didn't disappoint me at all. in short the game is just fascinating and i can highly recommend playing it. if you're into games with a postapocalyptic setting that can captivate by its plot and emotional depth, this one is one of best in its genre if not the best one. the world has been wiped out by the cordyceps fungus and now using different gameplay mechanics stealth, exploration, fighting off infected and noninfected enemies, crafting tools, collecting limited supplies for them, upgrading weapons you follow the bond that forms between main characters throughout their journey. i'd also like to emphasize separately the ai support  ellie actively assisted me in combat and saved me from killing a few times. the left behind dlc that focuses on ellies backstory how she was bitten and how she saved joel is a must play after the main story as this expansion complements it. i also loved the soundtrack primarily guitar melodies and even added a few songs to my yt music that i particularly liked. i'd recommend playing on higher difficulty and without achievement hunting for the first time. then, if you're into it, you can easily obtain 100 using chapter selection feature although collectibles can take you some time. by the way, there's no multiplayer mode and difficultyrelated achievements here comparing it with the ps4 version of the game, which makes the achievement hunting process a lot easier."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,"honest review  the only review u need to read. final toughts and conclusion down below ! all these improvements  permadeath, dualsense, and most of all, the graphical upgrades, come at a significant cost. pc porting didn't go well sadly. this has and always will be my favourtite playstation title. but this port to pc has been done poorly.  visuals are outstanding in this game, i was amazed how good this game looks, and playing in such visual appealing world was a experience on its own. shadows, light shafts and reflections are some of the best i've seen.  sound in this game is one of the best and worst at times features in this game. sound is immersive as it can be. sometimes happened 2 times in my playthrough sound will start to stutter for some reason, making the game very less enjoyable, forcing either a restart or reload. plenty of people have encountered this problem and still hasn't been fixed. not persistant, and easy to work around but still annoying.  gameplay and story is where this game shines the most. the game is a cinematic experience that could make a rock emotional, offering newcomers and seasoned zombifiers alike the chance to experience that jawdropping, heartpounding feeling.  multiplayer does not exist in pc or ps5 version of the game which is sad. for those who did play it, they know that this is a sure miss. thumbs down  optimization ... oooh boy... well, the game launched in a broken state, with bugs and tons of performance issues that made it unplayable on anything but the highestend systems. if your pc has highend components inside then you are good to go.  conclusion  this is an award winning game after all, and that does say a lot. game is definitely worth ur time, but not your money, it is a masterpiece nonetheless. it is poorly optimized and u sure will need a highend pc to ''muscle it out'' and enjoy this masterpiece. i will recommend this game to anybody, but not at this price range, wait for the game to go on sale and buy it then. must play, sure do recommend !  note to myself  it is nice to point out some good news, and that is that iron galaxy studio won't be doing the pc port for the last of us part 2, which is nice... since they did such a poor job with this one. the last of us part 2 will be ported by a studio called nixxes software, who have been praised for their work on previous ports of former playstation exclusives. so, does nixxes' latest project work as well as pc gamers expect? the short answer is yes. so that's one more reason to be hyped for the game."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,"to answer the question of recommending this game. maybe, leaning more to no unless you are patient. i want to emphasize by saying i only have one system that has a 13700f cpu and a 7900xt gpu and 1440p120fps monitor. the biggest reason i did not return this game after a short play session is because of the story, the world, and the beautiful environments you explore, solid game just for that. the issues. one thing i hate in games is when you are completely engaged with the story and the world then suddenly yanked away because of having to fight the game engine or the controls instead of focusing on shooting the clicker charging at you like a linebacker in the super bowl. the list of issues i had during the combat sections of my play through made the game very frustrating. sloppy controls i am not sure if this is the norm but i never had a game that had overly sensitive yet mushy controls. i understand that joelellie are not soldiers but this was bad. in third person shooters i have played i never had the aim down sights get more sensitive than when you have your gun down and are exploring. i had to use the precision button that reduces sensitivity on my mouse to actually aim at anything. i did not look at the settings to see if there is something to change but out of the box i don't see how this is right. wonky bullet magnatizm i am not sure how this is a thing in a game that was released in 2023 or even 2014 for that matter. there were multiple instances where i would be aimed fully at a target and fire only to see another enemy say 5 feet away take damage. in a game like the last of us missing your target can be the difference between living and dying. being punished because the game decided to send your bullet somewhere else is not a test of a players skill but more of what feels like rng. the game decided you needed to die so you die. canceling animations multiple times when i was attempting to melee an enemy have it be with a wood board or a pipe i would see the animation cancel leading to a death reload checkpoint or taking damage because the game decided to end joel's animation before dealing damage. this isnt the end of the world when fighting the enemy factions but the infected you miss you pretty much can expect to be reloading a checkpoint because you died. game engine stabilization i saw on multiple occasions where the textures were not loading correctly as well as crazy frame dips. i am not looking for performance to be in the 100s of fps but the frame dips would go as low as 70fps or worse at times. at the best time i would get a 120fps where i lock my frame rate. this is coming from having played indiana jones and the great circle that held a solid frame rate of 93ish fps through the whole game. this is with having ray tracing forced on, which the amd gpus do not excel at. i fail to understand how this game which is a remaster of a game made in 2014 has such bad gpu performance. i do understand this could be a mix of the hardware i have. i do not have an nvidia gpu to see if the performance changes but at the same time why should i be punished for buying a 7900xt? a lot of this reminds me of an overloaded game engine. i am not a game developer so i obviously do not know what was changed with the engine to support the new textures and resolutions but it just feels the engine cannot handle the higher resolutions and or textures. i will play around with settings to see if this is the issue. glitches and crashes thankfully i never had a game crash and the small amount of glitches were at times humorous. one instance joel was rushing through a door at the same time ellie was. ellie stopped moving but phased through the door and started floating up the door just to reset back on the ground where she was suppose to be. glitches like this are humorous to me. on the other hand though there were a few instances where i was fighting and got killed because an enemy shot me through a wall or a piece of geometry. conclusion i understand it is way too high of an expectation for any game to be perfect. at 60 dollars at the time that i purchased this i would have expected the combat to be a lot more polished than it is. i did try to keep in my mind that maybe naughty dog were trying to make the combat the way it was to show that joel is an older guy and not a hardened soldier but to have bullets not land in the target redicule and melee animations cancel makes combat frustrating. i do get that this is more of a stealth game first and combat second. there are times that the game makes you have to go out of stealth and that is where the game play would fall apart for me."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-14,"this game is as good as everybody says it is. simple as that. the attention to detail in every aspect of the game is phenomenal, be it the amazing story or the superb voice acting, the beautiful graphics, the gameplay that keeps you on your toes, everything really. buy it at any price, it is worth it, the experience is unforgetable. one of my top 5 of all time."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-30,"this game had a rough launch on pc but most if not all of the issues had been patched. as of december, 2024 the game is running flawlessly on windows 11. important notes if possible, get a playstation 5 dual sense controller for this game, the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback added so much to the overall experience. only works with usbc to usbc wired connection, will not work with usb 2.0 to usbc or bluetooth connection. also remember to disable steam input in game. there's tons of useful accessibility options within the game, anything from helping disabled gamer or options to make the game easier for people who aren't familiar with action games. it's so nice to see these kind of options ingame. tons of pc specific graphical and control options to fully customise your experience on the pc which is so nice to see. one of the best game ever made and as of right now, this steam version is the definitive version to experience this masterpiece. highly recommended!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-24,"a gorgeous and wellhoned remake of one of the biggest boppers in the playstation pantheon, the last of us part i is the best way to play  or replay  naughty dogs esteemed survival classic. the striking improvements it makes to its completely rebuilt world are complemented by the subtle refinements of its characters performances, and while it isnt retrofitted with every one of the sequels best changes, the upgrades to movement and ai make a welcome difference in an already outstanding game. its harder to argue it was an entirely crucial remake, though, considering 2014s the last of us remastered still stands head and shoulders above nearly all of its storydriven, actionadventure peers to this day."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-02,really enjoyed this. the story was well presented with good characters. a different take on the zombie apocalypse. can't wait for part 2 to hit pc.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-27,works out of the box on ubuntu 24.04 with a nvidia graphics card. amazing game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-21,"funny! when a game is crafted with such love and care as this, runs well on pc as this, has great pacing, story, looks, characters as this, it brings in money and dosen't fail. other studios and developers must learn that nearly after a decade, this game still holds up and has sales. we have so much trash games now, i'm just glad that sony is bringing this to pc."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,i mean its the last of us. it runs great too
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,"1010 replayed recently and still one of the best games i've played, i managed to avoid spoilers about part ii until this day. very excited to play the sequel blind when it's out."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,this game is a masterpiece the gameplay so good the story and characters amazing i cant wait for part 2
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,this game is a masterpiece. story is amazing . graphics is visually stunning . characters are awesome. its one of my best games right now
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,"having played the game for the first time, i finally understand why its universally acclaimed. the story and gameplay are incredible, and the remakes graphics are some of the best ive ever seen. an epic experience from the start of the base game to the end of the dlc."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,"it begins slowly, but suddenly, it catches you. the last of us is an unforgettable experience, drawing players into a gripping, emotional journey with stunning visuals and a powerful narrative. like many zombie stories, the last of us is unflinchingly brutal. but what sets it apart is how it forces players to reckon with that brutality. violence in the last of us isnt meant to be fun. unlike halo infinite or fortnite, where combat is a matter of racking up kills, every shot in the last of us carries weight. ammunition is scarce, and each pull of the trigger is a decision. the act of killing isnt just mechanicalits visceral, desperate, and sometimes deeply regrettable. yet, for all its cynicism, the last of us is also a deeply tender game. the evolving relationship between its two protagonists is at the heart of the experience, growing subtly over time. each new setting challenges them in different ways, breaking them down and building them back up. what begins as an uneasy partnership transforms into something akin to a fatherdaughter bondone that is both hardearned and heartbreaking. the game's world is breathtaking, filled with hauntingly beautiful landscapes that blend nature and destruction. from abandoned cities overtaken by greenery to snowcovered wastelands, every environment is meticulously crafted, enhancing the sense of immersion. the lighting, character animations, and voice acting all contribute to making the game feel remarkably lifelike. nowhere is this balance of brutality and beauty more evident than in one of the games most iconic moments the giraffe scene. after hours of tension and horror, ellie stumbles upon something unexpecteda small herd of giraffes roaming freely in a flooded city, nature reclaiming what humanity lost. its a quiet, breathtaking reprieve from the games unrelenting bleakness, a reminder that there is still beauty in this broken world. experiencing the last of us years after its release allows for a fresh perspective. while it is undoubtedly a product of its time, it has aged remarkably well. its emotional core remains as powerful as ever, making it more than just a milestone in gaming historyits a game that, even years later, can still leave you breathless, broken, and in awe."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,"this game was a beautiful experience. it evoked many emotions in me in a way that almost no other game has done before. from the very first 15 minutes of the game, making me cry, to the very end of the game, leaving me speechless. this was a perfectly crafted story 1010."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-06,"this is a breathtaking game full of heart, action, and drama. the solid storyline and spirited characters raise it to the next level and make it a game that i won't soon forget."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-28,"one of my favorite games ever. i've loved this game for so, so long and only just got around to playing it mostly cause the only platform i play on is pc. the story is amazing, the characters are so well written and complex, the scenery and visuals are breathtaking, and the music is just so emotionally packed throughout the entire game. the actual gameplay itself is super fun and satisfying. wonderful, deeply nostalgic and deeply loved game. highly recommend."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,"the last of us is not just another zombie game. its a beautiful story about loss and what it takes to survive and to protect the ones you love. the beautiful world shows how nature takes over during an apocalypse. everything looks so realistic, the face expressions, you can clearly see the emotions in the characters faces, the voice acting, the nature and buildings but also the combat. there are limited resources you find during the game, like ammo and health, which makes you think before acting. you can choose to play the game aggressively with guns and melee combat or choose for stealth. the game has a lot of collectible you can collect. each collectible tells you a story which adds more realism in the world of the game. the left behind dlc is also included which i think was a beautiful add on to ellies story before the events of the main game. also the music alone is just so beautiful. i listen to the music regularly and i think i can say its the best soundtrack i have ever heard. i played the game on my steam deck and it played pretty good. nothing really to complain. i do have to say that it looks better on ps5 and the haptic feedback plus adaptive triggers was something i missed during my play through on the steam deck the last of us is definitely the best game i have ever played and i think its a must play for every gamer."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,great thirdperson cinematic action story game from the creators of the uncharted series. i finished it entirely on a steam deck lcd with the frame rate locked to 30fps and otherwise default graphics settings.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-12,"you know you've found something special when you feel empty as you watch the credits burst onto your screen, sit in your chair for minutes silently, embracing the void that just filled your heart and soul. if someone was to ask me now i well, is that everything you hoped for? i after playing the last of us part i, i can say without a doubt b yes. b"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-20,this game is a masterpiece. it was an amazing experience. it looks phenomenal and had me in tears time and time again. do not miss this work of art!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-19,"great game, solid story, tv show adaptation was great too!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-18,"this is more than just a game. this is an unforgettable experience from start to finish. when i first saw the e3 2012 demo, i was immediately captivated by how real the ingame mechanics looked. a year later, i bought the limited edition version on ps3 and was once again blown away by the prologue and how it really felt like you were participating in an epic film. i was able to beat it in a couple of days because i just couldn't put it down. it was so good. when the remastered edition came out on ps4, i got it once again and beat it a few times. finally, when the remake was announced on pc, i knew i had to get it again because that's how much i love this game. i thought the game was already stunning on ps3, but the improved graphics for the remake makes it hard to go back to the original. every square inch of the remake is so beautiful. the artists did such an amazing job. as far as the controls go, i was delighted to see that it has ps5 dualsense support, which along with the upgraded visuals, makes the revisit feel fresh and exciting again. there is tons of replay value in the combat system. you can strategize every encounter by playing it stealthily or engaging in a firefight. you can really feel the power the impact with every gun, and taking down enemies feels very satisfying. melee combat feels intense, and makes you feel like you're in a life or death situation each time. as far as the characters go, i felt very connected with them, and there were moments when i teared up, especially during the prologue. the actors did an amazing job of making the characters come to life. overall, this is without a doubt one of the absolute greatest games i've ever played."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-09,"played the game when it first came out on ps3 and became my favourite game after the first playthrough. the story is amazing, the voice acting is fantastic and the art style is stunning. this being a remaster the graphics are of course beautiful. the gameplay is fun and you can approach fights in different ways so you dont just have to stand still and shoot. even though i have consumed a lot of media about the last of us since that first playthrough i have to admit that i have actually not played it since then, so when it was on sale on steam i knew what i had to do. and luckily for me i still love it to bits. i had some small stutteringrendering problems while playing and some minor annoyance with the ai movement from ellie and various others during the story. the stuttering issues might have been from some settings i had wrong, but they were never big enough for me to try and fix them. the ai issues while a bit annoying at times it never made it so i got stuck or had to restart something. during all my play time i never had any crashes or problems that made it so i had to restart missions or the game itself, so they ported it very well. i highly recommend buying and playing the last of us, especially if its on sale. almost 12 years after release its still my favourite game of all time story game atleast and one of the greatest stories i have seen. 1010"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-08,"amazing game, but i can only get it to run occasionally using an rtx 3050 card. continually crashes when trying to load a save and i haven't yet found a perfect solution."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-07,amazing story i bought a ps4 back in the day just to play this game finished the game and then sold the ps4 right afterwards.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-07,"the last of us is an amazing game. absolute cinema. it's amazing. the storyline is so well thought out. this is my 3,333th time playing the game. beautiful. never gets old."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-06,"i played this on ps3 some 10 years ago and it completely blew my mind! easily top 3 single player adventure games i've played ever, and the remastered pc version does not disappoint. i also watched the hbo series while playing through the game for full immersion. this is a must play, i cannot recommend it enough."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-06,"the last of us! joel and ellie's story is indeed emotional and beautifully crafted, and the game's combination of storytelling, action, and combat is masterful. definitely a 1010. waiting for part 2 this year."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-01,playing the game first time after you have seen the tv show already is not interesting that is what i thought before i have started. but shortly after i realized i was wrong and as a result it was amazing journey! the game with dlc is absolutely fantastic!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-31,"good graphics, good gameplay, good story. i am happy and scared when i play."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-30,"absolutely incredible game. story, gameplay, mechanics, animations, graphics  everything is just exceptional. rdr2 quality!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-29,"this was my first time playing last of us from start to finish as a casual gamer. a few glitches here and there, and i wouldn't say that the pc is 100 optimised, but overall it performed well on my system. the game mechanics overall do show their age ie stealth and combat etc, as do other aspects. ultimately, you can tell this is a remaster of an older game. i found the levels to a bit repetitive, it took a few chapters for the story to really start resonating with me, and drive me to continue with the play through  the first few chapters were a bit of a slog for me. overall, however, though it took a while, the story is really where this game shines. had a fun time playing, plenty of difficulty settings to play with in the menus. but i just stuck to normal  ie balanced for resources, combat etc. took somewhere between 1215 hours to complete with moderate exploring."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-26,"i never thought that making ellie to joke could be so difficult. well in such circumstances.. i feel you girl at the silver lake arc i felt all strength of thriller in genre of this game, that was so damn good the gameplay sometimes was boring but despite everything, the last of us part 1 is awesome and took a special place in my heart. the most important things i need to say mcs are kittens and bill will live forever the end"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,story 810. the gameplay is boring u are waddling around in a crouch like a goose or spend plenty of time for searching ammo.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-24,"a game unlike anything i have ever played story from the mere minutes you play this game you will be hooked, there is something so beautiful about the opening. joel is one of the bestwritten characters you will ever play as, as for ellie it is the same thing. the story grabs you and throws you things that a storybased game has never done before. from meeting new people to making your way around clickers you are hooked from the mere minutes you play. i have never played a game that has had me feeling every emotion i could feel within just under 7 hours of gameplay. aside from rdr2 from the scenery, the dialogue in this game is truly amazing in the way it portrays itself even after 12 years after its release. joel once a father takes the role of caring for ellie within the story, showing his hardships, and how he overcomes them as a character overall. gameplay from holding your weapon and moving around the map and coming up with different ways to attack is such an amazing thing and the way that tlou does it. always feels like you are in the game yourself. so many different ways to go around and be strategic and make sure that what you do, you think about it methodically. being able to play on either controller or mk is an amazing thing too. feeling the smoothness when looking at pois to capture that movie feel is great, too then switching to mouse and keyboard and being fast and a dealy aim really is a great feeling. replayability to keep it short, if you love the game you can always go back and play it again and feel the rushes of when you are going through certain missions. people who play it once might not find much else out of it aside from the extra game mode they offer with pc. a very cool touch added by the developers too is all the extras within the creation of the game, to see all the sketches and different ways they made the zombies to the characters and how they are drawn out and shown shows the care and time within the game and i love it. a very neat touch  audio the audio within this game is something i have never heard of. the soundtrack is the best out of any game i have played. super rustic guitar with the winds and other noises put me into the game unlike anything else i have ever played. gunshots and moving sounds are super crisp to the ears, branches cracking under you too your reload sounds are just too good. final thoughts story mode 1010 gameplay 910 replayability 8.510 audio 1010 it truly is a masterpiece in my eyes and i would strongly recommend this game to any hardcore gamer to the casual player. thank you naughty dog for putting this game out 3"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"a classic game of 2013 remake you enter a post apocalyptic world which is too damn true if ever happened.... this game take things seriously in every creative way and slaps you with a story which such a quality that it is yet to be replicated. the intro itself sets the tone, the enemy type and subtle mechanics. game aspects which i loved  stealth  gameplay  story  characters  level design  sound design  although it had a lot of bugs at launch, all are fixed, it runs good even in my old laptop. 1010"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,lovely base game and the dlc is a great bonus!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"i will always recommend this game just based on the story, its one of my favourite games of all time and the game itself is just a beautiful masterpiece. on top of that it the game is absolutely gorgeous on pc. that being said i have been having a major problem with random stuttering, so if you plan on purchasing this be aware that this might be a problem as its been around since day one from what i've seen. its not enough to give a do not recommend but people should still be aware of it before purchasing."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-07,"one of the best story driven games ive ever played. was hooked within the first 5 mins of the intro, the story is so rich and full of beautiful moments between the two main characters. the way they show how their relationship builds throughout the game makes you not want to put it down. i strongly recommend if your looking for a great single player game that you can replay. you wont regret it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-25,"one of the best games i have ever played. the story is absolutely incredible and engages you from start to finish. despite how bleak the world of the game is, ellie is a light in the darkness. the way joel gradually opens up to ellie throughout the story feels so authentic and human and overall creates a very emotional narrative. the final sequence with joel is a perfect conclusion to part 1, and asks the player to question whether personal bonds and love should be prioritized over the potential sacrifice of one for the many. this game has stuck with me long after the credits rolled. the story, along with the visceral gameplay, deep immersion, and gorgeous music to compliment the often lonely atmosphere of the game makes for one of the best singleplayer experiences i have played. 1010."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-23,"no importa quantas vezes eu experiencie esse jogo, sempre ser a mesma jornada emocional"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-14,"definitely the worst version on the game, terrible optimization, graphical glitches, sometimes the ai bugs out in amazing incredible ways. one time tess pushed me in front of a clicker while it was screaching to find us and at bill's mausoleum one of the infected levitated over a wall and teleported in front of my brick. while perpetually wet joel glitch has been fixed often hair textures would turn into ps1 2d bushes specially on henry and sam. i 100 bc thats why i bought it and enjoy the quality on life improvements and story. but i cannot in all honesty recommend it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-23,"the quality of the graphics, the playability, the attention to detail, and the total involvement with the characters in a complex story line."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-02,"the story this game takes you on is unmatched, brutal and full of heart. if you like narrative driven, tense stealth and high action single player games this is a must play. ran 60fps 1080p on high settings on an rtx4060 through the whole game. could use some polish for sure for lower end hardware since the game originally ran on a ps4 or even a ps3 for the non graphically upgraded game, but even on lower settings the beauty of this game is barely missed. plenty of replayability with ng, game modifiers like mirror world a la oot master quest, a speedrun mode and dev commentaries as you play the game which i personally love to enjoy and add fresh air to a new playthrough."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-17,"never been a big story video game player... in fact, in all my life i've played one story narrative tomb raider and thought it was pretty good. but ever since i could remember when i first heard how epic and amazing this game was, i always wanted to play it. now that i had a solid laptop to run it on well... i bought it during the spring sale and downloaded it. it took me 3 days in the span of 15 hours to finish this game with most of the grind happening on my 2nd day with a whooping 8 hour in one sitting, and i came out absolutely loving the game. it is one of the best horror games i've played and it beats the tomb raider in the adventure department also. it has such a strong storyline, deep character growth, and some exciting gameplay! strongly recommend to play... can't wait for part 2 of the last of us to drop on steam early this april!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-02,"one of the best examples of perfect storytelling in a video game. not once during my playthough did it get boring, wonderfully paced game. the gameplay masterfully blends stealth, action, and exploration, along with some stunning visuals. it was a pleasure replaying this gem all these years later on pc."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-22,a bit shot but a masterpiece. great storyline. get it on sale!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-22,its crazy thinking about how beautiful i thought this game looked back in 2013 now with part 1 this game looks gorgeous with some parts of the game looking so damn pretty and that's just the graphics the story is even better and i am man enough to say this is my 3rd time playing this game and i still cry like a little bch for certain parts. i initially tried playing this game on release and was pissed at how bad it ran and now i am glad to say they fixed whatever the hell was wrong with this game. now to wait for part 2 hopefully its good i

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-11,"wrote a review a while ago when this game was still unplayable. it used to have horrible problems with loading shaders, and would run at 12 fps on a moderately powerful laptop. devs put their nose to the grindstone though and fixed the issues. the quality of the story in this game has never been questioned, and still remains one of the best games of all time, and i'm glad it got ported over to pc. still worth it's weight in gold all these years later. buy it, you wont regret it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-01,one of my favorite games of all time. looks and plays amazing with everything set to max on 4070 super.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-01,"just finished the game, and its incredible! the story telling, the characters, the music. this game takes you on such an adventure. i laughed, i cried, i was scared. this has been one of the best cinematic games ive played in a long time. 1010 ."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-27,"one of the greatest gaming experiences the world has to offer. the best storytelling, worldbuilding, characters, gameplay, thrill factor, difficulty, customization, and meaningfull heartfelt emotions i have ever seen in any game, film, series, or other media. i cannot recommend this enough. do yourself a favor and play the last of us part 1."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,"love love love zombies!!! such an awesome concept and the world building was soooo good. had some trouble with graphics and stuff starting out and the game def crashed sometimes but it was made for console, so no biggy really. everything was a pretty easy fix and the game ran pretty good after a little tweaking! fantastic game, loved it loved it loved it! o"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-26,"definitely a really masterpiece... the characters, environment, the breathtaking moments, stealth, run times... what a game... willing to play the part ii asap."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-12,"damn, sony's exclusives are good. can't wait for the second part."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-09,"the game is absolutely phenomenal. from the very first minute, you know that you're playing something truly special. the story is captivating, i enjoyed it very much. not only because of the good writing, but also because the voice actors did a great job, and the cut scenes are directed really well. gameplaywise, it's a fun and challenging stealth game, but it's not monotonous  there is plenty of action too. visually, the last of us is stunning. they really put a lot of effort into making this world cozy and vibrant. i know it sounds strange for a postapocalypse involving zombies, but look at these beautiful scenes. even abandoned cities are covered with green, vivid grass! you can see that a lot of talented people put a tremendous amount of effort into this game. it's definitely one of my favorite games from now on. i see that a lot of my friends have it on their wishlists, and i strongly recommend getting it! even though the hbo show spoiled some key story points for me, it was still a pleasure. the only complaint i have is that photo mode doesn't allow you to detach the camera from your character. p.s. special thanks to sony, who refuse to acknowledge that estonia exists and sell their new games, including the last of us part ii, here"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-01,"the last of us part 1 had me straight up emotional, no lie. its all about joel and ellie trying to survive in a world thats completely messed up, with infected zombies and people who are somehow worse. the gameplay slaps ngl sneaking through, crafting items, and those intense fights had me stressed but hooked. the graphics are top tier, and the emotional moments? they just hit different. once you finish the main story, you have to check out left behind. it dives into ellies backstory with her bestie, how she got bitten, and how she saved joel. it ties everything together and hits just as hard. if youre into games that give you all the feels while keeping the action intense, this ones a total must play."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-28,"this game didnt become one of my favorite games, but its still a aaa title. ive been waiting for this game to come to pc ever since it was released on ps. but now that i have a ps5, im playing the last of us part 2."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-09,this is the worst port i've ever seen. i legitimately cannot get through even the beginning of the game using either a controller or keyboard and i don't understand how this was released
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-27,performance isnt too great but this game is an epic journey and my favorite story game ever
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,amazing story is good and animations are smooth killing feels great and looting is fun
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,"damn, this was my second time playing since 2013, still got me fucked up. please don't rely on the show to experience this story. it's one of the better stories out there with zombies and you get to experience it firsthand which is admittedly pretty damn terrifying at parts. its a little samey same throughout, but its worth getting through just to experience part 2 which refines the best aspects of this game and is coming at the end of the month. sad to see there was no multiplayer in this version because the crafting element carried over into a pvp deathmatch worked on so many levels, and probably had my most fun moments in multiplayer gaming ngl. naughty dog, it's not too touchy a topic anymore you can bring it back, i swear."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-16,"my score 9.510 without a doubt, this game has successfully revisited the horror survival genre. a different resident evil if you will. one with great depth, story telling and atmosphere. it has established itself to be one of the best games in that field, if not one of the best modern games that combines a great gaming experience with solid well written story telling. i do like the game, at least part 1 a lot better than the tv series. positives  incredible atmosphere  amazing up to date graphics  amazing novel like quality writing  you get to kill other bad humans which adds a whole new factor and experience into the horror zombies genre  the game allows superb tactical depth you may go stealth and attack from behind. you can also knife zombies from behind  shooting has a more realistic touch  great finale  negatives  insufficient footsteps, or it might be my ears. especially human enemies feel like they are wearing rubber shoes  it packs a lot of content and world environment, however, it did feel a bit short   the finale was pretty solid. some parts felt rushed and unanswered. although the ending was generally good, like a movie ending, i felt a bit unsatisfied. maybe in my subconscious i expected a giant final boss or something i highly recommend this game, even if you are not familiar with survival horror or anything. it is like a great book or movie that you should not miss. i'm thankful for the game and i would have loved the pc port to come out sooner. happy to pay full price for high quality games, period."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-04,"game was outstanding didn't notice any of the game stability issues that early reviews cited music, story, and graphics were incredible, and difficulty throughout was challenging but fair played on hard difficulty dlc was fairly incredible with the caveat that one combat sequence felt insanely punishing but also had an evasion mechanic that was both horrifying and realistic i kinda looked away from the screen because it was really jarring i also played the game entirely with the lights shut off for max immersion, highly recommend only real complaints were the one combat sequence from dlc and the bow and arrow weapon which feels weirdly difficult to use  9.510"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,"if you were to launch this game at the same time you started reading this review, it would have crashed by now."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-31,"i don't play many of them and generally don't enjoy combatheavy games, but this game may be the one that changes all of that. i cannot recommend the last of us enough. i played this in the most easy mode possible, and even though i struggled at first, it felt very doable. you'll be fine if you arent used to these types of games like i am. for me, the story is the star of the show the writers did a beautiful job. i was entirely immersed in the world and the characters' stories. there is so much depth in everything, from the environment to the little notes left by those who have passed to the design of each character. i hate fighting, but to still go through probably 15 hours of combat i had to replay the bloater fights soooo many times and never get bored is a true feat. i have no complaints i love this game."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-23,ive wanted to play this game for years and it does not dissapoint! fantastic story and characters fun gameplay and good controls
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-23,great story and the gameplay is really fun.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-23,"storywise, i'm only at the beginning and i'm already mindblowned. b for amd gpus owners b don't bother with fsr3 fg, not only does it look awful but the choppy generated frames and latency really feel like a downgrade. i still get 7080fps on my rx 6800 though."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-23,"fun game to play. wish the weapons interactions were a bit simpler as moving from weapon to weapon and even applying first aid is awkward. i am enjoying it, just wish i had better  more effective weapons and much more ammo. go air force!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-23,nowhere in the story atm but amazing game. got into it because of the show.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-14,"the last of us truly lives up to its legendary reputation! as someone who never played the original ps3 game or the 2022 remake, i approached this experience with high expectations after hearing its endless praise. the story, world, and gameplay blend seamlessly. everything feels effortlessly realistic and just clicks. if i had to describe the gameplay in one sentence, it would be a linear red dead redemption 2, with incredible attention to detail in its animations, weighted movement, and thirdperson gunplay. although the videogame industrys current remake era often feels uninspiring, tlou part i looks, sounds, and plays phenomenally. every character feels authentic, and the world and its inhabitants behave believably. there were some nasty performance issues at launch, but the developers did a great job addressing them i never experienced crashes, and frame rates remained consistently smooth. if you plan to play it and go for 100 completion, i recommend starting on hard difficulty and replaying on grounded to collect any missed items. the game recommends using a controller, but mouse and keyboard support worked fantastically without requiring any key rebinding."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-15,"i absolutely love tlou, but the game just runs awful, even on the lowest settings."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i love this game, the story is amazing! the characters are very interesting and lovable, learning all their backstories and how it plays into the story is great and i find that the tie of their backstories links to the plot of the game very well. i haven't played too many fighting games yet, and i find that the combat system wasn't too hard to get used to there's a few different gun types some with closer range and others with more longdistanced range  you can upgrade them later ingame, melee weapons like, bats etc, you can throw bottles and bricks found around, and you can later craft different weapons such as the molotov bomb, learning about and how to fight the different types of infected has been quite fun so far  the differences in the abilities between the runners, clickers and bloaters is cool and makes the fights more interesting and fun to play! different sight, hearing capabilities and how the bloaters shoot the spore bombs etc  i just defeated the first encountered bloater!! highly recommend this game! d"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"amazing game, one of the best stories in a game and will always be a classic. highly recommended, not like the other horror surviver type games out there."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"the last of us part 1 is one of the best apocalypse games ever. the story of joel and ellie is unforgettable, filled with emotion and heart. the gameplay is intense, with great balance between action and stealth. the worldbuilding and atmosphere are gripping. if you love storydriven games, this is a mustplay."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,have 3 days trying to run the game to continue my gameplay... now i know the error message by memory and it haunts my dreams... have not been able to run the game a second time...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"there is nothing i can say here that hasn't been said before, but this is a masterpiece. i played it for the first time in 2025 before watching the series and it runs beautifully on pc. the level of detail that has gone into it and the sheer emotional pull you feel playing it is akin to that of games like rdr2. i will most definitely be doing another play through and will buy the second game when its out on pc as well."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,1010. such a goated game. peak storytelling.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"what a beautiful game. i'm a latecomer, having been excited to play the game after watching season 1, but also hesitant to pay 60 bucks for a 12 year old game. thank you season 2 and a 50 sale! i've had very few absolutely beautiful and memorable game experiences in the last 1520 years, especially with alevel games, who often sacrifice voiceacting and story for pretty visuals. last of us is gorgeous, with a topnotch story and voiceacting and cinematography that's gradea. the show was wonderful, the game is better. the closest visceral and rewarding video game storyexperience i've had in recent years was probably mad max, but this was fantastic. my only complaint is that there's a bit of a weird translation between controller and mouse and keyboard. the game was made for console, so the pc port i played has a little bit of wonkiness, especially when it comes to switching around quickchange weapon slots. otherwise...man. what a game. play it on hard. you'll die. a lot. but, beating each painstakingly difficult step of joel and ellie's journey will be that much more rewarding."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i have played this game and beaten it, 4 times. 3 times in the past on ps4  ps4 pro  again just now on pc. i'm not one to replay games typically, ever. if you've seen the show and are thinking about playing, the answer is yes. such an amazing story  awesome game play. i just prepurchased the last of us part ii remastered for pc and that is another thing i typically don't do, anymore, prepurchase. 1010 just hurry up and play."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,"another playstation classic imported to pc. love this game, reminds me of the survival horror of resident evil and the feel of an uncharted game. definately worth playing."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,very beatiful game good storytelling and visuals and gameplay voice lines down to to the cutscenes and detail
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,"don't normally leave reviews but i haven't been able to put this game down. don't know how far i am into the story but i hope i have a long way to go, i don't want this to end. performance has been perfect for me. not a single issue."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,this game was one hell of a masterpiece! everything about this game was amazing i would totally recommend this to anyone and everyone!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,"i have only like 4 hours so far in this game but between the story, the gameplay and everything is absolutely amazing and would recommend 100.  love"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,"moving story, runs well"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,"i literally enjoyed every minute of this game  except when i was fighting 2 bloaters cuz i was suffering 1010 , you must play this game"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"i can't believe how good this game looks. i don't know how naughty dog makes their animations so fluid. the game runs like a dream and the superb voice acting and story make the whole world so captivating and immersive. i highly recommend this, if your computer can handle it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"one of the greatest video game stories of all time. gameplay is enjoyable, but dated. the pc version isn't different enough from the console version that i'd recommend buying both."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"story is great, game play is well done and the environment is amazing"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,its so good now no more long loading and my pc aint that good buy i can run quite smooth
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"i cannot believe how good this game is. i have not spotted a single bug through the whole thing, contrary to every other remaster i've played. the visuals are simply perfect, the trailers show the actual graphics of the game which i just.. wow. the world is well built and thought through, everything makes sense. lore is great as part of that and goes very deep. but the best thing by far is the character building. joel is simply a greatly designed character with a lot of good and a lot of bad. even minor characters only seen during a single section are sometimes given context through logs scattered around and details in the environment. combat system is well made, stealth also. bashing skulls in with bricks is very engaging gameplay. i have laughed and cried a little too much probably and felt genuine fear for the lives of the characters and i have to recommend this game to everyone i know. only complaint i have is that the price tag is a bit high so get it on sale if you're not sure, but if i knew what kind of experience this game would be beforehand i would've happily payed the full price. i'm currently feeling the emptiness i usually feel after finishing a great game, only a hundred times stronger than normally. i'll probably pay full price for part 2 when it releases on steam as well."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,fixed and optimized incredibly good in comparsion with initial afterrelease state.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,love the story so much and the accessibility options are wonderful!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,can shoot crazy people and stab people with guns very fun
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"from the moment i embarked on my journey through the last of us part i on steam, i found myself utterly enraptured by its breathtakingly immersive world, emotionally resonant storytelling, and profoundly nuanced characters. this was not merely a gameit was an odyssey, a masterwork of interactive artistry that transcended the boundaries of conventional entertainment and delivered an experience that felt deeply personal, evocative, and hauntingly beautiful. every moment within its postapocalyptic landscape felt meticulously crafted, weaving a tapestry of heartwrenching despair, fleeting hope, and the unbreakable human spirit. as i launched the game for the first time, the sheer fidelity of the graphical overhaul left me awestruck. the environment, rich with intricate details and stunningly realistic lighting, transported me into a world ravaged by time and tragedy. dilapidated buildings stood as silent sentinels of a civilization long forsaken, their crumbling facades overgrown with verdant ivy, as if nature itself had reclaimed dominion over mankinds ruins. the way sunlight filtered through shattered windows, casting fractured beams upon dustladen furniture, lent an eerie yet strangely serene atmosphere to the desolate streets. every texture, from the grimestreaked walls to the glistening rainsoaked pavement, was rendered with such painstaking precision that i often found myself pausing simply to admire the environmental storytelling. but beyond the sheer technical prowess, what captivated me most was the harrowing narrative and the deep emotional bond between joel and ellie. their journey was not merely a trek through hostile territory but a profound exploration of love, loss, and the enduring resilience of the human spirit. from the gutwrenching prologue that shattered my heart within mere minutes to the poignant, contemplative moments scattered throughout their perilous adventure, every narrative beat struck with unerring precision. the writing was sublime, effortlessly oscillating between heartpounding intensity and quiet, introspective melancholy. it was a tale that demanded to be felt as much as it was to be experienced. the voice acting and motion capture performances elevated the storytelling to an unprecedented echelon of authenticity. troy bakers portrayal of joel imbued the character with a grizzled weariness, a soul burdened by past traumas yet unwilling to relinquish the fragile hope he found in ellie. ashley johnsons ellie was equally mesmerizingan embodiment of youthful defiance and vulnerability that made her all the more compelling. their chemistry was palpable, their dialogue brimming with genuine emotion, and their interactions carried a weight that few games have ever achieved. each conversation, whether a lighthearted exchange or a heartrending confrontation, felt utterly organic, making their evolving relationship feel profoundly real. beyond the narrative, the last of us part i excelled in its meticulously refined gameplay. the combat was brutal, visceral, and unapologetically unforgiving, perfectly complementing the games themes of survival and desperation. every encounter with hostile foes, whether human adversaries or the grotesquely terrifying infected, was a tense battle of wits and resourcefulness. ammunition was scarce, forcing me to approach each skirmish with calculated caution. the weightiness of every bullet fired, every melee strike landed, reinforced the sheer desperation of survival in a world devoid of mercy. stealth played a pivotal role, and i found myself holding my breath as i crept through decrepit buildings, evading clickers with their ghastly echolocation clicks reverberating through the silence. the ai was impressively adaptiveenemies communicated, flanked, and reacted with an intelligence that made every encounter unpredictable and exhilarating. the games crafting system was an elegant touch, seamlessly integrating resource management into the gameplay loop. the decision to fashion a molotov cocktail versus a medkit often became a nervewracking dilemma, further intensifying the stakes of each encounter. the games score, composed by the brilliant gustavo santaolalla, was nothing short of a masterpiece. the melancholic strumming of his guitar underscored every moment with an aching poignancy that resonated deep within my soul. the music was never obtrusive but rather a subtle, lingering presencean elegy for the lost world and a testament to the raw, unfiltered emotions that permeated the journey. it was in the quiet moments, as joel and ellie sat by a dwindling campfire or gazed upon a breathtaking vista of nature reclaiming the earth, that the score truly shone, weaving an auditory spell that left an indelible mark upon my heart. moreover, the accessibility options in this iteration of the last of us part i were exemplary, making it one of the most inclusive gaming experiences i have ever encountered. the developers' commitment to ensuring that players of all abilities could experience the narrative masterpiece was commendable, further cementing the games place as a paragon of modern gaming design. yet, amid the games bleak and unforgiving world, there were moments of unparalleled beautysmall, tender gestures that reminded me of the resilience of humanity. whether it was ellies innocent fascination with comic books, a fleeting moment of levity shared between the duo, or the sight of giraffes meandering through an abandoned cityscape, these instances were imbued with a quiet, almost sacred significance. they were a reminder that even in the darkest times, hope flickers like a fragile ember, refusing to be extinguished. by the time i reached the games devastating yet poetic conclusion, i found myself emotionally drained yet deeply fulfilled. the moral ambiguity of joels final decision left me contemplative, my mind racing with the ethical ramifications of his actions. it was a rare and profound narrative that did not provide easy answers but instead invited introspection, leaving a lingering impact long after the credits rolled. the last of us part i on steam was not just a gameit was an experience that transcended its medium, a poignant exploration of humanity, love, and survival in a world bereft of mercy. every facet, from its masterful storytelling to its meticulously crafted gameplay, coalesced into an unforgettable journey that reaffirmed my belief in gaming as a powerful storytelling medium. it was a magnum opus, a work of art that etched itself into my soul, and one that i will cherish for years to come."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"9 hours straight and this game is immersive. it pulls you in. a lot of action, suspense, the story is great. i can see why they made a series about it. i'm hooked and can't wait to play the 2nd one! i'd highly recommend this game. i'm glad sony and steam partnered up cause i would have never bought a ps5 cause xbox is waaaaay better! lol! rage bait!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"this is the best game i've ever played. the story is phenomenal, the world is just so beautiful and has so much love and detailing put into it, you fall in love with the characters, and the sad moments will hit you like nothing else. the first death in the game literally made my stomach sick for half an hour and i nearly cried, that's how powerful this game is."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,very good ellie ponytail pchysics
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,"this game has been absolutely phenomenal so far! it's absolutely gorgeous, the designs are majestic, and the characters are really intriguing!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,"the greatest narrative single player game of all time is finally on pc. it's a decent port, but suffers from some odd graphical issues and sluggish performance compared to the uncharted 4 pc port from a couple years ago. i'm playing on a 7800x3d and a 4070 super, and i get average frames in the 70s and 80s at 1440p ultra. dlss has ghosting and other artifacts and fsr has too much input lag. i'm glad they ported it, but i'm disappointed by the lack of optimization."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,i mean what is there to say that hasn't been said already. its one of the greatest story games of all time and it looks better than ever on pc. i was worried at first because of the negative reviews ive seen here and online but these all seem to be due to the poor performance on launch that thankfully have been fixed. at least for me 1110 game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,"masterpiece of a game, completed around 56 playthroughs. highly recommend 9.510"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,still holds up. had a good time going back. weird that they took out the grounded achievementmultiplayer but otherwise a good remaster. glad it's not 70 bucks. one of my favorite games on the ps4 but upgraded to match part 2 visuals. hopefully naughty dog puts all their games on pc!

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,"the last of us part 1 isnt just a gameits an emotional journey. with its gripping story of survival and humanity, joel and ellies bond pulls you into a postapocalyptic world where every choice feels heavy. the breathtaking visuals and haunting score amplify its impact, making it unforgettable. its a masterpiece that reminds us why storytelling matters, even in the face of chaos."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,"it's been about a decade since i played the ps4 version, and this remaster looks insane. it was already good on old gen, but now the world just feels real. i feel extremely immersed and sometimes even unnerved from what's going on around me. goated characters, story and world. just make sure you have a beefy pc to run this. for me personally, this game loves to cook my cpu. luckily some new thermal paste made it less of an issue."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,amazing story line with captivating visuals. must play for every pro gamer!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,"after 10 years i finally get to relive the last of us, the deeply ingrained mechanics from the endless dying on the ps3 era jumped right into action as soon as i grabbed my controller. the scarce use of shivs, to the killing clickers with bricks to cheap out on ammo. and the game is just so beautifully crafted, part i is a love letter to og last of us, a great remake. 1010, would buy on quantum computers."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,"this game is an incredible masterpiece from playstation. it was definetly a little rough on release here on pc, but now after a couple years and returning to the game, i think its quite great on pc now! highly reccommend!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-17,"1010, i really dont have words to explain, i have never played a game as good as this. the moment you finish the game it really hits you, and you just have a weird feeling that i cant describe just awesome, cant wait for part 2 remastered on pc."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-17,"the last of us stands out as one of my alltime favorite games, and for good reason. its storytelling is unparalleled, weaving a narrative that's both heartwrenching and deeply human. unlike many games where cutscenes feel like a chore, the last of us makes them an integral part of the experience. i've even gone back to watch scenes i missed, a testament to how engaging they are. the game's focus on character development, particularly the bond between joel and ellie, is masterful. the postapocalyptic setting serves as a backdrop for their emotional journey, making their interactions feel authentic and relatable. the gameplay, with its blend of stealth and action, complements the narrative perfectly, creating moments of intense fear and emotional depth. what sets the last of us apart is its ability to balance storytelling with interactive gameplay, making each scene feel impactful and meaningful. it's a game that resonates long after the credits roll, and its influence on the gaming industry is undeniable. for me, it's a 1010 experience that i highly recommend to anyone who values storytelling in games."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-17,"easily one of the best single player games of all time. the story is great, the graphics are amazingthe original was fantastic and they made some amazing improvements here. in my opinion it is worth full price, and a huge mistake to miss it at a discount. this game holds up, and is worth multiple playthroughs. the combat is great, the design is top notch, and the characters are relatable, likable, and easy to buy into. the first 15 minutes will rip your heart out but it sets the tone and atmosphere so well that its unrivaled by any modern game. this is a must have for your library. buy it right now!"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,"great story, great graphics, and it runs great. awesome game overall and i wish more developers spent this much care on games."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-15,"amazing game, one of my all time favorites since the first time i experienced it some years back, i've played the story several times over, have a few hundred hours and 100 completion on it's console version. definitely recommend, but only if you have already played the game on console prior to it's pc release. with the proper hardware and luck of the draw with software, the game is playable and can be enjoyed. but if you haven't played it before and you want the best possible experience, you're better off playing it on a ps5 instead, because there is just simply no guarantee with this version of the game on pc. all of that been said, there have been updates and fixes to resolve a lot of the known issues, so it is far better than it was, just don't expect perfection. if you're not bothered by potential glitchescrashes or graphical bugs, then by all means buy it and have a good time!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-15,"love it. last of us has been dear to me for a long time now and i've waited a long time to play it again, this time on pc. it was worth every penny to me. they really did an amazing job with the visuals. the game finally looks like a modern game and everything just feels a bit more smooth here. animations too. i don't think i have to say but the story is an absolute treat and if you have never experienced it before please do yourself a favor and play this game."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-15,"i love and adore this game so much. it's such a wonderful and beautifully made game. the story is insanely immersive and the characters are so lovable and at the same time make you want to curse them out too joel. this series has taken over my life and perhaps is my new obsession. however, my game would constantly crash after a few hours into the game. my temps were just fine and i have a highend pc. i was never really able to fix it so it wouldn't stop crashing but beware and hopefully it doesn't happen to you."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-15,"a lot shorter story then i remembered, you make think it has plot holes but youre wrong its good"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-15,"this is the best game of all time. i did three full playthroughs on playstation and two of part 2, and still wanted to buy it on pc to play it again with the upgraded visuals. awesome. i hope they port part 2 to pc, and i hope they make a part 3."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,"game got a lot of flak at launch for performance issues. i also had performance issues at launch, but at this time, i have no complaints about performance, even on high graphic settings. rarely getting drops below 60 fps and usually run at 8090. lack of multiplayer and high diffspeedrun achievements is definitely disappointing, but im having a pretty great time reexploring an old favorite"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-12,"this is such an amazing game, i've been enjoying every second of it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-12,"played it for thousands of hours on ps3, ps4 and ultimately ps5 until i've got this game on pc. no matter how much time i spend on this game, the last of us will never cease to amaze me like it did back in 2013. p.s. the story will make you cry like a baby. p.s.s. i totally love ellie and this is pretty obvious from my name and my steam profile overall!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-12,"other than some random traversal stutter, and microstutters, the game was really enjoyable. will be playing part 2 when it comes out on pc."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-12,its def my favorite game trust its really good. im lazy so just take somebody elses description. lmfao
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,"i don't understand why some reviews complain about bad optimization of this porting. on my i7 6700k a cpu from 10 years ago!!! with an rtx 3070 it runs buttery smooth at 1080 resolution with all graphical bells and whistles enabled. not a judder, not a glitch, not an instance of lag smooth and beautiful to look at. the game, of course, is an emotional masterpiece."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,"my interest in gaming had been fading since 2009. it was now 2013, and life had got in the way. i lost touch with gaming, missing out on the peak multiplayer era of halo reach, gears of war 3, and black ops 2. one day, while scrolling through destructoid, a review by jim sterling caught my eye. i skimmed to the bottom and was surprised by the flawless rating. sterling was usually tough to impress! that was enough to convince me. the next day, on my way home from college, i flippantly picked up a copy, a day or two after it released, having somehow not heard of it until i saw the review, or even realising one of my favorite games studios had made it. the last of us 2013 had crept up behind me and stuck a shiv in my neck. what started as an impulse buy lead to an intense hyperfixation and obsessive love. the kind of love for a piece of art that makes you feel like you and you alone understood it. like the game was made only for you. i played it on the ps3 four times once on hard, twice on survivor, and once on grounded. i was hooked on its underrated, addictive multiplayer mode, factions. when the last of us remastered 2014 arrived on ps4, i played through it twice more, once on survivor, then on grounded, sinking even more hours into factions which thankfully had also been remastered and played so good in 1080p60fps. by then, i was primarily a pc gamer and could only dream of playing it with a keyboard and mouse. i truly never thought it would happen. the last of us part i 2023 finally gave me that chance. at time time of this review, i've played it on survivor, and again on grounded. i also got all of the achievements. though, it is not without its flaws. its pc launch was a disaster, which is why i waited so long to play it. the omission of factions is a crushing disappointment and completely unforgivable. this was also a fullpriced aaa release, despite being yet another iteration of a decadeold game. having said that, this is the definitive way to experience the last of us. the frantic and tense gameplay remains flawless, now enhanced by the smoothness and precision of a keyboard and mouse. using a controller just feels sluggish now, i will never play this with one again! the weapon crafting system, from upgrading firearms to assembling molotovs and bombs, is still one of the best ever. its not as fun on lower difficulties, but on survivor and up, resource management turns into a real fight for survival, its literally the difference between life and death. every decision feels crucial, and makes the game an excellent, razortense survival horror experience. the story, brutal and deeply emotional, has never looked better. the improved motion capture and facial animations bring out tiny details  a tensed muscle, a fleeting glance  that werent possible in the original. the remastered version, although still holding up remarkable well, has characters with flat, lifeless faces by comparison. spoilerthe opening sequence was always heartbreaking, but sarahs final moments now feel even more devastatingspoiler. across the game, cutscenes feel richer, with nuanced body language and expressions adding new layers of depth. if youve played it before, youll notice some changes. the workbench weapon upgrades now resemble part ii, with weapons visually evolving as you progress. the infected now behave exactly as they did in the sequel, with clickers actually using echolocation now, being much more unpredictable and noticeably harder to fight which i really appreciated as it totally caught me off guard!, and stalkers arent just regular runners now but appear as their bestial, creepy part ii iterations. spoilerthe section where joel and sam are trapped together is noticeably easier as a result, joels watch also canonically breaks when sarah is shot, and the hospital escape scene has been retconned, now using the surgeons character model from part ii for continuity.spoiler if you never played this before, i hope this release gives you a chance to experience the last of us for the first time. i really wish i could play it for the first time again... know that i am extremely envious of you, you little shit! the last of us is a timeless masterpiece, and among the greatest examples of video game high art. so yes, i recommend it!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,bugy at first but it goes away eventually. u can also trying turning on ultra performance and set priority in task manager to high
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,nice game. it looks awesome and the story is one of the best i have ever seen. for me personally it is a bit to stealthy cause i like to shoot and clap everybody but you can do that too. one part that i did not enjoy was the end of left behind. there you stand with your back at a wall and are attacked by 10 guys. you play with elly so you dont have your normal equip. and i had like not much hp and no ammo. i tried a few times and had to get to another safe. then i got it but thats the problem it can be a little bit fk up 1010 for me actually startet the game cause i saw the series. i instantly knew i would like it. your merketing is working!!!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,this is one of the best games in history. the story of this game still touches my heart even displayed all of this years.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,"i played this amazing game way back in 2011 on the playstation 3. in march of 2025, i finished both the main game and dlc on hard difficulty. let me tell you how immersive this game is! if you have super ultra wide gaming monitor and a powerful graphics card, you'll definitely get capture by the beauty of the graphics, action, game play, and cinema. there are changes to this game pertaining to the gameplay such as back in the day i could remember that this game on hard difficulty was tough and you needed to beat it on such difficulty to unlock hard  to get to survivalist. dont quote me on that its been over 15 years, also in the play3 version, you could look trunks of cards for scrap and items. the difficulty on hard on pc isnt hard at all compared to ps3, im not sure why lol. maybe its because once you get familiar with the game, it becomes easy? idk but i had to recollect my memory from 2011 and was like oh yeah, i remember this! type of moments. physx in this game in the pc version is quite frankly amazing! bro there are scenes and levels in certain situations in the game that just make my jaw drop. i dont want to spoil anything but in one scene someone off themselves and the blood flew straight unto my screen! which in the ps3 version never had done that before. thats just one example, there are many others. last of us part 1, i highly recommend you playing especially if you're a naughty dog fan like myself but a part from that you dont want to miss this amazing story that this game brings to the table. truly a classic and i can't wait for part 2 to release soon this april?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,"after watching the playthrough of this game many years ago on youtube when it first released on ps3, i have been a fan of this story and franchise. this was a great experience overall on my rx 6800 and i711700k at 1440p, they really did a lot to improve the textures and graphics of the game vs the original and remastered versions while still staying true to the original game basically the gameplay mechanics and levels are identical, they just look much better now. there are occasional crashes, but you can normally pick up right where you left off as the game has very frequent autosavescheckpoints. it requires a lot of vram at higher settings 1012gb or more, so keep that in mind. i also run into cpu bottlenecks and frame rates dips at times, but optimizing the settings can help a lot with this. speaking of which, the settings menu is one of the best i've seen, you can really dial in graphics settings and hud elements, etc. id recommend turning off effects like film grain and chromatic aberration, but this is just personal preference. the photo mode is also really nice, and you can change the directory it saves the screenshots to. as for the gameplay experience and story itself, its amazing 1010. one of the best gaming experiences ive had, the story and character development is just so beautiful. even after watching the ps3 playthrough and season 1 of the tv show, nothing really replaces experiencing this for yourself. it can be pretty intensescary at times but once you get the hang of the controls it's much easier. i played using an xbox controller and that worked well. now i find myself going through again for achievements and challenging myself with higher difficulties. you can do a new game which allows you to keep your weapons upgrades and such from previous playthroughs. there are even some really cool extras like concept art and behind the scenes stuff, and gameplay modifiers you can enable after your first playthrough like infinite ammo, slow motion, etc. 60 is pretty steep even though they seem to have put a lot of work into this, i picked it up for less than 40 on a steam sale and i'd say it will go for cheaper than that over time."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,"amazing story and atmosphere. great and believable zombie design. 18 no disney bullshit does not feel linear even though it is a linear game. shooting and inventory is a bit clunky, but it fits the game. gives a challenging feeling in a positive way. played on sofa in front of big tv with keyboard and mouse."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-06,"one of the best games of all time. naughty dog truly made a masterpiece with this one. if you know nothing about the story, keep it that way until you play the game. trust me, this game is worth it. you'll have fun in the game's immersive combat while getting to experience a story worthy of standing next to greek epics. if you're sitting on the fence on this game stop. just get it. you deserve it. everyone should experience this masterpiece."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,"love this game. worth the money if you like good story telling, and tense gameplay."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,"this game hits different. i doubt anything, even from the team that made it will ever quite cut so deep. not a masterpiece in any way, but if you truly cannot give these characters, their struggles, and their stories a chance, you are really missing out. it is however, a massive shame the overlords holding the writing are greedy bastards to put it lightly, meaning this story is really the third console seller for an honest to god flock of sheep. i love you gamers, but days gone remastered who the fvck asked blooooooodborne now"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,"after finishing this game i fell this weird emptiness in me and i don't know what to do next. amazing game, easy achievement, great gameplay, lovable character, excited to see joel again in part 2. fighting human  fighting infected"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,"the last of us has been with me since its first release on ps3. then i played the remastered version on ps4, and when i found out there would be a remake, i didnt hesitate for a secondi had to get it on pc to enjoy it in the highest possible quality. in 4k on ultra settings, it looks fantastic. but the graphics arent the only thing that blows you awaythe incredible story and great gameplay make this one of the best ever. 1010."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,game ran good for me on my recent playthrough. it's stupid how pretty this game is. i played apocalypse rising on roblox as a kid and this game is like that but on crack. very fun
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-04,the ammo is very scarce. there is a lot of hiding and going around enemies rather than fighting head on. for me it feels like the combinations to perform certain actions feel kinda awkward. other than the the story line is greatly entertaining.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-04,best game ive ever played better than any fps or rpg out there. it has the most in deapth story line and it is truly the best game out there
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-04,one of the greatest games i have ever played. few bugs but nothing which would affect enjoyment of the game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-03,"my favourite story game ever. plays great on mk, the game will tell you to use a controller before you play but it feels good on mk."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-03,"finally grabbed this on pc and it was totally worth it. i have had a blast and am on ng plus mode now. incredible graphics, story and gameplay. 1010."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-03,"first of all i was skeptical because of the performance problem it presented at launch and i have to say that although the port is not perfect and hyperoptimized and still needs improvements, the game is a work of art, on a visual and narrative level, let's go with the problem i had with the graphic settings this game is necessary or mandatory to run in 2k or at least upscaled from 2k the reason is that it needs dlss technology to have the necessary fps boost if you have a midhigh range computer by configuring the dlss well and with the game all in ultra and high i have been able to have very good stability and it has been a delight to play it in this resolution and with this quality. about the story, there's not much more to say, narratively it's beautiful, every environment, every place, every situation will stay in your mind, the game has one of the best environments i've seen in a video game, it's not just good graphics it has an art design that no matter how many times you go through an area you'll want to go through it again and imagine what would have happened in the area before the apocalypse had happened. the soundtrack, although it's really short puts the right sounds and sound style in certain situations and makes you remember those short melodies or instruments because it puts them in memorable moments. anyway, it's a work of art and it's really worth every penny for it, they fixed the game and now it's just perfect, waiting for part 2 on pc with great excitement 3"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,its good i like the story and game play it reminds me of a less like creepy resident evil
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,great game lots of acton and a good story line
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,"very fun game, havent finished it yet but very fun and cant wait to finish!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-28,"beautiful, emotional story game. i love the gameplay. the mix between combat, stealth, agility, puzzles, and horror is great. the graphics are stunning. ive played tlou1 3 times.i love all the gamemodes and customizations too."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-27,"great game, playing in 2025 and it is a very fun and captivating game! worth the hype!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-26,the game is so much better then the show. if you think the show is better. then you are the kind of idiot it was made for.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,"best story based video game i've ever played and i've been gaming for 40 years! bravo to the team, keep single player games alive."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,"as a game, this game is like cinema compared to the other games out there.. this is my first time playing the remaster, but not my first time playing this amazing game. this game is so good it makes me shed tears at its marvelous story, and i'm excited to play the upcoming last of us part 2 port coming to steam soon. my final verdict from a fan of the original game, this is like eye candy and i love playing it and can't wait to continue doing so.. so i rate this game a decent 9.5  10."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-24,a gripping story and gameplay settings that can fit your desired playstyle
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-24,"very immersive, graphics, dailouge, and audio are great"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-24,"truly an incredible game. the art, story, acting... all beautiful. gameplay is engaging if a bit repetitive at times and challenging without being frustrating. there's enough to scavenge, manage, and modify without being overwhelming or intrusive. i know it was buggy when it launched, but i experienced zero issues and it ran very well on my rtx 4060ryzen 7 7000 series. but really, it's all about the story with this one. if you've watched the hbo show, you're already familiar with it, but it's quite different to experience it this way. i think i'll wait until i play part 2 before watching the next season."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-24,"one of the best crafted games i've ever played. it is very graphic and has a lot of profanity so just be aware of that but to be honest i think for the most part it is appropriate for this subject matter. this also has the best story of any game i've ever played, in my opinion of coarse. made me tear up many times, even on the second playthrough. i really can't wait for part two. the developers really did a good job making joel and elle feel like real people and i really have come to love these two characters. good job naughty dog, you got me. it's time to check out your other titles."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-23,"excellent movie like game, very enjoyable, except one small issue, in certain sectiona of the game theres this weird black texture floor bug. quick hardware spec ryzen 7 5800x3d 4ghz all core under volted. nvidia 3090 16gb ddr4 3440x1440  144hz with hdr, high settings 144fps lock"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-23,"i started off wrong. i am downloading this game again to see how the developer designed this game for my model. but this was a dope game. shout out to my friend that bought this game. i believer his brother stole it, but his brother told me it was a kick ass game. his friend actually bout it though shout out to the homie kyle. i been calling him quel since i was a child. they just let me have it. shout out to the homie."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-23,"i understand of negative review due to bad optimization on this game. the truth is, i don't have a playstation but when it comes to pc, this is my only chance to play this game. this game is one of the best storyline and combats. it is way more better stealthier than others. the last of us part i is one of my favorite game i have ever played."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-23,great game and story. would be good if it was optimised better but its good enough
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-23,probably some of the most well written characters out of any game ive ever played this games actually beautiful
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-22,"this game truly was a masterpiece. knowing i will never find a story based game quite like this one is heartbreaking. everything was perfect, the story, the scenery, the graphics, the fights. this game is my greatest treasure."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-22,they fixed most of the bugs. feels good to play finally. great story and gameplay!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-22,"the graphics and story were very well done, i thought."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-21,great game and great story line. i am glad i picked this one up on sale and several months after the initial release which was plagued with numerous issues. this runs flawlessly on my modest i5rtx3070 ti setup. highly recommended and looking forward to part 2.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-21,"this game deserves a genuine place in the single player hall of fame and whilst this port has its ups and downs. i would buy this game and 100 it all over again. i ran this game on a 7800x3d  4080 super at 4k res native, no upscaling at a constant 70fps pretty good!. pros  game is very fluid, minimal crashing only crashed 2 or 3 times at the start when i first uninstalled afterwards flawless, stunning graphics  dlss 4 looks just as good at native in most cases  fsr 3.1 implentation gives more fps than dlss 4, even on a 40 series card cons  first things first, this game is very vram dependent, but if you turn down textures it should fix it  the gameplay, you're very locked into whatever move or keybind you press, no canceling a action.  on grounded mode, the human ai literally have aimbot and whether you pass the encounter or not depends on luck and if you figure out how to path the ai to sneak around or line up for you to kill them.   fsr 3.1 has noticable shimmers in water and certain corners  no frame gen  upscaling implementation  some places in the starting city and stairs you can pass through that flash bang your screen with glitched no or all white textures  some optional conversations in pittsburg can glitch out and not count causing you to have to go back through and retrigger them  amazing game 1010, can't wait for last of us p2 in april!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-21,"great story, you have to play in your lifetime!! it really makes you love joel and ellie as characters"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-20,"its awesome game, nice graphs, immersive, dialogues and story are great, various modes for harcore and regular players, difficulty adequate, money well spent for me."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-20,"played the game when it came back way back. always has been and will be phenominal, the better graphics only make it better"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-20,"greatest single player game of all time. 1010 in every way. remake has some glitches for sure, but nothing truly terrible."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-20,this is one of the greatest written stories of all time. now i can add its newest remaster to my collection!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-19,"it does have a few issues with performance but its probably my pc. but the story is absolutely a 1010, and gameplay wise is more fun than god of war 4 and ragnarok. deluxe edition isn't worth it imo as you get these things later in game."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-19,"captivating storytelling , one of the best in gaming history . 1210. i luv it"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-19,"amazing story telling, gameplay and progression is good, characters are top notch. only took about 1213 hours to beat, another few more including left behind. had no performance issues on a 8086k8700k, 3060ti with 32gb ram 1080p. 8.510!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-17,"played this when it 1st came out, hated it, too linear, full of bugs and laggy bits. now its smooth as butter, havent seen a single bug. really enjoying it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,"i bought the game after watching people play it for ages, but when i actually bought the game, it wasn't even able to boot up and i had to search up things to toggle and ways to make the game playable. and when i did actually play, i was only able to meet ellie, before i gave up. and mind you, the game could only run for about 5 minutes before it crashed. i kept pushing through all the way but eventually, got frustrated. i spent at least a full hour just trying to get out of the prologue as there were so many variables needed to be loaded. it's an amazing game and i still want to play it, but there's a big part of a game that needs to work. actually being able to play it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-28,highly recommended!!! i never seen the tv series but this game is less scarier than i expected
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,", .     .                 , ,    .     ,      ,   .         ,   ,"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,a masterpiece of storytelling and modern game design. the last of us is truly what a game should aspire to be. too bad we never got a true sequel to this masterpiece and only got a horribly written fan fiction.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-04,"i don't know whether if the developers optimized this game or if nvidia's new dlss technology is simply magical, but the game runs smooth like butter now years after i purchased it when it was a graphical stutter fest that made me question my purchase. all that is in the past now. the game runs on max settings at 3200x1600 after toggling dlss super resolution not dlaa and turning vsync off in game but on in the nvidia panel. this is the best game for grown ups out there where a grounded story, beautiful looking graphics, character design and superb motion capturelike animation merge together except maybe for the banshee or screamer, not sure what's its name which kinda breaks up the immersion, giving the gamer an unforgettable gaming experience that will be tough to emulate, especially now that developers appear to be so unskillful in creating an experience like this one. please buy this game and another in physical form so you can put it under your pillow and sleep well. i hope more games"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-17,"ok so i was absolutely loving this game, graphics some of the best i've seen but then when i got to the graveyard part of the game my game would crash out of no where and i haven't been able to find a fix so currently i cannot recommend this port of the game just for that alone. but i will be getting it on my ps5 instead so i can play all of it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,my pc can run modern games with full raytracing with no issues yet this game stutters and lags constantly. i really don't get it. i unfortunately can't really recommend a port that doesn't run.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-20,"the main game is great, nice combination of a rich story line, good action sequences, and challenging puzzles to solve such as finding the way out of an area. difficulty options can be customized so you get a challenging game without it feeling like an impossible slog. the included dlc, left behind, is far worse. the developers worried way too much about the story line with the dlc and not enough on actual playability."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-19,"game audio is so low it's almost inaudible. i have no problems with audio in any other game, but i can't even understand the characters' dialogue in this game. i'm applying for a refund."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"giving this a negative review, because the last of us part 1 is not region locked and 2nd is, i cant preorder. i love the game, i played it on ps3. but i hate what sony is doing with region locking."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,i loved this game since 2013. i've since moved exclusively to pc and this has been a wonderful experience.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,i hate games where you can carry 20 rounds. when i go to shop i have 45 rounds with me and there is no problem to put 100 in your pockets. don't mention it is aisle type of game. you don't have options here.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"timeless game. but why in the world are you guys remastering part 2??? it came out in the year of our lord two thousand and twenty, why does sony love remastering brand fucking new games, like seriously they will remaster horizon zero dawn five more times before we get even a simple 60 fps patch for bloodborne....."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-15,this game's story is amazing and a recommend to anyone who is interested
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-14,best storyline ever in a game hands down
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-12,"this is this best game i have ever played in my whole life, i 100 percent recommend getting the last of us part 1 and 2. this is such an amazing game! i would not recommend if you do not like shooting or scary stuff."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,"how can i start describing this game? no, sorry! how can i describe how good is this game!? no spoilers. i started playing this game just last year, finished a couple of levels, then got busy with life, yeah... back to it in the last 2 months, what an adventure it was! a great adventure through the postapocalyptic america. different locations, different enemies, different landscapes and views what great views this game has omg!. the characters are well written, the good, the bad, every place you go in has a backstory to it, and every story is unique and interesting. in my entire playthrough i haven't seen a single similar place, all are different! it really immerse you the way you expect a game of that kind would do. the infected were great, the ai was top notch, humans and infected. you just had to be surprised every time you faced some sort of enemy! the ui is clear and simple, the weapons and there upgrades are cool. the collectibles are rewarding to some extent. the downside is the performance, it's really heavy on any pc hardware, not well optimized."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-07,im only leaving this comment mostly before the part 2. reviewing everything before i actually see the second game for myself and reflect what went wrong. and before i get attacked by the woke for not being a fan of this series which is most likely done for good now
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-07,"with the combination of an engaging story, fun and challenging gameplay loop and a gutpunch of an ending, the last of us is a nearperfect game. there's a pervasive sense of danger and death around every corner, but the characters often introduce levity with small talk and moments of hope. having only played the original ps3 version, the graphical overhaul made it feel like a new experience. very, very impressed."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-07,"this is a well made game. art, voiceacting, gameplay, story, all topnotch. i saw the show first which no doubt took some of the emotional impact away for me, but there were still connections with the characters. standard difficulty was fine for me, though this meant it was too easy a good part of the time, i didn't much mind. highly recommended."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-07,"it might just be me but, the aiming zoomaim on pc is really bad and locks up and doesnt alow you to fire or aim which results in the zombie killing yo ass. however overall the rest of the game is very pretty. extremely clunky controls tho atleast for me. still i wanna keep playing its a cool story but it feels broken on pc mouse and keyboard, and control my aim is so shit i cant hit anything."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,it's a timeless game. but it crashes now on my steam deck that i just bought
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,runs perfectly fine for me and is still is one of the best games ever made.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,best game ever made of all time in the world 10010 recommend play it now you will love it and enjoy it and have the best time of your life
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,it crashed every time as soon as it loaded in with a gpu crash nothing i did helped fix it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,"amazing game. what else to say that hasn't been said yet? one thing i don't understand is why a 4gb gpu as minimal spec if the game uses more than 5gb of vram on low settings at 1080p? it runs smooth on my rtx 3060 oc in high settings plus dlss on quality either at 1080p or 1440p. but running this game on my gtx 1650 laptop is painful. everything on low and fsr on performance damages the visual fidelity so much and creates such an input lag that doesn't allow you to enjoy this game fully as it was intended. it is pleasant if played on a steamdeck, locked at 30 fps, as with the small screen and lower resolution helps with that but at 1080p with a gtx 1650 forget it. by all means play it, if it's the only gpu you have, but bear in mind that it needs at least 6gb of vram to make the experience enjoyable. games like days gone, uncharted, detroit and god of war run better on the gtx 1650. even cyberpunk with fsr 3 on native aa runs better."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,"overall, i enjoyed tlou but with some caveats. to be honest, i hated it for the first few hours. you don't get many weapons or much ammo, which is fine per se, but it plays like a stealthmelee based game for a while there... while lacking much of any decent stealth or melee mechanics. the camera pans slow, there's no block or dodge button, and enemies clownhouse around you. they don't give you many decent places to hide. enemies don't follow movement patterns and will randomly turn around and are very aggro for melee. you can throw objects to distract them, but you can only carry one throwable object at a time. all this had be pretty frustrated for the first few hours. once you get more weapons, you're more free to shoot your way out of the situations, but at best the combat mechanics are pretty flat imo. past that, the story and setting develop into an immersive experience that leaves you thinking. characters are notably expressive this story is all about learning to find meaning again, to get close to another person emotionally, and watching those characters develop towards that concept. the world design is pretty great too, especially with the changing seasons and varied scenes. i loved progressing through the world and its struggles. both friends and foes are designed with depth and it is not uncommon to blur the lines of good or evil, friend or foe. moral ambiguity always makes a story and its characters more interesting, and tlou does this beautifully. in terms of graphics, i was able to run it maxed in 4k no issues on a 4080 super, using dlss 4 which wasn't a compromise given the honestly offputting sharpening effect the visuals had at most times anyway. it wasn't as noticeable during the winter scenes, but this game really could have been a 1010 on graphics if not for this fact. this becomes more apparent on a larger screen closer up, and higher resolution doesn't help the issue the way it does for taa blursmear found in a lot of other games. the image was probably meant to be viewed on a tv as distance. i don't know why they used so much sharpening, perhaps to fake detail back from some kind of taa implementation. in sum, at the end i found myself craving more of the plot despite having had enough of the combat. tlou is one of the few games where the cutscenes and more passive, cinematic segments are the strongest points imo, and those points are strong enough to outweigh the weak areas."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,amazing game i love the last of us i'm super happy that the next game comes out on steam in 5 weeks

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-21,storytelling is incredible. i am so glad it got released for nonplaystation gamers
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-21,i absolutely loved this game and the storytelling was immaculate. i truly think everyone who plays games would love the last of us and i am excited for part ii.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-19,"it's a masterpiece, a treasure for generations to come, that everyone should play. nobody makes games like this anymore."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-26,"story mode too short. paid 60 for less than 19 hours. i liked it a lot, but should be half price"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-03,"i only bought this version of the game because it was on sale and i thought it would be convenient to play it on my computer. i assumed that years after the release of the port it would be cleaned up and run well. it does not. why does this port have so many crashes and longer loading screens than my ps4 copy from 2013? sure, it looks nicer, but it runs worse. eta i do not regret buying this version of the game  when it works, it is a very enjoyable experience. i just wouldn't recommend it due to the performance issues  i will admit that the patches since release have helped, however, they just haven't completely resolved the issues like frame rate and load times."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,"well gameplay is ok, it is nothing revolutionary that i haven't seen in days gone, resident evil or the evil within, but the story is very captivating and good. game is very short and expencive, and i found out about the plot in sequel which made me upset. if you watched tv series in hbo max, well they made everything from game in that show, they ruined mine expirience of this game. i haven't played the part 2, but judging from the plot on wikipedia i see that they ruined this series, so i will give negative review. do not buy this, it will touch your soul with the first one and then squash your heart in the next one. it is full of lgbt propaganda, and they kill main protagonist. i just don't want to play games where main protagonst die."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,"nunca jugu este juego en sus inicios, pero tena tantisimos premios y buenas referencias que realmente cre que me maravillara pues eran tan apabullantes las buenas criticas que mis espectativas se fueron a los cielos. ahora que finalmente lo estoy jugando, me resulta un juego de lo mas lineal y repetitivo en sus batallas ademas de acertijos absurdamente faciles y lo peor recursos tan limitados que tristemente es lo nico que hacen complicado el juego, y justifica un esfuerzo. solo dame un arma con balas infinitas y paso el juego con los ojos vendados. basura de juego con falsa buena publicidad y premios comprados"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,"i imagine this was good for 2013, but the gameplay mechanics are pretty limited, the allimportant stealth mode is pretty limited as well. i played this for the story, but to be honest, there is not much effort at developing the characters in a meaningful way, and there's not much to the story except constantly running from or killing random zombies or human enemies. no real interesting choices, and side characters come, and then go. there is a reveal eventually, but it takes a lot of slogging through very similar kinds of scenarios to get there. if you're looking for a rich story in a beautiful setting, this isn't really what you're looking for."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-19,"wow, what a great main story only to be ruined with the addition of left behind. leave it up to naughty dog to ruin an amazing story by adding woke nonsense nobody asked for in the extra mode. when i finished the main story of joel and ellie, i was actually really excited to play left behind, up until that lesbian mike tyson soundalike of a firefly ruined it. its really not needed and the liveaction counterpart of the down of us was ruined by a godawful casting of ellie. way to go, making one of the main characters look like somebody who has down syndrome rather than immunity to the cordeceps virus."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-01,this happens when you trying to port old games on pc. 100 crushes even with good equipment. so much time passed and still no optimised patch avaliable. dont buy this raw material. i haven't seen such a broken portation for a long time. keep on sony.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-17,"i have long awaited for this game to be on steam. unfortunately, this game will not launch from my pc and yes, i have the correct specs. i played this game growing up and highly recommend it. for steam, i recommend buying on sale and seeing if it will launch  if not, return. hopefully, it will get fixed one day..."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,"the last of us part 1  a timeless gaming masterpiece when i first played the last of us part 1, i honestly wasnt prepared for how deeply it would impact me. from the gripping gameplay to the emotional storytelling, this game set a new standard for what video games can achieve. gameplay the gameplay in the last of us part 1 is so wellcrafted that i found myself fully immersed in the survival elements. i love how the game combines stealth and combat, making every encounter feel different depending on how you approach it. the tension of sneaking around clickers or making tough choices in combat keeps you on edge, but its never frustrating. the controls feel tight, and theres just enough challenge to keep you engaged without feeling overwhelming. managing your resources, crafting items, and navigating the environment all come together in a way that feels rewarding, and i love how each decision can have such a big impact on the experience. graphics visually, the last of us part 1 looks absolutely stunning. it does an incredible job of enhancing the games world. the environments feel alive with detailed textures and lighting that immerse you fully into the postapocalyptic world. every characters expression and movement is so realistic, i often found myself just marveling at how lifelike they look. the ruined cities, overgrown nature, and atmospheric weather effects are visually captivating, and they make the world feel so real and livedin. its one of those games where you almost forget youre playing, because everything feels so tangible. storyline but its the story that really sets the last of us part 1 apart for me. the relationship between joel and ellie is central, and watching their bond develop as they navigate the horrors of this world is nothing short of brilliant. there are moments in this game that hit you right in the gut, and its the kind of narrative that sticks with you long after youre done playing. its heartbreaking, raw, and beautifully told. the pacing is perfecttheres just enough action to keep you hooked, but the quieter, more emotional moments are what really make this game so powerful. i have to give major credit to the voice acting, too. troy baker as joel and ashley johnson as ellie bring so much depth to their characters that it feels like youre watching a film rather than playing a game. sound and music the sound design is something i cant overlook. from the chilling noises of the clickers to the ambient sounds of nature reclaiming the world, everything in this game pulls you deeper into its atmosphere. and the music? gustavo santaolallas score is simply haunting. it perfectly captures the tone of the game, amplifying the emotional highs and lows in a way that makes every scene feel even more intense. the soundtrack is one of those rare ones that, even outside the game, i find myself listening to on repeat because it evokes so many memories of the journey. replayability and features though i havent finished the game yet, i can already tell that the last of us part 1 offers plenty of reasons to come back. from what i've experienced so far, the game is filled with hidden details and collectibles that im excited to explore further. i can already sense that the world is rich with things to discover, and the multiple difficulty settings mean ill likely revisit the game to challenge myself in different ways. plus, the new accessibility options make the experience more inclusive, allowing a wider range of players to enjoy it fully. im looking forward to seeing how the game evolves as i progress and how much more there is to uncover in this incredible world. final thoughts although i havent finished the last of us part 1 yet, im already incredibly impressed by what ive experienced. the gripping gameplay, emotional storytelling, and stunning visuals have left a lasting impact on me, and im excited to see how the journey unfolds. i can tell that the game is going to stay with me long after ive completed it, and im eager to dive deeper into the world and the relationship between joel and ellie. while theres still much more to discover, its clear that this game is a true masterpiece, and im looking forward to experiencing the rest of it."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,"tldr very beautiful but overrated and overpriced mediocrity. overall 410 plot 110 the plot can be described as you need to go from point a to point b. now that you are at point b, the thing that you needed here is not here, so you need to go to point c. rinse and repeat. mario did it much better. the characters, which there are only two because all additional characters appear on screen for anywhere from several minutes to one short mission don't really get any development, because most of the time they are silently shooting bandits and when we finally talk it's about something meaningless like a movie poster or a few words about which point in our journey we need to go now and why. only glimpse of character development of joel you get in a final mission, before that it's just journey for the sake of the journey. gameplay 210 the game starts as a mediocre stealth. you have only three stealth mechanics hiding behind objects, strangling or stabbing your opponents from the back, and throwing bottles or bricks to get others attention. strangling takes very long and stabbing works only ones, after which you need to craft a new shiv. at some point it gets better shivs now can be used up to 3 times and you get a bow. and when you get some better stealth gearskills the game transforms from mediocre stealth to mediocre shooter. now you have enough ammo to fight a lot of enemies, so the game gives them to you dozens of bandits or zombies, which makes stealth around the middle of the game obsolete. shooting is not satisfying and feels clunky. the only good thing about this part is gear upgrades, which have pretty nice animations and make you care about certain weapons more. game also have a rudimentary survival elements. you need to run around looting rags, alcohol, mechanical parts etc. from this you can craft bombs, medicine kits, shivs etc. and use it to upgrade your weapons. the main mechanic here is cap on everything from rags to ammo. the only thing which is somehow not capped is weapons. by the end of the game in your tiny backpack you are carrying 9 different weapons, among which a flamethrower, three types of rifles, bow and four pistols. but god forbid you have more than 7 rounds for each weapon for some 20. if you think the game is about zombies, you are wrong the game is about bandits, who if they tried to fight zombies instead of pursuing some dude and a kid probably would end up winning, cause there are at least 34 times more bandits in the game than zombies. graphics 1010 the game is really beautiful, the picturesque landscapes of a ruined world are truly breathtaking. i would love to immerse myself in this world and explore it for hours, but alas except beautiful picture there is nothing here to explore. i didn't have any crashes and overall quality problems, but i have a nice computer i714700, 32 gb ram, rtx 4070. value for money 310 even if you take it on sale for 50 of the price it's still pricy to pay 30 bucks for a 15 hour mediocre adventure with zero replayability. for the full 60 it feels like a daylight robbery, when games like baldur's gate 3 with hundreds of hours of content exist."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-05,"the last of us part 1 is an experience i will cherish for many, many years to come. this game will change you. although its concept is simple and has been done a million times, it still feels vastly unique. the story is breathtaking, and the visuals match it perfectly. however, when loading in for the first time, the time it takes for the shaders to load is far too long, and it definitely puts a strain on your cpubut its most certainly worth it. the voice acting, gameplay, zombies, and even something as simple as the title screen are all exceptionally well done. im aware of the issues the pc port faced when it was first released, but most of them have been patched since then. throughout my 100 completion, i experienced no issues, no crashing, and no glitches. now is the perfect time to experience this masterpiece, especially with the upcoming series and the pc port of the last of us part 2 coming next month. with the steam sale on march 13th, i hope this game is includedwhat better time to try it? i highly recommend it."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,while this has to be in my top ten favorite games of all time. i can not recommend this pc version. it is full of bug and glitches. like joel's face hair making him look like a wookie due rendering issues. gates that won't open and the e won't appear. even the sound track seem to be out of sync compared to the ps version of the game. save your money and play the ps34 version.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,"the last of us part i isn't merely a game, it's a breathtaking emotional journey that stands unparalleled as my absolute favorite game ever created. i cannot stress this enough this game is a masterpiece in storytelling, character development, and immersive gameplay. joel and ellie's journey is profoundly human, navigating a shattered world filled with heartache, hope, and haunting beauty. every encounter feels meaningful, every quiet moment resonates, and every twist cuts deeply. naughty dog has crafted characters so authentic that their struggles become our struggles, their victories our victories, and their losses unforgettable. yet, it's not all tears and tragedy, there's humor in the absurd practicality of survival. ever wondered how joel calmly stores lit molotov cocktails in his backpack without causing fiery destruction? or marveled at the unexpected lethality of casually tossed bricks and bottles? and let's not forget my new reallife hoarding obsession inspired by this game, endlessly gathering crafting materials like tape and broken scissors, because you never know when they'll come in handy during the apocalypse to make a terrible shiv to bust open locked doors to even more crafting supplies! from the raw intensity of survival to the quiet intimacy of its emotional moments, the last of us part i remains unmatched. it's not just entertainment it's a transformative experience that elevates the medium of video games into genuine art. simply put, this isn't just my favorite gameit's an essential experience that i believe everyone should live at least once."
