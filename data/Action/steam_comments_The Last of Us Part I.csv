"The Last Of Us has been one of the game that I'm really eager to try. Finally got to try it after a year and multiple patches. Safe to say, the game runs great now and it has one of the most stunning graphics to this date. It has great character details, environmental details and even the lighting and reflection. The story is one of the most highly praise single-player game out there and let me tell you it's really justified. The story is really well written, it's slow build-up all the way to it's ambiguous ending is really interesting. The additional DLC also does contributes more to Ellie's background as a whole. 

The soundtrack also compliments well with the overall game and In terms of the gameplay, it's really impressive. Everything from the body movement to the gun-fight. It's just so satisfying. There's actually body-weight on your character and the resources are limited making you think before using them. The body explosion and even ragdoll animation is fantastic. Also, here's something Ubisoft should take note regarding their infamous ""collectibles"". Make them related to the characters so there's a reason we would want to collect them. I would actually go out of my way to explore and look for collectibles and sometimes, the collectibles can even form a storyline itself. That's what I call great storytelling. 

For me, The Last Of Us is definitely one of the most immersive game that I have ever played. The whole game just felt like watching a long movie and it's really heart-warming watching Joel & Ellie grew closer and closer as the story progressed. The game has everything right, great characters, great story, great soundtrack and even in terms of gameplay it's definitely one of the best out there. It's a solid [b]10/10[/b]. It has some minor bugs but it's definitely worth the money and you should definitely try it.",True,8,0,2025-02-16 14:06:21
"[h1]A Masterpiece with a Few Hiccups[/h1]

The Last of Us is an absolute gem that delivers a breathtaking experience from start to finish. Here’s what makes it stand out:

✅ Stunning Graphics – The level of detail in environments, lighting, and character models is simply top-notch. Every scene feels alive and immersive.
✅ Satisfying Gameplay – The shooting mechanics are tight and responsive, making every encounter feel intense. Plus, melee combat is brutal and impactful. Taking down enemies with powerful weapons, like a shotgun, is especially satisfying...the way bodies tear apart feels just as cool as slashing through foes in RDR2.
Ubisoft should take notes and learn to create proper effects like this.

However, a couple of things slightly hold it back:

❌ Fewer Enemies Than Expected – I was expecting for Days Gone-style massive hordes, but the enemy count felt lower than anticipated. While each encounter is intense, I wanted more zombies to fight.
❌ Shader Compilation Takes Ages – The first launch (and if there's any update) felt like I was booting game on a floppy disk from the early '90s. Seriously, it took forever and it's not a peasant's rig (i9 + RTX 4080 + 48GB RAM).",True,20,3,2025-02-04 13:09:48
"The Last of Us is an amazing game on console; however, on PC, it is a different story. My PC meets the requirements for the game to run. However, The Last of Us constantly crashes at the graveyard.

"Game was outstanding (didn't notice any of the game stability issues that early reviews cited)
Music, story, and graphics were incredible, and difficulty throughout was challenging but fair (played on hard difficulty)
DLC was fairly incredible (with the caveat that one combat sequence felt insanely punishing) but also had an evasion mechanic that was both horrifying and realistic (I kinda looked away from the screen because it was really jarring)
I also played the game entirely with the lights shut off for max immersion, highly recommend
Only real complaints were the one combat sequence from DLC and the bow and arrow weapon which feels weirdly difficult to use - 9.5/10",True,2,0,2025-02-04 00:23:03
"The Last Of Us is not just another zombie game. It’s a beautiful story about loss and what it takes to survive and to protect the ones you love. The beautiful world shows how nature takes over during an apocalypse. Everything looks so realistic, the face expressions, you can clearly see the emotions in the characters faces, the voice acting, the nature and buildings but also the combat. There are limited resources you find during the game, like ammo and health, which makes you think before acting. You can choose to play the game aggressively with guns and melee combat or choose for stealth. The game has a lot of collectible you can collect. Each collectible tells you a story which adds more realism in the world of the game. The Left Behind dlc is also included which I think was a beautiful add on to Ellie’s story before the events of the main game. Also the music alone is just so beautiful. I listen to the music regularly and I think I can say it’s the best soundtrack I have ever heard. 

I played the game on my Steam Deck and it played pretty good. Nothing really to complain. I do have to say that it looks better on PS5 and the haptic feedback plus adaptive triggers was something I missed during my play through on the Steam Deck

"Well, the story is so-so. Not great, not really bad. Not the revelation many people claim it to be either. Stealth is sometimes pretty good, sometimes meh and sometimes unsustainable. Some non-stealth encounters are just screwed up totally, where the only chance you have is to learn the timing and then perform according to it. That is not a shooter, that is some boring, repetitive thing. 
Overall, worth it somewhat if you do not have anything better. But do not expect too much. Oh, and while Ellie is ok and sometimes engaging or even funny, the Joel is just a moron with too much aggression and not enough brains.",False,1,0,2025-02-15 08:02:14

"My Score: 9.5/10

Without a doubt, this game has successfully revisited the horror survival genre. A different Resident Evil if you will. One with great depth, story telling and atmosphere. It has established itself to be one of the best games in that field, if not one of the best modern games that combines a great gaming experience with solid well written story telling. I do like the game, at least Part 1 a lot better than the TV series. 

Positives:
+ Incredible atmosphere
+ Amazing up to date graphics
+ Amazing novel like quality writing 
+ You get to kill other (bad) humans which adds a whole new factor and experience into the horror zombies genre
+ The game allows superb tactical depth: You may go stealth  and attack from behind. You can also knife zombies from behind
+ Shooting has a more realistic touch
+ Great finale * 

Negatives: 
- Insufficient footsteps, or it might be my ears. Especially human enemies feel like they are wearing rubber shoes
- It packs a lot of content and world environment, however, it did feel a bit short
- * The finale was pretty solid. Some parts felt rushed and unanswered. Although the ending was generally ""good"", like a movie ending, I felt a bit unsatisfied. Maybe in my subconscious I expected a giant final boss or something

I highly recommend this game, even if you are not familiar with survival horror or anything. It is like a great book or movie that you should not miss. I'm thankful for the game and I would have loved the pc port to come out sooner. Happy to pay full price for high quality games, period.",True,1,0,2025-02-16 03:10:33

"This game deserves a genuine place in the single player hall of fame and whilst this port has its ups and downs. I would buy this game and 100% it all over again. I ran this game on a 7800x3d & 4080 Super at 4k res native, no upscaling at a constant 70fps (pretty good!). 

Pros: 
         - Game is very fluid, Minimal crashing (only crashed 2 or 3 times at the start when i first uninstalled afterwards 
            flawless), Stunning graphics
         - DLSS 4 looks just as good at native in most cases
         - FSR 3.1 implentation gives more fps than DLSS 4, even on a 40 series card

Cons: 
        - First things first, this game is very VRAM dependent, BUT if you turn down textures it should fix it 
        - The gameplay, you're very locked into whatever move or keybind you press, no canceling a action. 
        - On grounded mode, the human ai literally have aimbot and whether you pass the encounter or not depends on luck 
           and if you figure out how to path the ai to sneak around or line up for you to kill them. \
        - FSR 3.1 has noticable shimmers in water and certain corners
        - No frame gen + upscaling implementation
        - Some places in the starting city and stairs you can pass through that flash bang your screen with glitched (NO or all 
           white) textures
        - Some optional conversations in Pittsburg can glitch out and not count causing you to have to go back through and 
            retrigger them ):

"While the port for this game experienced a disastrous launch back in 2023, and much of the criticism it received for that port was certainly well deserved, I feel that Sony and Naughty Dog have done a decent job of fixing this port. While all the crashing issues and general gameplay bugs have been fixed (I experienced only one crash and few gameplay bugs during my time playing this over two systems of varying power), I still think this port doesnt quite perform as well as it should on lower end hardware, but that seems to be an issue across the gaming industry these days (looking at you, UE5). Having played this on my somewhat dated gaming laptop with a 6 gig 3060, this game performed rather poorly at 1080p low settings, and my nearly maxing out my VRAM usage I could get 60-70 fps medium-high settings with frame generation enabled, which is decent but it's clear how out of reach these games are becoming for budget gamers. Now, on my new system, this game runs at an easy 100 fps average at 1440p ultra (on a 7900xt). So I applaud the devs for doing their best to fix the game post launch, but I can help but feel bitter that they managed to botch this game so badly at launch, and I have to wonder why they can't just port the original to Steam, also, so budget gamers can still enjoy this amazing work of art without having to worry about their systems overheating when they launch the thing.

But, in any case, this review is not about the technical aspects of the PC port, though they are worthy of a discussion. For me, having never played this game before (or having never played a Naughty Dog game in general) and only being able to watch people play it for many years, it was a pleasure to play this game after the devs spent some time fixing it up. The Last of Us, no matter how you slice it, is one of gaming's greatest accomplishments and has influenced many of the best story-driven games of the past decade. It's influence can be felt all over, from these new Star Wars games to even God of War. It is difficult to imagine gaming in the modern day without the influence of Naughty Dog.

The Last of Us needs no explanation. If by this point you haven't played the game, watched a playthrough, or seen the show, you must've been living under a rock. The acting, the dialogue, the writing, the level design, the pacing of the game, the soundtrack, the visuals... the entire experience is a masterclass. While The Last of Us and its kin have never been a very gameplay-first sort of experience, the actual gameplay loop is still fairly satisfying, with most of the intrigue coming from the level design and less so the actual combat itself (similar to Half-Life). But even so, with combat arguably being the weakest aspect of this game, it doesn't taint or diminish the experience. You play Last of Us for the story. And what a story it is.

I won't ramble on for hours, mostly because Steam won't let me and because many people more qualified than me have already said all there is to say on this game long before I ever even played it. But if you have a decent system and some extra cash, then play this game if you haven't yet. It's an experience you won't forget, and I have certainly had this game in the back of my mind for years ever since I first saw others play it way back in the day. One of my favorite games of all time, and perhaps the best video game narrative besides RDR2 and Witcher 3. 10/10, though I still wish we had the original and that this port was more impressive than it is.",True,0,0,2025-02-18 17:05:12

"10/10 game play and story. If you have yet to experience The Last of Us, you are missing out.
I have seen many reviews talking about the ""compiling shaders"" and constant crashing and FPS issues.
Let me give you some tips from my personal experience:
If you have an older graphics card, say 10 or 20 series, you will NEED to be OK playing on 1080p low-med settings.
Personally I have a RTX 3080 (with 10gbs of VRAM), Ryzen 9 7900X with 32gbs of DDR5 playing at 1440p (2K) getting anywhere from 90-120fps at ultra with SOME of the very demanding VRAM settings on high. My VRAM as well as my RAM is getting eaten alive most of the time, with even 10gbs of my RAM being used while I play the game.
I realized through some trial and error that the game likes to crash if I don't allow for at least an extra 1-1.5gbs of VRAM. For example, in the game settings it tells me I'm using about 8.5 total. Now I still have experienced  a single crash upon chapter changes. Meaning, I'll play through a whole section of the game just fine (hours of game play) only to be CTD upon a transitional cutscene to a new chapter of the game. 
Another note is I am using the AMD FSR 3.1 WITH FRAME GEN TURNED ON. I do not know if that works with RTX 20 series cards. However, the game would be unplayable for me personally if I did not use AMD's frame gen. The game still looks AMAZING and I have all my settings on native resolutions for everything. As far as the compiling shaders issue, I don't quite know. I have the game installed on a Samsung NVME M.2 drive and it only compiled the shaders once taking about 5 mins total. I have been playing the game regularly the last week so I don't know if I took a break that the shaders would recompile or not. To be clear, I have cleared my RAM and shut my PC off completely between play sessions and my game has yet to say it's compiling shaders since the first time I launched it last week.
My final conclusions are, I probably wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have AT LEAST a GPU with 10gbs of VRAM. My RTX 3080 would struggle if I didn't have the AMD FSR 3.1 turned on. In my personal opinion ""struggle"" means gets less than 60FPS at high-ultra settings in 1440p. 
I originally played this game on a PS4 Pro and it doesn't even compare to how amazing it looks on PC. A totally different experience.
In my final conclusion if graphics are king to you don't bother buying this game without AT LEAST an RTX 3080.",True,0,0,2025-02-17 04:50:43

Everything in this game is done perfectly, you will never have the feeling that you are playing a game.

The graphics, the music, the concepts... are amazing.
All the mechanics correspond to locations that are different from each other and have a unique atmosphere.

It is very interesting to see how the relationship between Ellie and Joel develops, from mere strangers to family relatives. And to watch how the world around them is cruel and affects their journey. You will need a few days or weeks to think about the game after you finish it, and I think that is the best metric for how touching and unforgettable the story is.

the left behind is very short. 

my wife is not a gamer and the TV show we watched together then the she watched me play through the game and she is impressed how well the TV show is to the game. 

Worth 100% of the cost. even though total play through time is definitely not 1hr of game time per $1 spent. However the quality is amazing.

the extra features are really cool

i played with mouse and kb as im very bad at aiming with controller.  However the game works just fine. i will say to match muscle memory with other FPS or even 3rd person shoorts you will need to do a lot of button remapping as the multiple weapon types they are not keybord designed.

the game is yes originally console they put no effort in making it for mousen in kb. so that will take some at the beggining to remap and make it feel mroe kb friendly.

"""WOW!!!""

Is something that ""The Last of Us"" had me saying countless times! This game is not for the weak, I personally am a HUGE fan of ""Naughty Dog"" and their previous IP's (shout out to Jak & Daxter and Uncharted) but these games are TREMENDOUSLY different while all being great games in their own domain. TLOU uses the same engine utilized in the ""Uncharted"" games, a phenomenal 3rd person perspective that it's so well done,  it makes you feel as if you too are dodging the clickers with Joel and Ellie.  The melee combat is very intense, I feel the weight of each swing from Joel's fists, each filled with such anger and vigor, so much pent up aggression. 

However this game is so much darker than I could have imagined, the themes of sorrow, sacrifice, love and survival are heavily explored in this game. The game jumps you right into it! Be prepared for an intense opening prologue that is ruthless, a great taste of what is to come in this game. So many actions that these characters do make me question my moral's and what I would do if I was thrown into a post apocalyptic world. A cruel and unforgiving world where my family is long gone and I am fighting every day for my survival. All in all, whether you feel that their actions are justified or not, the writing is so well done that you can't help but reason with the choices they commit too. 


I love TLOU, it's a game I wish I could play for the first time all over again because of how traumatic the weight of the climatic moments in this game are. They can not be recreated, play it for yourself, hell it took me 5 remasters and the game being out for over a decade to finally try this masterpiece but I finally did it and I do not regret it one bit. All in all, this is a game I would EASILY recommend to even the most casual gamer who is OK with mature elements depicted in a story.

"The Last of Us Part I is a masterpiece that blends captivating storytelling with impeccable gameplay. From the get-go, the game delivers a fantastic experience, highlighted by superlative graphics and smooth performance—there are no frustrating FPS drops, ensuring an immersive and uninterrupted adventure.

The sound design is another standout element, enhancing the tension throughout the game. Every eerie whisper and sudden screamer is crafted to elevate the atmosphere, keeping players on the edge of their seats. This attention to detail extends to the gameplay itself, which is both engaging and well-balanced. There are no boring tasks to detract from the experience; instead, the game maintains a constant, gripping tension.

At the heart of the narrative is the beautifully developed relationship between the two main characters. Their story is filled with depth and emotion, supported by outstanding character development that truly brings the game to life. Additionally, the monster designs are impressive—each encounter is crafted to instill fear, with sounds that are as chilling as they are memorable.

Overall, The Last of Us Part I offers a superb gaming experience that combines excellent performance, stunning visuals, and a compelling narrative. It’s a game that not only entertains but also emotionally engages players, setting a high standard for storytelling and design in the gaming industry.

"Cinematic movie game where you push forward most of the time. I'd equate playing The Last of Us to being a guest on a tour: It's a linear, hand-holding experience where you are constantly guided by the invisible hand of the game devs. They design levels in such a way to guide the player to certain paths and interactive moments and hide other resources and interact-ables just a little bit off the intended path for more curious players (or for players who have played games before). The gameplay can be boiled down to: Walk through corridor; Search room and press triangle for supplies; Continue walking through corridor; Encounter a ledge too high for you to climb so you press triangle on the ledge and give Ellie a boost up so she can open an alternate path for you or you press triangle on a dumpster and push it to climb up the ledge; Enemy encounter; Cutscene; Rinse and repeat. The game is quite forgiving when it comes to resource management, if you can call it that. You really won't be struggling with ammo or crafting weapons. It's just for an experienced gamer, it feels too rigid. There isn't much for ones agency, because so much of the game is scripted; The gameplay aspects are too superficial, like, the crafting and resource management, to be anything interesting. The one draw for any person for this game is the story. This is a heavily story-driven game. While I can say the story is derivative, it is a story that WORKS and one that is superbly acted. These are characters, safe to say, you WILL be engaged by and, Joel and Ellie, you will love. If only gameplay and story were actually entwined. It's a mainstream, casual game. For newbies or casual gamers, The Last of Us is a graphically stunning 3rd person shooter with some light elements of survival horror.

"First played this on default difficulty, and then reduced it to ""very easy ""for gameplay issues.

Generally, I don't play horror themed games. However, from friend's suggestion, I decided to try it out, especially since it was on a sale at the time.
Unfortunately, despite the fame, it fell flat to the expectations. After trudging through clunky gameplay and being appalled at the unrealistic human elements, I reduced this game as a visual novel style game with some gameplay aspects. Even then, the plot was not strong enough to consider this as a great visual novel game.

From my impression, since the game's strongpoint is seeing Joel's growing relationship with Ellie, I would suggest watching the tv show instead. (the friend, who suggested me to play this game, watched the show) From what I have heard from their review, there were more human-like elements, that were severely lacking in the game)

- Impressed with the setting; how this game was created in 2013; felt like it vaguely foreshadowed 2020.
- Lots of accessibility settings
- Watching Joel's relationship grow with Ellie was the strongest tug boat that pulled this game
- Favorite boss fight = David vs. Ellie
- Characters lack survival-like behaviors, which prevented me from connecting/relating to them
- NPC behavior is conflicting that made battling/stealth a pain

There is an area I was particularly didn't like about the game, and it was the discrepancy of the realism art from the unrealistic human behavior and actions of these models. Because of this, I could only perceive these characters as ""models that look like human beings."" 
- Despite labeling as a survival game, the protagonists show no urgency. Joel never eats (only saw one cut scene of him holding an opened can of food), he generally only eats pills throughout the game. In the second portion of the story, where it introduced hunters, it felt disconnecting to see graffiti writing out how the people are starving, when I'm playing a character that show zero signs of hunger
- None of the characters drinks water, or even considers searching for food until after they go into Wyoming (if they didn't meet Henry or Sam, they probably would've kept walking on without thinking of food)
- Sleep deprived (would have liked to see more longer sleeping scenes, or treat a bed as an alternative healing mechanism)
- Food survival is mentioned, yet there is a cut scene where Ellie is seen playing with food (throwing blueberries and catching in the mouth). The lack of survival urgency and the disrespect of food treatment was incredible)
- Most of the time, these characters walked on foot. I was in disbelief, when they walked from Pennsylvania to Wyoming. That is nearly a month of walking. I was already skeptical that they walked from Boston to Pennsylvania, this was way out of my credible bar

A quarter way through the game I dropped the idea that this game is NOT a survival game, but skewed more on combat survival, but that was also not the case either.
I initially played this at default difficulty. For the most part, the combat was an appropriate level. The game offers two fighting methods, but more than half of the time stealth battle wins most of the strategies. This tends to be a problem, when the following NPCs are acting unrealistic in this area as well
- I'm stealthing and creeping around as quietly as I could, and at the corner of my eye I see the following NPC (Ellie, for example) darts in the enemies' walking line of sight -- and the enemy doesn't notice. It's very discouraging when I'm doing my best to hide
- NPC enemies: more than 90% only cares about the playable character's movement. There is only a few parts, where suddenly other NPCs' health mattered. As a result, this also reduces my mindset on survival urgency once more
- The straw that broke the camel's back is the hotel. Joel can craft bombs and has seen pry open abandoned elevator doors. Why did he suddenly become a civil human being and look for a card key and generator to activate this one door? The massive disbelief I got when I had a full stock of nail bombs but that impregnable door would not budge

Fortunately, decreasing the game's difficulty settings to the easiest level allowed more legroom to forgive these gameplay issues, so that helped me from DNF'ing.",False,1,2,2025-02-18 00:50:08
This game was a 10/10 on ps3. It’s 10/10 on ps5. Now I’m playing it on pc and still a 10/10. One of the best stories ever told in my opinion.,True,1,0,2025-01-29 02:57:50
"Amazing game. 
What else to say that hasn't been said yet?

One thing I don't understand is why a 4Gb GPU as minimal spec if the game uses more than 5Gb of VRAM on low settings at 1080p?

It runs smooth on my RTX 3060 OC in high settings plus DLSS on quality either at 1080p or 1440p. But running this game on my GTX 1650 laptop is painful. Everything on low and FSR on Performance damages the visual fidelity so much and creates such an input lag that doesn't allow you to enjoy this game fully as it was intended. It is pleasant if played on a SteamDeck, locked at 30 FPS, as with the small screen and lower resolution helps with that but at 1080p with a GTX 1650 forget it.

By all means play it, if it's the only GPU you have, but bear in mind that it needs at least 6Gb of VRAM to make the experience enjoyable. Games like Days Gone, Uncharted, Detroit and God Of War run better on the GTX 1650. Even  Cyberpunk with FSR 3 on native AA runs better.",True,0,0,2025-02-25 07:52:55
"Overall, I enjoyed TLOU but with some caveats.

To be honest, I hated it for the first few hours. You don't get many weapons or much ammo, which is fine per se, but it plays like a stealth/melee based game for a while there... while lacking much of any decent stealth or melee mechanics. The camera pans slow, there's no block or dodge button, and enemies clownhouse around you. They don't give you many decent places to hide. Enemies don't follow movement patterns and will randomly turn around and are VERY aggro for melee. You can throw objects to distract them, but you can only carry one throwable object at a time. All this had be pretty frustrated for the first few hours. Once you get more weapons, you're more free to shoot your way out of the situations, but at best the combat mechanics are pretty flat IMO.

Past that, the story and setting develop into an immersive experience that leaves you thinking. Characters are notably expressive; this story is all about learning to find meaning again, to get close to another person emotionally, and watching those characters develop towards that concept. The world design is pretty great too, especially with the changing seasons and varied scenes. I loved progressing through the world and its struggles. Both friends and foes are designed with depth and it is not uncommon to blur the lines of good or evil, friend or foe. Moral ambiguity always makes a story and its characters more interesting, and TLOU does this beautifully.

In terms of graphics, I was able to run it maxed in 4k no issues on a 4080 super, using DLSS 4 which wasn't a compromise given the honestly off-putting sharpening effect the visuals had at most times anyway. It wasn't as noticeable during the winter scenes, but this game really could have been a 10/10 on graphics if not for this fact. This becomes more apparent on a larger screen closer up, and higher resolution doesn't help the issue the way it does for TAA blur/smear found in a lot of other games. The image was probably meant to be viewed on a TV as distance. I don't know why they used so much sharpening, perhaps to fake detail back from some kind of TAA implementation.

In sum, at the end I found myself craving more of the plot despite having had enough of the combat. TLOU is one of the few games where the cutscenes and more passive, cinematic segments are the strongest points IMO, and those points are strong enough to outweigh the weak areas.",True,0,0,2025-02-25 03:12:14

"[h3]The Last of Us, Part I[/h3]

I thought I couldn't finish it the first time I played this series (Part II), two years ago. Back then, I was a rookie who had never played any AAA-quality game before, and this was my first experience with this genre. I wondered if I should leave a review in English after finishing it, as a way to show respect to the game and the developers behind the scenes.

Before deciding to retry the game, I watched an entire playthrough with no commentary and also saw the HBO series adaptation. I thought I was well-prepared for the content and ready to enjoy the story without feeling too much stress.

Okay, enough nonsense—let’s get into it.

The first half of the game is a bit slow-paced, probably because its core mechanics and story structure are quite different from other similar games or films. The relationship between Ellie and Joel is both complex and distorted. The core mechanics require significant time investment to become comfortable, demanding a lot of immersion from the audience.

However, if you stay engaged and take note of subtle hints hidden in the environment—before combat even begins—you'll start to unlock the true fun of the game. That said, it's not an easy task for most players. For example, I personally needed visual cues to catch on to the embedded environmental storytelling. Some parts of the game seem designed for audiences to experience multiple times to fully appreciate.

I’ve listened to Evan Hill’s talks on level design several times and came to understand the incredible effort Naughty Dog poured into it. Their approach to level design surpasses what most studios are capable of. In my view, the level design is one of the most crucial elements that connects directly to Neil Druckmann's ultimate vision, making it the ""heart"" of the game.

The second half of the game is where the ""real meat"" lies, as the evolving relationship between Ellie and Joel becomes more apparent. This is likely why the game is beloved by so many players. Rather than focusing on every single plot detail, the story uses mirrors—similar relationships and others' loss of hope—to reinforce the trust between Joel and Ellie.

That trust is ultimately tested in the story's climax, creating an unforgettable emotional impact.

[b]""Flaws in a masterpiece don't overshadow its brilliance.""[/b]

One of the flaws I noticed was the game's difficulty curve. Even late in the game, it introduces new weapons to the player. While this has its advantages, as with any game design, ""everything is just trade-offs."" I believe there was room to experiment with new strategies for pacing these introductions. However, it may be a case of ""it's the end of the story, Ellie is on the verge of death, who the hell cares about gunfights now?"" scenario—fair enough.",True,0,0,2025-02-06 01:00:30

"The Last of Us Part 1 on PC – A Beautiful Journey, Now With Fewer Stumbles 🍂🧟‍♂️
Alright, I’ve spent around 3 hours with The Last of Us Part 1 on PC, and while I’ve played it a lot on console (probably more than I should admit), I’m going to compare this version to that. So, if you’ve played the console version, you’re in for a bit of a comparison here, but let’s talk about how the PC version has held up.

A Masterpiece That’s Still Worth Your Time 💔

If you’ve played The Last of Us, you already know what you’re in for. The story, the characters, the heart-wrenching moments—this game is a cinematic masterpiece that pulls at your heartstrings. Joel and Ellie’s journey is a ride of pure emotion, and the bond between them? Unforgettable. It’s one of the best narratives in gaming history, hands down.

The gameplay holds up, too. The mix of combat, stealth, and resource management is still top-notch, and the environmental storytelling is as immersive as ever. You’ll find yourself constantly pausing just to appreciate the little details the world offers whether it’s the debris-strewn streets or the quiet moments between characters.

How Does the PC Version Hold Up Now? 💻⚙️

Now, if you’re a first-time player, you’re in for a treat. The visuals are absolutely stunning. The improved textures, lighting, and environmental details make the game look even better than it did on console. And honestly, there’s something special about seeing the overgrown world in high resolution on a big screen.

But, here’s where I have to address the elephant in the room—yes, performance. When this game first released on PC, it was a bit of a mess. There were a lot of stuttering and frame drops, which made the experience a bit rocky, even for higher-end PCs. But, since then, Naughty Dog has been actively patching the game, and the latest updates (like 1.1.4) have made a significant difference. The game is definitely much smoother now. The introduction of AMD FSR 3.1 Super Resolution and Frame Generation has helped improve performance, and the game runs much better for most players now.

It’s not perfect yet, but the improvements are clear. If you’re running a decent rig, you should have a much smoother experience than when the game first launched. The stuttering is still there occasionally, but it’s not as intrusive. If you’ve got a high-end GPU, you’ll likely see solid performance with the latest settings updates.

The Good, the Bad, and the Clickers 🧟‍♂️💥

The core gameplay still shines. The stealth is tense, the combat is satisfying, and the emotional beats hit hard, whether you’re navigating a dangerous world or crafting a few makeshift weapons. The AI is as clever as ever, and you’ll never quite feel safe, even when you think you’re in control. The crafting system remains just as satisfying as it was on PS4, and the limited resources keep you on your toes.

But while the gameplay is great, it’s hard to ignore those performance inconsistencies from time to time. It’s way better now than it was at launch, but if you're a perfectionist looking for a flawless PC experience, there’s still some room for improvement. That said, the updates are promising, and it's definitely playable now with fewer hiccups.

Is It Worth It on PC? 🤷‍♂️

If you’ve already played The Last of Us on console, this version is definitely worth revisiting. The improved visuals, along with the story that’s still as gripping as ever, make this a must-play. Just don’t expect a perfect PC experience just yet there are still some rough edges, but the patches have come a long way in smoothing things out.

For new players, it’s a great way to experience a modern classic, and the visual upgrades will definitely enhance the experience. The game is just as emotional and immersive as it ever was, and you’ll be hooked from start to finish.

8/10 – A classic that’s finally running smoother. With some tweaks, this could be a flawless experience, but even as it stands, it’s still a must-play. Just be prepared for occasional performance hiccups (which are getting better!). 🎮💔

"[h1]One of the best games of the PlayStation 3 era[/h1]

The Last of Us Part I is an action-adventure game set in an post apocalyptic setting. The remake is visualy stunning with a very well written story and unforgetable characters. The PC port runs very well after the recent patches, you still need a pretty beefy computer to run it properly. This was, of course, not a problem for me after I got my new rig.

[b]Positives:[/b]

+ The whole game feels like a movie, loading transitions are seamless. 
+ Great protagonists and acting performances.
+ Amazing story with a lot of twists and turns, there is a lot of emotional depth.
+ After completing the game once you unlock the game modifiers that allow you to use in-game cheats for an easier experience.
+ The DLC Left Behind is a nice addition to the game and comes included in the PC version.

[b]Negatives[/b]

- A few minor bugs here and there (Ellie can block you if you get stuck in a tight spot/technical glitch)
- There is no easy way to get collectibles if you miss some, you'll have to load the manual save if there is one.

[b]Overall:[/b]

A game that every gamer should experince atleast once. It clocks at around ~12h + ~2h for the dlc so I would recommend to get it on sale, atleast -50% off.

"The Last of Us Part 1 was a game that at first I was sceptical about buying. After reading several reviews on this game I can to the conclusion that it was a game riddled with bugs, performance issues and also had many crash problems. However I still had high expectations for this game. After maybe a year of the game rotting in my wishlist like most of my games there do I finally bought it and I have zero regrets. 

The Last of Us Part 1 is story telling at its best. I think I heard somewhere on the internet that the game ""has a simple story but complex characters"" and I think this is what makes the game story so great. Throughout the game you see Ellie and Joel's relationship changing as they first hate each other and then start to like each other and end up see each other as family near the end. The exchange of dialogue in this game feels like actual conversations you would see in real life with each characters face having realistic human facial expressions and body language. They speak like real people, with interruptions and pauses and imperfections in their speech which makes the conversations feel more natural. The game goes into great detail in these exchanges of dialogue, for example when Joel and Ellie are talking, Joel gets reminded of his daughter Sarah and glances down at the watch she gave to him before the apocalypse started. There are countless more details and definitely more that I have not even noticed but might in a second play through. As mentioned the story is simple which is great, because its easy to follow along and engage your self in it.

A lot of people say that graphics don't mean anything in a game, and its all about gameplay and story. And I agree to an extent, but the graphics in this game are mind blowing and it really immerses you into the environment. I am sure I would still consider this game to be a masterpiece with much more toned down graphics, but the graphics really excel the game. I could not tell you the amount of times I stood in an area to look at the details in the environment. I must of taken 100+ screenshots of the environment throughout my playthrough. However there are a few small issues that I noticed throughout my play through. I did notice that some of the mirrors in the game reflected my character in a way which made it look quite pixilated, however I do specifically remember in the introduction in this game before the apocalypse the mirrors reflected the character nearly perfectly, however this is such a small issue where I simply do not care. I did also find it a tiny bit odd how the puddles of water would reflect the environment around it but not the player. This is another really minor issue that I really think does not matter in the slightest and it might of even just been my settings.

The gameplay I think is the weakest part of the game, but I would say its still great. The combat is nearly perfect and feels smooth and satisfying. The game almost always gives you the choice to either go guns blazing into an area or go as stealthily as possible, slowly picking off enemy AI. Crafting items and choosing when and what item to use in a certain situation adds some more depth to the game play and you can also upgrade your weapons at an upgrade bench, however I did find that I did not use this too much and I had more than enough resources to upgrade my weapons even on the hard difficulty. And if you are struggling to find items and are finding the combat scenes too hard, you can easily turn down the difficulty to suit you best. Personally I stuck on the hard difficulty throughout the playthrough as it felt perfectly fitted to me. Some of the game play does feel very the same throughout the whole game. For example in the water sections you will almost always need to find a raft to bring Ellie across a body of water since she cant swim. It does get repetitive but its not a deal breaker and usually the post apocalyptic environment around me would distract me from getting bored because of just how good it looked. I also need to quickly mention that the transitions of game play to cut scenes are almost seamless.

Anyways, The Last of Us is an amazing game in blending storytelling with gameplay. The story is incredibly gripping and easy to follow along. This is a must play game for me for anyone who is considering it. The game has few bugs throughout and the few that I experienced did not effect my experience with the game a whole lot. The game is definitely in a lot better place when it first launched on PC. I would also say that the £50 price tag is a bit too much. I bought the game on sale for £24 and I would say that, that price is fitting for the game. I just don't think you get enough play time for the money spent. Aside from that, this game is a 9.5/10 for me. Play it if you can.

"One of the greatest singleplayer games I have experienced. I was immersed in the story from start to finish, its Brilliant",True,47,2,2025-01-28 08:53:38
"Brilliant game, even years later. Can't wait for Part 2 to release on PC and Part 3 at some point on Playstation. The HBO TV series is great too.",True,19,2,2024-12-21 19:10:35
"This game is more than a decade old now and it easily beats the majority of games that come out today. In terms of storywriting this is such a heavy hitter, it really can not be overstated. There's really very few games that you hit you in the guts like this and are so close to realism and relatability. You can really tell that the game is basically made with an actual filmmaking approach in every aspect of it. 
The amount of work they have sunk into this is astonishing and the only other game company that we know this kind of quality from is Rockstar Games. 

[h3]Immersion[/h3]
It's always so much detail where you wouldn't normally expect a game to have it, which makes it such a rich experience. 
The way the characters reload and handle guns, how guns are dismantled on a workbench, how tense dialogue becomes during fights. The entire game is acted by absolute professionals. 
Lots of minor things all add up and come together to really pull you in deep.
The melee fights are so messy that they sure seem very real, because there is always that random factor of taking an unexpected hit or missing a swing, symbolizing how chaotic and frantic a real life fight to the death would be. 
The death scenes are also very disturbing, because they made no compromise on how unforgivingly vicious reality can be.

[h3] The Graphics & Scenery[/h3]
The visuals are incredible in this new version and look pretty good even on lower settings. It feels very scenic with these huge locations and how the backgrounds are woven into the scenes make this single pathway game feel like an open world game for a lot of it. The maps are constructed in a way that there is always at least 2, if not 3-4 ways to advance, basically never giving you the feeling you're just channeled through the experience on rails, even though it technically is a strict one way path game.

[h3]The Gameplay Mechanics[/h3] 
The gameplay itself is so fluent and polished. There is never a way that the characters move in a weird way. They have gone over this thousands of times to ensure that the way items are picked up look natural and every character move happens in a natural motion. The whole gameplay just rolls. It's so smooth.

[b][u]And again[/u]:[/b] The only other game that I know that feels this polished and smooth is RDR2. And this game came out a good 5 years before Red Dead Redemption 2.

[h3]My Expectations Going Into It[/h3]
Having only played the Last of Us Part II when it came out, I was going into Part I with the expectation of it having to be like a simpler and downgraded experience in some ways, since it came out a decade prior to the sequel. [b]But it actually wasn't at all[/b]. This still very much feels like a fresh and new game and is absolutely in line with most of the gameplay from Part II.

[h3]The Performance Can Be Very Problematic[/h3]
I think the way it used my system for FPS was quite optimized, but for me the game just didn't run stable for long periods of time. The game kept crashing on various occasions, making me play it in 20 / 30 / 45 minute increments sometimes. In the end I had to remove all my overclocks on CPU, GPU and RAM to play this in 1 hour increments basically. Essentially downgrading my performance from 1440p almost ultra settings in 60fps to 1080p high settings on 50fps. It was very annoying, because I could not figure out what exactly it was and all online threads about it were just as clueless. I could not fix it entirely, but it didn't keep me from enjoying and finishing the game. Fortunately it does have a very good autosave feature and it does save fairly often and quickly. Basically before and after every single cutscene and action that takes place. So at least I never really lost any progress. 
If I wasn't so crazy for this game, I would consider this an actual dealbreaker and I'm sure many people do. So only purchase with caution.
I'm not sure how much of this is related to my hardware, because I've seen many posts from people with basically brand new systems having the exact same issues.
I really hope Part II doesn't have these kinds of issues when it comes out.

"The Last of Us Part I is basically an emotional masterclass in how to wreck your soul. The graphics? Gorgeous. The story? Unmatched. Joel and Ellie’s journey? Perfection. But let’s not pretend Naughty Dog wasn’t trying to turn us all into a sobbing mess on purpose.

Now, do we really need a full-priced remake of a game that already looked amazing? Probably not. But did I still throw my money at it, replay it, and cry like it was my first breakup all over again? Absolutely. If you haven’t played it yet, this is the best way to start. And if you have? Well, welcome back to heartbreak city.

"The Last Of Us has been one of the game that I'm really eager to try. Finally got to try it after a year and multiple patches. Safe to say, the game runs great now and it has one of the most stunning graphics to this date. It has great character details, environmental details and even the lighting and reflection. The story is one of the most highly praise single-player game out there and let me tell you it's really justified. The story is really well written, it's slow build-up all the way to it's ambiguous ending is really interesting. The additional DLC also does contributes more to Ellie's background as a whole. 

The soundtrack also compliments well with the overall game and In terms of the gameplay, it's really impressive. Everything from the body movement to the gun-fight. It's just so satisfying. There's actually body-weight on your character and the resources are limited making you think before using them. The body explosion and even ragdoll animation is fantastic. Also, here's something Ubisoft should take note regarding their infamous ""collectibles"". Make them related to the characters so there's a reason we would want to collect them. I would actually go out of my way to explore and look for collectibles and sometimes, the collectibles can even form a storyline itself. That's what I call great storytelling. 

For me, The Last Of Us is definitely one of the most immersive game that I have ever played. The whole game just felt like watching a long movie and it's really heart-warming watching Joel & Ellie grew closer and closer as the story progressed. The game has everything right, great characters, great story, great soundtrack and even in terms of gameplay it's definitely one of the best out there. It's a solid [b]10/10[/b]. It has some minor bugs but it's definitely worth the money and you should definitely try it.",True,8,0,2025-02-16 14:06:21
Definitely a game that lives up to the hype from a story perspective. It is slower paced on the game play front since it encourages you to conserve resources like ammo but I had no problem doing that as the story was really well developed and flowed better if you focused on stealth. You can feel the growth of Joel and Ellie individually as well as their relationship over the course of the game and I think everybody needs to play it through at least once. I didn't have any issues performance wise so no complaints there as well.,True,11,1,2025-01-23 21:32:02

"[h1]A Masterpiece with a Few Hiccups[/h1]

The Last of Us is an absolute gem that delivers a breathtaking experience from start to finish. Here’s what makes it stand out:

✅ Stunning Graphics – The level of detail in environments, lighting, and character models is simply top-notch. Every scene feels alive and immersive.
✅ Satisfying Gameplay – The shooting mechanics are tight and responsive, making every encounter feel intense. Plus, melee combat is brutal and impactful. Taking down enemies with powerful weapons, like a shotgun, is especially satisfying...the way bodies tear apart feels just as cool as slashing through foes in RDR2.
Ubisoft should take notes and learn to create proper effects like this.

However, a couple of things slightly hold it back:

❌ Fewer Enemies Than Expected – I was expecting for Days Gone-style massive hordes, but the enemy count felt lower than anticipated. While each encounter is intense, I wanted more zombies to fight.
❌ Shader Compilation Takes Ages – The first launch (and if there's any update) felt like I was booting game on a floppy disk from the early '90s. Seriously, it took forever and it's not a peasant's rig (i9 + RTX 4080 + 48GB RAM).",True,20,3,2025-02-04 13:09:48
"The Last of Us is an amazing game on console; however, on PC, it is a different story. My PC meets the requirements for the game to run. However, The Last of Us constantly crashes at the graveyard.

My system runs a Ryzen 7 3700x and an RX 6600, which should be more than enough for medium settings, but the game keeps crashing.",False,59,38,2025-01-28 00:01:26

"Initially having played the game back in 2020 on my PS4, this PC version also didn't disappoint me at all. In short: the game is just fascinating and I can highly recommend playing it. If you're into games with a post-apocalyptic setting that can captivate by its plot and emotional depth, this one is one of best in its genre (if not the best one).

The world has been wiped out by the Cordyceps fungus and now using different gameplay mechanics (stealth, exploration, fighting off infected and non-infected enemies, crafting tools, collecting limited supplies for them, upgrading weapons) you follow the bond that forms between main characters throughout their journey. I'd also like to emphasize separately the AI support - Ellie actively assisted me in combat and saved me from killing a few times.

The Left Behind DLC that focuses on Ellie’s backstory (how she was bitten and how she saved Joel) is a must play after the main story as this expansion complements it.

I also loved the soundtrack (primarily guitar melodies) and even added a few songs to my YT Music that I particularly liked.

I'd recommend playing on higher difficulty and without achievement hunting for the first time. Then, if you're into it, you can easily obtain 100% using chapter selection feature (although collectibles can take you some time). By the way, there's no multiplayer mode and difficulty-related achievements here comparing it with the PS4 version of the game, which makes the achievement hunting process a lot easier.",True,2,0,2025-01-10 10:29:48

"This game had a rough launch on PC but most if not all of the issues had been patched. As of December, 2024 the game is running flawlessly on Windows 11.

There's tons of useful accessibility options within the game, anything from helping disabled gamer or options to make the game easier for people who aren't familiar with action games. It's so nice to see these kind of options in-game.

Tons of PC specific graphical and control options to fully customise your experience on the PC which is so nice to see.

"A gorgeous and well-honed remake of one of the biggest boppers in the PlayStation pantheon, The Last of Us Part I is the best way to play – or replay – Naughty Dog’s esteemed survival classic. The striking improvements it makes to its completely rebuilt world are complemented by the subtle refinements of its characters’ performances, and while it isn’t retrofitted with every one of the sequel’s best changes, the upgrades to movement and AI make a welcome difference in an already outstanding game. It’s harder to argue it was an entirely crucial remake, though, considering 2014’s The Last of Us Remastered still stands head and shoulders above nearly all of its story-driven, action-adventure peers to this day.",True,2,0,2024-12-24 18:47:58

DLC was fairly incredible (with the caveat that one combat sequence felt insanely punishing) but also had an evasion mechanic that was both horrifying and realistic (I kinda looked away from the screen because it was really jarring)

"The Last Of Us is not just another zombie game. It’s a beautiful story about loss and what it takes to survive and to protect the ones you love. The beautiful world shows how nature takes over during an apocalypse. Everything looks so realistic, the face expressions, you can clearly see the emotions in the characters faces, the voice acting, the nature and buildings but also the combat. There are limited resources you find during the game, like ammo and health, which makes you think before acting. You can choose to play the game aggressively with guns and melee combat or choose for stealth. The game has a lot of collectible you can collect. Each collectible tells you a story which adds more realism in the world of the game. The Left Behind dlc is also included which I think was a beautiful add on to Ellie’s story before the events of the main game. Also the music alone is just so beautiful. I listen to the music regularly and I think I can say it’s the best soundtrack I have ever heard. 

I played the game on my Steam Deck and it played pretty good. Nothing really to complain. I do have to say that it looks better on PS5 and the haptic feedback plus adaptive triggers was something I missed during my play through on the Steam Deck

"This is more than just a game. This is an unforgettable experience from start to finish. When I first saw the E3 2012 demo, I was immediately captivated by how real the in-game mechanics looked. A year later, I bought the Limited Edition version on PS3 and was once again blown away by the prologue and how it really felt like you were participating in an epic film. I was able to beat it in a couple of days because I just couldn't put it down. It was so good. When the remastered edition came out on PS4, I got it once again and beat it a few times. Finally, when the remake was announced on PC, I knew I had to get it again because that's how much I love this game. I thought the game was already stunning on PS3, but the improved graphics for the remake makes it hard to go back to the original. Every square inch of the remake is so beautiful. The artists did such an amazing job. As far as the controls go, I was delighted to see that it has PS5 Dualsense support, which along with the upgraded visuals, makes the revisit feel fresh and exciting again. There is tons of replay value in the combat system. You can strategize every encounter by playing it stealthily or engaging in a firefight. You can really feel the power the impact with every gun, and taking down enemies feels very satisfying. Melee combat feels intense, and makes you feel like you're in a life or death situation each time. As far as the characters go, I felt very connected with them, and there were moments when I teared up, especially during the prologue. The actors did an amazing job of making the characters come to life. Overall, this is without a doubt one of the absolute greatest games I've ever played.",True,1,0,2025-01-18 03:59:28
"Played the game when it first came out on ps3 and became my favourite game after the first playthrough. The story is amazing, the voice acting is fantastic and the art style is stunning. This being a remaster the graphics are of course beautiful. The gameplay is fun and you can approach fights in different ways so you dont just have to stand still and shoot. Even though i have consumed a lot of media about The last of us since that first playthrough i have to admit that i have actually not played it since then, so when it was on sale on steam i knew what i had to do. And luckily for me i still love it to bits. 

I had some small stuttering/rendering problems while playing and some minor annoyance with the ai movement from Ellie and various others during the story. The stuttering issues might have been from some settings i had wrong, but they were never big enough for me to try and fix them. The ai issues while a bit annoying at times it never made it so i got stuck or had to restart something. During all my play time i never had any crashes or problems that made it so i had to restart missions or the game itself, so they ported it very well.

I highly recommend buying and playing The last of us, especially if its on sale. almost 12 years after release its still my favourite game of all time (story game atleast) and one of the greatest stories i have seen.

"This was my first time playing Last of us from start to finish as a casual gamer. 
A few glitches here and there, and I wouldn't say that the PC is 100% optimised, but overall it performed well on my system. 

The game mechanics overall do show their age (ie stealth and combat etc), as do other aspects. Ultimately, you can tell this is a remaster of an older game. 

I found the levels to a bit repetitive, it took a few chapters for the story to really start resonating with me, and drive me to continue with the play through - the first few chapters were a bit of a slog for me. Overall, however, though it took a while, the story is really where this game shines.

"So I can confirm up to date of the status of this game on Steam Deck use, so gather round if you want to know:

Does the gameplay work smoothly: yes

If so then what errors remain: the sound quality sucks

Why? Any high level sounds come off like fuzz in the speakers. Sony really really didn't give a damn on making this a port for pc definitely. I'm glad it's not crashing at all or I would've returned it without hesitation. The gameplay works just fine, but my dear word the sound is horrible in many places. I had to go into the audio settings to play with things to see if it could get any better

What I found is that there's a setting on the very bottom for the range in like degrees. I lowered to the lowest, I believe 15, and altered the bandwidth or something like that to narrow. That seemed to make things at least quite a ways better than where things were. You'll still hear the higher sounds coming through sounding like fuzz, but at least the rest sounds fine

There are plenty of obvious signs this game was honestly not really ported so much as just picked up and plopped from the ps4 to steam. So everyone has legitamite reason to dislike Sony

I can agree with others that the dlc chapter should've been included with the game. The extras on abilities sooner I could understand being like $3 seeing as that's extra, but nothing else needs to be seperate from the main game.

The characters all include their own personalities with Joel being a grumpy old man and Ellie being an energetic little brat. The games story was so good they had to make a show about it. the combat far surpasses all other games i have ever played. The resources are sparce but yet if your out of ammo there is always another way. The way this game is balanced is insane. I don't think I've ever played a better game than this one. It always keeps you on your feet and the action never ends. crafting bombs, Med-kits, and Molotov cocktails on the go makes you feel like an absolute god at the game. the detail on this game is crazy as well. the enemies you fight have their own names. its wild that when you kill someone some of their friends scream their name in horror. it makes you have depth to each kill. it separates from other games because it makes you feel like your actions have weight. 10/10 i do recommend",True,1,0,2024-12-15 06:03:35

"A game unlike anything I have ever played…

(Story) From the mere minutes you play this game you will be hooked, there is something so beautiful about the opening. Joel is one of the best-written characters you will ever play as, as for Ellie it is the same thing. The story grabs you and throws you things that a story-based game has never done before. From meeting new people to making your way around clickers you are hooked from the mere minutes you play. I have never played a game that has had me feeling every emotion I could feel within just under 7 hours of gameplay. (aside from RDR2) From the scenery, the dialogue in this game is truly amazing in the way it portrays itself even after 12 years after its release. Joel once a father takes the role of caring for Ellie within the story, showing his hardships, and how he overcomes them as a character overall. 

(Gameplay) From holding your weapon and moving around the map and coming up with different ways to attack is such an amazing thing and the way that TLOU does it. Always feels like you are in the game yourself. So many different ways to go around and be strategic and make sure that what you do, you think about it methodically. Being able to play on either Controller or M&K is an amazing thing too. Feeling the smoothness when looking at POIs to capture that movie feel is great, too then switching to mouse and keyboard and being fast and a dealy aim really is a great feeling.

(Replayability) To keep it short, if you love the game you can always go back and play it again and feel the rushes of when you are going through certain missions. People who play it once might not find much else out of it aside from the extra game mode they offer with PC. A very cool touch added by the developers too is all the extras within the creation of the game, to see all the sketches and different ways they made the zombies to the characters and how they are drawn out and shown shows the care and time within the game and I love it. A very Neat Touch :)

(Audio) The audio within this game is something I have never heard of. THE SOUNDTRACK is the best out of any game I have played. Super rustic guitar with the winds and other noises put me into the game unlike anything else I have ever played. Gunshots and moving sounds are super crisp to the ears, branches cracking under you too your reload sounds are just too good.

Story mode: 10/10
Gameplay: 9/10
Replayability: 8.5/10
Audio: 10/10

It truly is a masterpiece in my eyes and I would strongly recommend this game to any hardcore gamer to the casual player.

This was my first time playing this game in the 11+ years it's been out, and I absolutely see the hype. The story, combat, movement, characters, and setting are all fantastic. I read about the issues this game had on PC long before I bought it, and waited until patches game out and the reviews got a bit better. Ran into a handful of issues myself; but all I needed to do to fix it when those happened were to just verify the integrity of game files and reload the game. Simple.

Some of these achievements are so iffy on Steam, sometimes they straight up just do NOT register, and you have to reload your save and try again. The worst of them were probably Ellie's jokes, because sometime they would take minutes upon minutes to even pop up for me, or straight up not at all (the instance in the Hotel just didn't work, luckily it didn't count for anything). 

Other than those previously stated gripes, the game was amazing and I loved nearly every second otherwise. Definitely pick this one up, I got it on sale like 20-30% off, absolutely worth every penny. Can't wait for them to port part II on Steam in the future (hopefully with less of those small issues, lol). Thank you Naughty Dog for this experience! :)",True,1,0,2024-11-30 17:18:49
"Well, the story is so-so. Not great, not really bad. Not the revelation many people claim it to be either. Stealth is sometimes pretty good, sometimes meh and sometimes unsustainable. Some non-stealth encounters are just screwed up totally, where the only chance you have is to learn the timing and then perform according to it. That is not a shooter, that is some boring, repetitive thing. 
Overall, worth it somewhat if you do not have anything better. But do not expect too much. Oh, and while Ellie is ok and sometimes engaging or even funny, the Joel is just a moron with too much aggression and not enough brains.",False,1,0,2025-02-15 08:02:14
"Я не люблю зомби апокалипсис, я не люблю стелс, я не люблю линейные игры, обычно не перевариваю катсцены в играх. Но damn, кажется эта игра поменяла моё мнение. После прохождения моё самое большое желание это пройти игру ещё раз",True,3,0,2025-01-15 08:43:48
"Wrote a review a while ago when this game was still unplayable. It used to have horrible problems with loading shaders, and would run at 1-2 fps on a moderately powerful laptop. Devs put their nose to the grindstone though and fixed the issues. The quality of the story in this game has never been questioned, and still remains one of the best games of all time, and I'm glad it got ported over to PC. Still worth it's weight in gold all these years later. Buy it, you wont regret it.",True,1,0,2025-02-11 00:44:56
One of my favorite games of all time. Looks and plays amazing with everything set to max on 4070 Super.,True,1,0,2025-01-01 09:00:01
"Just finished the game, and its incredible! The story telling, the characters, the music. This game takes you on such an adventure. I laughed, I cried, I was scared. This has been one of the best cinematic games ive played in a long time. 10/10 .",True,1,0,2025-01-01 06:12:08
"One of the best games I've played, but you all should already know that from the other reviewers or word of mouth.

What you might be asking is if the PC version is playable. I had little to no issues. I did have to put all my settings on high for 1440p because my frames were dipping around some areas. Also, I only had ONE crash at the beginning, then it ran smooth.

"One of the greatest gaming experiences the world has to offer. The best storytelling, world-building, characters, gameplay, thrill factor, difficulty, customization, and meaningfull heart-felt emotions I have ever seen in any game, film, series, or other media. 

I cannot recommend this enough. Do yourself a favor and play The Last of Us Part 1.",True,1,0,2025-01-27 00:37:44
"The Last of Us is absolutely incredible! I finally understand why it’s been called the best game of the decade. The storyline is deeply emotional and heartbreaking, but at the same time, it’s so captivating that I couldn’t tear myself away. Every moment feels impactful, and the combination of gripping gameplay and a moving narrative makes it an unforgettable",True,1,0,2024-12-18 17:33:19

The characters, environment, the breathtaking moments, stealth, run times...

What a game...

"Damn, Sony's exclusives are good. Can't wait for the second part.",True,1,0,2025-02-12 17:55:10
"The game is absolutely phenomenal. From the very first minute, you know that you're playing something truly special. The story is captivating, I enjoyed it very much. Not only because of the good writing, but also because the voice actors did a great job, and the cut scenes are directed really well. Gameplay-wise, it's a fun and challenging stealth game, but it's not monotonous - there is plenty of action too.

Visually, The Last of Us is stunning. They really put a lot of effort into making this world cozy and vibrant. I know it sounds strange for a post-apocalypse involving zombies, but look at these beautiful scenes. Even abandoned cities are covered with green, vivid grass! You can see that a lot of talented people put a tremendous amount of effort into this game. It's definitely one of my favorite games from now on.

I see that a lot of my friends have it on their wishlists, and I strongly recommend getting it! Even though the HBO show spoiled some key story points for me, it was still a pleasure.

The only complaint I have is that photo mode doesn't allow you to detach the camera from your character.

P.S. Special thanks to Sony, who refuse to acknowledge that Estonia exists and sell their new games, including The Last of Us Part II, here 👍",True,2,0,2025-01-09 16:43:52
"Fantastic game, one of a kind.
And that's 99% down to the great story, great script and superb acting.
You simply start caring for Ellie & Joel almost from the start.
That's quite the achievement, in so many games this takes for ever and often it doesn't happen at all, especially when one of the characters is a stubborn teenager.
It's difficult to like those in real life, let alone in a game!
But it works.
You care so much about these two that more than once you get quite emotional.
Besides that the world created for this story is also first class.
It's gorgeous.
This game deserved all the prizes it won and more.
Thank you developers.",True,2,0,2024-12-20 02:31:07

This is the worst port I've ever seen. I legitimately cannot get through even the beginning of the game using either a controller or keyboard and I don't understand how this was released,False,16,5,2025-01-09 21:29:27
"My Score: 9.5/10

Without a doubt, this game has successfully revisited the horror survival genre. A different Resident Evil if you will. One with great depth, story telling and atmosphere. It has established itself to be one of the best games in that field, if not one of the best modern games that combines a great gaming experience with solid well written story telling. I do like the game, at least Part 1 a lot better than the TV series. 

Positives:
+ Incredible atmosphere
+ Amazing up to date graphics
+ Amazing novel like quality writing 
+ You get to kill other (bad) humans which adds a whole new factor and experience into the horror zombies genre
+ The game allows superb tactical depth: You may go stealth  and attack from behind. You can also knife zombies from behind
+ Shooting has a more realistic touch
+ Great finale * 

Negatives: 
- Insufficient footsteps, or it might be my ears. Especially human enemies feel like they are wearing rubber shoes
- It packs a lot of content and world environment, however, it did feel a bit short
- * The finale was pretty solid. Some parts felt rushed and unanswered. Although the ending was generally ""good"", like a movie ending, I felt a bit unsatisfied. Maybe in my subconscious I expected a giant final boss or something

I highly recommend this game, even if you are not familiar with survival horror or anything. It is like a great book or movie that you should not miss. I'm thankful for the game and I would have loved the pc port to come out sooner. Happy to pay full price for high quality games, period.",True,1,0,2025-02-16 03:10:33

"I don't play many of them and generally don't enjoy combat-heavy games, but this game may be the one that changes all of that. I cannot recommend The Last of Us enough. I played this in the most easy mode possible, and even though I struggled at first, it felt very doable. You'll be fine if you aren’t used to these types of games like I am. For me, the story is the star of the show; the writers did a beautiful job. I was entirely immersed in the world and the characters' stories. There is so much depth in everything, from the environment to the little notes left by those who have passed to the design of each character. I hate fighting, but to still go through probably 15 hours of combat (I had to replay the bloater fights soooo many times) and never get bored is a true feat. I have no complaints; I love this game.",True,1,0,2024-12-31 22:35:37
