"To preface: This game is not even close to being for everybody. If you are looking for an action or combat oriented experience, this is not the game for you.

Kojima was not at all kidding when he said Death Stranding was a walking simulator. However, it is quite possibly the only walking simulator that actually simulates walking. If you're still confused about what exactly you do in this game, as I was, you deliver packages on your back in a surreal sci-fi post-apocalypse. For reasons explained by the lore, that I shall not get into for spoiler purposes, the last remnants of humanity are isolated inside of fortified cities, and are unable to leave. Because they are unable to leave, and because planes and drones no longer work, they rely on so-called porters to deliver goods from settlement to settlement by hand. You play as one of these porters.

Almost everything in the game is in some way focused on delivering packages. The story and your character's part in it are a little more grandiose than simply delivering packages, but that is still the foundation upon which everything else is built. A standard mission consists of picking up an order at a settlement, arranging the goods on your back and on your suit in the most organized way so that you don't tip over from the weight, plotting a course to the place you have to walk to, and then walking there. This may sound very basic and boring, but the game does a surprisingly good job at making traversal a challenge that is just as interesting and engaging as combat.

The terrain is incredibly rough, and you will need the help of various tools to get to where you're going without damaging the goods. There are also two types of enemies that can get in your path: crazed bandit types who will try to steal your packages, and invisible enemies that can completely ruin cargo, and need to be stealthed around using a sort of marco polo mechanic, where the mechanical doo-hicky on your shoulder points to where the enemies are. The invisible enemies only come out in the rain, which damages your cargo due to story reasons; so it creates an interesting dynamic of trying to escape them as soon as possible to get out of the rain, while also not rushing through it and getting caught by them. 

On top of all this, there is a pseudo-multiplayer mechanic. You can place useful structures in the world to be used by yourself and other players, and you can use things placed by other people. You will also find various lost bits of cargo in the world that you can deliver for bonuses. Some of these lost packages will be randomly generated by the game, and some of them will be left behind by other real players. It's also possible to leave packages at safehouses for other players to finish the delivery, and you can pick up things left by other players and finish their deliveries too.

Overall, a strange and somewhat divisive premise has lead to what is, in my opinion, an extremely unique and engaging game. This is not even touching upon the story, which has that signature Kojima charm of being completely incomprehensible but also very symbolic and chock full of social commentary. My only major glaring complaint is that there is a baffling Monster Energy Drink product placement. Whenever you rest in a room, there are lovingly rendered cans of Monster on your nightstand. Your canteen in the game also magically converts water into Monster Energy Drink. I wish I was kidding. This is completely shameless, and honestly subtracts quite a bit from the game's artistry, but it's not a big enough deal to warrant getting fussy over.",True,1442,53,2020-07-16 06:53:29
"Does Truck Simulator but mostly on foot, in the apocalypse, with intricate cargo management, a healthy dose of bizarre storytelling and a sprinkle of third person shooter combat sound appealing to you?

You'll probably enjoy this.

Okay, maybe the actual gameplay isn't that similar to Truck Simulator but boil it down to the very core gameplay, and they're the same game. You deliver cargo from one location to another. That's it. First and foremost this is a game about delivering packages, mostly on foot.

Understanding this and knowing what to expect going in is the key to enjoying Death Stranding. Most of the negative reviews are going to come from people who are disappointed with what the game is. People who feel that the developers set themselves up for failure with cryptic trailers that showed little to no gameplay, leaving us to speculate from the breadcrumbs they left us. 

Because of this, setting the right expectations is important. This game isn't going to be for everyone.

This is a different kind of game. It's going to take patience to get anywhere. Combat and any action is only secondary to the bulk of the game, a ploy to spice up the gameplay at times. So if you're looking for an action adventure game this isn't it. There are bossfights and general moments of combat or suspense, but 90% of the gameplay is traversing the expansive and beautiful environments of the world of Death Stranding, as well as creating structures to aid in that traversal. If you play online, these structures also bleed into other players' worlds where they can give you likes should they find them helpful.

That's not to say the game is exempt from any criticism. Even if you know what you're getting into when you boot up the game, a lot of the complaints people have are valid. The pacing could be better, the story relies on heavy exposition and the game takes a while to really open up, to name a few.

Still, if you find the game's premise intriguing, I wholeheartedly recommend it regardless of any shortcomings it may otherwise have. 

Death Stranding has these Zen-like moments where it's just you, your cargo (and the supernatural baby you've got strapped to your body) trekking up the mountains, you're cresting a hill overlooking the town below as an eerily fitting song from Low Roar starts playing... Those moments are absolutely wonderful and exactly the reason why I love the game so much. The slow pace and the struggle to get anywhere pays off time after time.

This is very much a game that you need to play for yourself before you can fully judge it. Of course you're free to say that this isn't for you, or that it sounds boring. A lot of people are probably going to feel that way.

Just know that, in my opinion, moments like the one I just mentioned don't translate well into video format. And that they are the reason this was my GOTY of 2019. The difference between experiencing them through another person, and being totally absorbed in the moment when playing it yourself is like night and day.

Playing this game is a truly unique experience, and in a video game landscape where AAA developers are getting more and more flak for sticking to the same old formulas, Death Stranding is a breath of fresh air that I felt was sorely needed.


To finish off, here's the tip every newcomer should always be given before playing:
Focus on the story quests to begin with. Don't spend hours doing every little sidequest right away or you'll wear yourself out before the game gives you tools to make your life easier. The game opens up a few hours in. After that you're free to do whatever quests you please.

One of the characters will give you a ""tip"" that you can finish up the area you're in before proceeding. Ignore this, you can return to any area in the game more or less whenever you want.

That's it, keep on keeping on!",True,773,33,2020-07-14 15:23:43
"there is no other game like Death Stranding.

now, that's not a statement about quality, but of actual gameplay.  it's hard to compare it to any other genre.  for the most part, it's the kind of traveling to and from hubs that you'd typically find yourself doing in any number of open-world games.  the classic gaming conventions are all there: stat progression, new gadgets, traversal upgrades, action, stealth, and most critically, online connectivity.  

the core of what makes the gameplay different than other open-world games is a deeply ingrained subtext of altruism.  while connected to both the real-life internet and Death Stranding's ""Chiral Network"", you will be able to share supplies, structures, quest items, equipment, vehicles, and even entire highways, with everyone else who is connected.  your job as Sam Porter Bridges, our protagonist, is to expand this ""Chiral Network"" in order to rebuild a shattered and post-disaster America.  the benefit of this for us, the players, is that while our journey forward is taking us into harsher conditions, we're leaving a trail of convenience for others.  your interactions with and progression through the America of Death Stranding will be shaped by the community's impact on the landscapes you explore.  but rapid erosion caused by ""Timefall"", Death Stranding's post-disaster rain, ensures that nothing will remain should no one look after it.  so the implicit subtext is that your true objective is to truly rebuild and maintain this new America by supplementing its infrastructure and aiding its occupants.  Death Stranding achieves the, honestly lofty, accomplishment of bringing those words to hour-to-hour gameplay with its foundation upon altruism. 

i can't put a number on how many hours i've spent going out of my way to help others because of this incredibly palpable atmosphere of reconstruction and dogged hope.  it's such an earnest, wholesome high, to know that my efforts are appreciated by other players going through the game.  just as well, it is an incredible relief to be aided by a complete stranger on the internet in my hour of most dire need.  i can't say that i've ever been compelled to such consistent generosity by a game before.  hell, by anything.  despite its visual and thematic depressive nature, i always came away from Death Stranding feeling satisfied and hopeful.  

this game fostered a strong paternal instinct towards infants that i never though i possessed.  i couldn't fucking stand babies before this game.  in fact, i still didn't for roughly the first half of the game.  but over time, that constant bond of taking BB with me everywhere i went really brought something forth that i didn't know i had.  didn't know a game could do that. 

the hype for Kojima's first self-produced project, radio-silent marketing, and scathing critiques like Dunkey's (you betrayed me, Dunk, i trusted you.) sabotaged virtually any chance of this game's actual messaging coming across.  the absolute noise surrounding Death Stranding's release and initial impressions does a heartbreaking disservice to the utterly unique experience it holds.  

------------------------------------------

to address some common complaints:

Q) isn't Death Stranding just a walking simulator? 
A) it isn't.  the first few hours are a lot of walking and hiking, yes, but your traversal options widen as you progress. 

Q) don't the vehicles handle like garbage?
A) to be completely fair, the van handles like garbage on anything that isn't a road.  the reverse trike, though?  i've taken that bitch up mountains, across ladders, through rivers, snow, mud, you name it.  that thing is incredible.  please invest the time in getting adept with it. 

Q) isn't Death Stranding's story Hideo Kojima's attempt to create a plot so convoluted and obscure that only he could truly understand it?
A) not really.  i found Death Stranding to be, while typically Kojima in its intentional obfuscation and misdirection, rather digestible.  there were even times where i put pieces together before the game felt it necessary to do so.  MGSV is Kojima's game about confusion, Death Stranding has a very deliberate, albeit out-there at times, plot.  

------------------------------------------

now, to be fair, here are some complaints i have with Death Stranding.

- van handles like ass but the reverse trike is virtually an all-terrain vehicle.  what? 
- the boss battles can be pulse-pounding thrills at best, and frustratingly clumsy chores at worst. 
- the actual map kind of offloads most of the content into the middle of America, creating this sort of Skyrim-esque sidequest rabbit-hole for a good portion of the mid-game.  it's even encouraged, because most of the best unlockables are in the central area.  the side effect of this was losing the momentum of the plot entirely.  i had to wrest myself from The Grind because i hadn't progressed the plot in maybe 20-30 hours of gameplay.  
- (this is the big one)  the ending is kind of like MGS4+.  if you've ever finished MGS4 or know about its infamous ~1:30h ending cutscene, you know what i mean.  the pacing of the plot is tight and engaging for most of the game, but in the final stretch it becomes an incredibly drawn out exposition dump because evidently Kojima couldn't find out any other way to tie up the remaining Knots (heh) adequately.  i found myself hooked on the plot for most of the game, only to be almost completely disengaged by the end.  to be fair x2 combo, it's no MGS4.  there're actual gameplay breaks between exposition dumps.  and ultimately it hooked me again, just before the curtain fell.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


TL ; DR

Death Stranding got a bad wrap at release and deserves to be played because it offers a compelling and completely unique approach to gameplay.  play it if you're curious, and your curiosity will be rewarded.  i was the same. 

9/10 experience, truly nearly perfect.  very much looking forward to wrapping up my time in the post-game and replaying to appreciate all of the foreshadowing.  maybe we'll help each other someday!

p.s. A HIDEO KOJIMA GAME",True,141,2,2021-03-23 01:37:18
"Death Stranding is... well... an incredible masterpiece. I went into it completely blind, knowing NOTHING about the story, setting or even gameplay. If you as well want to be surprised by gameplay elements, skip this review. I of course will not spoil the story. 

Anyway, at first the game starts off pretty slow and with some intriguing cutscenes. Honestly it does take a while to get into it and you need to persevere through the first few hours of the game because nothing will make sense. Even though you have no idea what's going on, the cinematography, graphics, and design are spot on. 

I was expecting a ""walking simulator"" with some topography challenges and 100% stealth. I was not prepared to start acquiring lots of cool gear that let me do crazy things like skate down a mountain on a hoverboard, ride a zip line, or make grenades from my own excrement. Vehicles are a thing (I had no idea) and after all the hours of walking it was a welcome change to plow through snow in a truck or fly over meadows on a bike. 

Things really started getting intense a few chapters in when suddenly I found myself experiencing COMBAT IN DEATH STRANDING! I was definitely thrown for a loop, especially because there are quite a few guns as well as non-lethal options, frag grenades, even armor. 

So, consider that you have long expeditions with hugely varied landscape to overcome, enemy humans, monsters, tons of varying gear you have to plan with, and many weapons as well, suddenly the game becomes huge and full of possibilities. Granted, the combat isn't always perfect and can sometimes be oddly unresponsive or janky. I got frustrated in some battles because Sam would grasp his backpack straps instead of ready his gun, for instance. But these are small annoyances. The game is oddly social as well with buildings you can like and interact with from other players, as well as signs or mushrooms sprouted from peeing. Yes, lol. 

All I can say is give this game a chance. Yes, it is weird. Yes, it is genre bending. Yes it can be tedious sometimes from a gameplay perspective. But it has all the quality of a movie combined with a very solid foundation of a game. It is extremely intense at times and may challenge the way you think about things (I know it did for me). It has many subtle and deep concepts that really make your brain think. As well as some just balls to the walls crazy action moments. The story is captivating and emotional. Towards the last few hours of the game I just didn't want it to end but couldn't stop playing/watching. 

Overall, I would 100% recommend this game. It is not perfect but even the greatest masterpieces have flaws, and in this case it's well worth the experience. I finished Death Stranding yesterday and can't stop thinking about it.

"Death Stranding it's a great gaming experience, with some boring moments. I loved the game Soundtrack (the best part), the graphics, acting, gameplay are super well crafted and everything is really new in some way to the gaming community. The down side of the game is that the side-missions are really boring! (they are just deliver from point A to point B with little to no twists, especially if you already know the area of the map and it just gets more boring when you cross the same mountain or place for the 100th time) and some parts of the story don't really hit the emotional point that it was intended, but there are amazing scenes (Every scene with Mads Mikkelsen is amazing! and the development of the world and some secrets are really well done!). For a game that I watched every trailer before release and was still confused to what was going on, It was amazing to play it, because you already know what to expect from a game from it's trailer and Death Stranding really creates a mystery with the world and setting and everything is really well explained, of course you can discuss scientific plot holes or something, but the game is really well built and it is suppose to be fun and a fiction/fantasy.

I understand those who rated 10/10 and those who rated 6/10, but my score is a little more on the middle, I wouldn't spend 200+ hours in a bad or boring game, but there are some boring parts, but there are really amazing ones too, so I'll rate 8.5/10 (more on the positive side because of the Soundtrack, Mads Mikkelsen and the Easter eggs/Fan Service/Hideo Kojima)

Thank you for this experience Kojima-san!",True,108,4,2020-11-05 23:10:13
"I have around 150 hours on the PS4 version and platinumed it, so you could say that I enjoy the game very much. 

Death Stranding is unlike any game out there. It's a thought provoking scifi world that brings fresh ideas and themes to the table, with a gameplay loop that's extremely satisfying and relaxing. This is one of those games where the more you put into it, the more satisfaction you'll receive. 

The story gripped me from start to finish. It's hard to comprehend how any individual could come up with this game's setting and scenarios it puts you through, how the world and it's story unravels around you. While there are some moments that I felt the writing could've been improved that's about the extent of my complaints with the game. 

The PC port is phenomenal, I expected nothing less from KojiPro after the masterful port that is MGSV. It runs at a constant 60 fps on ultra at 1440p. 

The further you get into Death Stranding the more tools are at your disposal. The start of the game can be very clunky and tedious, but it's done so on purpose so that you appreciate and enjoy how far you've come when you reach the later stages of the game. You are constantly rewarded, constantly given feedback about everything you do. Giving you that satisfaction and being shown and told how well of a job you're doing, by both the characters and real players. 

The online functionality of this game really took me by surprise regarding my enjoyment of it. I became utterly addicted to creating the roads for the players I shared the same world with, reveling in the amount of Likes players gave me. Something about the melancholic world and tone that harmoniously compliments the online infrastructure of DS. For me at least, it helped me appreciate others, strangers. It helped me feel kindness towards strangers. Similar to the message system of Dark Souls, players can leave messages saying a number of things. Most of what I see are motivational messages left by others to keep pushing forward, it's a unique feeling. 

Music and the use of your soundtrack is one of my favorite elements of gaming. If implemented correctly, the right music at the right time can heighten your sense of emotion. Death Stranding understands that completely. Key parts of the story or environment when triggered will start to play a song, mostly from the band Low Roar. Their music fits the world and message of the game so perfectly it almost seems they were created side by side. The original soundtrack is composed beautifully, as expected from masterclass composer Ludvig Forssell who also created MGSV's score. 

There are many moments in Death Stranding that filled me with awe and a sense of serenity I never thought existed in gaming. Death Stranding is one of my favorite games ever created, and in my opinion one of the best scifi worlds filled with such rich lore ever created. It left me in tears, and in love with the story that KojiPro has told. Most importantly, it has helped me appreciate and show kindness towards complete strangers in a world where it's far too easy to forget that you're not the only one living in it.",True,673,29,2020-07-15 02:51:31
"Death Stranding is the best game I love but find it hard to recommend to almost anyone because it feels like a game deliberately made for me.
To get my criticism out of the way- the story in much of the style of MGS4 is a combination of me laughing out loud and just being completely lost for words, you have all sorts of big cameo stars doing extraordinarily contrived dialogue and being weird all over the place, with some of them being characters I don't want to be around with, the boss fights and combat scenarios are hilariously bad and the spooky stuff are disappointingly easy to defeat.

However, as much as it paints it as hours of bizarre, stupid plot, there is one thing about this game I can’t get enough of, the entire experience of ‘porting’. 
In this bizzare post-apocalypse, it's your job to hand supplies manually from A to B, and you are left to figure it out yourself, carrying heavy cargo and dealing with the wild terrain, enemy factions, and supernatural anomalies.

It might be because I like hiking, but everything about the simple act delivery is executed with a wonderful cohesive design. You have plenty of tools to plan, scout ahead, prepare, take notes and optimize your routes, and as you improve your skills as a player you go from having a ladder placed to cross a river to knowing exactly how to move around dangerous hills with confidence.

Your backtracking allows you to leave tools and equipment behind in the field and delivery knots to rely on in the future, as well as build structures other players can help you upgrade or use as well.
This brings me to the rather exaggerated “strand” mechanics, which are an important tool of the game to carry it’s themes and also have players get a true feeling of cooperation.

Seasoned users can equally help and assist newbies with things from warning signs to a perfectly placed zip line route. It’s a really nice way to have people help each other out and motivate them to carry on.
The care for Sam carries this as well, with the tools at his disposal all having useful ways to help with your travelling. Nothing in your equipment is useless and all have their place, it's a matter of you finding your rhythm and playstyle.
And in a way, this does justify the bland combat, as to be honest, if it was more demanding it would probably be a game too stressful to handle. I am confident almost anyone can beat the game, it just requires patience and most importantly- persistence.

In the end, the best way to boil it down is whenever you are at a peak of a hill, you see for yourself the hard work you’ve put in getting there. This feeling of mastery within a zen-like relaxed and laid back gameplay creates an aura of peace and a refreshing change of pace I haven’t gotten in any game for a while now.

It’s probably not the game you expected, and I’m late to say that, but if you need something that completely shifts gears and lets you have a more soothing experience (and you can put up with Kojima creatividad at his worst) there is a chance this might also be a game you’ll enjoy.",True,130,4,2021-08-07 13:17:43
"(MGS fans look below review)

I originally played this on PS4. My playtime there is about 70 hours, and I still have not completed the story. I literally was addicted to delivering packages and helping out other players to the point that I pretty much forgot about the narrative. The high you get from seeing other players having used something you placed in the world and 'liking' it is very real; knowing that I genuinely helped someone and they were genuinely grateful is a powerful drug.

There's not much to be said about this game that others haven't already touched on in terms of quality and story, however, there is something that bugs me: many people say that this is a game like no other, in terms of the moment to moment gameplay, so it's difficult for them to describe. That's simply untrue in my opinion.

There is a game that is strikingly similar, though entirely a coincidence I'm sure. That game is Mudrunner/Snowrunner. 

In Mudrunner, you drive big, awkward trucks through treacherous terrain in order to go from point A to point B delivering packages. Treacherous terrain, delivering packages, sound familiar? The enemy in Mudrunner, the main antagonist, is the terrain itself. 

In Death Stranding you control Sam, a delivery man, who carries heavy cargo on his back like a pack mule through rivers, up mountains, and across treacherous crags and freezing valleys. The terrain is your biggest contest of skill. Do not scoff at that, it is a mighty foe for the first twenty or so hours. Gradually, NPC enemies are introduced. They are fairly varied, and they will give you a challenge, albeit a different challenge than the terrain. They serve as a good balance once you've gained the tools and skill necessary to master the terrain, as now you need to deal with the terrain in addition to NPC's, usually at the same time. It is challenging sometimes, but engaging always. 

The gist, the real gameplay loop of Death Stranding is A. planning a route, B. navigating that route, C. maintaining your supplies. Is that not just Mudrunner? I mean, Mudrunner with crazy UPS men that treat you like a Diablo 3 loot goblin. (You'll see what I mean. I bet you never thought you'd be on the opposite end of that spectrum, huh?)

Keep in mind that Death Stranding is a game that opens up the more you play. You are constantly drip fed new features and mechanics; it starts really barren, however. Know that the first few hours is not representative of the rest of the game.

However, if its a real challenge you want, Death Stranding can be very, very difficult. Take on a load that's way too big for the delivery your making and watch as your plans fall apart. Take on one of the timed deliveries and watch how quickly you feel the need to look up a guide in order to S rank it. For the most part, the challenge will be self-governed once you hit a certain point; it won't be challenging unless you do one of the above things because your gear is simply so good. Again, it will always be engaging regardless. Take your concentration away for a few seconds and you're gonna tumble down a hill or get swiped up by a BT, or run over by NPC's, et cetera. Don't keep tabs on your supplies and you'll find yourself up shit creek without a ladder or rope. It's not difficult as long as your paying attention and trying, that's the key to Death Stranding's engagement. It is not M1 + W easy, or 'I play this game while I watch youtube and do my homework lmao' easy.

Death Stranding's biggest boon is the community. Asynchronous multiplayer. There are no other players in your world, but their presence is always felt. You can find packages player's dropped out in the world, and deliver it for them, and vice versa. If a player places a ladder in their world, it will appear in a number of other players' worlds. If a player builds a post box or a bridge it will appear in some other players' worlds. If YOU place something, it will appear in someone else's world. I have been absolutely ecstatic that I stumbled upon someones ladder in the middle of no where, you have no idea. It is such an awesome feeling. A better feeling is knowing that something you placed was used by many others and given hundreds of likes. I thought it a cute novelty when hearing about it, but once I saw the fruits of my labor being used by countless other porters I was smitten.

Do I recommend Death Stranding? Yes, to everyone. It is compelling with an addictive, engaging gameplay loop that most anyone of any gaming background will enjoy. Helping out the community by building structures and placing signs is a feeling that I've only had before in MMO's, and even then it was always fleeting. In Death Stranding that feeling is inescapable; it is everywhere, all the time. And it feels great. A wholesome experience wrapped in a bizarre package, that only Kojima's team could pull off.

Do I have complaints?
My only real complaint would be the narrative. It is very heavy handed and riddled with metaphors to the point of exhaustion. MGS was the same, but it didn't take itself as seriously. As usual with Kojima, Death Stranding has a lot of good, wholesome messages. The guy really wants to put good in the world. However, the writing is so... just... you'll see. People's names are literally what they are as a person or what they represent (moreso than MGS), the word 'strand' is used and explained so many times I began to roll my eyes. Yes it is a piece of a rope, it connects things together KOJIMA I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER BUDDY OH PAL KOJIMA, CONNECTED BY THE STRANDS KOJIMA Sam and Die Hardman are really cool though, not gonna lie. If anything Death Stranding is the best example of a game interweaving its gameplay and narrative into one cohesive theme and message. Unlike *cough* Last of Us 2 *cough* Kojima > Neil Cuckman *cough* 

Special mention to Norman Reedus. He plays his part perfectly. He is detached and aloof just enough that players can imprint themselves on him comfortably, and his grunts, wheezes and [intense effort] sounds are honestly A+. When he talks to or about BB it is very wholesome, his aloofness drops and he takes on a paternal tone that is genuinely comforting. 

Metal Gear Solid fans, hear me out:
I am a lifelong fan of Metal Gear. MGS 1 was my first console game played at the age of four; I bought and played each sequel as they came out and as I grew up. Metal Gear and everything in it has a special place in my heart, mind, and soul; it grew up with me, and I grew up with it. It taught me good values and honorable ideals during my impressionable youth that I still hold in my heart. When MGS V was released with an unfinished story and Kojima cut ties with Konami, effectively ending Metal Gear's lineage, I was actually heart broken as if I had lost a loved one. However, this is NOT Metal Gear. It is NOTHING like Metal Gear. Death Stranding is an entirely new beast. I'm saying this because I expected Metal Gear from Kojima and felt a bit burned when I got UPS simulator, but after I relaxed and opened my mind I really settled in to Death Stranding and felt like a fool for doubting it and scoffing.
As I said earlier in my review, this is a game that OPENS UP. Do not play for a few hours and quit, because that is not representative of the game as a whole. 
The only similarities to MGS is the bizarre narrative, strange character quirks, and memorable character design. But trust me, this is still a Kojima story. Like, it's all Kojima. I don't think anyone was proofreading what he was laying down. Hoo boy. That's not necessarily a good thing, by the way, I may love MGS but I'm pretty sure Kojima has no fucking clue what he's doing when he writes some of this shit.

But hey, that's why we love him. 

Wow this was way longer than I thought it would be. Sorry. 
I'm not sorry. Buy the fucking game.",True,153,7,2021-04-29 13:19:43
"Death Stranding is a one of a kind game. It is a game, an experience unlike anything you've ever played before. The game is about connection. Connecting with other people, other NPCs, changing a broken down post-apocalyptic country set in a sci-fi setting and bringing it back up and running...society, humanity, culture making the country whole, You are Sam Porter Bridges, a one man team selected to do just that. You do that by delivering cargo to other NPCs and people, some mundane, some critical to sustaining life and humanity, all of which has meaning and value to every individual. 

For your every actions, you will not only be rewarded by NPCs in the game but also by real players too in many ways. Be it via likes, via items, weapons, resources etc. Throughout your journey, you will find help from both NPCs and actual other players alike too. Yes, even though the game is single player, there's asynchronous multiplayer in the game from start to finish where you won't see the players but will see the help they've chosen to provide you via weapons, items, structures and many others things to make the journey more convenient for you. In this game, the journey is just as important and rewarding as the destination.

You will face many obstacles along the way too, not just the enemies and bosses, which you will encounter a lot but also the seemingly beautiful and hostile environment itself. There are both human and supernatural enemies in the game. The environments are nice and varied...from huge grassy green fields to rocky plains to volcanic crevices to snowy mountain peaks. The game has unique challenges and overcoming said challenges, especially when you're helped by other players, is immensely rewarding.

Visually this one of the best, most photo-realistic game you'll ever come across. Some of the other strong points of this game are the story, character build-up and interaction, gameplay, unique combat encounters and soundtrack. Hideo Kojima and his team at Kojima has directed / crafted this game masterfully and meticulously with the finest details from start to finish and it really shows in the game.

The game is also extremely well optimized and runs beautifully on decent hardware while looking stunning. I ran the game on my I7 4790K CPU paired with a GTX 1070 GPU and 16GB ram. Maxing out the game, I had anywhere from 60 to 120+ FPS. Depending on the location and how intense the visual spectacles were.

I've spent 133 hours finishing the game even though there were still quite a handful of side missions left. I played it non-stop since launch on Steam as the game was highly addictive and rewarding. Yes, it is THAT good and I don't praise a game to this high caliber lightly. I'm telling you, this is a game you MUST experience at least once in your life as it is a one of kind unique game that is so well made, you won't believe until you've experienced it yourself.

Overall, I give Death Stranding my highest score which is a 10/10. I'm seriously hoping there be a sequel as this game has a great potential to become the next big franchise.

"A fantastic game. The visuals, music, gameplay, and story telling are absolutely wonderful.

That being said, it isn't a game for everyone. This game is not combat based, but there are a few bits with combat.
This game is tagged ""Walking Simulator"" for a reason. It's about balance, carrying what you can, being cautious, planning ahead, and most importantly; patience.
To be more specific (With NO spoilers):

[h1]Story.[/h1]
This game is placed fairly modern day. The technology is boosted by the event this game is about, but other than that everything is standard. Science fiction for sure, but no flying cars or jetpacks.
The story is told mostly in cutscenes, with a few exceptions during a boss fight or exposition during gameplay. Not all the exposition is necessary and therefore some of it is tucked into seemingly regular delivery missions for mundane people.
Again, it's not required to understand the story, but more for the player that wants to dig deep. Or a completionist.
The story is told from the main characters perspective. He is neither ordinary or extraordinary. It's hard to explain without giving away spoilers.
Overall the story is excellent. It's more unique with a heavy focus on life, death, and limbo. It wants to tell you a story and that's that.

[h1]Storytelling.[/h1]
It does a good job getting the complicated world across. There are so many ways for lack of clarity in any topic in this game to result in confusion and an incoherent story/universe.
They take care to give you every bit of help along the way. While I'm 100% on board for stories that aren't always explained, this game didn't want to leave it open ended. There's no ""1,000,000 possibilities"" or questions unanswered. The game will show you the world, pose the questions, and answer all necessary questions.
If I were to compare the way they told this story I would say it's far more like a Quantic Dream game, like Detroit: Become Human. As opposed to God of War. The gameplay has some story, but it's 95% cutscenes.
But, to be clear, there are NO multiple paths to the end. There are NO multiple endings.
This game has one singular story. One beginning, middle, and end.
Quality story, world, and characters.

[h1]Visuals.[/h1]
Just ridiculously beautiful. I've run this game on max settings with 140fps easy. I run a GTX 1080. Nothing special hardware wise, but this game has wonderful optimization and runs smoothly.
There are reports that a few people have issues with the game crashing on loading up or fails to load up at all. I do not know how widespread that issue is. I have heard of it, seen it, and have seen a few solutions for those afflicted.
However, the support appears to be excellent and whomever is handling customer support is on the case. They have responded quickly and offered numerous potential fixes for a variety of problems.
The game has a lovingly crafted world. This game is screenshot heaven. With plenty of vantage points to appreciate scenery or boss fights that give fantastic shots of tension.

[h1]Gameplay.[/h1]
It's solid across the board. With very little focus on combat.
Your point is to deliver, not to fight. So the gameplay difficulty is almost entirely geared around how challenging it is to deliver your packages with minimal damage. There are many ways to achieve this. Use of vehicles for long distance, gear that help you traverse rough terrain, tools to assist in overcoming various obstacles. Your careful selection and balancing the weight of tools and packages, as well as the path you take to your destination; those sum up the difficulty of the game.
Combat is a part for sure and most people like more combat in games. Death Stranding doesn't really break new ground with combat. It's pretty simple. There are guns, your fists, and vehicles. You can use stealth (recommended), but when stealth isn't an option you can engage in decent combat.
The combat in the world like with MULES and some unsavory types really isn't anything special. Shoot them or not. Kill them or not. Killing results in a greater number of BTs in the area, which makes life more difficult. So you should be careful of that.
The combat the game puts you in, like in a boss fight, isn't unique. Once more you have common weapons like a handgun, assault rifle, rocket launcher, etc. You aim, you shoot, the boss gets hurt.
Combat is smooth, but definitely nothing ground breaking. Once more, with feeling; this game doesn't focus on combat.

[h1]Dialogue/Characters.[/h1]
This area gets some flak at times. Some people love the characters, some people hate them.
Personally, I adore them. I had my healthy suspicions at first of their intent or, outside of the game, their writing and design. But as I played more I found myself growing fond of the characters and their strangeness.
The dialogue could definitely be worked on in a few areas. Certain conversations feel forced or lacking in sincereity. It can feel awkward or, for me, sometimes cringey.
Not that it detracts from the game really. After playing it and getting deeper into the story I had adjusted quickly to how awkward some things were. Some people were strange and there were rational reasons for it. A few rare moments where I wanted to take the script to Kojima Productions, lay it out in front of them, and ask what were they thinking.
At the end of the day, having completed the story in this game, I can now say I care for these characters. Their awkwardness, their unusual behaviors. At the end of it all it kind of just came together for me and all I wanted to see is what happens to them now.
So a lot of the strange issues with dialogue or writing did not detract from the story itself.

There are a few characters that utter puns in this game and they know who they are.

[h1]Overview[/h1]
I'm trying not to give any spoilers at all so the review is safe to read. It is hard trying to give criticism to something I cannot explain.
I'm not a professional reviewer and I very rarely review anything at all. So my thoughts are not as organized or as well put as others. I would definitely look through a good number of reviews before making a decision to buy.

This game is unique. It is its own kind and I love it. I want to see another Death Stranding or more games like it.
I think this is a rare game that belongs up there with the great games of the last few decades.

I do not believe this game ""has a little something for everyone"" as IGN likes to list in all their reviews.

This game has a lot for the right players and absolutely nothing for others.
People who prefer a game to drop you in and say ""Go play!"" This is not that kind of game.
People who prefer a game to tell you a story subtly. This is not that kind of game.
People who like fast paced games, combat oriented games, or games that turn you loose with a thousand different options.
This is not that kind of game.

You have one goal and only one way to get it done. The path is rough and riddled with rocks, mountains, rivers, and frustration. You have to build the road to cross it and even then you are forced to traverse the worst terrain with the most delicate cargo. You have a task that must be repeated a hundred times.
This game is tedious and slow. Patience really is a virtue here.

But I love this game. Despite the hours I spent walking from city to city or to the small prepper shelters out and about, I never listened to music, watched a video on my other monitor, or had anything playing in the background while I traveled. I was always in the moment.

Not a lot of people will pay $60 to trip on a rock and destroy all your fragile cargo you just spent the last 15 minutes struggling your way up a mountain to deliver.

Also, the more I play this game the more I realize no one at Kojima Productions has ever either driven a vehicle or been in one being driven.

I highly recommend this game. But if it's not your style, than wait for Horizon: Zero Dawn. That game is fantastic too.",True,308,6,2020-07-20 07:00:06
"I don't do reviews very often, but this game really means a lot to me.

One review won't fit everything that I have to say. So I'm going to say this.

This game is like no other. To a lot of people it's a walking simulator. And it is. But it's a walking simulator that changes the way we travel in video games to get from point A to point B. All you need is patience. Trust me, it does get better.  

This game is one of the best games I've ever played.

People can make deliveries a lot easier with bridges, ladders, climbing ropes, ziplines, etc. When I play the game, it feels like I'm walking in Sam's footsteps. I'm within the world of Death Stranding. Truly remarkable.

Death Stranding makes the environment your enemy. Instead of just holding W until you get to the next location, there's a lot going through your mind each journey. On my second play through I'm still learning which way to play is more efficient. I hope more games learn what Death Stranding did to make your journey more interesting in open world games.

This game makes you feel connected to other people in a way you didn't think was possible for video games.

Thank you Death Stranding. Thank you.",True,409,12,2020-10-29 17:45:59
"You've heard this is only a packidge delivery simulator? A walking simulator?
Yeah, you are delivering cargo a lot. You are walking around a lot. And there is so much more! So. much. more!
The story is mystical, interesting, compelling, confusing, but makes sense in the end. It's even surprising how much sense the story makes. The pieces in which the story is delivered have a great pacing, so it keeps you interested all the time.

I'm very surprised how exceptional this game is. I've not seen anything like it (also this was my first Hideo Kojima game). Sure, there are games that have open world mechanics, infrastructure building mechanics etc. but the combination of those done like in this game is something special and new. And though there is no direct multiplayer, it does have multiplayer components. You are connected to other players and can use the structures they've built in their game. And this is what the whole game is about: connections. Connecting the people you meet in the game world, but also connections between other players of the game. Which is so cool!

The graphics of the environment do have photo-realistic aesthetic. The facial animations have blown me away, they transport emotions via acting in a way like barely another game does. Yeah the story has emotional elements which are moving already, but a special part in the ending caused even me to get teary-eyed. Speaking of the ending. This is an ending, that will remain on your mind for a long time. An ending that deserves the expression ending. An ending that's an emotional roller coaster, which heavy action elements, big story parts and starts about 6+ hours before you reach it.

I played this game on Ubuntu Linux, via Proton 6.3 and had maybe 2 crashes, where it's not clear if that's Proton- or game-related. I had one missing texture issue after several hours of gameplay, which never re-occured. I consider this a platinum rated game, which could even be whitelisted for Proton by Valve.
Steam states as of the writing of this recommendation I played for 113 hours. And I enjoyed every moment of it.

This is an exceptional experience, I can only recommend it so much, you have to experience it on your own to understand. After finishing the game, you might become a better human.

"Yes but no. But also yes. But no. But fuck yeah. Here's the thing: Death Stranding requires you to come at it with a) an open mind and b) a lot of patience. That's true both for the gameplay and the story. Death Stranding is the word ""oxymoron"" made manifest. It manages to exist both as a masterpiece and a complete disaster. Almost everything I love about the game, I also dislike at the same time. The story is genius and complicated and beautiful but it's also cringy and full of plot holes and kinda shallow. The gameplay is boring but also really engaging at the same time? Loving this game requires you to embrace it fully and just accept what it has to offer. If you're okay with letting go of the steering wheel for a while and just enjoy the journey, you'll love this game. It is an Experience more than it is a game, and I think it is very much worth trying if you're in the right mindset for it.",True,219,9,2021-04-19 04:04:14
"While I am recommending this, I have to stress that this is not for everyone. This is the sort of game for someone that finds managing your centre of mass to make crossing rocky terrain easier interesting, who finds engagement in going back to build up areas for when you pass back through them later, who wants to find themselves consulting a weather map when traversing known areas to make sure you're unlikely to run into the BTs.

Ultimately, Death Stranding's gameplay is about travelling. On foot, in vehicles, abseiling down cliffs and improvising bridges from ladders, or even just stepping onto a floating cargo carrier and using it as a hoverboard for safer mountain descent. The majority of your time is spent working out how to get from one place to another with minimal fuss. To aid this you can set up structures and manage your inventory, all of which is physically present on your body and each gram affects your speed and stamina use. The blasted remains of the USA are a wonderfully created wasteland full of colour, despite the grey and black asthetic in the most heavily damaged areas. Grass and forests still clutter the country side, red soil sits in the midlands and blue rivers run across the land. But this travelling is broken up by two things, both of which have a problem with your free movement.

The most interesting, and first introduced, problem is the Timefall and the BTs that can appear in it. Timefall rapidly ages whatever it hits, making your cargo less durable and more susceptible to damage (and makes Sam pull up his hood). But when it rains you might see the flickering indicator attached to your shoulder start waving in one direction. You see, BT's are invisible ghost-like things that rely on sound. Your device can only point to one at at time, and so will point at the nearest and flap faster the closer it is. Move slowly, move carefully, have Sam hold his breath, mindful that if you hold it too long he'll need to loudly breathe again when you release it, and try not to jolt too hard when the odradek starts flicking between several directions. As the game goes on you develop ways of dealing with the BTs, but your best defence is always to stay quiet.

The other enemy are the bandit-esque MULEs, who are out for your cargo. They don't care much for you, and don't want you dead. They just want your stuff. Interestingly, all the weaponry I have seen so far is non lethal. The MULEs have electroshock rods that risk you losing consciousness while they chase you, and Sam has a bola launcher and smoke grenades to temporarily delay and inconvenience them while he hides. It's for this reason that raiding MULE bases to get people's stuff back has been a recent pasttime of mine. The last one I did involved me escaping after I was caught by ramping my bike over a small ravine and hoping they didn't dare try to jump it.

Some may find the game boring. A lot of people, really. It's a niche genre, somewhere between Elite Dangerous, Eurotruck Simulator and The Phantom Pain. There are also a lot of cutscenes, even if some let you look around and focus in while stuff is happening. As with every Kojima game that I've played, the story is of utmost importance, and much of your first hour is light on gameplay for this reason.

I have not finished the game yet, and when I do I might update this, but so far this is an interesting creation that seems to have done exactly what it tried to do. Honestly, points for creativity.",True,54,2,2021-05-10 23:14:34
"Let's start with what the game is not:
1: it's not a combat/action/stealth game, forget MGS
2: it's not a RPG with customizable character and choice and consequences, the narrative is completly linear and you are a spectator.

The gameplay is slow paced, requires planning ahead, and the core gameplay is delivering stuff from A to B, but it's not a simple walking simulator, there are many mechanics involved, a lot of tools to build. And the map has many dangers.

The narrative is completly linear, but very interesting and weird. Coupled with the many real life actors involved, the superb motion capture and face animation, and the photorealistic graphics, the experience is between watching an author sci-fi movie and playing a game.

To give it's best it needs a quite powerfull rig, especially an RTX card with DLSS makes its graphics to look stunning and the gameplay to be superfluid.

For anyone beeing in the mood for this kind of gameplay and even being sligthly interested in weird sci-fi distopic settings, Death Stranding is an unique game worthy to experience.",True,109,1,2020-09-14 15:57:57
"I am about 60 hours into Death Stranding and I think this is one of the best games I played in recent memory. This game is so much more than a “walking simulator”. I bought the game for PC after months of telling myself that I would not enjoy game like Death Stranding because what can be cool about delivering stuff. This concept just sounds boring on the surface but after playing the game for hours I must say that there is so much more into this game than just being a “Fed-ex driver”. 

Death Stranding argues in both its story and its gameplay that adversity itself is what makes things worth doing and life worth living.

In the quiet moments of travel, usually as you near your destination, music might start to play. The soundtrack, which is largely composed of one band--Low Roar--is phenomenal, the kind of contemplative folk-ish music that suits a trip alone through a meadow or down a mountain. Because the act of walking is so involved, it's not a time to detach completely and zone out; it's a time to feel your feelings or at least consider what's next in your travels.

In a world full of negative things, Death Stranding is Positive in every single aspect. DS is a worth-taking Journey that will make you cry, laugh, and think about Life. Fantastic Graphics, One of the Best Narratives that VideoGame industry has ever seen and a gameplay loop that is meaningful and comforting. Play this game, and Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.

It's a game that requires patience, compassion, and love, and it's also one we really need right now.",True,52,6,2021-06-10 10:51:05

"This game confirms the concept of not judging a book by its cover…


I really underestimated this game when it came out. Went along with the “walking simulator” gimmick before even giving it a try. Wasn’t until a friend streamed the game, I was quite interested and can say I made the right decision. 

A simple concept of delivering packages across a beautifully large setting connecting the network together. The protagonist journeying to reconnect the world after a cataphoric event. That is the basic premise of the story. The mechanics are very linear and easy to pick up and the story is what keeps the game interesting and wanting more. Ultimately connecting the dots for the physical network of the country and the mental connections within the story. This game is all about the different connections and how you can come together. Each of these connections you delivered to had their own backstory for them and how they fit into this world. For instance, you can deliver medical supplies from a doctors safehouse to aid the birth of a child from another safehouse. It was interesting to see these interact with one another because human interaction is quite limited within the world. It is mostly yourself venturing out and seeing these people as holograms rather than themselves. The main characters in the game make up for this though. Hearing and discovering their stories was really interesting. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the story for this game as it connects all the dots you try to analyse throughout the game. A solid conclusion and a forgiving ending to Sam’s story but with a small sense of wanting to continue on.

The world is beautiful. The terrain that you have to traverse is interesting. Quite a large variety of different features not necessarily flat plains but mountains, cliffs, crevices, woods, snow etc. It made you plan accordingly whilst out on a delivery since these conditions were brutal if you were not prepared and I loved that. Making sure you had a ladder to climb up a cliff in case it would be too tall or equipping a speed skeleton to traverse the landscape faster. It was never boring, I never found myself tired of the terrain and actually enjoyed getting around on foot most of the time.

Soundtrack is top notch. I would probably say one of my top 5 honestly. It's not over the top cinematic music but it caters perfectly to the setting. The official soundtrack and Low Roar did an amazing job in the music creation because it sets an incredible ambience when exploring. I found myself to listen to most of the songs on spotify quite frequently since they are easy to come back to.

This game was a hidden gem for me even though it was hiding in plain sight. What an experience to play which I will remember for a while.

"As a fan of MGS, with what little I heard I went in cautiously optimistic. I did not expect to love the game as much as I did.

I'm an impatient person. I like action and I like it sooner rather than later, long form story driven games rarely keep my interest. This game was one heck of an exception. Even now I cannot fully explain just how this game enraptured me for 2 weeks of nearly nonstop, uninterrupted play. It's one of the few games I've actually 100% completed.

 If I were to describe it without spoilers, I'd equate it to the same drug-like addictive nature of something like Factorio, except instead of ""how do I optimize my factory's production?"" its instead ""how do I optimize my route from place to place?"" The game is a nonstop positive feedback loop of going from place to place, delivering cargo, building structures and connections with the various game characters, and making traversing the expansive world not only easier for yourself, but easier for other players as well. The games heavy usage of merging player's worlds and experiences together works very much in its favor as you are not just motivated by your own desire to make travel easier, but to make travel easier for those newer players that come after you. It's all about connecting the world again and you genuinely feel that throughout all aspects of gameplay.

The story is genuinely fantastic, especially if you're a fan of MGS. It has that signature bizzare Kojima ham and cheese with in-your-face symbolism, pun-tastic names of all the main characters, and bizarre video game references at inappropriate times. 
I understand this game is not for everyone, if you have doubts get it on sale as I've seen it go for 50% quite often, or wait for the Director's Cut to hopefully come to steam. Trust me, if you think this game may even remotely be worth your time, give it a try. This is definitely one of my favorite games I've played in recent years and I will not soon forget it.",True,41,0,2021-10-08 19:29:40
"[h1] SPOILER-FREE REVIEW [/h1]

DIDNT KNOW ABOUT CHARACTER LIMIT FOR REVIEWS LOL 

TL;DR: Stop whining lol

[b] ADDRESSING THE DISCOURSE [/b]

For months prior to purchasing this game, I read and watched numerous reviews on it. Most of them fell into two categories. The first being those that relegated the game to the category of ""walking simulator"" and dismissed it as being uninteresting or lacking in depth, and the second being those that agreed with the aforementioned critiques but made some poorly articulated argument that it is still a good game in spite of them. 
Given this response, I was apprehensive going into the game, but still interested enough by the atmosphere and Kojima-isms to give it a shot. 

Personally, I can't say I view these critiques as valid. If the game truly garners the moniker of ""walking simulator,"" this is only in the most comprehensive sense. I feel that the phrase is somewhat reductive of how the game actually plays. Most of the gameplay is, undeniably, movement. However, this is handled in a manner that is far more engaging than the usual ""hold down 'W' with a heavy object"" style of most games tagged as ""walking simulators."" Here, you have to carefully manage numerous factors, both predictable and not, in order to traverse the landscape. I rarely found myself just idly walking, as the game constantly requires you to engage with it dynamically. It's possible that the mechanics here just coincidentally appeal to me, but I do feel that there is something to be said for the seamless combination of tool usage, maneuvering styles, and planning at play. Thus, I find little truth in the assessments which suggest excessive simplicity. 
This critique usually comes paired with the notion that the game is too repetitive. I can see where this idea is rooted, as every mission does indeed require something to be transported from one location to another - effectively a fetch quest - but the sheer diversity of terrain, obstacles, and mitigation thereof make each one unique, especially as you begin to unlock more and more methods by which to handle the difficulties at hand. 

[b] DISCUSSION [/b]

This game far exceeded my expectations, especially in terms of uniting its gameplay with its story. Both sides are satisfyingly intertwined, and neither feels unintentional. 
I've already outlined the core aspects of the gameplay, but there is more to be said about the mechanics of further specificity. 
The attention to detail here is astounding. In the past few years, the idea of the ""systemic"" game has become increasingly prevalent, especially in the open world category. I have been particularly impressed by this style of deeply interwoven mechanics in titles such as Breath of the Wild and Caves of Qud, and I can honestly say that DEATH STRANDING still shines even in the face of those high benchmarks. Were this not the case, I think some element of the core gameplay would fall short, but its incessant adherence to the rules of its own world imparts a deep sense of immersion. 

Another aspect which impressed me was the sheer usefulness of all of the tools at your disposal. I generally tend to pick one weapon or playstyle in games and stick to that throughout, but DEATH STRANDING meticulously ensures that all avenues must be explored. At the same time, this dynamic feels less like a cumbersome requirement than a freeing encouragement of experimentation - an opportunity to hone your skills in a plethora of different ways. The various tools and methods presented to you throughout the game all feel extremely satisfying as well, each complementing your ""arsenal"" in a way that opens doors to plenty of potential approaches which might have previously seemed out of reach. Especially the grenade launcher. 

While the stealth-based combat was great, I did find myself mildly frustrated by a few of the more high-octane sequences, but I attribute this more to my use of a controller than anything else. I generally would use a keyboard and mouse for this kind of game, but I found a controller much more comfortable for the movement mechanics. Still, my rusty analog stick aiming made some of the fast paced shooting somewhat annoying. Your mileage may vary. 

The online aspect of this game is also a welcome addition, and functions as an integral part of your experience rather than just some peripheral element intended to justify the game being advertised as having multiplayer functionality. Each time you connect a new region to the chiral network, gaining access to the structures built by other players, your traversal of the area becomes far easier, imbuing the task of connection with a great sense of accomplishment. When you find yourself in remote, treacherous terrain, the relief of an online ladder or climbing anchor is truly unmatched. Additionally, when you are notified that other players have made use of your constructions, it makes the process feel gratifyingly transactional. 

On a technical level, the game is also quite impressive. The graphics are truly breathtaking throughout much of the game, and the character models are some of the best I've seen. Additionally, the animations are top notch - an aspect that makes the cutscenes so much more impactful. 

The story is bizarre, at times meandering, and varying in tonality, but ultimately very human. It is characterized by Kojima's usual idiosyncrasies. These may turn some people off, but if you are willing to roll with the punches, a fairly elegant narrative is presented. Kojima's portrayal of this world and its effect on the characters who inhabit it is masterful, and a true testament to the storytelling potential of games as a medium. I've seen some criticism of the highly technical ""info-dumps"" that happen in the game, and while it does have its fair share of technobabble, comprehension of the story is never impeded. Overall, the course of the story is fascinating, unpredictable, and fairly meaningful as well. It is heavy on cutscenes, but each is so well executed that I took little issue with this. 

The characters in this game are incredibly well written, with each having their own unique connection to the worldbuilding. It helps that the main cast gives excellent performances across the board. I may just be too susceptible to the emotional whims of media, but I was genuinely choked up during quite a few scenes. 

Kojima's use of rhetorical devices in this medium is very impressive. The story and its rather circuitous manner of handling its thematic material meshes perfectly with the gameplay, each enhancing the other and resulting in an extremely satisfying feedback loop. DEATH STRANDING truly captures a feeling of accomplishment with each task you complete, without relying on excessive grinding or other similar tactics. 

[b] VERDICT [/b]

While my review has up to this point been fairly glowing, I will say flat out that this game is not for everyone. In fact, I wonder if it is even appropriate for it to have been marketed as an experience that would appeal to a wide range of gamers. 

This game is an achievement to be sure. The writing, gameplay, and technical design choices are masterful. However, it also must be noted that the game is a subversion of the conventions of its medium. In a similar style to historical cinematic movements, DEATH STRANDING employs highly reflexive elements to distance itself from its peers. Where pioneers of the French New Wave abandoned the traditions of cinematic language to re-define the medium, so too does Kojima re-approach the conventions of this medium to present a truly unique experience, solidifying DEATH STRANDING as more of an experimental art piece than conventional entertainment. In spite of this, the game is extremely enjoyable, but maybe not for everyone. If you're not willing to see it through, maybe don't pick it up in the first place.",True,329,11,2021-07-03 21:42:00

But after playing for some time and discovering various aspects of the game (both story and gameplay wise), it will grow on you and your feelings, touch your soul more or less deeply depending on how sensitive you are. Yes, it is a game about delivering cargo from one place to another, but it is also so much more ! You have to think through what you will have to expect from the terrain you will have to use, prepare your equipment and your mind to face the different dangers. From places to other places you progressively learn the lore of the game bit by bit, through emails, interviews and cinematics. I will avoid any spoiler about the story by just saying the following: it talks about human evolution, love, social links, community, progress, life and death and a few other things. The whole thing scattered over 50/60h of gameplay with good plot twists, surprising events and touching stories.

Yes, this game isn't for everyone, but I deeply love it and can only recommend it if what I said previously caught your attention. 
Enjoy life and this game.",True,49,2,2020-10-26 19:58:48
"From the moment Death Stranding was announced at E3 2016 I, like many others, was both confused and intrigued as to what the game actually was. For the almost 4 years following I was always excited to see what the game would become. When reviews for the game came out I watched IGN's review only to be disappointed by how it described the game. I didn't own a PS4 and had no knowledge of a PC port so I ended up forgetting about the game completely. 

In early February of this year while listening to a Spotify playlist of video game soundtracks the song 'Don't Be So Serious' caught my ear. On a whim I decided to listen to the entire album for Death Stranding on Spotify. One hour and forty five minutes later I had preordered my copy of Death Stranding on Steam and began the long wait for the game's release. Between early February and the time of writing this review(mid July 2020), as anyone not living under a rock would know, alot has happened in the world. Regardless of anyone's political stance it should be easy to agree that the world, especially the US, is in a state turmoil right now. Through out all of that time I had been listening to both Death Stranding's album and soundtrack. Its in this atmosphere that I played Death Stranding for the first time.

[b] If you are willing to purchase this game, stop reading reviews and buy it. If you still need convincing or just want to listen to some random person's analysis, read on. I will remain as spoiler free as possible. [/b]

It is important to preface any discussion about Death Stranding by saying the tried and true: 'this game is not for everyone'. It isn't. To help you figure out if you would enjoy this game let me help you picture a scene that  I experienced:

[i] You've been walking for ages now. You plod one foot in front of the other, carefully scanning the snow ahead of you to ensure that you wont slip and damage your cargo, or yourself. All you can hear is the deafening roar of wind rushing through the snowy peaks and your own shivers. The wind begins to pick up and you stumble to one side, the weight of your cargo on your back weighing you down excruciatingly. You know if you damage this cargo too much you'll have to turn back and start all over again. As you look up you let out a groan, no longer able to see more then a couple feet in front of you through the snowstorm. You pull up your map and see that you are so close to the end of this miserable mountain range so you take a swig from your trusted Monster Energy® flask, put your head down, and force yourself forward. After painfully slow step after agonizingly slow step you realize that you are actually heading down. Finally, you must be so close. The view ahead of you clears and you see a beautiful lush valley stretched out before you. You missed the color green. As you hurry down the slope and trod along the rocky tundra towards a structure in the distance booming orchestral synths and calming vocals fade in. You relax, you made it. You turn in your cargo and get ready for your next delivery. [/i]

If the scenario I just described gets you as aroused as it does me, get this game and stop reading this review. The core gameplay loop provides that experience in spades. Especially if you play on the hardest difficulty, which I recommend.

Now, over 580 words into this, lets start my actual review.

You may have noticed that in the scenario I just put forward I used the first person when, in reality, the game is third person almost entirely. That brings me to my first point I want to talk about. I have always been attracted to first person games since I played Skyrim. Ever since I wandered from Riverwood to Whiterun, then to Bleak Falls Barrow I have always been enamored with games that made me feel immersed in their world. Previous to playing Death Stranding I had believed that to be truly immersive as it could be a game needed to be in the first person. Death Stranding proved me wrong. I have never felt more immersed in a game's world. Considering as much of the time in this game is spent walking from one point to the next alot of pressure was put on the sound design and environment design teams to keep that travel engaging, and it is. The ambient sounds in this game combined with the astounding landscapes in this game actually made me want to use the games included photo mode(which is very good). I cant say much for spoiler reasons but the sights you will see and places you walk through in this game are truly awe inspiring, and the sound rises to meet it. The game really makes you feel like [strike] spiderman [/strike] you are there.

Speaking of walking through places now would be a good moment to talk about the level design. Level design is not something that is brought up often in most open world games but in Death Stranding it is done so well that I would feel amiss not touching on it. Much of the moment to moment decisionmaking in this game is based around deciding what route to take to your destination and how to do it. Looking back on some of the paths I took it is becomes obvious that there are certain routes that were designed as the primary way to approach a destination. However, these routes were so well crafted and hidden that they made me feel as if I was truly making my own path to the destination, while in reality I was going exactly where the game designers wanted me to do. Especially in an open world game, I have never see level design done this well and this subtle.

Earlier in my scenario I mentioned the music. Its incredible. I don't much care for the genre of music that Death Stranding uses however every single song on the 'songs from the game' album as well as the soundtrack is incredible. And when the songs fade in as you walk through desolate America it truly does fit the game perfectly and really works well with the themes of the game.

Lets talk about the themes of this game and its story. If anyone is reading this who has already played the game you are most likely chuckling to yourself. The story in this game is complex. Very complex. There are many twists and turns that rely on you truly paying attention to the cutscenes and dialogue to grasp. This is not the type of game where you can skip cutcenenes and still get the gist of the story from the mission instructions. I mentioned the atmosphere that I played this game in because it connects significantly to the themes of this game. This is the closest I will come to spoilers to I will leave my description of the themes of this game under a spoiler warning. While it doesn't spoil any plot points, some may want to discover the themes of this game themselves. [spoiler] The major themes of this game include human connection, isolation, and depression. Its obvious to see how these themes tie into the time I played this game. These themes are woven into the story and gameplay in ingenious ways, but those are to spoilery... [/spoiler] It is also important to mention that the story is slow paced and takes its time building the plot. It isnt poorly paced, it just takes time for the story to really open up and start making sense.

Finally. Game made me cry at the end. It takes alot for a game to make me cry, not tear up, cry. 

If after all of this you think that the game might be for you, then get it. It is fully worth the price of admission. Death Stranding weaves a complex and deep story that was a wonder to experience along with its fantastic gameplay systems and genre-defying gameplay. For me at least, Death Stranding will go down as one of my favorite pieces of media ever. And if you are the type of person who looks at the gameplay and gets horny or starts drooling at the mentioning of a slow paced sci-fi story it may just be a favorite for you as well.

"It was hard to wrap my head around this and finally give it a verdict. First of all, I'll summarize the good and the bad aspects of the game as usual:

PROs:

+ The idea at the basis of gameplay is definitely something new.
+ Using the structures that other players have built is convenient and doesn't feel like a difficulty bypass, rather is a way to optimize travel time and resources.
+ Traversing a harsh terrain area can prove difficult and tedious the first time, but once you connect that area to the network you get access to online-built structures and with a collaborative effort with other players you can create the conditions for a safe and quick travel across. It is very rewarding to see the structures you've built being put to good use by others and make tremendous improvements to an area's navigability.
+ The story has some interesting, non-banal development that definitely keeps the interest high without being too hard to reconstruct once all the loose ends are tied.

CONs:

- The whole game is just an endless set of fetching quests. Go to the place, get the stuff to be delivered, delivery it to the other place, get the next delivery. Rinse and repeat forever. It’s just not fun at all.
- The few ""boss fight"" sequences and the few fights in general are nothing but weak TPS sequences that aren't particularly remarkable nor fun to play.
- Exploration isn't particularly rewarding either. There's a bunch of (useless) collectable holochips scattered around but they're mostly within the limits of some settlement, therefore there's no real incentive or need to go out of your way and explore the wilderness. In fact, it is detrimental to do so since you'll only waste time and most likely damage your cargo. The entire game feels kinda hollow despite having many player-built structures etc, because you're never seeing any other npc in person, only holograms, and ""cities"" are completely empty.
- If you thought Metal Gear Solid games were verbose, you haven't seen anything. The pacing here is atrocious sometimes, you will be continuously interrupted during the whole game by someone talking to explain something.
- Secondary deliveries are completely useless, they will only make you strengthen the connection with the outpost that receives the delivery, which basically just lets you earn some cosmetic items and a little star badge once the connection level is at its maximum. Automated deliveries have a high chance to fail and won't count towards the ranking system, so those are pretty useless too.
- The like system is also useless, at first I thought I was gonna be using the points I accumulated as a form of currency or something, but no. All the likes you get are just gonna be displayed there for amusement.
- BTs are supposed to be a threat that should be avoided as much as possible and approached with the utmost caution when no other options are available, but as soon as you get your first anti-BT weapon - which is quite early in the game - it becomes stupidly easy to deal with them. In fact, when having to get across a BT-infested zone it is much more efficient and less time consuming to just go in there guns blazing and let them grab you so that the Catcher will spawn, then quickly kill it and be done with it, rather then playing hide and seek for several minutes. Once you kill the Catcher, all the other BTs will disappear and the area will remain clear until the next rainfall, plus you'll get a huge amount of crystals as a bonus. Feels extremely cheap.
- PC version has an apparently unfixable problem with cutscenes stuttering, which is quite annoying.
- Without spoilers, the plot of this game suffers from the most severe case of ""big ol' 'splaining"" I've ever seen. Information about plot and characters is administered in drips and drabs, just barely enough to keep the player interested, and once you reach the ending you just get to sit on your ass and digest a HUGE amount of info that is provided during the most boring semi-interactive sequence ever, which comes after a long cutscene and then is followed by another long cutscene which is followed by yet another short gameplay sequence and finally a VERY LONG movie that finally wraps it all together. The entire ending sequence just drags on forever, it’s almost ridiculous.
- Despite all the emphasis put on building connection with others etc, almost all the primary characters of the game seem to be there to explain you stuff and little else. You don't interact with them as a player and even the interactions you see between Sam and them are mostly happening via holograms. There are some emotional moments that try to give the characters some more depth, but once they've had their spotlight all the characters involved go back to the sideline and there they remain 'til the end. They all feel like a bit more fleshed out versions of Codec characters, and thus they fail to convey the sense of presence and importance that they should give.

I really wanted to be able to say that playing this game was a memorable experience, it had all the potential to be so, but it wasn't. There are some rewarding moments as I mentioned but those are scarce and 90% of the time I had to force myself to go on because playing just felt like a chore. What frankly angers me the most is the fact that the pacing was so atrociously slow that the game probably could've taken less than half the time to be completed if the plot wasn't so terribly diluted and it would've been much more enjoyable if that had been the case. Kojima went to great lengths to build a product with the clear intent to make the player feel like they have earned the right to see how it all ends, but the execution was so dragged out that the only effect it had on me was to bring me to exhaustion.

I also think that Death Stranding failed miserably in its most flaunted intent, which is to make the player feel like the connections established throughout the game are meaningful and that the collective effort averted the crisis. Didn't feel anything of that. All I've been seeing in this game are the shadows of distant people that placed a bridge here or a piece of road there, things that didn't really make a huge difference, just saved me some time to get where I needed to be. But I would've reached my destination regardless. I can't remember a single player's name among the countless I’ve seen showed in front of me because I've never interacted directly with anyone. Ironically, I had more interactions and felt more the presence of MULEs, despite their being obstacles in the way due to their non-cooperative attitude. But at least they're there, I can see them and shoot them. All the other NPCs are holograms, shadows, and can only be interacted with via their computer terminal. They might as well not be there and it would make no difference whatsoever. The entire narration was based on this concept, you keep hearing about ""reuniting people"", ""building bridges, not walls"" and many other such slogans, but when you put that stuff aside you realise that the whole storyline, albeit interesting overall, has no life of its own. It's a plot entirely derived from and subordinated to the moral lesson it intends to give, an approach that feels rather paternalistic other than resulting in a lack of pathos and involvement. Everything is presented in a plastic, greatly detailed way but feels static, like something that was made more as an exercise in style rather than having been genuinely conceived as a story with live and vibrant characters. I feel like I haven't experienced a journey that guided me through a narration, but rather I've been making my way through some kind of performance that was aimed to send me a specific statement and nothing else. It was a well-crafted one, sure, but it didn't convince me in its development. And to be honest, if a statement is all that your work has to offer maybe you should’ve thought better about it and at least tried to make it entertaining.",False,190,18,2021-12-06 15:35:08

"In the world of AAA games, this feels like a classical orchestra against the scream of hyper-produced pop. A slow burn. The dramatic and impactful moments made more so, contrasted by the detailed, methodical and thoroughly engaging ""hiking simulator"" game play. 

Make no mistake this game is (mostly) as relaxed as they come. The cut-scenes often leave you upwards of 30+ minutes between button presses, and when you do regain control again it's inevitably to walk from A-B.

But this is a game that is far more than the sum of it's parts.

Against the grime and grit of an oppressive world lies a heartwarming tale of human compassion and hope. Told in part through your own actions as a character; by helping NPCs and other player alike (through passive means of leaving equipment and helpful signage), and through the fantastic performances across all the character-actors unraveling the main plot.

This underlying message of hope is the thread that constantly tugs you along through it's gameplay. Gameplay which is in equal parts relaxed, detailed, and surprising. This game drills right down into the mundane details of walking a human from A-B and somehow creates engaging and rewarding game play out of it; weight management, the condition of your boots, weather or not you need to piss etc. Sam is purposefully clunky, slow to move - As would you be if carrying upwards of 200 kilos on your person most of the time. 

Moment to moment the game enforces the feeling of great weight. A great satisfaction can be gained through managing that weight with the preparation, planning and execution of your routes. Had Sam of been made any more nimble, you would be robbed of such satisfaction which forms the core loop. It works.

This loop gets a much-welcomed mix-up often through the use of serviceable basic combat, and utterly harrowing stealth segments which pitch you up against all-but-invisible enemies. There isn't anything outright groundbreaking with these areas, but combining it with the core hiking experience and focusing on non-lethal combat puts emphasis on the vulnerability of Sam and his cargo. Punctuating the methodical pace with intense rushes of adrenaline made sweeter as they are relished for their scarcity. All of this infuses a freshness rarely seen in games of this stature.

The game has it's Kojima-style goof and wild tonal shifts, but I have found these to be more subdued than something like Metal Gear Solid and far more grounded than the wild, branching and convoluted plot points of those games. By all means this game has its convolution - that comes with the territory, but still It's astonishing that Kojima has woven a world in which a hi-tech fetus strapped to you makes any sense at all. Somehow all the far-fetched nonsense you see in the trailers comes together as a cohesive package (most of the time).

The combination of an expertly presented atypical plot and left-field gameplay with deep mechanics makes Death Stranding one of the freshest AAA experiences this generation. Loved it.",True,61,1,2020-12-21 14:00:51
"5 star. epic.
now i normally get bored of all games at aged 45, been there done that years before.
or they get too hard and i just cant be bothered with the effort.. too much of a challenge.

but this, even though everyone said its a walking simulator really caught me.
its not a simulator, it is an adventure and an epic story almost a sci fi movie.

tip was to avoid some of the missions and concentrate on Sam's orders.  yes there was still walking to be done but then when you think of other games, you always have to do this sort of walking about.


but anyway.. the story is just up there with the greatest of all.
i have now completed at 75 hrs. not interested in completionism... but i may pop back just for a chilled walk across some mountains and rememeber how the story finished.

"I was sceptical to this game which has been described what sounds like a cutscene storm on top of a walking simulator. I really dislike cutscenes in games, and usually just skip right through them if possible. I have precious little time for playing games, and when I do I want to play and not watch a poorly written movie, just interrupted with some linear gameplay. These kind of games tend to be popular though, so I guess I am just not a mainstream gamer.

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself intrigued by the bizarre story unfolding. There's a ton of lore in here, and it is all presented in an interesting way where the characters all have a strong personality that keeps me invested.

And the game needs an interesting story, because it does focus on it a lot. During the first hour or so, do not expect to do much except just watching cutscenes. But it gradually takes off the support wheels and let you take more and more control, so the world is opened for you and you can do what you want in it.

The game mechanics are very basic. Walk from A to B to deliver your cargo that you keep on your back. The bigger the cargo, the more you struggle keeping balance. Navigate through the gorgeous landscapes and keep pressing forward through all kinds of obstacles, ranging from easy ones like scattered stones and rivers to more challenging ones like vertical cliffs and ravines. You can use ropes, ladders and other equipment to solve how to get past a difficult area.

But the real challenge is the presence of some supernatural entities, that manifests during rain. There are also bandits who want to get hold of your cargo. So, as the game progresses, you find that there are a lot more to it than simply walking about.

But make no mistake, there will be a lot of walking around. At the moment I am not very deep into the story, but I am already not starting to feel my patience is getting stretched a bit. The most annoying thing that happens is you need to walk for a long time to get to some pre-determined even that will give you a real challenge. If you fail, then all the walking to get there has been in vain.

First of all the game is a fresh breath, as the AAA games typically tend to be quite stale without any new ideas. Most game studios throw themselves on popular genres like fortnite to cash out more with less risk, but in the process just flooding the market with similar games. So, kudos to the game designer here for taking a chance on what he believe in.

I am enjoying it so far, more than I thought I would. Can easily recommend to anyone who want to try something new and strange, with more depth and polish than the typical indie game studio can afford.

"This game helped me through quarantine and made me cry, thank you Kojima Productions.",True,98,6,2021-04-28 00:01:01
"[h1]Introduction[/h1]

Death Stranding is action-adventure game developed by Kojima Productions and published by 505 games in the year 2019. It is based on a certain unique kind of extinction event where humanity is struggling for its survival. The dead also known as BTs ( Beached Things ) no longer travel to the afterlife and stay stranded in our plane, ever hungry and preying for the living humans. When the dead drags the alive to the other side a massive explosion occurs on the spot, killing everyone falling in the blast's radius forming a crater. And as i mentioned, the newly dead linger on as BTs waiting for their prey. This is where the porters come in, who risks heir lives to transport all kinds of materials, varying from everyday items to pocket sized nukes.

[h1]Setting[/h1]

As the game starts we get to see our protagonist Sam venturing the uneven rocky terrain  trying to reach his destination. This is where we are introduced with two of the most challenging aspects of the game, one is rain which is no ordinary rain.  It is named ""timefall"" since whatever that water from heavens above touches get old instantly. And second is a sneaky BT which appear invisible to the naked eye (unless you can a BB {Bridge Baby}). Narrowly escaping the BT and collecting his deliverables Sam sets of to make the firs delivery. The events from here on mark the beginning of a painful, tiring, inspiring and life changing journey of a porter trying to unite a country in tatters with  knots made by bringing people together into one single chiral network. The story ahead is yours to explore.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Gameplay first of all seems like a walking simulator to the naked eye but its so much more than walking from point A to point B. The most important aspect is the journey from A to B, as craters are present all over the map, which in turn are filled with MULEs (rogue porters who will try to steal your cargo, equipped with weapons, electric spears and sticky guns) and BTs. But not all is grim, as you will see the game allows players to build structures like bridges, safe houses, storage posts, timefall shelters, zip line points and generators to cross these hurdles and allow other players to use it while they go through this region. The like system allows players to send likes to other players for their structures, mementos and sign posts. The real beauty is to see your structure see help so many people reach their destination. This makes your feel happy and so proud for the contribution and its really nice to see so much support from the players. 

Coming to MULEs, they can be handled by parrying their attack in the initial stages and later on in full on stealth mode when the ping negator is available. As game progresses you get different kinds of lethal and non lethal weapons which can be used as frontal assault or backup for tricky situation. For Bts though only Sam's blood can hurt them as he is a repatriate ( he comes back alive every time he dies ). Blood is used for making grenades and as ammo for special BT guns which are collected during resting period of Sam in safe houses. 

[h1]Bridge Baby[/h1]

Now for the most intriguing part in the game which is the pod baby attached with Sam. A Bridge Baby is a baby which is extracted from a still mother, which is their mother's body is no more but they are alive which gives them a connection between both worlds. Hence, the child can sense BTs when they are around and attaching them will also show Sam the ghastly stranded BTs. The story of the BB which Sam carries is a vital cog in the events of Death Stranding which is left for you to explore.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Death Stranding  is an excellent game carrying the genius of Hideo Kojima, truly a mind bending and masterful premise with elements from Metal Gear Solid. The only con i can point is the final portion of the game which feels over stretched with over the top boss battles thrown one after another. Other than this, its a memorable title which i am sure which stick to your mind for a while. With this i end my review, hope it helps you.

"I played Death Stranding on the PS4 when it launched, it  has become one of my all time favorite games and the most unique and memorable game in the last years.

The game is beautiful and so is the story, the gameplay contrary to what you may think, is fun and sometimes challenging, from planing a route and choosing equipment to going through some hard terrain and overcome it. This is the type of game that has you so hooked up that you lost the time sense. 

The online aspect of the game is a big part of the experience where you connect with fellow porters and even if you are playing by yourself you will never feel alone, make sure to be connected to it when you play the game.

Edit: After finishing the game again, I can only say it's awesome, very well made port, not a single crash or bug and the performance is flawless, had no trouble in my 100% completion journey.

"[h1]Overview[/h1]
[b]Death Stranding[/b] (DST) is a post-apocalyptic open world title not belonging to any genre, as it builds a unique gameplay from scratch. Players impersonate Sam, one of the few Porters that dare to brave the desolation left by the Stranding, a mysterious event that broke the barrier between the world of the dead and that of the living. After rejoining the UCA, Sam is tasked with traveling to the other side of the continent, uniting all the survivors in the process to restore America to its former glory. His journey through the wastelands will go beyond any expectation, and become a legendary tale.

🟩 [b]The Good Side[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Unique, satisfying gameplay formula[/b]
DST has a unique take on the open-world gameplay style, as it has players traversing incredibly vast stretches of land where the main obstacle are not enemies or dungeons, but the landscape itself. Most gameplay consists in fulfilling delivery contracts - which may sound boring. Instead this title manages to make an astoundingly creative experience out of it. With a vast array of tools ranging from simple ladders to advanced vehicles, each player will forge their own path to destination, with a reward system that keeps interest up till the very end.

[*][b]Incredible visuals & art direction[/b]
From mountain, river to the desolation of urban remains, this game is nothing short of majestic at every turn. Amazing landscapes only seldom found in your average open world, here instead become commonplace, with maniacal attention to the smallest detail. Models, animations and effects are of masterpiece-quality without any flaw or inconsistency.

[*][b]Revolutionary multiplayer[/b]
DST uses a unique asynchronous multiplayer, where structures built by others may appear in your world, and vice-versa. Not only that, but players will also be able to upgrade each others' structures, contribute to larger projects such as highways, and leave signs around in a fashion similar to Dark Souls - other than ""like"" each others' structures, exchanging XP in the process.

[*][b]Overall great story[/b]
Hideo Kojima did it again, as expected he managed to cook up an extremely convoluted story that branches into philosophy, human existentialism, history and a dozen other subjects with equal complexity, while also narrating the adventures, betrayals and losses of Sam and his companions. Too bad it loses a lot later on, but it's overall memorable.

[*][b]Amazing soundtrack[/b]
The music accompanying the most iconic moments and boss fights is nothing short of perfect, amplifying the magnitude of those moments tenfold. The selection of tracks employed here suits masterfully each situation, contributing to the narrative pathos.
[/list]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2173866322

🟥 [b]The Bad Side[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Mediocre boss fights[/b]
The bosses of DST are mostly disappointing, either having simplistic patterns with zero evolution in the course of battle, recycled designs, and/or being hulking bullet sponges without any unique mechanic to them. Combat might not be the main focus of the game, but in contrast with the overall quality, these fights do not live up to par.

[*][b]Control problems[/b]
Many players (including myself) have experienced a repetition / delay in game inputs, both on KBM or Gamepad. This bug can lead to weapon misfires, unwanted actions, and very well your death in the most serious combat situations. A nasty bug that definitely makes the experience more annoying.

[*][b]Story pacing becomes a drag later on[/b]
As you approach the late/end story phases, an excessive repetition of already seen scenes, along with some good old complete nonsense that contradicts things stated earlier on, ruins the narrative pacing quite a lot. It becomes a mess for the sake of BEING a mess - in the later stages.

Initially plays out on foot, though soon enough will be supported by vehicles and more advanced means later on. Traversing the landscape has a variety of mechanics to it including fatigue, stamina to resist effort, balancing your character to prevent falling down, and various environment phenomena such as storms. There is not much to explore as the world turned into a wasteland, the few and far between points of interest are almost all mission-related, though some collectibles and secondary NPCs can be found by the attentive explorer. 

A handy map will enable planning your paths, your scanner will reveal hazards and items around you, while the structures of other players may help you in your journey if they spawn in the right place. The land is vast, varied and full of unexpected dangers.

[b]Character Management[/b]
Is done on the fly while exploring or in a more complete way at one of the many outposts available. You will be able to use 3D printing to craft weapons, equipment, utility via terminals, with the resources found while exploring or gained by leveling up the trust with each outpost with successful deliveries. Making sure you have all the necessary equip and managing your weight is fundamental, depending on what type of mission will be your next. Being overburdened with cargo will lead to massive maluses, and quick stamina loss. Your character can level up passive stats as he makes more and more successful deliveries, each will benefit him differently such as more cargo capacity, or better balance.

[b]Deliveries[/b]
Are the main activity and are divided into several categories, from standard ones to time-sensitive or with other special conditions. Making sure the cargo arrives in good state is the primary concern, as too much damage to it will void the contract and in some cases trigger a game over. Depending on time, cargo status, weight and other factors you will receive a rating, equivalent to a certain amount of reputation with a particular client. Leveling up reputation unlocks weapon blueprints, gadgets and many useful tools. 

[b]Combat[/b]
Plays out in third-person and can be either melee or with guns, grenades and devices. Killing people is possible but strongly discouraged as it has terrible consequences - a vast array of non-lethal weapons is available and effective. Not only humans but also monsters from the ""other side"" will be your enemies, either being stealth or fighting them openly are viable strategies. Combat may not be the main focus but holds up quite well and has mechanics like dodging, parrying, headshots and status effects to build a serviceable system. Enemy AI is not too brilliant however, rather predictable.

"WOW WOW WOW.
This game is an absolute masterpiece.
The Gameplay is brilliant and has lots of brand new mechanics which you've never seen anywhere else.
The graphics and the environmental design are fu*cking gorgeous and you can never stop looking at the views.
This game has the best character development you'll ever see, not only the main character but every single person you'll have encounter with. It had A LOT of celebrities and used all of them perfectly. Each person has its own unique personality with a great great background which probably will make you cry.
AND GOD DA*MN don't even get me started on the story... I really wanna know what drug kojima uses to come with such ideas cause a normal human being can't just simply think of something like this. He deserves every complement he gets cause he's a fu*cking genius.
Thank you kojima for letting us be a part of this amazing experience and blowing our minds once again.

"Definitely one of the stranger games I've ever played (both story and gameplay mechanics), but it's very intense and beautiful.

The environments, the music, the characters, and the cut scenes make for a very intense, long, and weird Netflix series with a unique spin on the post-apocalyptic world.

The game is pretty hard to get into at first.  The controls are odd and the UI is intimidating, but if one is patient, reads the tutorial tips, and doesn't try to rush through the game, then it becomes a very rewarding experience.",True,54,1,2021-04-11 06:08:46
"I haven't finished the walkthrough on PC yet, and I feel like that won't happen anytime soon, but on PS4 I got through it completely, so I think I can leave my review.

I remember the time when I first saw the teaser and was looking forward to the release of this game. With the release of the trailer the desire to buy and play became even stronger, because it all looked amazing and great, but with the gameplay video there were some doubts, but I still wanted to play and try it myself.

In terms of story the game did not disappoint me, passed the 6-7 hours a day, watching and listening to literally everything. Passed with the Russian voiceover, and unfortunately could not enjoy the voice of Troy Baker. Although I'm terrible at English, but his voice is an orgasm to my ears.

As for the gameplay, there are already minuses. The game has too much information, which to me, makes it difficult to master. The second time around is certainly already much easier to pass and everything is clear, but here the first time there were moments when I paused for about 10 minutes and did not know what to do.

Graphics. I play on ultra-high/120FPS and the difference with the PS4 is minimal. On the console version is a little more soapy picture and 30FPS (that's the main minus), otherwise I saw no difference.

As for the controls, I want to point out the victory of the keyboard and mouse, although I prefer to play on a gamepad. In general, the port is very well done and seems to be without bugs.

I think i have played enough to see what this game is.
Its a unique masterpiece.

Its not for everyone, but when you hit a certain chapter the game opens up with more action and more nerve wrecking moments. how will i survive this?

The music is phenominal, the story is fantastic and the gameplay is unique. 
Kojima did a outstanding job with this game.

I certainly love this one. It pulled me in the more i played.
What started as a delivery game is ending up as a story heavy, thriller.

A must for Kojima fans and a must if you want to try something unique.
A great game that deserves praise for beeing something we have not seen enough of.

Innovation.

I bought this game on sale about 8 months ago, and didn't even bother installing it until recently, but now I'm kicking myself for not playing it sooner. This game is, in my opinion, one of the best examples of ""Video Games ARE Art"". From the breathtaking graphics, to the linear (yet not stale) story line, to the A+ acting (for the most part), just everything about this game is incredible. This game really makes you think about life and the connections we make with others, and how they affect our lives.

If you are waiting for a reason to play this game, let this review be the one. You won't regret it.",True,144,6,2022-02-21 13:26:35
"tl;dr: I tried desperately to love this game, but like cargo left out in the timefall, that love slowly rusted and fell apart. A great world and story drowned in tedious, arduous gameplay that only gets more so as time goes on. Watching all my buildings and roads rot away after a little break was like seeing my garden die.

- - - 
I fell in love with this game the first few weeks, the weird and unique world and tone of hope against bleakness. I was enraptured by every cutscene, Kojima weirdness and storytelling at it's finest. I got to middle america and began my great work. Reconnecting humanity, and restoring hope to the lost. I legitimately felt connected to the world and the work put before Sam. This, I thought, would be one for the history books. Don't worry sad masses of humanity, I will restore you. I will make you whole again.

I found my calling in connecting everything together, spending almost a full week just grinding for the materials to rebuild all the roads, and connect anyone off the highway by zipline. Judging by the lack of contributions it seemed few on my server wanted the job, but I buckled down and got to work for the greater good. Day after day, I logged in after the mule camps respawned their loot, filling up my truck time and time again to feed enormous amounts of ceramics and metals to the endlessly hungry road pavers. I tossed myself into danger, fighting scores of huge BTs for the crystals I needed to remake the world. Road after road, zipline atfer zipline, I forged a path through the unchecked wilds. And finally after eight long days I had done it, I had reconnected a huge chunk of America. It felt great, Sam the Builder. Carving out a place for civilization from the inhospitable wilderness.

I'd been fighting an uphill struggle with the tediousness of the game to do it though. Every day it was a little harder to put my Bridges boots back on and struggle for the greater good. Building civilization is one thing, but the endless fetch quests (or close enough, anyways) that make up the main gameplay loop had evolved past mind-numbing monotony into feelings of dread, like waking up and realizing you have to go into a job you hate. 

I hit my breaking point right after another wonderfully enrapturing cutscene at Heartman's lab. The moment it ended, wonder gave way to a sinking feeling in my stomach. The story bits were over. I would now have to cross even more horrible whiteout-blizzard filled mountains full of invisible enemies just to do the same shit I've been doing the whole game. Struggle mightily to deliver an order of nondescript cargo to some meaningless hologram person, with the promise of lots more of the same to come afterwards. It was just too much, I needed a break.

One week later (today as it happens) I logged back in, full again of ambition and drive. I was rested and ready, let's finish the job! I had kept America waiting long enough. I fired up the game, hit ""continue"" and listened to my GPU fan kick up a notch in preperation. The world loaded in, I checked my cuffs, and a lead boot kicked me in the gut.

All my hard work had rotted away like a cardboard box left in the rain. Most of my roads were low double or single digits away from destroyed, as was my entire zipline network. My proudest accomplishments, earned with the blood from my veins and the sweat of my brow... nearly gone after a short week of rest. 

I could spend a few more days farming and ferrying the materials to repair them, that wasn't the point. It wasn't the structure damage that was the real kick in the stomach. It was the realization that all my proud accomplishments, all that I had endeavored to build, was forever doomed to be short-lived. 

The forces of entropy on my creations were strong and tireless, and to maintain them I'd have to turn the thing I enjoyed most about the game into another mindless, hated chore. Another long, tedious grind just to keep the things I was proud of from decaying before my eyes, to say nothing of the thought of building more.

That realization broke my heart and cut my connection to the world of Death Stranding.

If that's the tone that Kojima was going for, despair and a feeling of hopeless futility, he succeeded. I may come back in time, and just do what's necessary to complete the story. But that hopeful, hardworking part of me that had struggled in vain would forever stay behind, on the beach.",False,208,19,2021-02-24 16:05:47
"This game is not for everyone as you may know. I'm a casual player but I wanted to play this because of the story and Reedus :D I knew it would be harder than I like but I bought it on sale even my PC is an old one (I have a GTX 1050 Ti). And it looks great. I was immediately drawn to it and I finished it slowly in 67 hours on the easiest difficulty.
I can't say anything bad about it. The story is immersive (it's Kojima :) ) and I liked the characters very much. The ending is... you have to see it yourselves. 
It's a walking simulator though it's not. And yes, there is hiding and fighting and it's scary a bit. But it's in my top 3 games of all time (and I'm old...)
So I defiintely recommend it. It was an outstanding experience.",True,184,0,2021-11-20 08:51:06
"This game is made for a certain type of person. One who loves enjoying scenery and traveling. I am not one of those people. The story is pretty interesting, but the gameplay is just too boring. I like Kojima, but this was just not a hit for me.",False,214,12,2021-09-04 19:00:47
"I'm really enjoying this game, and FOR ME - it's been well worth what I've paid.   Yet, I don't know if I can recommend this game without talking to the person I'm recommending it to.    This game isn't for everyone.   Lets start with some basics.   The port of this game is incredibly well done.   AAA game companies should take notes.   It's smooth, and gorgeous.     On a ultrawide monitor with settings turned up, it's incredibly immersive. 

Its social component is very clever - other players structures and imprints on the world, show up in your world.   You don't see other players, but you see what they've left behind.   A well placed rope or ladder to help you on your way,  or some critical supplies dropped exactly where you're going to need them - are all things you'll experience from other players.    The ""Currency"" of the game is ""likes"" -- more likes you have the more xp and advancing you'll do.   

So, lets boil this down to it's simplist roots.   You are a delivery man in a very green post apocolyptic type world.   You are asked to deliver packages to outposts and other cities AND since you're there, connect those cities up to the network.      That is a massive oversimplification, but at the root of it...yep.       You are ""special"" in that you don't die you get to come back to life over and over, and so your skills are valuable in this very deadly world.     You have a baby in a pod strapped to your chest, because the baby is a bridge between the world of the dead and the world of the living.   With that baby - your sensors can see the ""ghosts"".    which if they catch you, will drag you down into their world (aka you die) and worse, your packages go everywhere and you have to go scoop them all up again.

The game goes from serene with these huge vistas accompnaied by this very melodic pop music (courtesy of sony), to instantly incredibly tense because you're surrounded by the dead, and then back to melodic.   your baby goes from happy, to crying and scared, to happy again.    

The grind...is the game.    and the game isn't about destinations, it's entirely about the journey.     If you've ever gotten into an open world game and didn't do any of the objectives but instead just ran around looking at things and exploring - you may love this game.     If you like weird  anime-like story telling, you'll like this game.    If you want combat...well, the worst part of the game is when you have to do combat - so you probably won't like this.    

So far....I love the game, but my recommendation is entirely based on WHO it's going to - possibly more so than any other game I've ever played.",True,24,0,2021-06-13 01:51:58
"[h1]Death Stranding: A great and unique experience, but not for everyone![/h1]

[i][If you are too lazy to read all of my thoughts: TLDR at the bottom][/i]

[b][u]The world, story and characters[/u][/b]

The beautiful post-apocalyptic world of Death Stranding, based on photogrammetry-assets captured in Iceland, invites you to explore. The theme of “Connecting and feeling connected” is at the center of Death Strandings story about loneliness, family, loss and hope. The game manages to hold a healthy balance between “serious”, “deeply philosophical”, “funny” and “emotional”, that worked out for me very well! If you can’t stand overexposure, some cheesy puns here and there and lengthy cutscenes (basically the Kojima-way of storytelling), then you might feel turned off by the game’s narrative at first.  The well written characters, with their deeply emotional backstories have grown to my heart after a while and I always wanted to know what’s next! Also, the cast (full of Kojimas friends and people you might know) does a great job at delivering the story through their motioncapture performances and dialogue deliveries! The cinematography of the cutscenes is also one of the best in the industry!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2647400508

The story is one I still think about long after having finished the game and that’s quite a rare thing! The soundtrack and licensed music selection is also amazing and fit the atmosphere at any given moment! Seriously, there are quite some bangers in here! 

[b][u]The gameplay: Can traversal as a core gameplay mechanic be fun? (Yes!!)[/u][/b]
Death Stranding is a unique game. You might have watched some gameplay on “YouTube” and thought “Well that’s just a walking mailman! Boring!”. These thoughts are based on your mental model on how this “walking” feels in other games where you just press “W” / “LS forward” to traverse any terrain with ease. Death Stranding takes the element of traversal and makes that the one of the core elements of the game: Being aware of how terrain around you, planning smart routes and using the right equipment to traverse the roughest areas of the game get quite addicting after a while. You got to keep your balance, use the tools that you can craft, like ladders, climbing ropes and more. Getting over every hill, mountain and river feels like an achievement!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2640126860

Delivering is what you do in Death Stranding (and the only thing you for for 99% of the time)! If you expect a fast-paced action game, this is not the right game for you! There is some combat against the mules and the B.T.s, which is quite fun. Especially the Bola gun is enjoyable to use! You can also avoid most encounters with B.T.s (the black slime-thingies) by using the radar that is powered by your B.B. (that baby in the orange-juice glass).

The game takes its time to suck you into its world. Playing Death Stranding is more like an experience, than playing just a game: It feels therapeutic, meditative… Finishing each delivery is satisfying! That’s only the case, if you know that this is a [u]slow-paced[/u] game, that many people might classify as “tedious” for focusing on the traversal aspect! 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2648289659

[b][u]Feeling connected with other players[/u][/b]

The asynchronous multiplayer-elements are what makes the game very special in my eyes: While working on your deliveries and exploring the world, you gain the trust of certain people, which unlocks the ability to build structures in the area around the properties of these people to make your routes through the landscape easier. Basically, you connect knot after knot. Connecting the different knots, unlocks the ability to see the structures of other players like Ziplines, bridges or shelters and use them to your advantage and help others by upgrading them.

You can also see some of the routes others took, use the vehicles someone left, upgrade and repair structures or place signs that inform other players about upcoming dangers, restore stamina or mark enemy territories. You can also upvote all the things other people build, which gives them a notification. Kojima described the goal of the game as followed: [quote=Hideo Kojima]""After spending dozens of hours in the game you will come back to reality in the end. When you do, I want you to use what you learned in the game. Connecting is one of those things."" ([url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjUpYlKs0nM] Death Stranding: Inside Kojima Productions | Newsbeat Documentaries - YouTube [/url]) [/quote]The theme of “connection” plays a major role during gameplay and it feels so rewarding receiving all the positive feedback from all the players, so Kojima definitely hit the tooth with the drill there and made me feel less lonely for the time while playing the game!
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2650966924

All in all, I played Death Stranding for over 100h and completed all the achievements and do not regret it at all. The unique and deep story, the beautiful world and the innovative gameplay made it really special in my eyes! Death Stranding was a great escape from reality and sucked me into its world with ease!

"I've married for 7 years and had no plan for having kids... until i played this game.

BB interaction with SAM (main character) was very beautiful and thoroughly crafted.

The more i play, the more i think... isn't it good, for having and caring a tiny version of yourself in your own hand?

I've never felt like this before. in my life.

Kojima's point is :
- IT IS GOOD for having a family
- IT IS GOOD for having a connection with others
- IT IS GOOD for caring something that you loved
- IT IS GOOD for giving / accepting help

This is game for mature minded people, from a great creator unlike everything else.

Thank you for reminding me, also thank you for this game.

"Meditative, topical, contemplative, poignant – these are the words I'd use to describe Death Stranding. An avant garde video game experience that combines long, contemplative walks to deliver orders with a social strand system that enables you, dear player, to help others like you. It's equal parts weird and zany as well as relevant, inspiring you to be kinder to people you'll never see or meet. 


The game certainly isn't for everyone, but you owe it to yourself to at least try it. Try the game once. Borrow a friend's copy if you have a console, or ask your buddies to share their library, but try it. You can come back and tell me I'm full of shit, I won't disagree with you. But trust this random stranger on Steam reviews when I say you owe it to yourself to try the game at least once. Let the game unravel its mysteries for you. Then you'll understand. 

",True,27,2,2021-10-01 06:46:22
"A well-made but certainly polarizing gaming experience.

Death Stranding is probably unlike any other game you've played before. If you're not familiar with Hideo Kojima's style and humor, you may find it and its storytelling ""cringe-worthy"" and sometimes even unbearable. Like other Kojima games, this one also has 10-20 minute long cutscenes that will make your gamepad go idle. We all know its gameplay is unconventional, and that's why it divides opinions. Personally, I didn’t enjoy the traveling aspect of the game much, as it became overwhelming after a while with the BTs, the terrain, the distance between objectives, and all the back-and-forth. However, at least the story and impeccable cutscenes make up for it. Combat is okay but not particularly complex, and it reminded me of Metal Gear Solid in its approach and animations. The resemblance is undeniable, and you'll certainly notice it if you're familiar with the franchise. There are some boss fights, but they’re not spectacular—they’re mostly about shooting and draining HP bars, without requiring much strategy or mechanics.

What makes this game stand out are the cutscenes, the actors/actresses, and the voice acting. Hideo Kojima’s love for Hollywood is well-known, and this game is no exception. It provides a movie-like, dramatic experience as promised. However, for this concept to work, the story needs to be good as well. The writing, unfortunately, often feels forced, relying heavily on ""shock value"" with shallow storytelling. About 90% of the story’s ""hidden"" or shocking elements are easily predictable, making it laughable that they thought they’d be surprising. Because of this, I found it hard to get attached to the story or the characters, even though there are Hollywood-level performances from actors like Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen, and Léa Seydoux. That said, the side character stories are likely better than the main plotline and carry more emotional depth. Stories like those of Fragile, Heartman, The Deadman, and Mama were wonderful, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of them.

The original soundtrack and various artist tracks are fantastic. Low Roars' music fits the world perfectly, and when their tracks hit while approaching a target, it feels great. However, I couldn't understand why you couldn’t play them anytime in the outside world. It could have worked similarly to the Walkman in Metal Gear Solid, which would have enhanced the experience.

The graphics, thanks to the Decima engine, are still stunning and cinematic. Mountains, volcanoes, craters, and barren lands look incredibly realistic most of the time, and I can't even imagine how they would have looked with a 2022 engine, let alone the 2019 Decima version. Performance is solid, and if it’s not enough, DLSS works excellently without graphical degradation. I did encounter crashes in some parts (specifically during the crater mission), which I couldn’t resolve, and the only solution was disabling DLSS until the next mission. After that, I had no further crashes even after enabling DLSS again. The game supports actual Ultrawide monitors, though there are mini black bars on the left and right. A community update is available to fix this issue easily.

I’m giving this a positive score because I enjoy Kojima's style since the PS1 era and appreciate movie-like experiences, but your mileage may vary. It’s recommended to do your research and buy it when it’s discounted. That said, I believe you should at least experience it for yourself, as it offers an AAA movie-like experience.

P.S.: Please note that the game's ending requires at least 2 hours, including credits and post-credit sequences, and you cannot save or leave the game during the cutscenes. Be sure to plan your playtime accordingly.",True,18,0,2022-05-03 15:06:20
"Bit of an essay below, but there's a tl;dr at the end :)

After managing to avoid any and all spoilers since the game was released on PS4, I finally got to experience it for myself on PC. I'll start this review by saying what many others have already said - this game is not for everyone. If you aren't the kind of person to get invested in a long, singleplayer narrative that takes place largely through cutscenes, then what you're left with is gameplay that many label a ""walking simulator"", with intermittent sections of stealth or action that can often be avoided entirely. However, if story is something that you value, then what you'll find here is a [b]compelling narrative[/b] set in a very unique and interesting universe, with a cast of great actors to carry it. The acting and delivery can at times be a bit hit or miss, perhaps because of the writing, but the parts that 'miss' are often not important enough to detract from the storytelling. Some of the cutscene sequences are phenomenal - Mads Mikkelsen especially stole the show, and his character's backstory was so interestingly woven into the main storyline that I found myself excited to learn more (this game has plenty of cool reveals, and an important plot twist to boot). I previously quoted ""walking simulator"" - well, if you are invested in the story, these walking/delivery segments have a lot of meaning added to them, and I often found that the main reason I was continuing was to learn more of the story. Everything comes together at the end, and it feels amazing to finally understand everything (given that parts of the story can be confusing). 

The delivery segments are more than just 'walking', too. The game gives you a phenomenal [b]sense of progression[/b], dealing out various upgrades and new pieces of equipment over the course of your travels. A particularly unique feature that I love is [b]the ability to place down structures that will appear in the worlds of other real players[/b], and vice versa. You can award arbitrary 'likes' to such structures (or vehicles later on), and receiving likes on a bridge, zipline, etc that you yourself have placed down feels very gratifying. For some deliveries you will find yourself simply travelling from point A to point B, with only the terrain as your enemy. The environment itself is gorgeous - [b]this game is one of the nicest looking I've seen on PC[/b]. I often found myself stopping to take screenshots with the in-game 'Photo Mode', which allows you to pause time and apply various filters or photo effects to whatever scene it is you've captured. Sometimes, you'll find yourself doing deliveries that take you through hostile territory, and these hostiles come in one of two forms - BTs and MULEs/terrorists. A very unique and often intense mechanic revolves around the former - they are invisible enemies whose whereabouts are hinted at with a device that blinks based on proximity (and this device is hooked up to a baby, but that'll make sense if you play it for yourself). These segments can be quite spooky, and you always feel the atmosphere shift upon entering one of these BT areas. The latter, MULEs, are human enemies that are out to steal your packages. This is where I [b]recommend playing the game on hard or very hard[/b], because these encounters can be easy if you play it right - the MULEs go down easily and, especially later in the game, some of the equipment available to you can trivialise the fights. Nonetheless, MULE or terrorist encounters add a great spice to the gameplay. This game also features a few boss fights, and honestly the things you face in some of these (more so in the later ones) are breathtaking - I remember panicking on more than one occasion when something many many times larger than me emerged from the ground and started chasing me or flying around in the sky.

This game is great as a PC port. I'd say 99% of the time it [b]controls really nicely[/b], and despite there being heaps of mechanics everything feels very intuitive and smooth, with the same button being used for many purposes depending on the menu/context. The game is [b]very immersive[/b] thanks to a combination of the environment/atmosphere, story and sense of purpose, but another element that adds to this is the movement. Thanks to the need for [b]weight management, balance, being able to fall over obstacles[/b], etc, it really feels like you're in full control of the character (as opposed to typical WASD movement). The handling of one of the vehicles, namely the bike, occasionally feels a bit off - for example you can sometimes lose all momentum instantly when driving on uneven ground or when you hit a tiny rock or protrusion; arguably sort of unrealistic and annoying. This isn't something that occurs consistently though, for the most part the vehicles feel great and really help with the sense of progression. Sometimes they can trivialise deliveries (especially if roads have been constructed), and whilst this may sound like a bad thing, when you're actually playing it can be relieving after completing so many deliveries on foot. The same goes for the ziplines (which are essentially usable to skip entire areas of terrain) - they often trivialise deliveries, but after a difficult segment of trudging uphill through stamina-consuming snow, it can feel pretty good to be able to take a free ride to your destination. 

One last major point: [b]this game has a phenomenal soundtrack[/b], perhaps one of the most fitting that I've heard. Some really emotional songs play during important parts of the story, and other times you will be walking and you'll be hit with a sudden song that plays to break the silence, and to be honest it can be quite motivational. To make it better, songs are unlocked after you've heard them, and you can play them as you please in your private room (a feature of every major stop-off where you can rest). 

Lastly, here are a few random, minor game details that brought me amusement or otherwise just pleased me throughout my playthrough:
- don't quite know what I expected, but upon walking through a low doorway with a pile of containers twice my size on my back, a bunch of them got knocked off and that made me laugh for some reason
- whilst resting in the private room you can choose to drink to restore stamina, and in the later part of the game where beer is the drink of choice, he suddenly shook a can and let it explode onto the camera, saying 'right in your face'. surprised me and made me laugh
- you can urinate in snow and it melts (also you can control where you aim)
- half-life references (actual deliveries that you can choose to do which unlock you hl-themed goodies)
- oh yeah, there are three insane segments where [spoiler]you are placed onto battlefields (WW1, WW2, Vietnam, in that order) and it's honestly pretty mindblowing. really big shift from the ordinary gameplay cycle[/spoiler]

[u]Rating[/u]: 9/10

TL;DR - Masterpiece of a game with a few minor hiccups that, in my opinion, don't detract at all from the experience. I only recommend this game if you're likely to get invested in the story, because otherwise you may find the gameplay loop repetitive - and in a game about making deliveries, what reason is there for you to make them if you don't care about why you're doing it or who you're delivering to? Really good acting, really good actors, phenomenal soundtrack, beautiful graphics and environment - a great PC port.",True,34,1,2020-07-23 02:49:52
"I'm just going to share my honest opinions about this game.

I love the story, characters, visuals, UI, the game is smooth as butter. I have 0 performance issues and overall this is an extremely well done port from what I can see, if you have already played and enjoyed this game then it's worth picking up on PC if that's what you're into. 

That being said, this game feels like a chore, because I play it to get to the story and the characters and learn more about the world. The setting is so interesting and you want to know more, that it keeps you somewhat motivated to play the game. If not for that, I feel that this game would be a total failure. The gameplay loop does not captivate me or keep me even remotely interested. You feel pretty helpless against the enemies, even though you can dispatch enemies pretty easily most of the time. They are not super hard, even the BT's don't stand a chance if you just run away from them. Not saying that's the optimal strategy, but it works. So you're walking nearly everywhere, delivering packages on foot. That's the game, and if you're expecting more than that, I would say don't play this game, because at it's core this is a walking simulator. It's a damn good walking simulator, but a walking simulator. 

Another thing that I just personally get annoyed with in this game, is when I actually am in the mood to deliver packages and mellow out for a while, it constantly interrupts your play with tutorials, messages, guys talking to you, guys warning you, when you get a new item everyone has to explain what it does. Sometimes they are incredibly lengthy in their explanation of a mission, even though it's really not that complicated what you're doing most of the time. Sometimes characters will literally have nearly the same conversations that you just had with a previous character about a mission or item. It can actually be very annoying. 

And at the end of the day, your goal is to deliver packages safely to their location, and build roads and other items to assist others and yourself for the next journey. It's not for me. I feel like this game is missing something very important that would make it much more interesting for me, I don't think it's combat.",False,64,4,2020-07-28 06:02:02

"First of all:
- This game runs SMOOTHLY on PC (even better than ""Horizon: Zero Dawn"" which was made by people who developed the engine used in Death Stranding).
- This version has many QoL improvements that we didn't had in the original PS4 version.
- This is a LEGIT Hideo Kojima game with the same values ​​that we had in the MGS series since the 90s.
- The Steam version has full support for the PS4 controller, you can even hear the baby's voice coming from the controller.

So I really liked this game and even more now with this new version here.
The game has its flaws (as any game does) but the overall experience is quite unique because it goes in the same mood as some games like ""Shadow of the Colossus"" but with its own approach in this genre.

Some people really hated the fact that you couldn't kill people here (well you can but the game will punish you a lot for doing that) or because ""being a delivery man is a shameful job"" but if you have no problems with that kind of thing just go and enjoy it.

Just remember to play on hard because the so-called ""normal"" version is a really downgraded version of the intended gameplay to the point where many mechanics become useless and this makes the overall game experience worse, playing on hard is not really difficult so don't worry if you are afraid of some challenges.

Focus on the main missions and try to understand why this game has so many puns with names everywhere like PRINCESS BEACH (this is a mistery greater than the main plot), after the final scene you can continue playing to do sidequest and so on so don't worry about 'losing content'.

"So you've probably come to this review sections wondering: What on earth [i]is[/i] DEATH STRANDING? Is it simply an Amazon Delivery Courier simulator? Is it the self-indulgent, crazy acid trip with an obsession for unborn infants that the trailers would suggest? Perhaps both?
As you can see already, I have decided to recommend this game, but it is important to understand who I am recommending this to, as it is not for everyone. So here is my slightly more nuanced, heavy-spoiler free review! 😊

[hr][/hr]

[b][u]Story/Lore:[/u][/b]
[list]
[*] DEATH STRANDING has the kind of story you should expect the infamous Hideo Kojima (Or Genius Kojumbo, as my friend puts it) to make. It is an insanely weird and unique spin on a post-apocalyptic setting that makes it exceedingly tricky to draw parallels from other mediums of entertainment. This brilliant weirdness makes the world feel fresh and interesting - A welcome sight in an era of cookie cutter open world games.
[*] If you are familiar with Kojima’s games, the first bullet point could make you uncomfortable while your head screams: “I’ve had enough of [i]unique[/i] and [i]weird[/i] after Metal Gear! I won’t babysit your virtual babies, Kojumbo!”. However, let me offer some respite for the voices in your head: This game is not the weird nonsensical nonsense that is prevalent in Metal Gear. While its setting and story are certainly odd (See: Carrying a baby around in a pod), it establishes these early into the narrative. Every “weird” thing has a very strict narrative purpose that is contextualised and makes sense within the world of DEATH STRANDING. Within just a few hours, you will think its perfectly normal to be tiptoeing through rain while your baby is crying and your back breaks under 50 slowly degrading package containers. That is, until someone walks into the room, gives you a weird look, and you suddenly realise that perhaps you have deviated from normality a bit…. But I digress… 
[*] What I vastly love in this game, above most things, is that gameplay and narrative are seamlessly united and compliment each other in an intuitive and satisfying way. To give an example, without going into spoiler territory: The game’s award system is based on getting “likes” for completed activities or deeds around the map, from Players and NPCs alike. What blew my mind was, at one point, a character stuck their thumbs up at me during a cutscene which gave me likes in-game – With the normal sounds & UI elements that I’ve expected to appear during normal gameplay! Such a simple thing, but I found it to be such a great example of how integrated everything is in this game… You do not get any of the usual ludonarrative dissonance evident in some games.
[*] Characters are a little hit and miss for me. Some are very interesting, but most of their character depth and intrigue is delivered through the veil of mystery rather than character depth. I will not go into detail, as it can be spoilery… But most the characters are good and interesting, I just thought they could have had more work for me to form a larger emotional connection outside of a select few.
[/list]
[b][u]Gameplay:[/u][/b]
[list]
[*] So, let us call spade a spade: Much of your time is going to be spent delivering packages. It is a little more complex than the “Amazon Delivery Courier Simulator” idea I eluded to earlier, however. A lot of the package deliveries have different requirements for delivery, such as time requirements or temperature requirements that require premeditation and forethought to take on. If that is your kind of thing, you can spend a fair deal of time optimising delivery routes & structures to ensure the harder optional deliveries can be completed. No, I will not reveal how many hours I spent dismantling & reconstructing zip lines.
[*] Delivering packages is quite chill and relaxing. Unless you trip off a cliff.
[*] Unfortunately for some, the gameplay is not really all that difficult, even on the harder difficulties. Most of your challenge, if you are looking from it, will come from the optional premium deliveries that you can take on in the early mid-game. For most people, I recommend playing on “Hard”.
[*] There is combat in DEATH STRANDING, and it takes two forms (Outside of structured narrative moments): Fighting cells of Terrorists/Mules, and slowly taking out groups of BTs. For the former, this will be your more typical third person fighting, with stealth, guns and short-range options being available to you. The latter is more interesting, which will involve you moving much more carefully, often stealthily, to ensure you can take BTs on one-by-one.
[*] There is a nice drip-feed of craftable tools and equipment that you earn during the game, either via the narrative or by increasing your relationship with the many characters dotted about in prepper shelters on the map. A fair few of these items can significantly shift how you think about & solve problems in the world of DEATH STRANDING – Which is always welcome! 😊 
[/list]
[b][u]Graphics/Aesthetic:[/u][/b]
[list]
[*] Oh my, this game is very pretty! The landscapes are very realistic an believable, serious respect to the artists and engineers behind the Decima engine for achieving such incredible visuals.
[*] The characters and motion capture for this game are also great accomplishments! The detail present for each character in this game really allows the actors performances to shine through as it would in a show/movie.
[*] There are many “screenshot” worthy moments in this game, both during natural gameplay and narrative set pieces. It’s a feast for the eyes at several points.
[/list]
[b][u]Closing Notes:[/u][/b]
You’ve made it this far? Well done! Hopefully my rambling has helped you come to a decision. But to close things off: If you are after a slower paced game with some easy to moderate difficulty and optional challenges, with a weird but thoroughly enjoyable narrative, this may be the game for you. It truly is a different experience that I think that anyone willing should dive into!

“Keep on Keeping On!“",True,33,4,2020-10-16 19:52:49
"I just can't do a simple summary of the good and bad things in this game, so it's going to be a messy, lengthy account of my impressions.

I had never played a Kojima game before, nor did I follow Death Stranding release, and I didn't know what to really expect. All I had, from just enough previews to not spoil myself, was the impression of a contemplative game with quite an intriguing sci-fi background to it, which was enough for me.
Honestly, I was confused for the first hour and a half, not knowing what the point of the game was, struggling to grasp its concepts and the ""why"" of everything, wasn't sure if I would ask for a refund, but my curiosity kept me going. A good book usually involves the reader constantly wondering ""and then what happened?"". In retrospect, that's a feeling I quickly got, and I was hooked to the story (and the gameplay) until the end.

It's actually kind of hard to describe the game. Sci-Fi? Combat? Horror? Platforming? Adventure? All of that, actually. I saw it being called a walking and/or Fedex simulator, and, well, it's not far from the truth; delivering stuff on foot or in vehicles is a big part of it, and I do love the mechanics around it (balance keeping, fatigue, path finding, inventory management...). But this vision dismisses the genius world building behind it, the sheer beauty of the whole thing, the dreamy soundtrack, the hours of stunning cinematic, the tense hostile situations, your character's subtle evolution as the brilliant story progresses, the quirky humour, the many things you can do, and how you shape a bit of the world as you go. 
I said I was confused for a while, but all the pieces of the puzzle were handed to me, one by one, in a satisfying timing, occasionally blowing me away with intense revelations. The game really felt polished from beginning to end, and the amount of details is just incredible, never seen anything like it.
I'll add that the game is, at times, surprisingly self aware regarding gaming culture, cinema and music, which is a nice touch.

Other than that, It's a game where you take the time to do things, whether it is making your first deliveries on foot through rugged terrain, planning how to slither in enemy territory, optimising your route, resting your wary character, building and attributing resources to infrastructures... 
In my view the game can only be appreciated with a good deal of patience and dedication, because it then fully gives back in equal measure. All these road segments you spent hours hauling resources for? It will be a huge relief for the many back and forth you'll inevitably do, including the grand finale, and you'll be proud as hell you did it. This shelter you worked hard to link with through many deliveries? You'll get improved equipment/vehicles that might make your life much easier depending on how you play, and/or an increase in resources for building equipment and structures. Not only that, but you'll also get important snippets of lore through emails and archives to understand what's going on. Plus, you get a bunch of nice customisation options. 

And the negative side? Well, nothing major, really. It's well optimised for PC (but I highly recommend a controller), few bugs and none of them game-breaking. My only complaint would be for the vehicles, which sometimes are either sluggish, or, on the contrary, go crazy for no reason on rough sections of the maps. In addition, there are rare moments where my character felt like he had a will of his own in delicate situations, losing balance pitifully despite my best efforts, and I was like ""what the hell dude?!"", to which Sam sometimes replied the same thing. Which reminds me, the communion and intimacy you get with the character as time passes are awesome, for lack of better words. 

To finish with, there's a passive multiplayer aspect that can be enabled, where you help each other from afar for resources, construction, equipment and such, and you can stumble on stuff someone left. Right from the start, I had the feeling it would break the immersion for me, because while the game describes this as interacting with other porters in the world, in actuality it's hundreds of the same character doing the same story, typical mmo stuff, and your character, Sam, is supposed to work his ass off as a solitary man against a world gone down the drain. In short, the multiplayer is there if you want to navigate your environment with more ease and thus progress the story faster, at the cost of immersion. Never looked back on my decision to not use it.

Anyway, there are certainly other things I forgot in my review, but it's a brilliant and unique game. I now understand Kojima's reputation. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you're of the patient, contemplative, and achiever sort, chances are you'll get a blast from it. Like I said, a good hour and a half are necessary to really know if you'll like it. 
In any case, Death Stranding is an absolute gem of a game, well worth the 20 euros I got if for in a sale. It made a lasting impression on me, and also helped me through tough times.",True,18,0,2021-11-19 20:45:58
"An excellent PC port of a (so far) intriguing sci-fi adventure that stubbornly refuses to be confined to a specific genre.
Graphically, it looks phenomenal while at the same time running like a dream, even on mid-range hardware (and there's DLSS 2.0 support for those who have lower end RTX cards and wish to play at higher resolutions without sacrificing performance or visuals). It works fine out of the box with keyboard/mouse, which is a nice bonus, considering most Japanese PC ports end up requiring a gamepad.
I'll update this review as I go through the game, but my first impressions after four hours are extremely positive.",True,31,0,2020-07-14 20:34:19
"Absolutely incredible game. The atmosphere is so anxiety inducing and story just keeps you in a baffled, depressing state.
So unique game game play I never had such before and the mundane missions are just terrifying joy to do. 
You get this need to know what the heck is going on the world. And the more answers you get, the more questions you're left with. I just loved every moment of the game.

Easily became one of my favourite games of all time.",True,21,1,2022-02-23 19:08:04
"An absolute masterpiece. I can see why it wasn't everyone's bucket of fish but personally, I loved every second of it.

The story is intriguing, the gameplay varies between relaxing and full of action and the music is some of my favourite in any game. 

This game is beautifully strange, thanks mostly to Hideo Kojima's limitless imagination and creativity. I was glued to the screen for months just taking in the pure vastness of the game world and winding down in the private room listening to tunes, checking in with BB and drinking monster energy drinks.

The cast is brilliant, all of them deserving every award that comes their way and more.

I have spoken to Tommie Earl Jenkins on Twitter a number of times and his character of Die-Hardman was definitely my favourite character, especially in the late game. But I also grew attached to the game's protagonist, Sam Porter Bridges, played by the badass Norman Reedus. 

Guillermo Del Toro is always awesome, as is the king of video games, Troy Baker, and I was thrilled to see Mads Mikkelsen play one of the most unique roles I've seen in a video game narrative ever. He has been one of my favourite actors since I watched James Bond - Casino Royale as a boy.

Lindsay Wagner was wonderful as Amelie, as was Margaret Qualley as Mama and Lockne. I loved the whole idea of Heartman and how his heart stopped every ~20 minutes and full credit must be given to Darren Jacobs for his excellent portrayal of the character.

Heartman is an extremely interesting character in the game's lore and Darren does an outstanding job at bringing him to life.

Overall, I enjoyed every moment of this game and would rate it as my favourite game of 2019 without a doubt.

Also I would like to thank Hideo Kojima for making this whole project happen, ignoring the haters, of which there were many, and pushing through with this masterpiece as he had envisioned it. I was super pleased to see all the bonus content on my birthday (Jan 16th) and I was actually playing the very moment it ticked over to my birthday when I was pleasantly surprised by these wonderful and thoughtful additions to the game.

For anyone who has made it this far, thanks for reading my review and I do hope you give this game a go. It may not be for you, and that's okay, but you may find yourself to thoroughly enjoy it like I did.",True,41,5,2021-06-14 02:30:07
"there are plenty of perfectly valid reasons why someone would bounce off this game. and that's fine. people describe a lot of games with ""it's not for everyone"", but that's quite apt here. if it isn't for you, you'll probably bounce off of it quickly, and it's probable that the things it tries to do won't resonate with you. 

that aside, this is one of the best games I've ever played. firstly, the gameplay. i really appreciate it when games feel ""tactile"", or that I feel like my actions matter, and the game is communicating to me that they do. Death Stranding makes the act of traversing terrain feel tactile like no other game. past that, without spoiling exactly how it works, the infrastructure and online aspect of this game is awesome and unique.

regarding the story. if you're familiar with Metal Gear, the writing is not unlike what you'd see there, both for better and for worse. personally, i enjoy a lot of the cheesiness, but it's not hard to see that it would put people off. on the other hand, this means that the story will explore and consider themes in a similar way. if you appreciated what MGS games (like MGS 2) did, you'll probably really appreciate what DS does. there's a lot going on here, and most of it is quite good.

overall. i loved this game from start to finish, and i'm not going to forget about it anytime soon. i definitely wouldn't play it again though lol",True,14,0,2021-03-07 22:43:37
"Contains Spoilers

The first four or five hours is just you holding down the W key walking between lengthy cut scenes trying not to trip.  They make a big deal about how you shouldn't be out in the ""time fall"" rain because it damages the (ridiculously large) items on your back, but they give very very few places to hide from the rain, and even if you do find cover t think you can really ""wait it out"" in most cases.  I think they just introduced this mechanic to clear the world of all the junk that players leave behind.  

Eventually you're introduced to a non-walking game element.  The BTs (creepy floaty monster things that also walk on their hands?) will periodically appear on your walk between delivery points. You have to hold your breath and crouch walk and avoid them. You hold your breath an creep forward and they disappear. You run out of breath and take a deep breath and they reappear and move toward you.  But your breath comes back pretty quickly so you hold your breath again and creep forward.  When you make it out of their range the game element ends and you can go back to running to your destination. 
 Basically it is just a nuisance that makes the already dull walking gameplay more annoying.  If they do catch you, a black puddle appears around you with indistinct black muck guys trying to pull you down, you get instructions on screen to mash buttons to shake them off.  If you can escape the puddle, the threat ends. If they succeed in dragging you down, a giant octopus or whale thingy grabs your foot and drags you a few hundred meters backward into a large lake of black muck with buildings floating in it. If you can escape that lake the threat ends and you can go back to... walking. If that sounds bizarre and annoying and not fun at all, well, it is.  

Eventually the game slowly gives you tools to fight the BTs and the other marauder-like dudes who want to steal your parcels, but that gameplay isn't particularly fun either.  The marauder guys live in little camps and are inexplicably not bothered the BTs at all.  The game makes a big deal that if someone dies, they need to be incinerated quickly or they'll make some sort of necrotic explosion large enough to take out a whole city.  So you never kill the marauders, you just tie them up by hand or with a rope gun and leave them there forever.  

People act like this is a lush world but it's basically just a barren wasteland with nothing to do or look at as you run from one outpost to the next trying not to trip.  There's marauder areas you can just avoid, and occasionally the BTs show up, but other than that you're just holding W down trying not to trip.  You do get vehicles eventually, but the mechanics aren't great and they're oddly slow. The developer filled this world with craggy rocks everywhere (probably to avoid there being literally nothing to look at while you walk) so you're constantly trying to jump your vehicle over them.  Oddly enough tripping over rocks on foot is more damaging to you and your cargo that ramming into them at full speed on your motorbike.  

The numerous, lengthy cut scenes would be OK if the plot and character development made any sense at all.  The game starts, you're a loner delivery guy who has some sort of super power that allows him to sense the monsters in the world.  You crash your bike running from the monster and end up in a cave with some random chick hiding from it.  Eventually the monster vanishes and so does the chick and you continue your delivery.  When you get to the drop off, you're asked to go see the President and seem surprised there is even a President.  Then you find out that the President is your dying mother? And she asks you to reconnect all of the cities and hubs across the US.  Wait your mother is the President? You say no and she dies, but then you just start doing what she asked anyway.  If this all sounds like it makes no sense, it makes no sense.  You then strap a live fetus to your chest (which is supposed to protect you from the BTs, but doesn't?) and head out and start reconnecting the disconnected colonies. 

I love scifi and I love horror.  I was really excited for this game, but the arch of the story, the development of the characters (including you), and the general storytelling are all trash.  I don't need to be told why everything is the way it is and what everything means.  At first, I was intrigued by the world but the longer I play the dumber it all gets.  Bizarre-ness for the sake of bizarre-ness does not make an intriguing product. I should feel fear or dread when the BTs appear, but I just roll my eyes.  I should be excited for the next cut scene revealing a little more about what's actually going on, but each time it's just more drivel.  

The main character is beautifully done, the graphics are phenomenal and life-like.  He's not particularly interesting though, because they gave him the standard tough guy who doesn't care dialogue.  They were going for early walking dead guy and gave us later seasons walking dead guy.  He's a caricature, not a character.",False,69,3,2021-04-20 20:53:10

"I REALLY wanted to like Death Stranding and was super excited to get it on sale. At the start of the game I was super intrigued by the story line, I have no doubt that it is a good narrative. For the life of me I cannot get into this game. As gorgeous as it is, I find the game play absolutely excruciating. It has to be one of the most tedious  games I have ever played. Luckily I have a flare for weirder, more outlandish stories which kept me going for a little while, but that only went so far. Maybe I will return to it one day, I would love to finish the story.

"For years, [i]Hideo Kojima[/i] has been a household name in the games industry, a pioneer of storytelling in video games and the godfather of the stealth genre. [b][i]Death Stranding[/i][/b] is what happens when you give developer [i]Hideo Kojima[/i] free reign to do whatever he wants. Bizarre and not always user friendly, the stealth-action game provides a unique experience that's laced with social commentary.

In true [i]Kojima[/i] fashion, this setup serves as a springboard to tell a narrative that casts its net very wide, in terms of themes, scale, and arcs. The delivery components of [b][i]Death Stranding[/i][/b] combined with the satisfaction of completing a tough journey creates a constant feeling of progression and satisfaction. It's rare to play [b][i]Death Stranding[/i][/b] and not be doing something that's rewarding you in some way.

There’s also a huge emphasis on storytelling, which shouldn’t come as a surprise, considering the mind behind the game. [b][i]Death Stranding[/i][/b]’s story covers a lot, and it has a lot of things to say, and for the most part, it does it all pretty well. It’s a slow burn, with more things getting revealed to you gradually and on a constant basis, as pieces of the puzzle slowly and consistently fall into place.

The slow burn of [b][i]Death Stranding[/i][/b]’s story is, interestingly enough, reflected in other aspects of the game as well, the most notable of which is pacing. Given its traversal-heavy central gameplay loop, it was pretty clear from the get-go that [b][i]Death Stranding[/i][/b] wasn’t going to be the most adrenaline-fuelled and explosive game, and the way it is paced definitely shows that.

One thing is certain - [b][i]Death Stranding[/i][/b] is definitely an acquired taste. It has a very clear and specific vision in mind, a vision that might not be to everyone’s tastes, and it works toward that vision uncompromisingly, even in spite of knowing that that vision might not appeal to everyone.

[b]THE GOOD[/b]
- Amazingly oppressive atmosphere
- Highly detailed, polished graphics
- Innovative social multiplayer mechanics
- Vast and engaging open world

[b]THE BAD[/b]
- Might not run on lower-tier PCs
- Cumbersome menu system
- Not for everyone's taste

"Death Stranding is a modern day gaming masterpiece.  It is a masterful combination of beautiful visuals, epic music and brilliant story telling.  I think gamers needed this game so that they can experience something other than your typical shallow, soulless shooter (which I do enjoy as well).   This is more like being part of an art piece, or movie - you don't play this game, you experience it.

I've seen this referred to as a ""walking simulator"" and while that can be an easy description, you'd be missing the point entirely.  Turn out the lights, turn up the volume and immerse yourself in the life of ""Sam"" and his journey though a wasteland of complexity and the unexpected. You will not be disappointed.",True,103,10,2020-07-15 12:53:55
"Death Stranding is a digital experience - movie like, but more game than interactive novel / mild interaction.

So to the few that label it ""walking simulator"" - it isn't - that is an over simplification of the topics at hand, game mechanics and execution of this masterpiece.

Labelling it a walking simulator is the same as saying F1 2000 is just a ""driving simulator"".

With that out the way, I would say this is a masterpiece, with an attention to detail, graphic fidelity and script writing that doesn't disappoint.

Motion capture, high fidelity graphics and an environment reminiscent of the raw natural beauty of Iceland. The environment is a character on its own, where through the course of the game you will learn it's nooks and crannies, where crossing a river becomes a serious consideration.

With the ""timefall"" rain mechanic - you can observe grass and flowers grow and die within moments, as it slowly erodes your cargo and your mood with the trudge through mud, sliding down mountain sides and the perpetual drip on your suit. 

No one else has quite done ""walking / carrying a load / balancing"" quite in this fashion, where in the beginning of the game, it is made abundantly clear that you aren't a hero, and hurling yourself down an incline will not work. Careful consideration, balance, height of your load and sometimes taking things slow is the best way to traverse the terrain.

Within 8-10 hours of your opening moments in the game, you will have access to vehicles which eases the travelling to a degree, but maneuvering  through areas still require the obligatory trek. As you progress, gain experience and ""level up"" - it becomes easier, but the game pulls no punches in hitting you in the gut when your hubris and over confidence takes over with moments of lapses of concentration.

It isn't often that you become engrossed, and attached to characters in a game, mulling allegiances and who to trust or believe. The meandering narrative takes a pace around you, and will wait as long as you need while you busy yourself with other work. However, never losing velocity, it pulls together all the strings together, in a climatic finale lasting for a few hours (so be prepared!)

Part of what adds to the charm and feeling of isolation as you move through the environments is the excellent soundscapes. The sound of rain on your suit, the occasional and well chosen songs pay close attention to the emotional drama and guides your thought processes as you make your journey. 

 The vehicle of the narrative is ""You are just a porter"" - however, this is again just a vehicle to drive the narrative. The richness in the tapestry woven here is the connection with ""Sam Porter"" and his family connections, the BRIDGES directive to connect communities and the more personal individuals dotted across the landscape with their own stories. The story is about tying knots, connecting people, changing perspectives and evolving your own expectations as well as the expectations of the characters as they move through the world.

A few pain points exist, not insurmountable but should be noted:

The Otradek - your scanner on your back - takes far to long to charge up when you are in enemy territories, with unnecessarily long animations. These could have been shortened or shown once and then through sound - referred to again. 

Certain plot points and set pieces are (of course) unavoidable, and there are a few times where I groaned out loud due to these pieces regardless of my best intentions to not ""fall into the trap"". From a narrative and ensuring that you understand the implications - it makes sense, but can feel heavy handed sometimes.

A few missed steps (especially while travelling on the faster vehicles) occurred with the music kicking in and then getting the unceremonious boot when I crested a hill or got to close to my destination, possibly the expectation was to complete that journey on foot. 

I will say in summary, that Death Stranding is a masterpiece, something that should be savoured and not rushed. Dive into the world, take the proverbial ""stroll"" through it's meandering caverns, let the narrative touch you and ponder some of the plot points. For me personally, a few key points hit home, had special meaning and added gravity to the game experience, but that is a product of where I am in my life journey when I played this.

If you are looking for an action game with non-stop adrenaline, then this isn't the game for you. There are moments of sheer terror and adrenaline for sure, and there are other moments where the stark beauty and silence overwhelms the senses. A 7 course meal, versus a fast food takeout, both will fill your belly, but one will be far more memorable than the other.

Take a chance on this if you are looking for something different. I recommend you ""Keep on Keeping On""

"More than just delivering a pizza.

If you can put aside the ""delivery man"" aspect of the game, it is very enjoyable. It is a very unique experience that cannot be compare to anything else in the gaming industry at the moment.

"I bought Death Stranding on sale with low expectations but I ended up really enjoying it. It's a very hard game to explain and ""walking simulator"" is a vast oversimplification. If Doom Eternal is an 80s action flick, this is more like a movie about climbing Mount Everest. There ARE monsters and people to fight or sneak around, but it isn't the main focus. Instead you're mainly fighting the terrain.

The story is great and easily the best part of the game, though I disagree with some of Kojima's political points. Some of the political symbolism is a bit like telling your friend that you have clinical depression and he responds with ""Just don't be sad, bro. It's easy."" Life isn't that simple. The writing is fantastic though for the most part. If you want a mostly chill game and not a shooter, definitely give it a go.",True,18,1,2021-01-26 08:40:15

The story is good but the characters are what makes this game special, Mads Mikkelsen was the best. I played the game because of him if you know him from Hannibal (TV show) he was a great actor.
There is also the same mistake that Kojima did with MGSV that the last chapters have more cutscenes than the first 80% of the game.
Soundtracks were epics ❤❤❤❤ but there is one thing that bothers me the most they were only played before your actual destination so will listen for about 30sec and that's it 🤬.

"I just cannot recommend this game. Even after finishing it and mostly understanding the story.

Too much of the story is delivered through exposition, you have to read a literal book to have the foggiest of clues about what is going on in this incredibly weird world and more importantly, the gameplay is just among the most boring open-world experiences I've suffered through in a very long time. The only interesting parts are the cutscenes and I might as well watch a let's play to get through those. Playing the game doesn't give me any additional benefits.

People keep saying how you need to give this game a chance, because it's a slow burner and that it becomes interesting later, but I just don't have the patience. The only reason why I stuck with it for so long is that I was going through a backlog of youtube videos on my second monitor while basically just holding W/LS (trying to figure out if the game is better on a gamepad or KB&M). 

Too much focus went to the technical side, which is great, because the game is just gorgeous, while not even needing DLSS to stay around 100FPS on 3080 in 5120x1440 (around the same pixel count as 4K) but that's not enough to keep a game interesting. You need to design interesting things for the player to do and making all quests literally the same is just not the way to do it.

If I wanted to constantly play fetch quests so badly, I would rather just become a dog.



EDIT AFTER FINISHING THE GAME (no spoilers):

Yeah, still keeping this one at a negative I'm afraid. The story is actually pretty damn cool and it would make for an interesting sci-fi movie on its own, but that's only about 1/5 of your playtime. That leaves you with 4/5 of your precious time being a delivery boy. You run around, you drive around, that's it. A handful of boss fights won't save this massive borefest. It took me a little under 50 hours to finish the game, so 40 of them were mostly youtube binge while holding W and 10 of them were watching fairly interesting cutscenes. And yes, now I know it's better on keyboard + mouse, because you do have to do some shooting later on and the driving is nowhere near challenging enough to require a gamepad.",False,67,7,2021-05-23 17:28:57

There's a lot of polish here, a lot of good mocap, a lot of good VO, good music, and a lot of famous actors... but the game itself feels empty and is not responsive to your actions. There's an interesting sci-fi story in here, but its on rails and your actions don't have any impact on it in a meaningful way. It a set story connected by a rich detailed world... of fetch quests. This alone wouldn't bother me as I like atmospheric games, I like a slow place, and I like narrative, but the combo in DS just doesn't work for me. I feel the killer here the combo of not being able to be involved in the story combined with gameplay that's designed to be lonely and detached. I felt myself trying to beeline from story point to story point, just to grind through, but eventually just realized I wasn't enjoying it enough to care anymore. I regret my purchase and I doubt I'll ever finish this game. Will wrap it up through youtube.",False,135,18,2020-10-30 10:13:20
"Despite my lifelong love for Kojima's dramatic flair and convoluted storytelling demonstrated in the MGS series, I was skeptical of this game's release. As a big PC gamer, I was thrilled when it came to Steam, but by then I had learned it's essentially a walking simulator. BOY, WAS I WRONG.

In simplest terms, Hideo Kojima has gamified ""wall climbing"". Remember scaling that mountain in Skyrim? Or wall jumping the cliffs around Iron Forge in WOW? It takes the fun of that idea, of 'defeating' the terrain, and turns it into a game. And I have to say, it's brilliant.

I can't stress enough that this is basically ""wall climbing"" gamified. Meaning, don't play this if you're in the mood for GTA. Play this is you're in the mood to jump over some rocks while narrowly avoiding falling off a cliff, while carry 10 crates or a dead body or something. All while Kojima does his best to mind-f#$% you.

The soundtrack is beautiful too. If you can, I'd suggest playing this on a big TV with a controller versus a monitor and a keyboard. It's designed as a ""console"" game, which really means it shines as a TV game. Try to enjoy it that way, if you can.",True,11,0,2021-02-23 00:17:20

[h1]In-General[/h1]
Death Stranding, while having unique and exceptional gameplay not found much elsewhere in the modern scene of video game development, is not exclusively built from the point of view looking at the gameplay. In my opinion, it is gameplay built around the core message of it, reconnecting people in a time where they have all strayed apart. It does not make use of any climactic, over-the-top tropes. You connect them with in the simplest yet very meaningful avenue; delivering what they need to go about their daily lives.


[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

[b]Travelling the world[/b]

Death Stranding’s gameplay is one of the most unique and innovative to date. It takes the simple premise of delivering stuff from point A to B, but enriches it in so much substance and depth that it becomes an adventure. The gameplay starts on a simple foot, giving the player a short trip than the later missions and deliveries of the game and limited traverse options in the form of ladders and climbing hooks. But as the game progresses so many, and I mean [i]many[/i] structures and options open that it can become an entirely different game later on with all the unlocked potential.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2166122521

The game’s contents in terms of offering different approaches to making your deliveries to remote locations, whether they be remote in the sense of being poised atop blizzardy mountains, inside rocky canyons, beyond destroyed cities teeming with BT’s, inside a valley, etc. Grow exponentially towards the end of the game. Unlocking things ranging from small hovering carriers that you can load up with lots of cargo or ride like a scooter yourself to several types of exoskeletons that allow you to jump over large crevices and/or negate the terrain’s hampering. 

[b]Combat/Enemies[/b]

Death Stranding abstains of violence as much as possible, contrary to most modern video games. Its design philosophy Is very unique in that regard, and the uniqueness translates into the enemies presented in this open-world game. There are two chief archetypes of enemies in the game; BT’s, which have too many spoilers to be discussed in-depth. They only appear in areas hit by timefall (which comes in the form of rain or snow) and require navigating through stealthily (though the player can choose to try to stealthily attack them and utilise bombs or other weapons that are unlocked later in the game to either temporarily contuse/distract them or send them back to their world). The second type of enemies are the game’s post-apocalyptic equivalents of social media junkies; the MULE’s. 

The game offers a wide array of weapons to deal with enemies. Starting with the bare minimum; your own cargo. Which you can use to throw at MULE’s or smack them with at the cost of your clientele’s appreciation. More weapons are gradually unlocked as the game progresses, including bomb vials made of the protagonist’s urine, shower water, blood and excrement. Other weapon unlocks include bola guns, which you can use to ‘peacefully’ subdue and incapacitate MULE enemies. Guns that shoot a variety of ammunition ranging from stun ammunition to incapacitate enemies without killing them, to bullets containing Sam’s blood (which has strong properties against BT’s) to live ammunition. Rocket launchers, assault rifles, sedative bombs, at the end of the game the arsenal will have grown massively from the combination of urine and hematic grenades you start with. The game strongly discourages killing humans, and for good reasons; corpses tend to have catastrophic consequences in the game’s world.

[b]Construction[/b]

The game features construction/building elements. Most of the worlds in the game are completely empty, devoid and barren, owing to the apocalyptic backdrop of the game most people are holed either in cities or have elected to live in isolated shelters distant from metropolitan cores. 

As a result, the great outdoors are completely barren. You can build structures to aid you in your journeys, which include postboxes where you and other players from their respective worlds can store their own items or donate excess gear and equipment they do not need to the postbox so other players can chance upon them or entrust cargo to other players for delivery. You can also construct bridges to help you cross over large bodies of water safely, watch towers to observe the landscape, charging stations to charge the batteries of vehicles and exoskeletons. The nature of the open world gameplay about delivering cargo through hazardous conditions means your strategy of placing these structures can factor greatly into the gameplay in a satisfying manner. Building a very expensive structure like a resting room in the middle of a big swathe of blizzarding nothingness can mean a very valuable waystation to rest & recuperate during your trek.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2176279866

The structures require resources, which your clientele either offer you or you can collect from the world (the landscape would be strewn with discarded or lost containers of cargo, building materials and memory chips, dropped mostly by other couriers). You can also raid MULE camps for materials. Structures also require connection to a chiral network, the network requires incorporating the local system, shelter or city to a network. Some clients will refuse to join the network until you’ve done a worthwhile effort to convince them that it Is in their best interest to join it. 

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]

“A friend in need is a friend indeed”. The game’s multiplayer aspect is rather unique, and emphasizes the core message about cooperation and making connections.  Structures you build can be seen and used by other players, and vice-versa. Multiple players can cooperate on building & levelling up a structure, such as a bridge. You could be on the brink of collapse when you encounter a private room built by another player where you can rest. You could be disarmed in an area crawling with BT’s when you chance upon a postbox containing hematic grenades or other weapons, donated by another player. Players can also donate what they made/crafted/earned to other players, including equipment, weapons, materials and even vehicles you no longer need can be donated at waystation terminals.  

[h1]Graphics & Performance[/h1]

The game utilises the decima engine, which often offers beautiful photo-realistic visuals. Its reputation precedes it and is in need of no praise more than it has.
With the following hardware running at 1440p resolution, the game has maintained a rock-solid 60 frames through every single part of the game;
CPU: Ryzen 5 3600x
GPU: GTX 1080Ti
RAM: 16Gb of DDR4 3200Mhz

It's got male nudity, Troy Baker, more plot twists than you can shake a stick at and old movie references up the wazoo.

"As with any artsy game you either go ALL IN in buying every decision taken or you fail to create the ""fictional pact"" and think everything is crap. In my case I went for the first one, the story, the character naming, the slow-paced vs fast-paced gaming, the music ONLY when they want you to listen to it and of course, the ending (won't spoil anything, but it felt appropriate).

THE GOOD:
- Deep dive into Hideo's cinematic mind and forever listen to Low Roar soundtrack in his dystopian future while crying like a baby. Would play again without skipping anything.

THE BAD:

- They don't warn you that the ending requires 1 hour of time and a bucket of popcorn, yep, just like watching a movie, no saves.",True,18,0,2021-12-12 13:43:45
"Slow, confusing and eye-rollingly self-referential, this might be the best game released in a long time. The plot, concerning the world of the dead crossing into the world of the living mirrors the integration of time-independent online elements into the single-player experience and demonstrates some sublime confidence in storytelling, an absolute Kojima classic.",True,21,0,2021-05-28 19:50:43
"As a Hideo Kojima fan, I tried to like this game, I really did. I gave the game 60 hours of my time before throwing in the towel and deleting it. 

I read the reviews (the good and the bad) and knew what I was in for. I wanted to listen to some audiobooks while giving my hands something to do, maybe experience some avant garde gaming while I'm at it, so this seemed perfect. However this game fails even at that.  

This game occupies an uncanny valley between tedium and engagement. It's long periods of boredom peppered with frustrating interactions, cutscenes, and fights. The controls are clunky to a fault, going beyond a form of expression as some believe it to be, and the interactions (i.e. the non-hiking parts) are best described as annoying chores--yes, chores compared to trudging across repetitive scenery at a slow pace. Vehicle physics are abysmal. The narrative and cutscenes are self-indulgent, disjointed, unsubtle, and puerile, yet also preachy and self-righteous--a combination that reminds me of the schizophrenic. However, this is merely an exaggeration of Kojima's writing style, so I'm not going to hold this against this game, since this is about par for the course and aren't game-breaking. The other issues are much more severe.

This is an artistically and technologically pretty game that is a joy to look at, until it opens its mouth. No doubt the technical aspects of the game is laying the groundwork for something far greater, but this game as it stands is a highly-polished, over-marketed, AAA turd. I've been on Steam for about fifteen years (since Counter Strike 1.6), yet it is this game that brought me out to write my first and probably only review.  This has significantly dampened my mood for any more AAA games.

Whoever you are, this game is not for you.",False,338,40,2020-08-25 15:50:30

"Imagine for a second: 

You're playing you favorite game of all time. It has all the right magical moments, it has quality, it has character and you get lost in the story. 

Then, you come across that one quest that is, a meaningless delivery quest. Move from point A to point B. Nothing happens along the way, and finishing it means nothing, except some XP progression. Doesn't ruin the game, but you have the momentary thought of - ""wow that uninspiring.""

That feeling was 90% of this game. 

Look, I gave this game it's due. Check at the hours I put into it. I played what this game had to offer and the easiest way to describe this game is a series of uninspiring delivery quests with MAGICAL moments in between. 

And at the end of the day - despite the magical moments, the high quality, the character - I can't give it a pass when so much of the game felt like an uninspiring grind. 

I was about 100 hours in and I realized the game just wasn't fun. I UNDERSTAND that being a delivery guy is the foundation of the game but there's way you can still accomplish that premise without being the core gameplay loop being soulless. I literally spent 75% of the mid/end game with one hand on my phone playing a CCG and the other on the controller driving to Point B because every delivery was the same and nothing ever happened in between them. 

I can see how some people can forgive the major flaws because the magical moments are great - but to me, the core gameplay loop is the game and if it fails, so does the experience. To me, Death Stranding a 5/10.

"Death Stranding is a superb game and has unique and interesting game mechanics that keep the player engaged throughout. As a result of this it feels very immersive and allows you to take the role of Sam Porter Bridges as each delivery feels like it means something after trekking through rocky terrain or a treacherous snowy mountain. The overall map design is great and allows the player to traverse through it using plenty of different options such as ladders, ropes and ziplines. Or, if the route permits there is also the option of a truck or bike to help you to your destination. There are many small details throughout the game that leave an appreciative feeling whilst playing. The music will also kick in at brilliant times, adding to the immersive feeling of the game.

I would give Death Stranding a 9/10. You will either absolutely love or hate this game.

    [*]The sense of community, you can use other player structures and they can use yours to help get to your destination.
    [*]Almost movie like cutscenes (I deem these to be a good thing, it also helps to piece together the story)
    [*]The story is really captivating and makes you want to keep learning more.
    [*]The progression of the game past Chapter 2 is very well done.

❌[h1] NEGATIVE [/h1]

    [*]A lot of fetch quests
    [*]Some boss fights are quite repetitive and offer little to no traditional boss mechanics when fighting.
