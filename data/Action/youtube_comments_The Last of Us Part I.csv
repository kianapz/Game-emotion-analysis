Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-08,i always appreciate people who dont rush through the beginning as its one of the best openings in videogame history and the first few minutes walking around as sarah really helps build the tension.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-19,i love that moment when the building is burning down at 84624 when joel grabs ellie and tells her to look at him and begins crying and he says oh baby girl and hugs her it give me goosebumps. because at that moment it shows that joel is growing even a stronger connection with ellie.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-07,one thing i appreciate about mkiceandfire is that hes always gonna get that loot and i respect the grind
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-06,"this is the type of game which makes you connect so deeply to the characters that you feel like you are actually them instead of playing them. this game is work of art ,a masterpiece and i can't wait for part 2. perfectly done developers."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-26,man. the range of emotions she goes through before saying okay at the end. conveys the same face that we the player make when accepting joel's answer. such a perfect ending.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-30,84628 this moment just gets me every time. the baby girl
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-21,"85624 i really appreciate the whole show from the writer actor to director. they made this dialogue even more emotional and sprinkle ellies flavor into it. not just bland lets go anywhere you go but rather ill go wherever you want to go, as long as were together. they made the series really well. sadly the ending feels super rushed but im anticipating for season 2!"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-17,i loved how mk uploaded this the same day as hbo tlou live action series came out.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-17,"as much as i love this game.... it does nothing for my anxiety lol. unfortunately, my parents were lame and didn't let me grow up with video games in the 90s, so i've never been one with the controller. my teenager thinks it's hilarious seeing his mom play this game because whenever it's time to fight, i start freaking out like i'm fighting these npcs in real life. i'll be yelling for him to help me, and he just falls on the floor laughing. i think this game would be better if it was vr and you could use a handheld gaming gun. since i didn't have consoles growing up, i went to arcades instead, playing zombie games with a handheld revolver. those were the days. thanks for this video. it helps me remember how to play it. we got it a few years ago, and then rage quit lol"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-30,i gotta be completely honest. this game changed my life. it made me a father before i had a child. the best game i ever played. i loved it so much i cant even watch the show or play part 2. i dont want to ruin it for me. the scenes. the storyline. the chills i got from it. kept me interested from beginning to end.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-22,after watching the hbo series i got interested in the story of this prominent game which previously i've only had heard praises and the emotional impact it caries. i am in love with this story and seriously the creators of the hbo series have done justice to the game. brilliantly well directed and choreographed. the game is a masterpiece.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-12,"i'm diving into this game for the first time ever now that i've got my hands on the ps5. it's truly the pinnacle of gaming for me. the depth and immersion have me hookedi feel genuinely invested in every moment. being a dad, i can only chip away at it a bit each day, but that slow pace suits me fine it keeps the experience fresh and prevents me from rushing through it. the last time a game resonated with me like this was metal gear solid 2."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-27,watching this because of the tv show. such a cool story line

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-19,94448 im infected!!!!! and you are too. that was so smart
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-01,"ya know, i really want a backpack that i bring to the ends of the earth with me the way joel does. the dependence, the commitment, the sheer impressive volume of things stored inside."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-04,"awww, sam knowing that hed turn must have brought so much pain to himself, and recognising his brothers efforts to keep him safe, he didnt want henry to be upset either. its so upsetting that henry had to die that way, feeling guilt that was so unwarranted. henry was an amazing brother to sam."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-05,"a huge thank you for this! game systems are expensive and for those of us unable to buy them or who are for any reason unable to play the game in general, this is perfect! loved the show so i had to find an actual gameplay, again, thanks!!!"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"i love this game and i'm so glad they rebuilt it. everything looks amazing and the characters all have way better facial animations which lets you connect with them more. you are not paying for a texture pack. if you haven't played the game before, then you're paying for the best possible way to experience this game. if you've already played the game, then why are you gonna buy it a second time? you can still buy the original game and the first remaster no problem and for cheaper. i got a physical copy of the first remaster for 10 from gamestop. but when you buy this new remake, you're paying for the experience. considering this is my favorite game series of all time, i would have gladly spent 70 to play this version of the game as my first time because this is exactly what the developers wanted you to see when they first made the game nine years ago."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-26,i love how ellie said she likes gnomes so he shot them

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-06,100412 the way she says joels name makes my heart break every time. this whole scene makes my heart break every time.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-15,the change from a loving father to a heartless survivor to a killer to a desperate father....man what a roller coaster
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-19,73416 its my favorite moment with joel and ellie. i like as tommy understood relations between them and saw sarah on ellie's place.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-28,50722 the hell is he yappin about

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-14,imagine binge watching the entire 11 hours through
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-28,"in october 2024 i finished it for the first time and i enjoyed it. i played it on pc. the story of the game is great. i liked how joel and ellie didn't get along very well in the beginning, but over time they started to get used to each other until they became friends. the atmosphere of the game was good. i liked how the environment changes in the game, sometimes you are in the city, then in the nature, i also liked that the seasons change. graphically, the game looks nice. i liked the sounds and music. infected were interesting. there are a total of four types of infected. it's interesting how the infected changes. the first type of runner resembles a human. the first type runner resembles a human, while the fourth type bloater does not resemble a human, but rather a golem. i also liked the weapons and that could be upgraded later. as someone who likes to explore environments in games, i found a lot of things, thanks to which i could create something, for example, a health kit, then, for example, use pills to increase my health etc. there is so much i could write about this game. this game is amazing, one of my favorite games, it is all, have a nice day."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-28,"this game is super dramatic! it's like a movie. no wonder they turned it into a t.v. show. woooeee. i wish they had included some other scenes in the tv show, though."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-18,"111126 the way he calls her baby girl stop  this is litterally proof that at this point he cares more about her then he does him self. joel would litterally risk his life for ellie. even when he was litterally knock out and taken to the hospital the first thing he was worried about was ellie. he wanted to be a father figure for her even tho he said that he wasnt her father and she wasnt his daughter. but he still acted like it, like when he said he would teach her guitar and started calling kiddo and baby girl. he even lied to her bc he knew that the surgey would most likely kill her, and he didnt want to lose her."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-27,71351 when ellie wouldnt move out the way
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-24,never played the game but i am deep into tlou lore hole and i cant get out

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-14,i don't know why but men who call their daughter figures baby girl or kiddo makes me so happy. i guess it's because i have no brothers or a father to do so. but

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-23,couldnt watch the show so this is really helpful thank you!!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-10,"you know, i think one of the most unnoticed realistic part about this game, is the way the characters try to grab things. in most fpswalkathonstory video games, they always hold their hand out whenever the input guide shows up press e or press x to equip y'know what i mean..., in this game though, it gives you the guide, but they never pull their arm out, and i think thats a really realistic part of the game, cause of the fact that just because you're next to an object irl, doesnt mean you're going to grab it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,"this is a great game for people who haven't played part 1 yet, it's a timeless masterpiece for me."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-25,i'm glad this remake exists mostly for the groundbreaking accessibility options. the fact that someone platinum part 2 even without their slight was amazing. so i think it's great that people with disabilities will experience the masterpiece that is part 1.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,"still waiting for pc, almost 11 years. i hope it will come early 2023"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,i'm a massive fan of these games and i cant wait to play this!!!!!!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,i think this wouldve been better if it were 50 not 70 for a remake of a game that holds up very well to this day
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,i knew there was a reason i woke up so early.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-25,just secured my ps5 a few days ago. cant wait for this as well as ragnarok

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,i'm definitely going to buy it but not at full price. i love factions and still play to this day so i can't convince myself to pay 70 for a game that's missing a main aspect of it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,just what we needed. 70 bucks price tag for a small graphical improvement.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,"this game is an absolute masterpiece, one of my all time favorite single player games.. but i just cant justify paying 70 for a 2013 game"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,"the gameplay score in part 2 is incredible, have they updated the sounds as well?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,seeing the vertical slice of this at e3 in 2012 is what got me back into gaming after about a 14 year break. one of the best games of all time for me. will buy even though i have the original and the remaster already.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,"love this game. already preordered, things i never do."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,"it looks amazing, just not for 70, i'll pick it up on a sale when it is closer to what a remake is worth."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,looking forward to enjoying this again when the price drops to 30 or 40. 70 for a rebuild is just ludicrous.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,i'm gonna hold off and wait until this is remade for the 6th time on ps7. see you in 2040.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,never played it so i guess i will finally try it out in ps5.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-26,can't wait to pay 70 for this ps3 game. i bought a ps5 just for this!!!

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,"as much as i love this game i can't just justify the 70 price tag , maybe for the pc because of mod potential and graphics fidelity ."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,"been wanting to replay this game for a while after lou2. can't wait to revisit it with all the remastered goodies. price tag may be steep, but i only pay full price for a handful of games per year anyways. it will be this and ragnarok this year!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,it does look stunning. and it's a masterpiece of a game. i'm just not sure if i want to replay it yet. i think it's too soon
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-26,that price tag of 70 is steep for just updated textures. owners of remastered should get this for free.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,would not mind if they made game of the year again! their work is just stupendously out of this world!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,"preordered a few days ago, i'm so excited to play this masterpiece on the ps5 again"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,one of the best games of all time but it doesn't justify releasing the same game three times in nine years.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,masterpiece that has already been remade. not worth 70 dollars neil.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-25,can't wait to replay this once i can get a ps5
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,"an amazing game for anyone who has not played it yet, and i would love to pick this game up again but at 69.99 and no multiplayer i will wait until it is on sale."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,"i mean it's one of my favorite games of all time and it looks amazing, but i'm just not gonna pay another 7080 to play it for the 10th time."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-27,i am so eager to replay this masterpiece once again. the upgrades make this worthwhile and i have no regrets with pre ordering it.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,why work on part 3 when you can do the remake of the remaster on a 2 game saga?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,"nobody can tell me that you don't see any difference to the ps4 parts. it looks fantastic but since i don't have a ps5 i'm waiting for the pc version. a masterpiece, definitely!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-25,what i like about this trailer is they just didint show anything related to part 2 and i still hope that they come out and say we were just having fun part 2 isnt canon or something. its real funny how you can easyly buthcer a masterpiece like star wars and got
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,a masterpiece rebuilt. beautiful! sadly overpriced.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,probably one on favourite games of all time but i cant see myself spending 100 for something that ive already played 10 times.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"after this, naughty dog can focus on their next big project. tlou1 for the ps6"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"its a game so nice, they built it thrice, said moto moto"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,this might be the first game to have both a remaster and remake within 10 years
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,the last of us is one of my favourite game of all time but to charging 70 for a remake is ridiculous.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,the multiplayer for the og version was severely undervalued.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,cant wait for part 2 of this review
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,definitely picking this one up.... in december when it goes on sale.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"if this brought the excellent multiplayer from the original, it would immediately be worth the 70. cant believe they left it out, especially with their newbigger factions mode still far out."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"honestly looks amazing, but ill have to wait until it goes on sale for a cheaper price"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"of course it looks better than the original, but to charge full price for basically a 11 remake without any new gameplaycombat improvements of the sequel..... is a joke."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-15,"definitely picking this one up, when they rererelease it for the ps10"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,an ign reviewer not giving tlou a 1010 for the 4th time? impossible.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-27,"a small detail naughty dog should have done was have you play, left behind during the main game where it takes place. it would have made it such a seamless story"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"they should have done a proper remake with expanded levels, backstories, more dialogue etc kind of like a directors cut of movie releases yeah sure it may not have sit well with purists however at least it wouldve stand on its own especially at the asking price"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,65 for a 10 years old game. nice try naughty dog and sony! i'd like to play it again when it will be 5 or added to ps plus.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,uncharted 12 deserves a remake more than the last of us
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"i've played this masterpiece so many times, probably 4 or 5, i just can't justify the 70 price tag. guess i'll wait for a sale"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"in a couple years when i'm ready to run through the entire tlou story again, i'll pick this up. part 2 is a little too fresh still."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-24,tlou series is one of the top 3 best videogame stories of all time. it deserves to be fully realized on the newest hardware.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-10-25,im glad they remade it. its been almost 10 years and the ps4 remaster wasnt much of an upgrade imo. did not need to be 70 though. shouldve been a 40 game if that
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,how do you charge full price for a game we have already purchased? there are no significant gameplay changes and it doesnt include the factions mp.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,they should remake the second one!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"the game was meant to be in sale, i'm sorry there's no way this is worth 70 usd"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,can't wait to see all the new cutscenes on youtube without spending a cent
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"being someone that has never played this, ill be in here having fin"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-02,they had me at explosive arrows. shut up and take my money!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,removed factions mp and charges 70. splendid
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,waiting for the remastered remake
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,and no word about the insanely high price. this is surely something that needs to be taken into account for a game that has been remade for the 2nd time. we all know tlou is a great game but remaking it again and sell it for 80 bucks should drop de verdict by 2 points or so.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,multiplayer  removed gameplay  not changed audio  not changed price  increased
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,i'll pick it up for 10 bucks at the retro game store in a few years. i'm still happy with how well it was on ps3.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,damn imagine naughty proud of all their 10s for this game and just got bumped down to a 9 by ign of all people
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,what few people seem to realize is that this isnt really for existing tlou players  its in anticipation of the broader audience whos going to want to get into the game after watching the hbo tv show. first time gamers
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"literally could have gotten another entry to this world but we are still stuck on part 1. i loved both games, i'm just ready for them to continue telling the story."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,if they released a remake of factions id totally buy it. kinda lazy for them to completely abandon factions multiplayer that finds lobbies within seconds to this day.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"man, half the people complaining about the price are sitting with multiple 20 skins across their battle royal accounts."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-10-27,this game makes you feel like youre playing a 70 remaster of a 9 year old game 910 ign
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,beyonce left dc in like 2004. last of us came out almost a decade after she was already out.. such a weird thing to say and get wrong at the same time
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"honestly its a bit much at this point.all the remakes, remasters, reboots, whatever you want to call it. really, its like the gaming industry justran out of ideas."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,1010 makes you feel like the last ouf us
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,this remake is comparable to adding graphic mods to a game like skyrim or gta. it's not like ff7 or shadow of the colossus where they made a massive leap graphically. to give a 9 to a pull price high resolution texture pack with some gameplay patches is laughable.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,i'll give it a 1010 when it's 10 dollars.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,it is nice to have better graphics here and there but this just feels is unnecessary to drop a 9 year old game a with a full price tag on it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,gotta respect the honesty that he at least knows that this remake isn't necessary plus not giving it a 10
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,thoroughly enjoying the fact that luke reilly is doing more of these reviews.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,one of the remakes of all time.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"it's obnoxious to charge full nextgen price for a remake of an already remastered game, especially when the multiplayer has been excluded."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"tess didnt look, or sound, remotely in her 20s in the first game. this is not a remake. its the exact same game, exact same combat, exact same mechanics. not worth the money"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"the original game got a score of 10, they remake it, and get a 9. ooooof."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"video games need to stop adding dust and dirt on lenses for effect. they do it for immersion but it immediately takes me out of it because now im thinking oh, they are tryna to emulate a camera lens which reminds me subconsciously that theres a camera filming which, for immersion sake, there shouldnt be a cameraman there. even in real life, very rarely is dust or dirt visible even on a dirty lens. so idk why video games always do that."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,one of the best games ever made. now is this cash grab remake worth it? absolutely not. shame leaving out the excellent multiplayer too.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"remember back in the day when the base game came out full price, then the remaster comes out with the dlc included for less than the original where did that go? or is it the mandela effect happening before our very own eyes?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"this remake is so pointless. they didnt even improve upon the flaws of the original, just gave it a new coat of paint and slapped a 70 price tag on it..."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"its a remaster, not a remake. stop saying that."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,so let me get this straight. naughtydog'd only defense to make this game 70 is  it's rebuilt from zero. and it doesnt bring anything new and it doesn't have the multiplayer mode
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,im really curious how much copies this game is going to sell in the first week. there is no way in hell im buying the game until there is a fairly decent price cut
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"the fact that they ruined the title of the original for the sake of the sequel really pains me. this isnt part one. this is the last of us. it was a complete story when it released, and its still a complete story now."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-07,disappointed that its still full price tbh. already own two different copies of the game. so much for loyalty to the customer.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,this looks incredible. ive played this game many times but ill gladly play it again just to experience these graphics. might wait til the price drops a bit but this looks better than 90 of the next gen games out now.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"ign 2013 the last of us is a 10 also ign its the same game but better in every way, 910"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,this is where we are in the games industry... remaking multiple games for cash outs instead of using those resources on other projects...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,the 70 bucks pricetag should take the score down imo. shameless
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,first miss in terms of effort and time spent by naughty dog. original was already perfect and the graphics still hold up. this remake should have come out 10 years later
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,so they give the game a 910 because its a 1010 but theyve already given it 1010 too many times so they wanted to drop it to 9. this game should be a 510 simply for the fact that naughty dog didnt release something else instead
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-14,just me that thinks we deserve a prequel to tommy being in the fireflys and joels past after his daughters death there was a 20year gap they could do alot with that
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"aaaaand after everything has been said, its not worth it for us that already played the game so many times in the past."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,70 for a graphics upgrade and no gameplay mechanics changes or additional material? laughable to say the least. ill pick this up at my local cex in the discount basket later on.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,can't wait to get this cheap from a 2ndhand gaming shop in a year's time after watching a complete walktgrough for free on youtube.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-28,my number one top game of all time. the only game to bring me to tears
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"this is nothing more than a lazy cash grab without any difference or any sort of effort and even had the gall to call it a remake, charging you 70! if you want an actual game that is worth the price and the devs made it with love and passion, pick up any 3d platformer that is out right now such as pacman world repac, klonoa phantasy revival series, and battle for bikini bottom rehydrated."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,an excellent game that won the hearts of millions
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"gta v i think we have a competitor! tlou1 i'll even drop on the ps2, watch me.."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,looking forward to the last of us remake remastered version aswell now whenever it's out that is
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"tess was not in her twenties in the first game. she was mid thirties, at least."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,hopefully last of us doesn't become what skyrim is for bethesda
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,naughty dog purposely trying lose fans goodwill
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-15,"i'm in the camp of having played and adored the original, but not having played it since launch. so, for me, this is ideal for giving it a second run through. though there are many aspects of the improved visuals that appeal to me, the adjustments to facial animations are really quite significant. looking forward to being sad all over again!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,well this game is definitely a masterpiece but not worth 70 buckshopefully it goes on sale soon or be free through ps
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"i'm pretty sad naughtydog did the minimum effort in what was expected from them, zero new dialogs or new combat mechanics or having infected and people at the same time like the sequel."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,i'm actually quite surprised that the original never had cheats. naughty dog made cheats a fun part of jak  daxer and the uncharted series. even some of the crash bandicoot games had secret unlockablescheats. i'm glad this game is finally getting them.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,one of the few to get a 10 from ign
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-22,"even though the review mentions that the game was originally released 10 years ago on the ps3, they forget to point out it was on the tail end of the ps3 life cycle. the ps3 originally came out in 2006, which means this game was running on 7 year old hardware. fast forward to the release of the ps5 remake and you're looking at a 14 year difference in terms of hardware  which is insane to think about."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"4 ferrari commercials later, im exited!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"meanwhile, bloodborne is locked at a buttery smooth 30fps"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"gonna pass, bring on ragnark!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,what do people insist on changing other people's decisions about a product that you don't have to buy.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"as great as this is, im not buying it ive beat this game 2 times already."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"disillusioning violence? life itself, no humanity itself is more cruel than anything video games can portrait. instead games like the last of us part 2 can make us feel for characters, which in turn can develop further empathetic ways of thinking. which so many of you lack you cyborgs"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,time to play this game through for the 50 millionth time.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i never played the original ps3 version. so i was very happy they made a ps5 remake. this was the first and only way i played it, and it was truly glorious. ive actually played a few times now"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"nice run down, always appreciate you going through the technical stuff and little details!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"no dodge, no purchase from me. so disappointing"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"okay naughtydog, we get this is a money tree, but let's move on to something else. it's time."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"even for playstation and naughty dog, doing another remaster for the last of us and charging 70, when they already made gangbusters from the previous two releases  is pretty dang low of them. they can call it a remake all they want but it's a remaster. this remake is nothing more than greed."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"this is a brillant game, if you have never played the orginal and your new to ps then its a must."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,naughty dog wanna see me make the last of us? naughty dog wanna see me do it again?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,part 2 looks exactly like this and thats a ps4 game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,naughty dog next game  the last of us remake remastered
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-07,if the game is an improvement in every way how can you possibly give it less of a score. ign logic is the best. it just makes sense.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-29,the way he described how brutal and unforgiving tlou2s story was well put. it doesnt get enough credit for that
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"the visuals look brilliant and im excited to play through it again, but i cant justify paying 70 for a remake that is mostly a graphical overhaul."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,it looks cool. i'll definitely check it out when it drops to 30 in a couple of months. charging 70 for this is kind of insane.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-25,like if you're here after the ps plus game catalogue release
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"this game blew my mind when i first played it, the story, the graphics, the anxiety it gave me. this has to go down as one of the all time best games."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"regardless of how stunning they can make it look, the last of us on the very last days of the ps3's life cycle was outstanding and nothing can ever compare to how it hit the first time playing it"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"loved this game and excited to eventually replay it on my ps5. i do think that sony did a disservice making this game a full 70. pretty sure it should have been 39.99 or 49.99, maybe even a bundle with part 1 and part 2 for 70 kind of like what they did with spiderman and miles morales"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"1 of my fav games of all time, didn't feel like it needed a remake after the remaster but still looks amazing"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"everyone should make sure to turn on the dialogue vibrations in the settings because its not automatically on. you can feel the pitch, volume, and frequency of all the voices, and it makes it so much better."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-26,i wish i didnt play the remastered version earlier this year for the first time. but im glad i was able to get this game with a black friday discount sale. i really enjoy my second play through of this game. this version of the game is a must play.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,i just cant see them justify 70 for a solid remakeremaster man.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"a remake at the same price as a new game with new gameplay and new stories. i respect that it deserves a remake, but the price is a slap to the face"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-06,"i love the tlou and playing through this story on part 1 feels partly like a new game. the video mentioned that speedrunners will notice a lot more when it comes to the mechanics of the game, and that is 100 true. im finding myself relearning routes and levels because the ai, targeting, and level design has had enough done to it to force me to relearn. i play solely on grounded and lemme tell ya pittsburgh was hell, and it was so much more fun. as a die hard tlou fan the 70 didn't bother me too much, but not snagging a physical firefly edition did lol"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"im also a little disappointed that they did not integrate the combat a little more from 2. that was among the best changes they made to part 2, i realize that joel wouldnt be able to do some things ellie could but yeah, a dodge button wouldve been cool. either way i will check it out when it hits pc"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,the one thing i noticed after playing the original and remastered so many times is they changed out all the metal trash cans with the big plastic ones you see today along with some environmental changes with different furniture. other than that its basically the same game with better graphics and some fancy window dressing like new menu interfaces and some more detailed workbench animations. i got to play it for free because my friend let me borrow it the day he got it and i gotta say its super awesome jumping back in to a game im so fond of and seeing it look like this. not worth 70 bucks but it is the best way to experience this game for the first time thats for sure. edit for all the pressed people in the comment section the person i borrowed the game from literally lives with me and works long hours. cant believe with all the shit going on in the world the thing you dont believe is somebody letting a family member play their game while they work
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,played it a million times and blast through it. i can repeat word by word cutscenes before the characters even say their lines. jumped right on grounded and finished it too. thank you naughty dog for bringing back my favorite game of all time refined and better!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,i really hate this trend of remastering games and selling them for 70 instead of creating new ones.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"one complaint i had with the original and even the remastered was that i always felt joel looked too young for his age in the apocalypse.but here you can see the gray hairs, the wrinkles, you can see the stress in his face. he looks brooding, he looks worriedhe looks like hes waiting for a monster to pop out around the corner"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-11,im someone whos playing it for the first time. i know im late to the party but i seem to of missed it when it first came out. i just finished the bills town chapter and i love it so far. the graphics look pretty modern and haptic feedback is awesome on my ps five. the story and characters are great but i already knew that from what ive heard before. the only issues ive seen so far are minor graphic pop ins and sometimes the companion ai isnt that great. minor issues aside i highly recommend. i understand for those who already bought it twice in some cases the 70 price tag is a bit much but since its the first time buyer for me i felt the price is worth it. to each their own
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"back when this game originally came out i had moved on to pc years ago because of games like wow, but i remember viewing this game from afar thinking if i ever invest in another console this'll be on top of the list. fast forward nearly a decade later, i still haven't touched these games once, i just bought a ps5 last month and now i'm finally getting to enjoy the game for the first time with this remake version."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,ive played the game twice the last time just before pt 2 came out and im looking forward to play it again when it drops in price. i feel like if youve purchased older versions you should get a discount at least.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,just the ui changes where it matches tlou2's will help make the experience more streamlined. it was weird going back to the remaster after playing part 2. the multicolored button cues for the qte's seemed a bit out of place for the games overall mood and atmosphere. the white minimalism definitely feels better...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"i played 20 minutes just to check it out, wow it's easily the definitive version. from the opening scene, it's immediately noticeable how improved the graphics and presentation are. feels more natural now having both part 1 and part 2 as a set. now of course the 70 raises eyebrows, and i don't blame people for not wanting to dip in. since this is my favorite game of all time and i have the disposable income for my hobby, it's a nobrainer."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"this game is my all time, most favorite game , that i replayed many, many times over. for sony to release this for 70 and no discount for those who already own the game just shows that they are trying to milk every penny out of their current customer base. i will absolutely not pick this up until its around 10 at most. this kind of treatment of sony fans will not last long. please rethink your business strategy."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-06,"you know i had never played through it myself, i watched my cousin play it back when it first released and thought it was awesome. now all these years later, i went out and bought myself a ps3 copy of the game, and i gotta say i've been binging my way through the campaign. fantastic game!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"by far my favorite game ever, but no way i'm paying full price for better graphics only."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,this game is a master piece. envy those who play this version for the first time.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"this game looks absolutely phenomenal, and i cannot wait to play it. but 70 is kind of insane, considering that this is a remaster and doesn't even have factions multiplayer as the original did. i'll definitely get this when it goes on sale."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"started playing it yesterday and it's great. i just like having part 1 and 2 now on my ps5, and they both play together like one long game, without a graphical difference between the two. the foliage has been cranked up. the lighting is different and creates entirely new moods on certain scenes. and the character models are awesome. i've played the older versions several times, and this is a whole new experience. there's a particular scene where tess gets pretty intense, and her eyes look desperate and she has one eyebrow raised higher than the other. she looked like a real person. and it was definitely it a facial expression that was not shown in the older versions. price is still pretty damn high for what is essentially still a remaster. if you're on a budget, wait til this game drops to like 30. but then definitely buy it, because it is still a phenomenal game all these years later."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,i believe we should get this as a free upgrade or a serious markdown if you own the original or the remastered
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-27,"the 1 thing i wanted was not a graphical update, but massively improved enemy ai."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"this is my favorite game of all time, its literally perfect in my eyes. ive played it so many times and i was so excited to see that it was coming to ps5. the upgrades really do look next gen but the price really just kills it for me. im looking forward to getting the game when it goes on sale for like 2030"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,just bought this earlier today. first time playing it thou. but i watched the cutscenes in both last of us 1 and 2 when they came out. i had no console that time.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"the visuals look fantastic here but wouldve been nice if the game was at least 49.99 starting out. i know ps5 games are more so being introduced at 70 but again, this game has initially been released twice before already, regardless of being more of a remake here. and thank you, jake for this breakdown! i dont have a ps5 yet but hoping to get one in the next year so i can experience this one again with a refreshed twist"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"as much as i loved the game i can't justify paying full price for this remake, especially when it's really just a really well done remaster. it's clearly the definitive version to play if i ever feel like revisiting the game, but there has to be a price drop or sale before i even consider getting it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"there's no arguing on the amount of effort that went into the visuals. but we're essentially paying 70 only for the visuals. when i paid 60 for elden ring i paid 60 for the entire game design, story writing, music creation, maybe not so much gameplay cos its very dark soulsy, and visuals. 70 for just visuals seems too much to me"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-15,i've been waiting a year for the price to drop to 25. still can't find it cheaper than 45.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"asking 70 for this game is an insult to you. the game was released for ps3. then re  released for ps4. and now, re  re  released for ps5. listen.... the price for a new game is 60. you can't ask above the price for a new game, for a game you that have been released twice already. this is an insult to gamers"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,75usd? you think that's bad? here in australia it's 125aud. just for reference games here in general aren't really that expensive like they used to be. for some reason brand new ps5 exclusives are always 125 here while normal new titles would cost roughly 8090 compared to the us 6070. i don't know how many people here are actually buying these games at such a ludicrous price but i sure as hell ain't. we still get good sales so i'ma wait until this is like 40 or less a few months in.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-08,i'm so bummed about multiplayer not being in it. the first one was so good and addictive.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"i played the original remaster on ps4 and it was a good time! i haven't played part 2, but it is on my list. i dont think i really need to go back and buy this game again, but the visuals look really good and i can see why people would be excited to play again"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,they should remake the first 3 uncharteds
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,449 the timing is amazing for the deep blacks comment
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"this is just me but the original holds up so well that the 'remake' should have added new features such as going prone and expanded on areas a bit to change it up so fans of the original had something new. nd had the resources from both part i and ii so it was certainly achievable. still, it's one of my favourite games of all time so i will be playing at some point."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,graphics 1010 story1010 gameplay 710 price 010
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-06,"i played the remaster for the first time about 2yrs ago too n it was pretty good, but this definitely looks like a massive step up. that said, full price 70 is insane, it should be like 50 maximum"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"i appreciate all the work they clearly did to bring a classic game up to the current generation, but i still can't justify paying full price for that when i've played the original and the remaster already. once it goes below like 50, i might scoop it up"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"at first i thought this was the last of us  before you buy, part i, with a part 2 coming later to squeeze some extra views out of the review, which would be oddly appropriate given what naughty dog is doing."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-25,0212 i went into that water to check out the details. there is no reflection of joel in the water and there were dots in a grid pattern on the water surface. i thought it was a strange oversight. everything else looks good so far.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"started playing this game yesterday because of all the conversation around the new version. i had the ps4 remaster sitting around for ages and never gave it a go. well, i did try it once but i messed it up and never got past the first part where they were going to get the rations. yesterday i gave it a real go normal mode and was surprised. it was challenging but definitely easier than expected. i thought it would be like resident evil or third person shooter most of the time. the game is actually very balanced."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"yeah, i still don't think it'd be worth a fullprice purchase."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-07,i beat it a couple times on ps3 then another couple times on ps4. im happy to do it again on ps5. its that great.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"for some reason, the footages you presented here have been the best in convincing me that the graphical fidelity is truly different i don't know if it's to do with the way you guys captured the gameplay, but yeah, great job."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"one other little detail i miss in part 1 that was in part 2, is the way the enemies shouted out each other's names after one was killed. that really added a personal touch that immersed you in the world even more. overall i'm super impressed with the game, not thrilled about the price tag. but this is my favorite game of all time, just made better."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"the cutscenes are more impactful in the newer one. their faces are more expressive. if you haven't played it yet, it's a must buy."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,as jake said if you've never played this and you love a story driven game then buy it it's honestly one of the most beautiful crafted games ever made in every sense i have bought it for the third time as i love this game and seeing it and playing it with the graphics upgrade and it is a proper overhaul and as said how they've redone the facial animation enough though it was amazing on the ps3 i can truly say the the cut scene with tess as shown in this vid is so much more powerful looking forward to getting to bill as his character is one of the best parts of this game i'd give it 1010 anyway but it does honestly deserve it the only problem for me is reminding me of the 7 years i waited for part 2 and that's another story!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"i cant justify spending 75 on this game after beating it so many times on the remaster. but if they included factions, i would of bought this in a heart beat. they didnt have to change anything about it either gameplay wise. imo the best multiplayer game ever."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-18,that thing in your moms bedroom drawer 519
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,just buy the remastered version and save yourself money. jesus there are so many versions of this game it's hard to distinguish
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"i was about to preorder, but had a sinking feeling checked online and yup, no multiplayer. i loved last of us 1s story, but kept playing for over a year because of how fun the multiplayer was"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-06,"the last of us 1  2 are my favorite games of all time. ive been gaming for 30 years. that all being said, i feel like charging full price for this game was ridiculous. i expected at the very least for the levels to be redesigned to match the gameplay from part 2. we didnt get any of that. im passing for now"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"i played it on the ps3 and i loved it it came with my ps4, and ive played it so much my favorite part of the game was after beating it 3 or 4 times, i put it on the easiest difficulty and just ran through the game guns blazing def an entertaining way to play the game haha, and also a level of fun that i didnt expect to get from the game after beating it. i highly recommend you do that if youve beat it. when i get a ps5 i will be buying this. i did not buy the last of us pt2, mostly because there was so much info and news around the game i kinda just wanted to play it without being swayed by how people feel. and if its not good to me, thats cool. i wont regret waiting, and if its great it will have been worth it. but. if i had a ps5 now? especially because it came with my ps4 i would not buy it at 70. id wait for a sale if i get the ps5 before it goes on sale?id still wait for a sale i think"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-03,thankfully it was first time playing the last of us ever so the 50 black friday price was worth it . i just finished it and holy shit so beautiful and dark ..
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-08,0531  with all that vibration. it definitely goes hard.  susbaldino
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,this game did not interest me back 2013 but my taste in games has definetly expanded through the years. i am now about four hours in this game and im enjoyning the hell out of it. i recommened the remake for anyone who hasnt played the original before.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"man i just want this game for the pc. i loved it on the ps, but i really want to play it on the highest difficulty, but i'm too bad with a controller to aim properly."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-06,"while i never played it i'm broke so i watched walkthroughs the original is so nostalgic and great, and the older graphics add to that. don't get me wrong, the remaster looks great too though. i love seeing just how far games graphics have gone in what isn't actually that many years, if you think about it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"this was the only game i've really played in the last decade. i don't own a consol, but my ex did, and actually staying over at his place staying up til 4am playing the last of us was how we formed a relationship ' good times."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,"as crazy as it sounds, i have never fully finished the original version. tried like twice, but you know life. so when they announced this, i knew i had to get it on release and take this opportunity as the one where i finally take the full journey. have been playing it since midnight on release, and man i am so happy that i get to experience this version as my first full experience of the game because it is unmatched. naughty dog prevails once again!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"i got this game in the playstation store on day one. also joel can dodge. ive push the triangle button and he dodged. one thing i havent seen from no reviewer about this game talking about the snow  stage when youre playing as ellie and joel that the dualsense controller make you feel like youre there. what i mean is, it feels like the wind is pushing you back. that was amazing to me! also naughty dogs was right about the pulse 3d headset. you can hear everything around you. i think the money is worth it. im not tripping over 70. if that game wasnt so amazing i wouldve been mad. i love it! one more thing ellie help you out a lot on here"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-06,"having just finished tlou part i, i can say, without a doubt, this is the best version of one of the greatest games of alltime. i don't think i've ever seen character models this detailed and emotive ever in a video game part ii included. the game feels familiar and new at the same time. say what you will about the 70 price tag i tend to side with the developers and think they deserve to get paid, if you don't want to pay it, that's fine. just wait for a sale. the lack of multiplayer doesn't bother me as i never played much of it the first time anyway. the only thing i might've wished would've been added was to just make left behind part of the main game, organically. other than that, fantastic job naughty dog, as always. can't wait for the last of us part iii and whatever new ip they are cooking up i've long hoped for savage starlight to be made into a game."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-28,deep blacks shows black dude
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-06,"even some of the bathroom scales worked when you step on them, i thought that was a nice little detail."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"i think even 4045 bucks would have been a reasonable ask for this... but pricing this the same as a new triple a release including sonytax! is a pretty big ask... particularly when the remake is essentially a well done graphical overhaul and minor ai tweaks with limited gameplay impact. i understand that they couldn't just import the new mechanics from tlou2 and plop them down into a gameworld that wasn't designed with those new mechanics in mind... and that's fine. the game didn't need to have mechanics overhaul, but without substantial gameplay additions, this just doesn't justify it's full asking price. maybe once the game is down to halfprice, i'll pick it up. if it dropped at 40, i would have probably picked it up day one."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"an amazing and gratifying moment in my life was beating this game on grounded difficulty setting without dying one time, on my first try not the first time ever, hell no lol. just first grounded try. i practiced a ton on the other difficulty settings by beating it a lot and learning everything i could by playing it. and then i tried grounded and it was one of the most intense and heart pounding and memorable gaming experiences of my life. i'll never forget the feeling it gave me while playing it. felt like a true survivor in a hellish dystopia lol."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-23,"i have never played last of us ever before, i never had ps before, ps5 is my first ever playstation console, picked this game up as a 2nd hard market, and just completed it, i have tons of emotions for this, story telling masterpiece, just kind of speechless as of now"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-06,"i liked the original first game, and i have not played the second yet. i have not replayed it many times like a lot of the community seems to have. i will probably pick this up, and play through it, and then pick up part 2 and play through it as well. as far as i could tell though, it looks like they do not have a ps5 version of part 2. i hope that is added soon."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,ive never played the last of us but i grew up watching youtubers play it. 70 is hefty but this game is one of the all time greats and being able to experience it first hand with a dual sense and these new graphics has me excited.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-26,"watching this video for the first time. recently bought tlou on steam cause it's my favorite game and i am an xbox guy my entire life only to find my gaming laptop can't handle it  i love this game and the series as a whole. tlou i and ii are some absolute masterpieces. i loved both of them. the visuals, the sounds, the music i absolutely love the music. i don't think a game has ever moved me so much. as a man who's been with xbox his entire life, tlou will probably be my favourite game ever. i hope to get a good computer to play them one day and be able to experience it all for myself. i would also love to see factions out again. that game slapped. for context, i only got to play bits of tlou i through my cousin's ps3. most of tlou i and the entirety of tlou ii was experienced on youtube."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"i love it, gonna replay it 100 times. definitely the best version of the last of us, i wish there was a trophy for beating it on grounded though. regarding factions, there is a factions mode coming out next year so keep your eyes open for that."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,this needs to drop on pc already!!!!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,instant purchase. have i played it on multiple platforms already? yes. is it a fantastic game that i want to continue to replay every now and then? yes. was there anything wrong with the previous version? no. am i pleased to play a current gen version? heck yeah
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"thanks for laying it all out. i love both the original and yes, even part 2 to pieces. so, i knew as soon as part 1 was announced that i was eventually going to get it even though i also didn't believe the ps4 version was outdated in any way. that said, i will wait until it's a tad cheaper."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-28,any video game should not be over 40
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,i havent played part 1 since the ps3 so im def going to play this version but i can still wait for a sale. i got plenty of rpgs im catching up on in the meantime
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,in halfway through and i just love it. 100 worth every penny. can wait to play part 2 immediately after it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-05,finally got a used copy. replaying this game just reminded me how great naughty dog was when there where people like bruce and amy who kept neil's ideas in check.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,did anyone else catch 447 when he says deep blacks?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-13,"im going to be one of the lucky ones. never played this game, always wanted to but i was very burnt out of the zombie genre after walking dead. definitely going to give this a good play through!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"played the last of us 2 first. game blew my mind. then tried to play the original but the graphics looked bad. saw they were remaking it for ps5 so i waited. for me, it was definitely worth the wait and the price!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,449 good out of context quote
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,"played it when it first released. blown away for the story and the gameplay. 70 is a steep price to ask for a game that was released in 2013. 50 i'd be happy to pay. it's a welldone overhaul but feels kinda like a cash grab. if you're playing it for the first time, then 70 might feel right. you're in for an amazing experience."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,i would love listening to these reviews on spotify. literally these but in audio form
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-04,tlou12 and rdr2 are by far the best storytelling video games i've ever played.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-06,glad to hear it came out good. i look forward to playing it when i can get it used or out of the bargain bin for 2030.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,im running through the game now and im really happy with it so far. the lack of a dodge button feels like oversight however.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,last of us part 3 should be about how joel and tommy survived those 20 years before the first game and you play as tommy
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-06,favorite game of all time. already played it a hundred times but im working my way thru the remake at a nice pace. its so beautiful
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,missed it the first time aroundmust have been a good yearbut i've always been intrigued so i'll definitely have to catch this one. maybe i'll hold off for a better price first though
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"a subject nobody talks about enough is the fact than owning a ps5 gives you direct access to the remastered version for free with the ps plus collection...that alone should've motivated sony to charge it for 39,99 and there would've been zero controversy. adding it to ps plus extra even better. but charging 70 for it was a mistake , most fans have payed full price for it on ps3 and again on ps4. hard pass for me."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-19,"i have heard so much good about the last of us games, so i just had to get as a ps5 version for my first time experience. my expectation is mostly based on if i will feel it was worth it or if i will be enjoying myself.. i have only just begun the story so still a lot of excitement in me!"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-10,imagine being exited for a 3rd remake of a game thats been on the previous two generation consoles. this is a prime example of whats wrong with todays gaming industry and the fact people lap it up is a joke.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-10,"looks nice and all, but i really dont think this game needed a remake yetits not even a decade old id say wait until 2033."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-22,replaying both games back 2 back is gonna be a whole movie
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,this game still gives me chills..till dis day!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,props to editor. perfect ending line.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-11,bloodborne waiting room...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-14,"while this does look great, the original is more than enough in my opinion. i guess i just dont understand why youd want to spend 80 bucks on a game that you can get for free on playstation plus just with slightly worse graphics"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-13,i loved the jump to real time cutscenes in part 2. im so glad they decided to make em realtime for part 1.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-10,"love me again, fans! please! nasty dog, everyone knows joel's fate."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,give me the same multiplayer and i'll care. very underrated multiplayer experience.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-17,this game will forever be a masterpiece
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,for the very few who haven't played this masterpiece. now is the perfect time to do so !
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-12,"this isn't memory , it's love"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,"it's like a trilogy, but just over three generation of consoles."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-07,that graphics is crazy compared to the remastered
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,"glad this is finally happening, we heard rumors but it's always nice to get confirmation, especially with a release date in less than a year. i met my best friend through the forums before the release of the original back in the day. it will be truly mesmerizing to reexperience this masterpiece in all it's current gen glory."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,definitely didn't need a remake
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,this looks amazing and i can't wait to play it. i just wish sonykonami would remake metal gear solid already.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-28,this game was always ahead of its time.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-10,loved this game! wish i could get a ps5 to play this again
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,time to grab myself another platinum trophy to add to my holy grail of the original game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,to people who already own a copy of this game and plan on buying it again just stop. save yourself 70 and get something else people. you already own a copy of this game and this new version does not have enough graphical change to warrant a purchase.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-26,ive been playing this game since i was six years old and i still play it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,"i hope this will revive factions mode, that thing was so underated ! a really well thought multiplayer mode"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,i can wait a year for this to be on ps extra. amazing game but im not paying 70 to buy this again.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,we can only hope that the whole uncharted series gets this same treatment and comes to pc as well
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-29,best game of all time
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,"honestly it looks better than i thought, hopefully they add some new content as well"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,it's such a shame that this game never got a sequel.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-10,"finished the game at 1am. i just sat with my jaw dropped for 15 minutes while the credits rolled. couldn't believe what i had just played. same thing happened with part 2. original was a more flawless game, but the gameplay is getting a bit dated now after playing the second one."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-17,"i am excited beyond words, i love this game so much, cant wait to get the platinum trophy again for this gem"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-10,"part 1 was the best, and still is."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,does this game need a remake every gen
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,"i didn't understand why this game would need a remake and it still doesn't need it, but this is beautiful enough to justify its existence"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-21,out of all franchises. out of all those underrated franchises. this one gets a remake
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-10,i love the modern gaming. one game 3 consoles. ps2 was like 3 games one console.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,if it has the mechanical changes such as how stealth and crafting worked in part ii i'm in
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,that also in development for pc made me very happy.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-30,"this game is my favorite game of all time. part ii can take a hike, but part i has my whole heart."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-06-09,appreciate the fact that theyre developing the game for pc. i absolutely love this game i just hope the multiplayer is still intact.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,my only complaint is how much they changed the lighting in bill's town. i always remember it being bathed in a redish sunset and standing out as a cozy break from the rest of the games bleakness. now it just looks like a kind of gloomy town like the rest
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"the thing i like about the remake is that older characters's model actually feel older and you can see the highlight on the amount of stress they have suffered like the bags under their eyes, they are somewhat skinnier and feel more tired."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-15,"i think collectibles being a physical object joel picks up adds a lot more than just immersion, it makes the scene where joel rejects the photo of sarah that tommy offers him all the more powerful because through the whole game, joel has been pocketing every trinket and doodad he comes across, but instead of thoughtlessly pocketing the photo, he hands it back to tommy. this makes the scene where ellie hands joel the photo all the stronger, because he finally accepts this memory for all of the joy and pain it brings him. wish that naughty dog focused on these elements of storytelling more than traditional cinematic storytelling."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-07,"my favorite thing about the remakes is the nature, and how its taking over. the building are all covered in vines, theyre breaking apart and we can see flowers and other plants growing in them. and also, the moutains, and the trees, and the water, is just so beautiful"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"the best part is definitely gun recoil. they used to just lurch upwards when fired, now the guns flail and wobble around more when fired"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-25,the ai improvement blew me away. for example during a shootout at the start of the pittsburgh chapter ellie called out that they were behind us. the enemy ai actually flanked me and i didnt realize it but i was saved because ellie actually called it out
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"one of my favorite subtle details is how the cars now have breakable windows and detailed interiors. that combined with the new physics object make combat much more gritty, when you have glass from the cars flying off as it's shot, objects in the environment flying all over the place when a bomb is set off."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-27,"i personally really enjoyed the stylized look of the remaster, but theres no denying how beautiful the remake is in its own right"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-18,"i can't decide which version i like better. joel and the other gal at the beginning of chapter 1 now look their age, which is great, but at the same time, the characters' facial expressions have changed. where joel once looked determined, he now looks weary. where ellie once looked feisty, she now looks vulnerable. it's not worse, it's just ... different. much of the background art is improved, but a few of the original environments still seem preferable. for example, i was saddened but also chuckled when i noticed that they'd removed pluto from a poster in joel's daughter's room. i liked the scummy water of the original, but i also like the brackish water of the remake. i think both versions are flavours worth enjoying. i think i'll buy a copy of the new version in another month or two when it's released for pc and enjoy the excuse for a replay."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"i remember when the original came out and thinking that how can graphics get any better than this and it actually did get better now with the remake. i feel the game is just too short and no new stuff really added to add replay value to the game so i dont really wanna spend 70 dollars on it when i can get a completely new game with that money, overall good comparison video"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"i loved how the enemy human ais all looked different in the part 1 version as to where the remastered version, enemy human ais had like 6 different models."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-15,"beautiful description about the comparison and changes. as a 3d artist in the industry myself, i definetley appreciated this video! you deserve this good sir!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-21,"great comparison, i really appreciate the work they put into this remake. though i was noticing around one out of five examples i preferred the tone of the remastered original. maybe it's the way it was captured, but a lot of times the remake feels washed out or less cinematic in color tone. a few examples 250, 518 ellie is pink, 1345 that excessive red and yellow light made that entrance to the town for me. that all said, i'm looking forward to trying it out for myself when the price drops."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-10-26,"even though part 1 does still look incredible, this video is helping me realize just how good the original and remastered still look even today. obviously the tech is outdated for todays standards but they overall visual language is still super solid. maybe thats just mostly nostalgia for this almost 10 year old game."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-12,"the graphical improvements look great, but as i've beaten both original and remaster, i just can't justify paying full dollar for this. i could see myself buying it if it drops to around 20 bucks, but i don't see that happening soon. for new players though, this seems like the definitive way to experience this masterpiece."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"the new visuals are fantastic! sure, the remastered version already looked great, but the jump in visual quality with part one is astounding. i almost get lost in the world. the sequence in the hotel basement with the stalkers that i played last night was amazing! i really take my time to and look at everything closely to really appreciate the world that was created here with so much attention given to the smallest details. i wonder if my dream will come true one day uncharted 1, 2 and 3 getting remade with the same graphical quality as uncharted 4. i would buy that in a heartbeat!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-07,they really did an amazing job on both versions. nice to see a direct jump in performance.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-04,the only thing they did not remastered it's the price !
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"the facial animation really is the star of the show for me, also.. i know it must've been a ridiculous amount of work to hand animate the facial animation since they don't use facial motion capture like it was in the part ii.. presumably"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,i was looking forward for your presentation. they never disappoint. thank you so much for your videos.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-08,"the old one had such a unique art style, now its just so realistic, which is cool and all but i miss the old style"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,beautiful upgrade. not worth 70 just for the visuals but for definitely picking it up on sale!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,i had the privilege of working on this game for 4 years. been looking forward to your comparison for a long time. thanks for always producing such high quality content!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-15,"i love how tess looks in remake... and that scene when it's revealed she is infected, so much emotions on their faces... incredibly made"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-07,"i love what you do and these direct comparison videos. everybody is reviewing this game as if it's new and even though this isn't a review of the game itself, it feels right given that it's a remakeremaster. great job as always!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,the improvements are amazing and undeniable. but i believe that the original game has aged amazing. sometimes i really can't tell the difference at first glance. this game's graphics were way ahead of its time. compare it with the most games from that era and you'll understand. naughty dog never disappoints us. their games are all phenomenal.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-06,"just beat the remake and its amazing, loved every minute of it.. once you beat the game you can unlock the gameplay modifiers, and actually start the game with all your weapons and upgrades in your backpack its fun, you basically own the world dominating everything, love it"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"i'm waiting for the price to drop but i will admit that i was surprised with how much better this remake looks. i wish it was not remade shotforshot and included some expanded content or gameplay since ps5 owners can already play remastered through backwards compatibility  but it looks incredible and some of the ai adjustments to the enemies will probably make my first play through much more fun than remastered. at least some of the amazing ai and gameplay from part 2 is coming to part 1, even if it's arguably not enough."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,while i am a huge fan of this game and i want this version i am content to wait until it's cheaper. while the improvements are nice they aren't 70 worth of an improvement for someone who has played tlou so many times with a backlog of other games to get to.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-13,"ive always heard of last of us growing up but i wasnt much into action adventure games and im older now and im seeing thats all im really desiring, going through my first play through on the ps5 with the remake model part 1 and this game is truly amazing, the story is soo good, i know a lot of people are saying it might not be worth it but if its your first time ever playing it do it!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,you always produce high quality and i was looking forward to this one
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,"i will always be content with the older version, and have that nostalgia. that being said i cant wait to get the new one whenever i can afford it. it does look amazing."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-01,"in terms of sound design, i like the fact they got rid of the pew pew sound from the guns in favour of someone more rounded."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"love that you do sound comparisons, most underappreciated part of games"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,personally i really like looking at good graphics in games and the work you do is very much appreciated
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-04,"remastered has a darker, more gritty tone than part 1."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,i might sound crazy but i liked joels old design over the new one. the old design of joel looked threatening and badass while the new one is literally a middle aged grandpa that is strong.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"in the main scene of the game in which tomy takes joel and sara to the city i felt that in the remake they did a great job, i do not know if people noticed but the scenery got much darker and more impactful"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-11-28,"another amazing comparison, as we've come to expect, rich with deep analysis and with so much detail. keep up the good work!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"really is incredible how much work nd did with this remake. still remember how impressed i was playing it back on the ps3, can't wait to play it again on ps5 if i ever get one..."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-21,"i wish they kept the warmer colors and orange sunsets, infact they shouldve made it more warm because it just matches more with the first part and the 2nd part feels more dark so it should be cooler. i like remastered more most likely due to nostalgia"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-07,"the last of us part 1 remake is available as a free download right now with ps plus. finally got my copy and it's worth every minute. despite knowing the game inside and out, it feels like a totally fresh playthrough."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,nick is down right the most underrated youtuber of all time
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,been waiting for this video!! really enjoyed watching it! please do an in depth comparison between part i and part ii
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-11,my only complaint is how they are trying to sell us this game for a huge price
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,very impressive remake . unfortunately in my opinion this great remake still doesnt justify a 70 price tag . i feel it could of at least be 59.99 considering its a remake and not a new product. still with that being said and echoed throughout the comment section you can tell that there was much love and passion from the team and its not their fault sony decided to milk a dying cow .
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"i've been playing the remake on grounded difficulty and its way more difficult than the remaster ,the changes they've done to the a.i. really show."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,this makes me want to play the last of us over again. i think part 1 looks really good. i'll have to get it.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"when i got my ps5, i somehow lost all my ps4 save files in the transfer. i was crushed, of course was working on 100ing a 2nd run of tlou2, too but being able to relive the story like this definitely helps me to look on the bright side."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-10,"it is difficult to find a video so detailed and made with such care. this youtuber is simply excellent. regarding tlou, anyone who says that this remake is just a few textures and doesn't have new things is obviously blind. nd takes things seriously and knows its players perfectly. fantastic"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"for those that really love last of us, the remake worth it but not at the current price... specially when you consider they removed the multiplayer which i always thought underrated af. maybe at 40 or something like that..then i buy it"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,great video! can you make a video where you go into the differences of tlospart 1 to part 2?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-07,the original graphics carry a different vibe and it cant be compared in my opinion
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"the higher resolution of course is incomparable, but sincerely most of the times i like more the remastered dark less contrast look... the new details are really impressive and the sounds are even more realistic!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,i prefer the colour tone of the originalremaster.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-02,this was so incredibly satisfying to watch. i wonder if the environment team enjoyed making those tiny changes. thank you for making this video  so well done and edited!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,this is amazing. thank you for your time and attention to make this video.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,i was waiting for this comparison. thanks nick!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-17,"2140 in the remake, the pallet texture is also more realistic, with it looking damp, rotting and covered with algae. where else in the remastered, it looks dry and unaffected by the swampy waters. the sound effect also seems more accurate with a duller thud sound in the remake instead of a creaking sound in the remastered."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,i like the look of the older one. like the colors just look better to me. i wish they added the the details but kept the old look and feel.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"i just beat the tlou part 1 and thats after playing both the remaster and original days before, the new game, while with a hefty price tag, was most definitely worth it to me. graphics were incredible, even better than portrayed in the video, gameplay is significantly better and everything is refined and smooth. i ran into one glitch throughout my entire play through and all it took was an encounter reset. definitely wait for a sale or the price to come down before buying, but also still definitely buy it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-31,as a huge fan of tlou i recommend anyone on ps5 to play remastered then part ii. you'll appreciate the improvements of part ii more and remastered is free with ps5 essentials. and tlou remastered on ps4 pro enhanced mode on ps5 runs 1800p 60 fps locked with virtually no loading times while keeping the original aesthetic while keeping the best multiplayer game on ps4ps5 while ur waiting for factions part ii to come out.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"very good video as always, im not sure i believe ageing the characters necessarily makes them look better."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,fine with 20 dollar version. i don't think it is an remarkable improvement. it is an improvement. but not worth the 70 bucks price of admission unless you some type of superfan. it's the same game i brought already. ill catch it on sale around 40bucks this xmas.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-30,"i've played remastered on the ps4 twice now, and i just started playing part 1 on the ps5 last night. i actually cried because of how amazing and detailed it looked. i just felt like i could see everything better, and i was seeing some details for the first time. i feel so much more immersed. the physics of joel's backpack moving as he walksruns, the way he puts his arm up for cover if he stands under falling water i don't remember if he does that in remastered..., the way he actually picks up objects instead of swiping his hand over them... i'm so glad i bought part 1, it's so worth it and feels like a totally different game. this comparison was crazy to see."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"personally, i prefer ellie's originalremastered character model. her face has a narrower chin, smaller nose, and bigger, more expressive eyes. like you said, she looks like a whole different person. now she looks like an edited version of ashley johnson, and, to me, it feels kinda weird, for a lack of a better word. also, i like a bit more how joel looked, but his transformation isn't too bothersome. in the sound design side, i actually prefer the old pew sound the guns made . sometimes, i rather have some unique artistic choices, than to have full blown realism. nonetheless, i say that most of their choices are solid for this remake."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"the improvements are mindblowing, cant wait till its launched on pc!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-10,"as an early pc player since 1985, i never had a gaming console before i recently bought and reconditionned my first cheap and used ps4 pro to experiment lazy sofa gaming. i wasn't expecting to much of it... just fun with my teenage daughter... i bought the remastered and part ii versions used as well for 20, i've just finished both of them. i instantly and definitely fall in love with the story and the caracters that are both absolutely amazing. whatever the little problems of design and gameplay. i've never been touched that much by a video game, except death stranding maybe. a master piece, really. but, thanks to your big work here, i'm the happier old gamer of the universe ! sure, i will one day buy the enhanced part 1 and part 2 versions for my pc just for the pleasure to fall in love again and again... amazing remake after all ! thx !"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-23,part 1 is a masterpiece. one of the best i've played.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,big enough to double dip but not for that price 3040 seems more reasonable to me
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-26,its crazy how my 13 year old self playing remastered for the first time thought everything looked so realistic back when it came out.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"part 1 looks amazing, but is it weird that i still like the original better? great video, as always."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-05,"it really is a remake, granted they could have had better gameplay mechanics but the fidelity alone is insane. the cutscenes actually match the voice acting in terms of power the actors gave to them. amazingly done, plays super smooth too."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-20,dude the background music. sounds like a car honking its horn in the middle of a drumming circle.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"nice comparison, but i feel as though many people don't take into account just how impressively detailed tlou1's visuals were when they came out, and how easily it holds up today. some of the best graphics you had ever seen on a console."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-18,it looks pretty good in the remastered version too.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,"no matter how impressive the remake looks, it will never replace the og remaster for me. it was an important part of my life back then."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"the haptics are great, too. the subtle feedback when you holster a weapon gets me every time."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-31,"one thing that i imagined them doing in the remake that didnt happen was expanding the gameplay areas. remember how in the original game, floors in buildings are randomly blocked off by debris, and many areas are made inaccessible by wires. with the increased power of the ps5, they couldve easily expanded the gameplay areas by making these areas accessible. this couldve made the game feel more open ended. sad that they didnt do it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-01,"original game is built on the uncharted 3 game engine. the remaster is just that same engine, but with higher resolution assets, better render resolution, framerate, and improved texture filtering and antialiasing. all of the tech and post processing is the same, just more refined. remake is their newest game engine with brand new everything across the board."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-19,"one thing you didn't mention was the spores. in the remastered version it was like you were in a haze and you can barely see anything. in the remake, the spores effect is much less aggressive."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-10-14,"this is a really informative video. like some others have said, the original ps3 the last of us was an incredibly detailed game when i first played it. the last of us remastered was well worth the purchase price as it stepped things up another level  i didn't think it could get much better, i hated what they did to the characters and story in part 2, so i was very sceptical of this remake... but boy, it really does look brilliant! despite my dislike of what they've done to the series in part 2, i will be buying part 1 when it releases on pc. 4k, 60 fps, ray tracing hopefully! and dlss here we come!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-20,"i don't usually believe that old works need to be improved  even if they're flawed now, it can add to the original intent but i look at this and keep saying wow that is better. especially the cutscenes, i can tell they've used what they've learned about framing and composition during pt2"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"a comprehensive comparison between the two that brings far more information than the other comparison videos out there. just the facts and observations, and a lot of them  all without keeping the driving force behind the video on is it worth the 70? rhetoric that every other video seems to do with the exception of the end. i am far more excited for this to come to pc than i ever have been."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"as a new ps5 owner i'm stoked for this! always had xbox and nintendo since the ps1 so to be able to play this, looking so good, will be an experience!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-31,"at 2000 showing someone getting shot yet still censoring the cussword with a beep is the most american thing still happening. nice laws, youtube"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-27,i think this is pretty cool. it's almost like comparing a video game to its live action movie. the amount of work and detail naughty dog puts into their games is astounding.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-25,got the platinum 3 times and can't wait to do it again once it's added to the psn catalog 09262024. happy tlou day guys!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-22,this man really said genarbator 935
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-16,"what a great break down, there is more that went into this than i thought. though, i do think some of the visual upgrades actually make it less appealing. the jaggies introduced and the general sheen and cleanliness hurt the world and character a vibe a bit. but the generbater 936 animation is interesting, sounds new"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,nick i'd be far more interested in seeing you do a comparison between this title and tlou part 2. i'd like to hear whether you see anything in the tlou part 1 to make you believe it couldn't have also been ported to the ps4. and generally which game you think is ultimately better looking.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-25,this was a very enjoyable deep dive my friend. thanks for the good content. subscribed
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-03,so cool that you got kermit the frog to narrate your video
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,i was really looking forward to this one. nice job once again
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-27,i appreciate a lot the detail into this video! you awesome thanks!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,i prefer the way the environments looked in the original idk what it is it just looks better to me artistically
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-11-01,apart from my movie comment earlier. you did a great job with this in the comparison! thanks bro
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-11-09,this is exactly the type of attention gta trilogy should have received from the studio instead of the abomination they made it into. this is a proof that it is possible to make a good remake.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-17,"this is without a doubt one of the most beautiful games i've ever played in my 20 years of pc gaming, i love it"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"oh yes, the ground up remake that began development in the spring of 2021 and came out in the summer of 2022. that makes a lot of sense. it took 5 years to make the original and it only took a year to make this completely newly made game? and no one's questioning this? seriously?? this is, literally, the original game with new visual assets over top of it. it has a few other minor tweaks, like a couple character movements and some map alterations here and there, but it is honestly the original game operating underneath a new veneer. just look at when it began development april 2021 and understand that games finish development a few months before they actually launch. also, play both versions and notice how many of the character placements, movements both playable characters and npc's, and maps have not changed. far more has not changed than has besides visuals. in actuality, the majority of things are 100 identical when not talking about visuals."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"optimization is what we need ...no cheaper price ,graphics ,or stuffs even needed as vital as game optimization.."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"what we need is better optimization, i'm scared what will happen"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,bro what u think i have ryzen 5 3600 rx 5700xt 16gb ram can i run?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"from nowhere, it's better to pirate this game. buy part 1 if you want."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,"222 shit don't kill me man, please. damn, felt his soul departing even before getting shot."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-11,"i love how he relies so much on his bottlesbricks, and other equipment rather using his guns all the time. he has very strategic gameplay, and while playing on the remake just makes it even better"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,the hostage at 229 begging for his life as joel pulls the trigger.. cold and brutal.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,"the combat in this game was always satisfying, glad to see it get some attention that it deserves"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-14,"when he said don't kill me man, please please please! i felt that"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,608 saving the sticky bomb for later was just so classy.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,smvrs the type to punch a clicker with his bare hands and still win the fight
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-20,the bloater tossing ellie around was hilarious
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-28,"aggressive is an understatement, this guy was on the hunt! it felt like they were hiding from him ... . you made some of the most challenging encounters look easy,"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-21,i know joel and ellie arent related by blood but by the end of part 2 you can see just how much joel influenced her in who she is as an adult i say this with all the love in my heart for their dynamic.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,even in a zombie apocalypse you still style on the enemies. good video and can't wait for gow ragnarok
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-28,"i watched this and then tried to play this way and instantly died multiple times, like not even close. i dont know how the hell you do this or how long it must take you learn every enemies movement pattern but kudos man, its masterful."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,i remember playing through part 2 thinking man i wish these gore effects were in part 1 here we are and it's beautiful
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-15,"my first playthrough back i was pretty satisfied that i got some good looking gameplay on grounded  but looking at your nearperfect choreography and mechanics in these scenes, i'm in awe. bravo, you always amaze."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,228 is such a wild moment my god
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-26,this man puts the definition of kill or be killed in perfect use.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,"damn, the dorm section here was intense asf 949 i couldn't help but laugh when that bloader was slapping ellie bruh"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-14,the bloater hit ellie so hard thrice 949 to 1000 . seems like he knew joel is unbeatable. so he chose to fight small ellie. btw some elite gameplay right there. you knew where will every enemy be coming from. it's like you are the enemy and they are the main character being hunted
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-07,"wow, theres so much i never knew you could do. this flawless gameplay makes me feel ashamed lol subbed instantly."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,"at the end be cool, man oh, im the coolest  blows head off"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,"dude, this is flawless. probably the best gameplay on this platform  carlsbergif it was a game changer."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-30,"as someone whos completed both games on grounded i can say that this much ammo really makes it easy lol, sick gameplay though"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-30,"i feel like joel is such and underrated character in media, he's literally batman and you make it so flawless"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,welcome back bro!!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,"glad to see you're still kicking. despite the game playing pretty much the same, i do enjoy it so much that i'll probably get it again. when it's on sale and i own a ps5"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-11,"amazing, i'm more of a stealth gameplay guy but this is definitely worth the watch"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-29,"joel is a cold, ruthless, brutal survivor and it scares me how much of killer hes become"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-12,"fantastic gameplay as always, truly"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-15,this is so beautiful. this gameplay is art.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-08,this guy plays amazingly. the way he dealt with the hotel bloater
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-11,still one of my favorite games of all time
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-12,couldnt wait until you uploaded part 1 gameplay and as usual you are the king. that bow shot wow and your aim is so good.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,"i've beaten this game a few times on grounded myself. i always choked the uninfected while using the bow and its awful targeting reticule for the infected. i lacked confidence in my aim and dreaded every single shot i missed. but you? not only do you display accuracy, confidence, and fluidity i never had. most of all, you are unashamed of using your arsenal lavishly, and efficient enough to make it all count! a great video! will you be uploading more?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,i've been waiting for this can't wait to see more. keep it up
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,he's back!!!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-29,great to see smvr back in my feed. missed these badass aggressive videos.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,this is what i wanted great video dude you really push the gameplay to its limits.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-27,636 i love how the other runner politely waits for joel to kill the first runner
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-12,dude youre a monster with that bow
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-30,058 lets be smart about this theres a lot of them sprints and sucker punches a guy

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-17,1050 that collat had my jaw like
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,the king is back
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-28,the way you play is so fluid and fun to watch.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,keep kicking ass my dude
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-01,949 love how funny it was when the bloater slapped the ever living sausages out of ellie lmao oh lord
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-16,"ellie getting kicked around by the bloater at 0950 was great. revenge for tlou2, jko"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-27,just snagged the firefly edition. great video. can't wait to dive back in. thanks for the upload.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-12,man i've been playing this game for years and didn't know you could do half the stuff in this video. i'm playing through again now haha.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-14,858 knife we all float now....
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,"high level gameplay as always, this was satisfying to watch! before watching this video i was a little worried because it looks like there will be a lot of rats but apparently not"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-13,"wow man, this is such a pleasure to watch. i love the flow keep it up"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-29,"i played part 2 in the same way, everything on grounded except for resources on very light. first thing i did upon entering each room was to shoot a couple of bullets in the air to get every enemy's attention, not a single stealth kill during the whole game. awesome experience"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-22,"honestly, your way of playing is so much better than mine that i never get tired of watching the video"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-11,i was having anxiety when you were fighting the bloaters lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-11-08,"i just realized that a combat system like this would be perfect for a john wick game. improvisation, stealth and a good mixture of gunplay and melee."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-25,phenomenal gameplay!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,"i looked forward to it, and i'm satisfied"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-27,"012 wait, did he just throw a runner at a clicker?? you could do that??? i had no idea."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-28,im glad stephen is doing better! i cant imagine youtube without him
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,best gameplay so far
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,so impressive with your speed and accuracy. every shot is a head shot except when shoot their knee so they fall to the ground. my gun aiming accuracy is horrible i want to be this good!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-25,run. bill was trying to save runner's lives from joel.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,not a big fan of the last us part one gameplay but you killed it stillkeep up the good work.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-13,the legend is back!!!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,"jesus christ, it's jason bourne"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-21,858 magical floating shiv.... nice lmao
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,smooth play as usual mate! cheers
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,"daayyyyum son! thats some precision, right there"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-10-15,"wow! even with the horrible aiming in this game, you somehow managed to master it"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-10-05,you don't speak and your content entertains me. i like people like you. thanks.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,smvr you gotta play sifu man. i think it has some of the best melee combat i've ever experienced.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-18,"you're really good with the combat, keep it up!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-18,"i keep forgetting that ellie was literally born when the apocalypse started. joel should've searched for a camera with a video of the old world or even just a picture, ellie would be weirdly impressed"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-04,i guess when you have so much you never think of it running out.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-20,this is why ellie was an interesting character to me. we are so used to how we live now. she was born six years into the apocalypse and that her norms are not like ours.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-11-14,pfft thats stupid me just sitting here thinking i should laugh or just question myself
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-30,"i like her realistic approach. as someone who has never encountered such a concept, it mustve been completely alien and counterintuitive to her."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-07,its still so eerie hearing her go in your time. im used to most apocalypse games and movies taking place a year after the outbreak or something. but its been so long that she was literally born into this. shes never seen what the world used to be like.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-09,this part of the game hit me especially hard. had a pretty bad ed at the time and i'm 99 sure this was one of the things that made me wake up lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-29,i love little moments like these. pieces of banter like this really displays the difference between the worlds they were born into
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-12,i love how realistic and grounded ellies perspective is on this topic.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-11,i thought you had plenty of food in your time that line got me
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-20,first time i played this part i was literally dealing with an eating disorder and this conversation made me laugh
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-24,"joel if the apocalypse happened 10 years later than it did in the games wait till i tell you about looksmaxxing, ellie youll be grateful the outbreak happened."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-18,"this model is skinny for looks, but people in this comment section acting like joel just said being fat is a good thing. he implied being to far on one end or the other was bad thing."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-20,some people fail to recognize beauty standards are also influenced wealth perception. in times where food is scarce a bigger body is usually seen as more attractive because its a sign of wealth. same with skin tone. pale was more attractive in the past because sitting inside meant you didnt work the fields. now being thinner is considered beautiful because it indicates you can afford good food and a gym membership wealth. a tan means you have leisure time to spend outsideon vacation.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-22,"i see some people mention how ellie is just as skinny as that model and shes skinny because theyre starving. there is no food, which is why she asked why the model would choose to be as skinny as someone who is half starved on a daily basis? the answer is looks, just as joel said. if the model wanted to be healthy shed have a little bit more fat and have a lot more muscle. so dont tell me its for health. its a beauty standard for modern society. a strong athletic women isnt, but the athletic women is definitely healthier. so dont give the crap excuse of health. wanted to clarify, some people lean towards the heavy side and some lean towards the leaner side. its all calories in and calories out. everyone should be eating based upon activity level, sex, height, exc. the most important thing is to eat proper nutrition and be active at least 45 times a week. as someone who used to be super skinny and was skinny shamedi had an ed, i would never want to do that to someone else. just be healthy folks healthy is beautiful."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-27,"this is how you write. not the hamfisted attempt in the second game. ellie doesn't judge, she simply tells us how this concept looks from her perspective."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-07,you can hear in the tone in his voice he hated this stuff lol. especially since he had a preteen daughter she was probably being affected by this type of stuff too. edit why did this start a all out war in the comments? i just voiced an observation i made and gave a reason why that observation may be right
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-11,"oml, ain't no way people got mad from this"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-08,by the looks of it you could lose some of that food  ellie to bill
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,i love the part where the scene has the exact effect the writers intended and the audience participates about how they like that it is the way they made it because of the reasons they made it that way.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-27,"when food was scarce, being a bit chubby was considered beautiful. in a world where we have a surplus of food, its the opposite lol"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-06,the way ellie tries to look under the dress
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-08,pov youre trying to find the toxic comments but all you see are people fighting against their own imaginary comments.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-28,that is such a level of realism to this perfect game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-15,it's not that deep guys.. it's just ellie confused because she grew up in the apocalypse and doesn't know any better since she literally has to kill for food. that's it.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-28,this is weirdly comforting
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-18,pov youre trying to find where all the mad comments at
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-04,"when i played this game this part honestly kind of helped me heal, probably sounds stupid but its true"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-17,it's funny how i'm seeing comments about people looking for offended comments and people are talking about finding comments about people not being able to find the offended comments.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-11,"ellie is just precious, i love her"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-27,"this is actually very very comforting. wish i could normally think like this but my ed has eaten away my brain edit by ed i mean eating disorder, not erectile dysfunction. my pal works just fine i just have anorexia lmfaooo"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,such great narrative development through this tiny piece of dialogue
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-18,"damn, some ya'll took this shit to heart. he's talking about the model, and models are known to stay on very strict diets to maintain the industry's standards. it was a simple answer for a kid curious over a posterin a videogame xd"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-20,"nah cause the whole comment section is twitter at this point edit oh, its called x now"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-27,"bro why are people arguing, it's a game"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-15,"that..... really made me question a lot of stuff sometimes trying to look good, we forget our health. but when we don't have nothing, what will we do?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-09,theres more comments talking about how people are offended then there are comments about people being offended
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-31,modelling agencies legit tell you to starve yourself and turn you down if you arent skinny enough. thats his point
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-12,its hilarious that people are this brainwashed into thinking being underweight is healthier than being overweight
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-07,so many cool moments like this scattered throughout game that you can just walk by and miss  lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-07,im skinny and i eat a lot i understand the unrealistic beauty standards but i grew up with big is beautiful  which made me very ashamed of being skinny. even developing an ed for eating more than i should ofc i just couldnt gain the weight. it took me a very long time to realize my body is enough and that i am woman enough. many people dont realize skinny people also go through insecurities this badly this is for the comments double standards are crazy
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-04,woah bro this is like so deep. this says a lot about society. we really are the last of us
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-02,looks like a normal human
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,i cant unhear petra whenever i hear this voice actress speaking
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-19,i like how they chose to use an image of someone who's not even that skinny.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-03,yall got to remember that she thinks its dumb because she eats as much as she can to survive and with all the work they do every day they burn calories fast
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-06,"i honestly agree with ellie, it is stupid, dont starve yourself just because it may make you look better, lifes to short to worry about looks, health and happiness always have been and always should be top priority in the lives of someone, not just to help yourself but to help others"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-01,i literally just played this part. currently on my first playthrough since i've never had ps3 until now. god i have been missing out
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-26,"genuinely so sad how one of ellies traits was how she loved food, and then after joel died, she was never eating, and even said in her journal and in several scenes that shes having to force food down. second game perfected her character, the people who think otherwise didnt pay attention to the first game"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-06,"well, some people eat normally and they are naturally skinny"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-29,wait till ellie finds out about eds
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-27,this genuinely has me in tears
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-16,i hate when people assume im not eating enough when in reality i just have an insane metabolism
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-16,she looks normal ? i see pepole who are relatively the same size as her everyday so it isint unrealistic like the game wants us to think
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-01,the game telling people eating disorder is bad and doing it for looks is stupid twitter and i took that personally.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-17,that line had a lot more lesson to it than they were trying to force in last of us 2.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-05,"yall they are talking about a model, a models job quite literally and put simply is to look good. it is well known that a good amount of models tend to starve themselves or at the very least struggle with body image. its not the models fault, its definitely because the modeling industry is so exploitative and just dehumanizing to the point extreme beauty standards are internalized by the models. also our beauty standards sway so extreme to the point where models, pop stars, idols would starve themselves for looks. yall are kidding yourselves if you think that isnt a huge reason people want to be thin. this isnt about the average person who just eats normally and works out regularly. also joel isnt saying yeah we should all just be obese its much better hes saying looks can drive you to an extreme such as that, when civilization had plenty of food we didnt appreciate ithow silly do beauty standards look now when were all focused on just trying to survive. but obv joel said it more summarized and a little jokingly. like how do yall miss the point, even top comment is missing the point lol"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-27,"not everyone in the comments thinking models still starve themselves in 2023, even though half of models now are plus size girls for diversity"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-24,"yeah, the motivation should not be for looks. it should be for health."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-28,this is the best thing i've ever seen
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-04,"you guys don't realize that some of the stuff you care so much about would hardly matter to someone that grew up in a way ellie did, it shows how stupid it is to hold on to certain beliefs when there is much more important things to worry about"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-30,"imagine if she saw a plus size model at target and had the same energy. man, you really did have a lot of food back then"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-18,i mean she is getting paid for looking like that.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-28,ellie is so cool to say the realistic stuff
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-18,"you can eat good and be skinny, whoever says the opposite is lying"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-10,ellie knew whats up
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-26,"why are people acting like models are healthy ? a lot of models their diet was some berries , some nuts , black coffee and water ."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-04,i love how similar this is to aj in telltales walking dead
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-08,"im naturally skinny, i eat alot i just dont gain, please stop assuming we dont eat"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-26,"i hope in the tv series they do this with paris hilton or other famous people in 2003, and since in the 2000s, being extremely thin was the trend, and having a more normal body was already being obese."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-27,"i thought there was plenty of food in your time is really a line that only could come out of modern times. there are a thousand things to notice before that, why is she so pale, why shes so clean, her skin is perfect, her hair is so fluffy, her clothes seem so useless, what is that on her lips, or even if you really want to go that way, she looka so weak. i'm not saying it's a bad line, but it comes from a modern mindset."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-29,ellie ate! she is so hydrated
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-27,oh my dawrin! last of us commentary on the female beauty standards! oh my based
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-26,"joel's right its for looks. ellie's right its stupid. train,eat,rest. thats how you got in shape not starving yourself to death"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-06,these comments make me wanna see the commenters daily cholesterol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-11-08,"i have played this game so many times, and there are still things i have yet to find. i've never gotten this conversation before!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-26,it's actually so sad because it's implied that she had an eating disorder in the second game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-07,she doesn't even look underweight
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-10,what i expected haha so funny what we got oh my gosh stop arguinggggguhhh!!!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-21,this makes me feel so much better
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-03,"as someone who is tall and thin not specifically trying to be, just how i am this always made me feel just a little weird. like the absolute bewilderment in her voice as if someone being that size is unfathomable. all right writers, don't make me feel weird about myself."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-23,some people are just naturally thin not everyone is thin because they starve themselves
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-17,"bro, that is what ive been saying my whole life"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-05,this genuinely makes me feel better about my body
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-11-04,the fact that shes literally the same body type as her makes this hilarious.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-30,bruh you have no reason to be angry about this. the subject doesn't even have anything to do with overweight people. some models actually stop eating to look like this. of course ellie would think it's stupid because it sounds stupid.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-01,can someone actually explain why the mean comments are never actually in the comments section when you look at
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-15,this wasy favorite part of the series. they really got into the mind of a kid raised in the apocolypse and
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-20,"honestly, i thought this was the worst line in the entire game and i freaking love this game."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-21,"it was the 2000s, you have no idea how many models limited themselves back then"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-28,she looks perfectly healthy tho and 95 of models are healthy
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,"this will be more and more like real life, at how thinks are going, we each they closer to the apocalypse and when food will not be longer for anybody, food isnt granted, always finish your plate on restaurants and if you cant please take the leftovers"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-02,that girl is so skinny funny coming from ellie
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-12,"why do people continue to push this whole models show an unhealthy, unrealistic body shape but are completely fine with plussized models like tess holiday, who are 500 pounds? having ellie walk up to a picture of a morbidlyobese woman wouldve painted the picture a lot better than this shame the already shamed modeling industry crap. edit misspelled holliday whoops"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-15,"that model isnt even model skinny. shes like, normal lean. ironically, ellie is also normal lean. that said, it could actually be an even more immersive moment if she is implying that people with food abundance should eat all of it all the time, which is a realistic misunderstanding for a young person with food insecurity to have. is it catering? probably, but it could be read differently. his response could also be read as him answering passively and not really thinking on it beyond that. i never played much of last of us, cause its toted as a player choice rpg, but the first several hours are boring linear gameplay, and i just wasnt fine with that"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,i be eating just to eat this makes me feel so much better
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-02,now im totally replaying the first game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-06,"she seems pretty healthy, some people just have a harder time gaining fat in certain places, like the arms"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,in my honest opinion and experience playing this game. ellie brought it upon herself for just wanting to go after abby for herself rather to stay and at least move on but instead. she was manipulated by tommy how he got piss she didnt want to and that was the final trigger to have her go after abby and now lost everything and especially her two fingers

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"i love watching your channel and always pop in to watch. i have to say that this game is easily my favourite ever as much as that sounds like a cop out  the emotionality behind every scene and the way it definitely feels submersive and always such a ball to run through the environments even though ive played this game so many times make it such a vibe. its never a bad time. i cant justify spending this money just for the improved graphics but man, imma watch the hello out of this series to take in every single expression and graphical upgrade! the eyes are a1 and that lip syncing immaculate! the realism here in the motion capture and the lighting is perfect."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,my favorite game of all time has gotta be the last of us cause they did it so well. it simulates what the world would be like if something like an apocalyptic world would happen and i just find it so cool and fascinating and they did a really good job with details of the game and everything. definitely 1 on my list of all games i've played
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-20,"one of my favorite little details of this game is at 3950. terrancethe hey pretty lady guy is none other than the man, the myth, the legend himself. troy baker."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"let's goooo! favourite game is probably, dead space or a plague tale innocence, because as a father that game hits hard!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"tlou is definitely my favourite game of all time. i bought the ps4 just cause i wanted to play ltou 2  in my opinion there is no other game that can match the ability this game has to make you immerse in the story  i also got to know your channel because of tlou! also, feel free to make the other parts long as well, i know i will watch them all."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"my favorite game of all time is red dead redemption 2, i cant even begin to describe how much that game did for me thank you hollow for all the amazing video and have a good day"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-25,3318 the cordyseps infection doesnt turn ppl into zombies. zombies are people who died and came bck the infected from tlou are normal ppl tht get infected with the only goal to spread the infection
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-09,this game looks so interesting and i'm thinking on getting the game now keep doing what your doing hollow you truly are the best
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,the last of us part 2 is definitely my favorite game of all time. it hit me so hard and had such a beautiful and sad and so many other emotions into it. it holds a special place in my heart that ill eventually get ellies tattoo she has. so hype for this
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"i would love to play this remakeit looks stunning, gaming has never been better"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"this game man... hollow, i am so glad this is one of your most loved games to date. i remember this coming out for playstation 3 and playing some parts of it and of course i was so young at the time of release. then playstation 4 came around and they remastered it and i loved watching gameplay of it. it was so cool seeing it get the tid bit of consistent love it deserved. after awhile of course, the last of us part 2 released and i loved watching you play it. the emotions, tones, sound design, character development and stories that were told. the theme of the cycle of violence and animosity throughout the story and the fact that it did not hold back on narrative choices. it was an awesome time watching you play through it. and now... they literally remade this game from a atleast very steep starting point and i gotta say it might actually look better than part 2. the thematic tones in each level. the level of detail and ambient character to the world and the sheer fidelity in the cutscenes too and with this game overall! it's so freaking tear jerking to see this game where it is now. this franchise. i care about it so much and i don't even have a playstation. i've never actually fully played. i've always been an xbox guy. wish i did though. that's what's surprising. how naughty dog can pull you in without even having to play. this is a game franchise i've never been fully apart of because of having not played it, yet i'm so close to because of the story that is being told. seeing you play this hollow is amazing knowing how much you love this game and you actually take your time with it. now i just gotta catch up!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"this game is awesome, and so are you hollow! thank you for making such amazing content for us!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,i've played through the last of us on ps3 and ps4 ... absolutely a masterpiece of a game. the last of us 2 ... not so much.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"wow this is great! i cant wait to experience the game again with you! edit my favourite game is probably this game. before this i never thought it would be possible to feel such emotions for a bunch of pixels, truly a masterpiece!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-22,this game is hands down my favorite game of all time. it holds a special place in my heart for the times i played the original one. and i soon will buy a ps5 just to experience this game once again in 4k
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"the last of us part 2 is my favorite game of all time, its a beautiful look at the art of violence, and the cycle of revenge. true gaming milestone . also id love a copy"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,my favourite game of all time will have to be half life 2. nothing right now comes close to what it offered in the fps space. there is still hope for half life 3.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-28,3 minutes in and i'm already crying that was so wholesome
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-13,love that they added the wilhelm scream at 1640.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"my absolute favorite game has to be the last of us part i and ii because the culture shock it caused in the gaming community. although many people didnt like the twists the last of us part ii had, it truly started the conversations of deep analysis in storydriven games. i love your videos hollow and love watching you grow to be one of the biggest youtubers on the platform!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,the better question is is the port ready?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"definitely benchmark the game, although there might be a ton of benchmarks on the game your benchmarks are genuinely the most resourceful and indepth. keep up the amazing work!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"as someone who lives in a regionblocked country by playstation, i can confirm that the restriction is still in place. even though some recent games, like god of war ragnarok, no longer require a psn login, the issue remains. the messedup part is that ever since sony imposed mandatory psn login and regionblocked sales, they have still been offering regionspecific steam keyswith the only exception being the horizon zero dawn remastered upgrade dlc for those who previously owned the original hzd. so technically, you can still buy ps games on steam, just not directly from it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,who's ready for a 10 hour shader compiler! it takes that long due to abby's guns.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,requiring 150gb for the bare minimum graphical settings like 720p or 1080p should be a crime in itself. rip my steam deck.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,"would love to see a benchmark of this title considering the issues with the pc port of the first game. especially because they explicitly mention frame generation in the post, which can mean that the target fps is with that enabled, which no one likes."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,never trust the official system requirements! wait for actual benchmarks.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,i know the pc version is enhanced but the fact that this game ran on the base ps4 gives me hope for great performance and scalability. it even ran 30  1440p on the ps4 pro which is slightly on par with a 1650 if google is correct the part 1 remake on launch seemed to be overly heavy without the proper optimizations.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i guess i am not gonna check the system requirements in the next 2 years since i bought the new 9070xt. i love this feeling, experiencing this for the first time in my life  hope all of you guys will be as lucky as me"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,i expect performance issues similar to what we have been experiencing in recent nixxes ports where they have started using directstorage. that 32 gb ram requirement paints a different picture.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,a classic tale of a developer living off the same game for a decade
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,my 4080 will live to see another day
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"mr. daniel, are you making a video about microsoft's directx raytracing 1.2? wccftech's article about it mentions a lot of performance improvements. it would be nice to know how this can potentially improve gaming in terms of visual quality and fps."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"150 gbs for a single player game is brutal, they could give us options to remove or download 4k texture packs, mobile games have already started to implement this to combat the problem of bloating"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,the fact that its so light on cpu reqs prob means it'll be an alright port
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,abbynator is ready for everything.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"1745, they have not. for whatever incredibly asinine reason, sony is still refusing to sell those games to those of us affected by the region locks. now down to 132 countries andor regions, which includes a large portion of the balkans, the entirety of the baltics, and places like the philippines and egypt the former being a pretty well sized pc market as well. you'd think that, internally for sony's execs and shareholders, the entire point of knocking the login requirement down to optional would be to sell games worldwide again. but nothing this company has done for the past year and a half has really made any sense. at this point, i'm fairly confident we won't see worldwide sales for their games return until they see a serious dip in their pc port revenue. great first party studios and games, terrible publisher."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"the requirements seem on the high side for a ps4 game with minor enhancements. but it is a high end console game, so its probably better optimized for that platform."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,my pc don't need to be ready for tlou2
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i have 3080ti and will use optiscaler frame gen mod to utilise dlss upscaling with fsr frame generation. have been waiting for this one to drop on pc, as enjoyed part 1 on ps4 pro and then switched back to pc gaming after a decade or so. gonna enjoy playing 4k, 47y me."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"this is the same as tloup1. that game also doesn't have dlss fg, only fsr fg. sighs"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,the new aaa games trend reduce player base with ultra high hardware requeriments. brainless as always. they are lost at a rendering terminal. next move 200 games with expiration time.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"this version is 'optimized for' upscaling and frame generation  what in the marketing blurb is this nonsense? you don't optimize for them, you resort to them when you fail at optimizing."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"diversifying your content output maintains a diverse audience. i used to watch your gpu news but ive switched to watching these benchmarks and system requirements, even for games i dont care for."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"what is there to question my man? amd payed naughty dog to have exclusive amd framegen, it is as bright as the sun in a sunny day."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,"super hyped for this release! i played the first tlou on ps3 but haven't tried or seen anything from the second game. hopefully, this launch goes better than the first port! the system requirements dont seem extremely crazy, so thats good. keep up the great content!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,ellie swear to me. swear to me that you guys will not kill my pc! naughty dog devs we swear. ... ellie okay...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,rtx 3070 for 1440p 60fps sounds very promising
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,this game is just an interactive movie. just watch a playthrough and save your wallet
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i don't agree putting the blame on the game studio for leaving certain upscaling or frame generation technologies out. they're all proprietary and all require extra work to include. dlss fg missing is no different than xess entirely missing for example. upscaling and frame generation should be moved to the graphics api dx12, vulkan in a standardized manner so games can just implement that once and it'll work with whatever upscalers the hardwaredrivers support."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i think theres always going to be more interest in benchmark videos vs system reqs for a given game, mostly because people buy gpus based on actual performance, not sys reqs."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"cool and all but main key will be if its optimized or as bad as first port, it took almost a year for it to be playable with all the patches, really hope it runs at least as good as last of us part 1 now on pc btw im glad my rx 6800 non xt is mentioned in 1440 p 60 fps, that means with some adjustement to settings like using benchmark king settings that he does its possible to go for 4k fsr quality and target 60 fps, nice."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,couldn't pay me to play this slop.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,would be interesting to see the benchmark from the standpoint of fsr4 on vs off.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,1550 weird they didn't use a 4070ti super which is closer to the 7900xt.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"are you actually going to play the game? or just install it, test settings and frame rates and then use the results to determine which upgrades you want to do."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"hey daniel, take a look at the feature notes of the latest nvidia driver. it says support for dlss4 and multi framegen. maybe its only available via override, so naughty do doesn't mention it?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,inflation is everywhere even in game specs ffs
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,the port to pc for us  part 2 the video game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,my pc is ready for anything. is nd ready for me not buying it?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,the low preset is aligned pretty well on a steam deck. if it turns out to be accurate that's good news for deck owners
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,i'm afraid that the 8gb of the 3070 will be a big limitation for 1440p
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,love how my 11700 is still considered highend
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"about upscaling, in tlou part 1 pc system requirements, there is fsr above 7900xt for the 4k 60 fps so probably no need to use upscalers this time and i saw on reddit, don't know if it's true, the dev used tlou part 2 assets for the part 1 pc version so maybe they finally optimized better this time"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,i don't trust system requirement charts anymore because 90 of games require upscaling andor frame generation and a lot of those games don't specify in their requirement charts that those features are required to hit the suggested performance.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,love to see good optimization. nixxes studios are well known for optimizing games. its the same studio that made ghost of tsushima.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,i bet the ps4 version runs smoother than the pc version. hell ive even seen it where the pc ports on console run way smoother.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"badly optimized games are the new normal. imagine games that would use hardware as good, as they do with the ps5 which is in comparison much weaker compared to new midrange hardware."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,how much upscaling and framegen is included in those reqs? d
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"we are not going to know the level of optimisation that this game is given until it comes out as an older edit this was a ps5 not ps4 exclusive that is getting ported to pc. this looks ok specswise, but we all know the story around the game, which did put a lot of fans off the game , but to be fair, some fans did like direction of the story but i got to say this one not for me."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,off topic are msi 5099s recalled?? i just had newegg recalled my msi 5090 trio that i got lucky to order. was recalled by newegg after it was shipped but before delivery. sucks
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"the developers did a good job, the creative director actively worked against them with his weird fantasies."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,i'm surprised by the low cpu requirements. especially since the previous one did hit the cpu a lot. let's hope.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,the real question here is why aren't they adding dlss 4?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,1814 why did you stop there danny 00
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,i cant wait for the mods
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,a remaster? already? part 2 feels like it came out so recently for ps5?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,i don't mind the specs i just wish storage sizes weren't so big
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"but on the latest nvidia driver notes it mentions dlss multi frame gen, strange"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,thanks for that daniel
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,hope it'll be a good port. and do a benchmark on the game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"naughty dog, used to be a good dev but they've done the same thing as other devs since they're riding the trend of course. which is that the devs now don't optimize their games properly and they don't get enough or any qa testers to test the game. since they know that people will still buy the game and it's a winwin for them save up on hiring testers while milking the consumer who's testing the game and paying for it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i'm sceptical with this release. i mean it's a game meant for ps4, ps5 version has no graphical upgrades just frame rate increase ps5 runs 1440p, 60fps, ps4 1080p 30fps, with identical settings. yet the pc version needs gpu that is 2x more powerful than ps4's gpu for 720p 30fps, and rtx 3060 can only play at 1080p to hit 60? maybe they are doing something unnecessary under the hood, you basically need more gpu power than consoles did, almost a tier above."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,at this point naughtydog is just an industry plant. this game doesn't need no remaster
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,benchmark please
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"3080ti owner and im tired of pc gaming with poor ports, was thinking about getting an upgrade but nah, almosr getting a ps5 pro and calling it a day."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,im surprised theyre not adding dlss4 support
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,it damn well better be. i just installed a 5080 last night.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,will be well optimized at launch? lets hope
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,i'm currently stuck with a 5yo 6900xt in a brand new highend am5 system build. the gpu market is complete insanity! i am seeing a nice boost to fps with the old card on the new mainboard and 9800x3d upgrade.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,all games forward are gonna use frame generation. get used to it bro.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,i'm seeing another game that says quad cores are minimum 30fps and 6 cores recommended for 60fps. i wonder if this this is due to threading or simply that the 6 cores are typically faster.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,how many times are they gonna release the same damn two videogames???
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,we all know what happened when lou part 1 got ported to pc
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i'll admit, i'm curious to see if they fixed that stupid vram allocation thing from tlou1  the main reason why we know the ps5's os uses as much ram as it does was they didn't remove the vram allocation for the pc version, and it just ate your vram while giving nothing in exchange xdxdxd"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i was gonna say fair, but then i thought this was about part 3, and i'm not even high"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,the first one had a high load on the cpu so i'm fully expecting the same for this.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i thought they announced support for nvidia multiframe gen along with dlss 4, no?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"considering how good this game looks, i think its a no brainer. plus it would be good to see another dlss 4 vs fsr 4 comparison. 9070xt vs 5070ti would be awesome"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,please benchmark
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,i hope you benchmark this game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i don't play games at max settings, usually find some videos about optimizing graphic settings. it can make lot of framerate difference like 30."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i hope they don't do what they did on part 1 where you could only use fg with fsr enabled and not dlss, really weird decision and from the wording here it sounds like it might be the case. i had to use a mod to use dlss  fg"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,cant wait to play with lowest settings at 720p
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,hello sir please cover the assassins creed shadows in different nvidia and amd gpus . thanks
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"ah yes, deep learning super resolution 3.0 super resolution."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"if i was a game dev, i would personally also focus on fsr frame gen before anything with dlss. the quality is good, and you can use it on all brands. so why would i spend the time and money on dlss frame gen? upscaling is another talk, as i think both have their use, although i would also first focus on fsr. everyone being able to use it, would be more important to me, than a specific percentage of people having better quality, and others don't have anything, even if it is as big as nvidia, because it helps highend stuff like igpu  handheld as well unlike dlss but that is just my personal opinion"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"benchmark, please."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,benchmarking this game i think is a must. the last of us 1 is on a lot of gpus reviewscomparison so 100 this one will replace it.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,why are they remastering it? it came out not long ago
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,my pc is so ready to skip this slop.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"does my pc have to be ready for something i'd never touch in my life? if so, well, it's ready anyways. ready to ignore this piece of ."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,nvidia really kicked the 3070 in the nuts with that 8gb vram .. it really needed 12gb.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,my 4080 needed frame gen to run the first one at 4k 60
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i've got 9800x3d, 64 gb dddr5 and a 9070 xt... but the most important factor for why my pc is ready for tlou2 is.... is having no plans to install it all."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,i just hope that tlou2 runs reasonably smoothly without a million bugs like the pc port of the first game had. that game's been out 2 years and is still buggy as hell.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"thats actually, quite reasonable. the ps5 power is roughly analog to the rx 6700xt so recommending a 6800 for 1440p60 is pretty good."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"i'm surprised there's no uproar about all the new sony pc games still requiring psn which blocks them from being available in many countries, including mine."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,"the real question is why would you even care to prepare for it? it's last of us by name, that's it..."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,from what im seeing im right in between recommended and high. hopefully my 3060 ti will be able to run 1440p dlss 4 with a mix of medium and high maybe very high settings. if not ill be sad and mad

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-31,abby made a goddamn demon out of ellie
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-04,coldest edit i've ever seen.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-23,"bro as soon as changed in to ellie saying, im gonna find i had shivers running down my spine"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-01,"ellie is not the type of person who would hunt and kill someone and their friends, that's how u know how much joel meant to her, abby seriously ruined her"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-31,you forgot the part where ellie literally spares the person that killed her father.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-18,this gives off the same energy as bearded rick with the red machete.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-17,an army to kill one person vs 1 person killing an army

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-01,ellie took her revenge. abby spared ellie but killed the person she loved the most . ellie killed everyone abby knew
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-11,bro dropped the hardest ellie and thought we wouldn't notice
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-20,ellie and john had a same reason for revenge but john actually killed micah
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-26,every single video on the channel is an edit on tlou but each one is perfect
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-01,"joel killing abby's dad, abby killing joel, ellie killing abby's friends and not abby"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-02,giving them death would be a greater gift then leaving them to live unknown
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-15,the quality is better than my eyes
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-31,one of the best edit !!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-31,every last moth. but she let abby alive
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-11,joel got that glenn treatment
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-17,nothing is more satisfying than getting your revenge
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-31,ellie was not having it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-26,i just wish people would understand her not killing abby was worse than death. this is because she lost all of her friends and has no one.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-03,"then ellie, after losing literally everything, including her home, father figure. wife and kid, and even her fingers, let's abby live, as they sail off to the sunset happily ever after even though they were the first to take revenge, as ellie, who didn't even want to go after in the first place, it now a shell of a person.... and all of this, to tell a story, that is basically revenge is bad but not when the new side character does it"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-27,"this reminded me of glenns death in the waking dead! when rick says hes going to kill negan, not today, not tomorrow but im gonna kill you! and then season 8, rick had a chance to kill negan. but chooses to save him because of what carl said! reminds me a lot of the last of us 2 ending!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-31,"it didnt work for me. i think if you build up a character arc thats so devoted to getting revenge and then at the very last moment change that motive, it falls flat. i didnt want to let abby live. i dont think anyone really wanted to let abby live. if we are supposed to be playing with ellie and understanding her motives then her choices should mirror what we want to do. the first game had us save ellie and even though we knew deep down it was wrong we wanted to do it anyway. we were completely invested in joels motive to commit those murders to save her. as ellie in part two we wanted revenge, we understood the cycle of revenge, we didnt need it rubbed in our faces. let us do the bad thing. its what the games were originally about. convincing us that love forces our hand."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-20,revenge is a fools game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-01,dude you're the best at edits dude keep it up
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-09,wow that girl sure must be distraught at the loss of her friend! i sure hope this character does not end the lives of all the evil crew members but spare the one who actually ended the friend because she believes that revenge is bad and inhuman.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-16,"revenge is not a valid motive its an emotional response, not vengeance punishment frank castle the punisher"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-01,i hope tlou 3 actually lets us kill abby if shes in it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-10,this edit gives me chills all over my body

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-25,she didnt just kill joel. she lit a fire that could not be put out within ellie
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-03,abby never should let ellie go as i always say. leave no witness.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-25,"people mad that ellie spared abby when she literally ruined abby's life, just as she did. she was making her feel the same pain"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-26,"i love how ellies revenge was about not killing abby, but by torturing her with the guilt of the death of her friends, and joel."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-22,"ellie's revenge was on another level, abby and her friends basically asked for the rath that was coming for em"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-17,"i begged you to stop, abby you brought this on yourself"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-08,"ellie got to abbie and realized that actually the game devs were the real monsters, they wrote joel's death in a way where it was just about the most avoidable thing possible. abby, ellie, and really, all of us who had to deal with dis shit, are all the real victims"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-22,dont forget how tommy helped too! amazing edit btw
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-04,y'all keep forgetting that joel killed abby's father and prevented the world from getting a cure. the whole point of the game is that an eye for an eye makes the world blind. it's good that in the end ellie spares abby and vice versa.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-04,"imagine a universe where abby killed ellie and we play with joel in search of revenge, would joel forgive abby in the end?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-18,im gonna kill every last one of them except for abby because of  sht story writing
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-21,that girl tooked you will regret this to a whole another level

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-03,i remind you that joel started all of this....don't get me wrong joel is my favourite character
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-30,"for those people who are saying they were very disappointed because ellie ended up not killing abby. well thats kinda the whole point of the game. ellie realizing her mistake and that killing her wouldnt bring joel back. she just wanted closure, she thought that if she killed abby it would have given her the satisfaction and stop her trauma. but it didntand her worst fear became reality. being alone."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-07,"if i loose,you loose too."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-12,"i'm so upset that they released this game for pc gamers in such a terrible state. shame on sony. after all, this game is an event, a celebration and they ruined it. and people have been screwed over so badly. i hope they fix the game promptly. and more people will be able to touch the beautiful."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,10 years later and still a masterpiece .
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,i truly hope it sells well on pc. one of the greatest games ever made.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,"do not buy, the game is completely unplayable because of crashes, terrible optimization even on high specs . and its just another terrible pc port . don't buy until it's fixed if it even does get fixed"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-30,"nice that its finally on pc, but sad that the port is absolutely terrible. lets hope that the devs are working on it with priority."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,"man seeing this again makes me see how the creators of hbo made it look almost identical. this game is definitely in my top 5 ever! together with rdr2, uncharted iv, witcher 3 and gtaiv."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,i am letting everyone know the port is absolute dogshit and the port devs are the same ones that did uncharted which had issues at launch and arkham knight aka the best port for pc
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-31,"it has more graphics improvements than part 2 remastered, sony"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-31,wow the trailer of earlyaccess. hope we can play it 6 month from now.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-03,love the characters. can't wait to see what they do with them in the sequel.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,i feel like this game is being released every month
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,surreal to finally see this on pc. can't wait to see what the modding community does with this.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,check steam reviews before buying people....its a hot mess right now
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,ive bought this game 3 times now. cant wait to buy it again on ps6
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,"do not buy the game on pc, it runs horrible even on high end pc's, it's the worst pc port ever, worse than arkham knight for those who remember  it is ported by the same studio  iron galaxy."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,"bad port to an amazing game, dont buy it until it gets bettersale or just get it another way"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,"after all these years, finally i get to play this masterpiece. don't stop here, bring us part ii as well!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,this brings a tear to my eye.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,we can finally watch shaders building in 4k 60 fps
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-19,why are we still here? just to suffer? we all know where this ends
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-21,loved it on pc!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,"33 on steam, nicely done. i heard these same devs did the arkham knight pc port, which was removed from steam for quite a while. why would sony hand over one of their most prized franchises to these guys, i've no idea."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,definitely one of the greatest games i have ever played!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,"literaly on my top 3 best game ,after rdr21 and witcher 32 then tlou13 anyway these 3 games are masterpiece."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,the music gave me goosebumps and the new graphics look amazing
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,i've bought my playstation 4 to play this unbelievable game. sony makes a great mistake with it's new exclusive politics
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,"guys, its a flop. horrible optimization"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,33 score on steam. blunder of the year.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-01,imagine implementing direct storage for pc so you don't have to wait 10 years for shaders to build and don't need to pump all data into your gpu vram. sony is so lazy.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,a masterpiece.. that will always be a masterpiece
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,thanks for the early access. so will this be a functional game in the next 10 years?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,game is a masterpiece but very poorly optimized on pc
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,if you can't optimise a game like this on pc is really a shame
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,100 shaders compilation of 100
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,"pc gamers beware this port is messed up and mouse input again is broken. it s the same incredible incompetent studio iron galaxy behind uncharted port, which they also messed up the mouse input and never fixed it. thank you very much sony for giving 2 of my fav ips to the most incompetent studio possible. don t buy it if you wanna play it with mouse  keyboard, the default input device of the pc this port is made for."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,i could hear how they would edit the music before i even clicked play
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,what a joke of a pc port you sold to your fans.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-07,"someone said after 10 years finally i can play this game, but i just bought and downloading , so after 11 years finally gonna play this game"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,"i have an 2060 super, i5 10400f and 16gb ram and it runs like if i had a pentium..."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,noice. now release part 2 as well on pc.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,we get it! you're releasing it again!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-06,"you still have time, remove it from the stores. fix it and re launch in a few months."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-14,cant wait for part 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,buggy mess on pc poor port and poor optimization.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,crazy they made a game based on the show
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,wow a trailer trailer. can't wait for the trailer
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,use me as the i have xbox and cant afford pc or playstation but love watching this game on youtube button
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,"the last of us is what got me into playstation in the first place, and bought a ps4 just to replay remastered, figuring sony would never publish to pc. thank the lord i was wrong all these years later! what a dream to finally come true!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,pov you're early but nobody cares
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-07,now release part 2 i wanna play it so bad cuz all the new mechanics
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,excited to play this as i only game on pc and have never played it before.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,1 day gone and its still building shaders
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,the ultra wide support is nuts. why sony releasing better pc ports than pc exclusives..?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,10 years later.. finally
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,"from a only pc user, thank you."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,next i need part 2 coming to pc
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,why am i still seeing tlou1 new trailer after 10 years?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,the last of... your ram...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,the last of our money for same game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,"thank you, sony. i hope that the second part will be released on the pc"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,such a bad pc port  ... so badly optimised
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,por fin! lleg el videojuego basado en la serie que termin hace poco en hbo!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,naughty dogs  rockstar ... they raised the bar too high
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-19,"great when is part 2 coming, just finished part 1 on pc"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,and so the wait begins
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,it's interesting how the pc visuals will compare to the ps5 visuals in this game! p.s. finally a video longer than 15 seconds!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,news flash guy's! sony phoned in this pc port! unfortunately it's pretty bad!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,"i am ready to see some crazy mods , let's go !!!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,cant wait for niko belic and claire red field to be fighting teletubbies
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,"is it possible to artificially increase the amount of required vram? because, this game in its current state is pulling 15500 of vram in full hd"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-10,the low enviroment textures look so bad yet it consumes so much vram..its like they deliberately made the game this way to push people into buying new cards.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,"sorry sony, but i no longer need to buy a playstation."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,sony stop milking this franchise and realease some new titles already
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-30,cool. now fix the optimization issues. why is it cpu bound?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,after 10 years of waiting
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,srekli oyundan atyor rtx 3060 orta seviyede bile oynayamyorum . umarm bir gncelleme gelir
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,the only bad thing about this remake is there's still no factions multiplayer mode from the original and remastered versions of the game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-11,"never played the game, but just watched the tv series epic, what an awesome job. i am now going to download the game, 10 years late........."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,i just had to restart my game since it wasn't allowing me to sprint
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,they really should have the ported the original version it has a way better art style and atmosphere
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,best version on pc 20132023... this is win
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,no one goes this indepth. thats why youre the best in the business. awesome video.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"that enemy ai section at 3949 is pure comedy gold, i absolutely love it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-12,"2150 i like how when the gas station explodes, the scenes whole color palette changes within an instant, making everything look so much more dramatic"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"i watched the whole 50 mins in one go without checking once how much time is left, that's how good that comparison was, incredible work john showcasing such an incredible game, thank you."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,digital foundry is absolutely unparalleled when it comes to content like this. awesome work guys
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"the amount of effort john puts into his videos is highly commendable, what a legend"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"geez, imagine how much time it takes to make these comparisons. thanks for your great work and effort digital foundry team."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"the lighting comparison starting at 1313 made me say wow out loud. gorgeous lighting improvement there! nice work as always, df."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-10,im so glad i got to play the last of us part 1 for the first time ever on the ps5. it was an amazing experience.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"50 minutes!! now this is a thorough tech review, very professional!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"that character replacement at 1355 got me weirdly excited. i remember replaying the original game 4 times, and after my first playthrough i couldn't get over the fact that the character model used in the original is just a generic enemy ai skin. you kill dozens of guys that look exactly like that guy. the replacement actually looks like an individual now, and not a clone."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-18,"i still can't believe how this game looks. i'm a sucker for beautiful visuals in games, and so this remake, making my favorite game of all time look like this is everything to me. i'm never not absolutely blown away by the detail and realism in every environment and cutscene. i'm so glad to have a video like this one that'll go this indepth on the visuals here and how incredible they are. this game is an absolute marvel."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,that was thorough! it looks amazing and well worth a replay. im just gonna wait for it to drop in price a little first.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"i literally watched 50 min non stop, got so immersed in the analysis. great job as always df. the game looks absolutely incredible."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"i feel really bad for the people at naughty dog after watching this. when first revealed, a big part of the internet didn't see the difference between this and the original. games always look better in your head, especially ones that looked great at the time. but this definitely is a huge step up from the original. so much work went into this, even an absurd amount at points if you ask me like with most of their games. hopefully this video helps showing the actual work that went into this project and get the love and credit it deserves. it must be heartbreaking for the team to see the negative reactions at first, knowing the passion that actually went into making this."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,those metal gear solidesque sound effects for the text popins really had me going
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,when it's compared like this you really can see the work put in. all those people saying it's upscale resused is nuts...there's some serious evidence here that hard work went into making this as close as possible to a current gen game. very impressive. i think i will pick up a copy now. thanks df!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,mindblowing how much work they've put into this remake. it's like if all assets are remodelled completely.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"your content is absolutely top level. it is on a level of detail that fills my gaming soul. i've been a gamer since 1988 and your videos almost interest me more than the current level of releases. i thank you from the bottom of my heart. i have just started programming and making games on unity at nearly 40yrs old. i hope i make a game with enough impact this channel critic's it....live life hard,and dream big.....xxxx"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,i think a lot of people have rose coloured glasses on when thinking back on last of us 1. these comparisons show the crazy amount of work that has been put in. especially the character models look amazing
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"you guys are the absolute best, going through just about every single detail with explanation behind it. you can tell a lot of love went into this remake, weve seen remasters and ports, and even remakes that are just lazily done, but this is some absolute top shelf work from naughty dog"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,amazing looking game... sometimes we just have to step back and marvel at how far video game presentation has come
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,4628 the world itself feels more reactive i see what you're up to john
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"amazing, thank you for helping people appreciate all these details that mustve taken ages for the team to create. the most attention to detail ive ever seen in a game"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,honestly i always use your reviews to help make a decision. i was really unsure about buying this but you have made my mind up. extensive and informative. excellent and professional review. thanks john and everyone at digiatl foundry
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,thanks for saving me 70 says the internet 2 minutes after a 50 minute video has been uploaded..
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"i find it incredible how much john goes into detail with his analysis. when the vast majority of the people will say looks better, but not worth 70 it's all subjective. it's stupid expensive for again the same game but his analysis made me want to get it when it drops to40 100"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,a very good demonstration of what can be achived with effort without using raytracing. probably the same result with raytracing would cost a lot of performance without significant noticable changes in visual quality.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"at 4607 he was stunned not by the leg shot but by the ai throwing a brick at him, giving the prompt. pretty cool they added that for the remake. amazing video as always!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"while you can debate if they shouldve included the action mechanics of part 2 in any degree, you cant deny the work especially in visuals that they put in. from that perspective, it really is from the ground up and the improvements are absolutely insane. your channel did an excellent job covering it all!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,insane game came out less than 10 years ago. this much tech upgrade in a decade. granted 2013 from 2003 was a crazy jump too. imagine 2032 graphics!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"wow! the game really does look fantastic. thank you, john, for the extensive coverage. i always enjoy watching your videos but this is easily your best yet in terms of offering detailed comparisons etc."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,love df's unmatched attention to detail. bravo john.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,it's funny. they improved the characters greatly but my brain is still like ''that's not tess''. as if like actors being replaced by someone else in a tv series. very impressive none the less and i hope new comers enjoy the game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-20,"i'd love to see get uncharted 1, 2 and 3 get this treatment."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"if they watched this, you definitely made some devs day by pointing out that mirror placement revealing an enemy ambush. i'm almost certain that was an idea someone thought would be super cool! great find!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-16,"for me, this is one of the top 5 greatest games of all time. it will be hard for any to dethrone it!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"regardless of how stunning they can make it look, the last of us on the very last days of the ps3's life cycle was outstanding and nothing can ever compare to how it hit the first time playing it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-14,a lot of criticism for remakes in general but i just played this and thought it felt like a new game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"that 3d audio test was pretty amazing. i've been missing my 5.1 system after moving to a smaller place, definitely need to look into 3d audio more especially since i've got some nice headphones i rarely use."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,this video is so in depth in showing the amount of work that has gone into this that i believe naughty dog should use it to market the game as most people can barely see an upgrade whereas john is here to give it df analysis to truly appreciate and outline the differences
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-08,"i am stunned that tlou even ran on a ps3 back in 2013, it really pushed the console as far as it could possibly go. on 512mb of ram? ridiculous, lol. definitely should've been a ps4 release first, but i'm still glad it came out when it did, because i've literally only played it once and that was a very personal doneinonesitting playthrough that i still think about nearly 10yrs later. but this remake? holy cordyceps shit! so many things redone from the groundup. people think the team just pressed a make things look nicer button and called it a day......nope!!!!! they redid all the character models, the facial animations, the 3d mix, the environmental changes, realtime changes to all the lighting, items, animations, it's absolute madness that they managed to work on this while dealing with the last leg of crunch on tlou2. probably gonna get emotional playing this again, but screw. it, it's gonna happen xd"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"i want to say that soft shadows on the ps3 was probably something no other ps3 game did, and they looked quite believable too, despite the directionality issue in some places. honestly, there weren't even many ps4 games that did soft shadows generated by more ambientdiffuse light sources, which makes it even more impressive."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,honestly im amazed every time i see the ps3 version. its amazing the quality and capabilities the ps3 had in this and many other games.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"this video really changed my mind. i love this game but really thought this was only for new players that are new to ps with the ps5. but this is a remake, the quality is insane. not every remake needs to do the radical changes that re does. this is jawdropping and all the youtubers saying its just graphical are severely underselling this. i still might wait to get a pre owner copy or for a sale, but that is because the heaps of new games coming out in the next few months lucky owner of the ragnarok jotnar edition here, and i am craving callisto as well. this game deserves to be engraved with every new generation, this storytelling only comes around every few years. this one is special and deserves to keep its relevancy, nd has done a magnificent job at making sure it doesnt get surpassed by the new gen of gamers that will scoff at low resolutions."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"the work put into this video is incredible, thank you!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,digital foundry is without a doubt the best gaming channel on youtube.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"its not just the level of detail this video goes into its the sheer amount of knowledge the commentator has on in the inner workings of light, shadows, particles and so much more. cant wait for the comparison video for the ps5 and pc version of the game when it drops."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,this might be one of the few games i'll voluntarily play in fidelity mode. the options for 40 fps and vrr at native 4k are gamechanging.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,this masterpiece deserved the new look. amazing tech review btw.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-23,tlou 1  2 are some of my favorite games of all time. nothing replaces that first time you finish part 1. i aint payin 70 for the ps5 version but i am totally getting it on sale.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,always appreciate john's taste in music. kind of hoped for silent hill soundtrack for a video like this and wasn't disappointed.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"the facial expressions and shininess of the eyes is pretty amazing, i'm trying really hard not to fork up the 70 for a game i've played a few times already before it goes on sale but it's hard the more things i watch."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"damn, hearing john talking like this for an hour makes me think that light is something you could literally drink and consume... also having having the silent hill ost frequently running in the background is a big plus!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,john you are a treasure to the gaming community
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"i really want to see how this looks on pc, it already looks so amazing on ps5"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,the ps5 is way more impressive and amazing than i thought. i never would have appreciated the differences unless you went over this. incredible!..
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,i can't imagine being a devdesignerqa and seeing my work evaluated with so much detail... congratulations for being on the top naughty dog
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"for those that have not experienced this game, it is worth every penny, for 'the rest of us' it should be in the 3040 range before double or triple dipping."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,what a fantastic analysis. i am consistently impressed by the attention to detail john puts into his videos. not to mention the editing quality and the fact that he is one of the only people who actually mentions sound in his reviews.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,amazing job on the analysis! this makes me appreciate even more for all the hard work of the people coming together and orchestrating such a detailed environment and story mixed with gameplay.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,i seriously cannot wait to play this. it just looks so good. my first time playing this game was on a horrible lcd tv with the ps3. i have not played though the entire game in several years and since this announcement avoided playing it.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-10,"this remake is for new players to introduce tlou world. all ps5 first timers or ps first timers, would be massive for such immersive experience for players"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-07,and people will still say it looks the same
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"outstanding work, john. one of the best so far. your eye for detail is truly one of a kind."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-30,1338 actually made me say woah out loud. that is an immense improvement!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"man. once again, digital foundry goes above and beyond and proves that they're in a league of their own. magnificent video, guys! must have taken hundreds of hours to create this."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"for ps 6 not only sharper in 8k, you can literally smell joel"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-10-01,bill looks more like the actual actor in the remake
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"another brilliant video john, this must have taken ages to create and edit, astonishing how graphical techniques have improved since the original release. luckily managed to snag a copy in the end for 45 so looking forward to diving back into this amazing game again."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,the audio comparison was awesome and really helpful to determinate the quality of the implemented 3d audio!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-25,3407 they added particles for the trickling water in part 1! i like to think that you're the reason they added back the effect.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"the difference really is dramatic visually. wow. so impressive. as a huge fan of the game im so glad to have this modernised version. it looks far more emotionally impactful, and the game hardly lacked that already. i preordered it and sure i wish it was cheaper, but im happy to support this studio and this franchise with my money to be perfectly honest. if people want to wait for it to be cheaper i respect that, or if they think its not worth it at all then thats up to them. but im very glad this exists."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,it's crazy. after watching this video i didn't know how old the original one looks... and even if it holds up there are some features that look vastly different... i still like the classic younger models better though... but side by side this are day and night. can't wait to play this one on the weekend.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"i love the improvements nd did in the remake that most won't even notice until watching this video. df has yet again did a great job, great vid, thank you. they put a lot into this game, and i think the price tag is warranted."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"you clearly put alot of time and work into this video, much appreciated! i personally don't care about review scores or other people's opinions, and i was also quite happy with tlou remastered, but after seeing this incredibly indepth and detailed comparison i'll definitely be buying this. such an incredible upgrade and such an incredible comparison video!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"when people say it looks the same, they need to sit down and watch this video. you all are the very best at this stuff, the attention to detail is amazing. love the video."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,1651 squirrel on a telephone wire. top right.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"the only thing the game needed, imo.. is factions remake yes i know they're making a standalone game which is apparently huge but to tide us over till then with a factions remake would have been great.. secondly a dodge mechanic.. not to fussed about prone for this game though it was amazing in tlou2.. but dodge was essential for me, especially with the improved ai, and maybe the overall melee combat like tlou2 would have been nice. but looks like a gorgeous game."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,cant wait playing this game on about 8 hours. cant wait to see all the hard work they put into this looks amazing
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"been playing the game and periodically loading up remastered, and wow. just wow. its incredibly cool to see them side by side. there are massive changes in every aspect. some environments have an enormous amount of new detail added in. im actually not disappointed with my purchase. although 4050 has a nicer ring to it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,if they would've bundled this with a ps5 native version of last of us part 2 perhaps with dual sense features then the 70 usd asking price would've been worth it.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"wow, big difference in the audio! the 3d audio of the ps5 has been more impressive then the visual upgrade so far in my opinion. especially returnal had great audio and haptic feedback, you could really pinpoint enemies by sound even above or below. should be awesome with the upcoming psvr2 as well!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-07,"one of the first things i noticed in the beginning, was that nd forgot to put wiper blade arms on tommy's jeep when joel was kicking out the windshield. that small detail was appreciated on the ps4 version."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,epic analysis john!  really enjoyed this deep dive into the beautiful changes this talented team have achieved. can't wait to experience this emotional piece of art once again
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"what a phenomenal comparison... absolutely stellar work, john"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-28,"infamous 2, resistance 3, infamous 1, ratchet and clank tools of destruction and socom 12 are all sony games that need a remake as well."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,amazing work john and the team.. love it!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-17,despite the original being one of my all time favorites i never even considered buying part 1 till your review. sony needs to hire you for marketing. it would be infinitely better for them then the pr disaster leading up to part 1's launch.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-11-19,"this game is proof that ray tracing isnt necessary in gaming, i guess if you're on a very tight time budget, but most games already have an option to switch to rasterized rendering anyways"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"this was the most perfectly paced breakdown video i've ever watched, i never checked the time once and was riveted start to finish. brilliant effort!!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"i'm very excited for the pc release of this. i played through this game countless times on the ps3 before switching to pc gaming in 2015, without ever having purchased another console since. i do wonder how well kbm controls will work for it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"i love the fact that you were able to take the time you wanted to develop this one! not the easiest format to approach, but definitely the most thorough choice ! the researcher that i am approves !!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"it's incredible what they have been able to accomplish in terms of improvement in the game's technical prowess. it's quite obvious the graphical improvements are substantial. even the flashlight lighting and reflection in the different environments create even more immersion into this world. god, this is awesome."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"100 grabbing the pc version when it releases, this looks freaking amazing also, fantastic video as usual!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-05,they added joel covering his head under flowing water in part 1.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,the difference is spectacular. character animations are probably the best we have seen so far. incredible.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"your videos are truly the pinnacle of video game journalism, my utmost respect!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,the analysis of the silly ai at 3949 made me lmao. i like how john says this kinda demonstrates what he means regarding the meme worthy ai of the original  . that whole scene was incredible
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"wow just wow! the comparison is incredibly good, nice job! sony, take my money!!!"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-11,she really turned into joel

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-03,i don't know how or why but i didn't have many issues with the pc version. actually ended up enjoying it. full game video 4k resolution ultra settings and no crashes somehow my pc 4090 rtx  amd 7950x
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-28,"in october 2024 i finished it for the first time and i enjoyed it. i played it on pc. the story of the game is great. i liked how joel and ellie didn't get along very well in the beginning, but over time they started to get used to each other until they became friends. the atmosphere of the game was good. i liked how the environment changes in the game, sometimes you are in the city, then in the nature, i also liked that the seasons change. graphically, the game looks nice. i liked the sounds and music. infected were interesting. there are a total of four types of infected. it's interesting how the infected changes. the first type of runner resembles a human. the first type runner resembles a human, while the fourth type bloater does not resemble a human, but rather a golem. i also liked the weapons and that could be upgraded later. as someone who likes to explore environments in games, i found a lot of things, thanks to which i could create something, for example, a health kit, then, for example, use pills to increase my health etc. there is so much i could write about this game. this game is amazing, one of my favorite games, it is all, have a nice day."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-04,"the opening is quite tough, a dramatically tense gut wrencher, i wonder what parents who played this on ps4, when it first released must have thought. but it set the tone, so to speak for what follows between joel and ellie. the only other game that i can think of, with something of a similar beginning, was the qte fest that was david cage's heavy rain now there is a game that could do with a remake!! and that was a very difficult opening scenario to open a game with."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-03,did enjoy the tv series pedro pascal was an excellent joel and the actress who voiced ellie made a brief camio
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-03,if you have an ultra high end pc then this game does seem to run within the bounds of acceptability taking the rig of a rich youtuber with a 4090 and believing that experience with translate to those with average pc's is unrealistic you should not buy this game on pc in it's current state. you are only rewarding a mediocre port job if you do

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"this looks insane, they even rebuilt the price"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,if it looks like this now imagine how much better the remake of the remake of the remaster of the original for the ps6 is going to look. can't wait.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,it definitely looks better but the price tag is pretty high despite this being one of if not my favorite video game of all time
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-13,"i'm sure a lot of people would think the behind the scenes of how these games are made is boring but as someone who is studying animation in college, i find it fascinating"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"being someone who loves gaming but is slowly going blind due to medical reasons, seeing developers put love and care into accessibility features almost brings me to tears and makes me feel hope for the future of gaming."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"its interesting they didnt include the gameplay elements within combat as they had in tlou part ii, i feel like that wouldve been a worthy inclusion and heightened the gameplay aspect of this remake. edit  i understand implementing these things could drastically change the technical aspect of the game itself, i am reiterating that these features perhaps could have made this game more engaging and exciting as we have all likely played through this game countless times, it would be a fresh take  so to speak. what do you all think about this?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,loved everything i saw here. can't wait to pick it up for 2030 sometime next year!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-13,best video game remake ever.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"a game released originally on the ps3, remastered and enhanced on ps4 with multiplayer still alive, and it is natively compatible on the ps5. visual upgrades, speedrun, permadeath, photomode features, realtime rendered cutscenes instead of prerendered from ps3 and no multiplayer doesn't make it up for 70 price."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,hefty price tag but the game looks incredible. i hope the gameplay and enemy ai is on par with how it was in tlou 2
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,my most anticipated 40 black friday purchase of all time!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-06,this is crazy! can't wait to get it on deals a year later!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"real talk, this is my favorite game of all time. countless memories and just love all around it. absolutely not paying 70 dollars for updated graphics. just not gonna happen"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"graphically it looks amazing and the accessibility features are an outstanding addition, for people that haven't played it is a must have, for the rest that price tag and the lack of part 2 gameplay mechanics might not be worth it. honestly i would have preferred a remake of uncharted 1, which is the one that looks outdated."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"i really want to play this, the improvements look absolutely incredible. but as a canadian, 90 tax 100 is pretty tremendous for me. i've bought the game twice on ps3 and ps4, and played it countless times already. but to do it again at an even higher price is a pretty big pill to swallow... usually i'd buy a game i want day one, but i might wait a bit this time... something tells me the price won't stay this high for too long."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-24,this looks absolutely incredible. cannot wait to reexperience this masterpiece on pc.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"as interesting as this all looks, i stand by the claim that uncharted drakes fortune would benefit most from a groundup remake like this. i know people who quit early in that game due to dated 2007 actionplatformer controls. perhaps we could see that in the future if this does well"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-23,looks awesome cant wait to play it in 4 years when i get my hands on a ps5
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"looks incredible. not worth 70 to me, personally, having bought it 2 times already... but, i'll pick it up on a 50 off sale or something."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-30,one of the greatest videogames ever. unreal journey with amazing soundtrack.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,game absolutely incredible looking price tag not so much
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"i'm really excited to play this game. years later, when it's either a more acceptable 20 or just given away in ps subs"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"imagine uncharted 2 among thieves, or any of the prethief's end installments getting this level of a remaster for ps5? man, that'd be the day '"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-07,so they didnt bother expanding the areas? adding more enemies? dogs? more weapons? i love this game to the core but for 70 dollars just making it pretty and run a little better doesnt seem enough
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,i will patiently and eagerly wait for this to go on sale. it looks really great but i simply cant justify spending 100 canadian on a game that i have played multiple times
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,this should be called damage control the trailer.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,looks great and i'll probably get it at some point. the price at release is just completely insane. this should not cost the same as tlou3 would have.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-29,"very impressive remaster of a remaster, ill buy it when it's on a heavy discount"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"cant wait to play this, at a heavily discounted price. no shade to the work they've done. i really am excited to play this but the price point is too high for something i've bought twice already."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,absolutely adore this game. completed it on ps3 and the remastered on ps4 countless times....but that price tag for the remastered remaster on ps5... wow!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"this looks amazing, but when you advertise the remake having the same level of gameplay as part ii, i think people expected to see similar crawling, jumping, or dodgingcounter mechanics instead of haptic feedback. hoping the next trailers clear this up."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-29,one of the most annoying things in the original was the fact that enemies didn't react to buddies and buddies would always take cover weirdly. it will be nice to see this highly improved bc it would always take me out of the experience.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,few things in gaming compare to the feeling i had when i finished this game in 2013. truly an all time classic.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,glad they are doing this work. looking forward to when it hits the 10 price point. i'll be a buyer.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,me wow this looks cool! what an upgrade! inner me remembering the generator scene nope i'm done with that nightmare
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-24,lou is becoming the gtav of single player games.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"as a disabled gamer, it warms my heart when i hear developers talk about accessibility features. for me the location navigation feature in tlou 2 was a real game changer for me, i truly wish every game had something like that"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-23,they have really done the work here. i do agree however that it is hard to want to buy this at full price.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"game looks great graphically, can't wait for it to go on sale and cost like 15 bucks because 70 bucks for a graphical mod ain't it chief."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-30,"as much as i love this game. i can't justify buying it a third time. should be free for previous owners, definitely not paying full price!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"this looks absolutely incredible visuals wise, but im definitely waiting for a sale. happy for people that have never played it tho"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,to me this showcase feels more like a price justification rather than simply showing how great the game is. ill be buying once the price lowers. like most people ive played on ps3 and ps4 so there is no rush
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-23,"aside from the ridiculous price, the game looks awesome."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-18,definitely a must play for anyone on ps that hasn't played it.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-23,"really looking forward to playing this again with improved graphics and gameplay, but itll be when its on sale , not paying 70 !!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"i dont have any disabilities, but all of the accessibility options are amazing and should be a staple for major aaa games"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,i am 100 behind these improvements and enhancements made to one of the best games playstation has published. i am also 100 against the 70 price tag as they're trying to sell the same game for us the 3rd time in 10 years. 40 as a brand new game or 10 to upgrade your existing copy should be a fair asking price. greed on display.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-26,love the audi description accessibility! such a huge step forward which can be overlooked quite easily
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"i really want to play this again, more than any other game i have played multiple times. the problem is the ps4 remastered version is 20 and is great. is this experience really worth 50 more for improvements? hard to justify."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,i am so jealous of the people who havent played this game and now get the chance to play the new and improved version of it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"definitely getting this, it looks amazing. but i can't pay 70 for this. it doesn't even have factions."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-26,i would have actually considered paying full price for this if they implemented the new gameplay and stealth mechanics from part 2 into the remake of part 1
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,as much as i appreciate everything they are doing with this game i just dont think i can pay 70 for thisthis is my favourite game of all time but im still torn. i really want it and i think every improvement theyve made is awesome. but im gonna have to wait for black fridaybecause for a game thats essentially not new i dont think 70 is appropriate.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"i would pay that for a new game, that needed to pay for writers, actors, environmental artists etc. that cost for a re skin feels crazy"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"this remasterremake looks beautiful, ill give them that, but not for 70. you could honestly play the original remastered version for ps4 on a ps5 at 4k 60. it has its own charm and looks amazing. save this for a super reduced sale."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-05,remember when everyone complained about gta 5 coming to next gen ? and they still ended up buying.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,if they add the dodge mechanic and give some more executioncombat animations then this rebuild would be an 1110 from me.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,if you guys didn't add the prone or dodge mechanics to the game why is factions removed??? 70 is way too much for this remastered 2.0
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,80 dollars for petting giraffes with vibrations babyyy
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-11-04,ps5 pro enhanced now!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"really wish they'd taken part 2's gameplay as well  the long grass, going prone, the bigger combatstealth areas, dogs etc."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"definitely will get this once on sale. if it had included the new game mechanics which were in part ii, i wouldve paid full price on release. having played this game multiple times, i dont need to rush only for a 4k new look."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"i think 40 would be a lot more reasonable. it does look impressive but, as others are saying, i've played it on ps3 and ps4."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-29,i cant say how much i appreciate the audio description as someone who works with visually impaired folks. i love it so much
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-23,"this game is an absolute masterpiece for sure, but i wont be buying this version unless it drops under 20. then i will consider buying it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,the game was always high fidelity in my memories
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"i appreciate all the hard work that was put into making this game, i mean clearly we see the passion behind enhancing this experience to its ultimate version. but all of that being said it doesnt not enable them to charge 70."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-24,i will buy it when its around 20! its a masterpiece and the new haptics and graphics are awesome. if i hadnt played it before i would probably pay the full price for a tlou game on ps5 and play it on release! i hope there is a part iii! thats gonna be fing fantastic with graphics and physics!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"i'll wait to buy it when it's 20 on sale before the hbo show releases so i can relive it again. it is cool how some games can eventually be remade, i wonder what the game will be like 20 years from now."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"as big a fan as i am, i'll be waiting until the price drops, whenever that happens. the combat mechanics don't seem to have changed that much  i was hoping for something more similar to tlou part ii, which unfortunately it doesn't seem to be. i'll still buy it eventually, just not anytime soon."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,i love how in depth this video is. really cool. still not forking over 70
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-27,these guys sound like used car salesmen trying to sell me a jalopy with a brand new paint job.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"funny how the devs only talked about the visual updates and nothing about important gameplay mechanics such as hiding in the grass and enemy tracking the player. i get the value and hardwork of just updating the graphics, but it doesn't really justify the price tag given that we already have a remastered version not that long ago."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,as much as i love this game imma wait for that price drop. to those who spend the money awesome enjoy the adventure its fantastic. buuuuuuuuut im solid lol.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"i appreciate the hard work the devs have put in for this game. everyone from the director, the artist for the environment, the artist for the characters, a.i. programers, and everyone in between. they've done a fantastic job to make this game feel like a modern release. but this isn't a new game. it's essentially an old game with a new coat of paint. most of us have played this game already. so, not only do i already not understand the point of making a remaster of a remastered game, but they're charging 70 for it? i'm sorry, but i can't support this. doesn't help that i still don't have a ps5 either."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-25,0747 i cant wait to play this masterpiece again
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,definitely getting this...when it's half price or free on ps deluxe. would love to replay this game again for the 10th time but not for 70. no matter how hard you try to sell it sony  nd
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"i am excited to replay, and it looks stunning. but i have to be honest, as my 3rd purchase of this game, i'll be waiting for it to be 40 max."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,definitely worth it for someone who has never played it because they were too young before or something but a ps3 game shouldnt be full price especially if its meant to be for people replaying the game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-24,89.99 for a remake is such a cash grab
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"if they remade the multiplayer and included other part 2 mechanics and features such as crawling, high grass, dogs, suppressors, updated animations, maybe even bigger levels to incorporate these features etc. then it might justify the price tag"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,game looks beautiful but i'm hoping for a future sale. i can't justify spending 70 on a game i already own for this upgrade but when it's cheaper i'll get it. i'm excited for anyone who hasn't played it already though. it's still such a great game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,70 for a remastered remaster is nuts! this game is one of if not my favorite games but 70 is ridiculous.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-29,"as an xbox gamer who's just switched to the ps5, i'm excited to try this game out finally."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"im think this remake looks beautiful and i appreciate everything nd has done to make this the best version of the game, but i must say im disappointed they werent able to incorporate the dodge or prone functions and animations into it. i feel like that would have really added to the modernization of the remake and helped justify the price point."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"this looks great, but for 70 we should be getting multiplayer included as well. ill wait for a sale."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,this game is amazing!!! i love it and will always cherish it!!! but 70 dollars nope.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-27,858 joels watch clips through his hand
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"it's funny how seeing the scenes sidebyside we can definitely notice the improvements, but when in motion it looks like exactly the same game. this is not really a criticism, but i think it's something that's a lot more interesting for those who haven't played the game in a long time, or at all."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,i am so excited for bill's town! it's still my favorite area of a video game ever. can't wait to see it and everything else when it releases!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,i have a feeling grounded mode will be a bit tougher in this rebuild than the original. which will add a breath of new life into the game when we go back to where it all began.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-14,the fact this game got remastered 2 times is just crazy
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"the price shouldve been 49.99 not 69.99 , this game is for sure my favorite game of all time , and ive beat it 4 times already, the price is way too much especially for a game thats not that old tbh"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,the different outfits appearing in cutscenes now because they happen in engine instead of being prerendered is a nice touch
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,literally my favorite game of all time  ive played it at least 10 times. im excited to play the remake but i can speak for majority of us when i say the price is a bit of a reach. at least eat 20 from the price and i think thatll be fair for most
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-30,imagine how far into a new game they could have gotten.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,"honestly the game looks incredible, and it's cool one of the best games of all time gets such a definitive edition. i still feel the price is too steep for me for a mostly visual remake, so ill wait for a discount."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,i've never seen so many people complain about a price of a game im on board with you guys 70 bucks for this game is insane i understand a lot of work went into it but i feel like 40 maybe 50 at release would be way more acceptable
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-22,definitely not paying 70 for a game i played already but soon as it goes on sale ill make sure to pick it up
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-07-26,i would 100 buy this if the multiplayer was added back at some point. i cannot financially justify 90 cad for a game i have bought twice already. please add back the multiplayer at some point down the line! there is still a community!

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-26,if i were joel i wouldve played along and it wouldve been an even more wholesome moment lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-17,"for those wondering how ellie knew about hotels, its most likely because of the book and stories she read similar to how she knew about gnomes."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-11,ellie love being sarcastic

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-07,i'm surprised that she even knew how to check in a hotel considering she probably never even step foot in one that is still in operation.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-22,is truly sad that abby and ellie never got to talk properly and had to live in a messed up world like this one... if only abby knew she became just like joel when killing ellie's adoptive parental figure...aka joel

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-18,lol. i said its weird to see a kind hearted girl turn into a cold hearted killer in the second game in the official discord server for the last of us. they banned me for racism and homophobia for it.  clowns
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-18,i just finish my first playthrough and man was it a blast with joel and ellie. ellie also has corny jokes in that area too courtesy of a book she found.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,"guys.. this is the same girl who brutally tortured a women, and killed dozens of men ruthlessly. give that a minute to sink in, just to how badly joels death and memories of his loving care for her messed her up."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-22,i like to pretend too i like to pretend that the 2nd game doesnt exist
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-10,the fact that i know how their future went on hurts my feeling..
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-25,cutie patootie that ever pookied pooked

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-08,ellie to joel youre a weird kid
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-04,"come on joel can you take a joke for a minute,"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-22,dang
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-09,"abby spared ellie twice, she deserved to be spared at the end... abby just killed the guy who killed her dad"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-22,how do you get this audio? ive played probably 20 times at this point and ive never gotten this?!?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-20,"smash, next"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-17,this is not the same girl as in tlou2
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-25,the zombies just hear clapping form upstairs.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,joel did something that every father around the world would do it exactly like him
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,maturity is realizing without joel ellie wouldn't even survive to be the cure outside boston. no matter how hopeless humanity is joel owes it nothing and considering how he lost sarah and how he grew close to ellie he had valid reason to not went through that hell once again and lost another daughter even if he has to sacrifice the whole humanity for it. what he did doesn't make him a good man but it made him a great father
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-31,jeol really did i would give up the world for you in actions. not in words.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-12,"this is why the last of us is so good, every action a character does can be explained but that doesn't make it justified."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-17,humanity lost its chance for a cure long before the virus.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,"abby and ellie were basically two sides of the same coin. they both wanted revenge, and it ruined both of their lives. abby getting revenge for her father cost the lives of all of her friends and in the end, she only had lev with her. for ellie, it ruined her life since her need for revenge made her lose dina and jj. i think she needed to face abby one last time and decide for herself if she wanted her to live or not, but because of that, her worst fear became true  she was alone."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-16,"you are a hero in your own story, but you'll always be a villain in someone else's."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-13,i can't say i'd have done different
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-18,"joel is that kind of villain who would end the whole world so the person he loves could survive, and i love that concept more than being a hero who'd sacrifice u for humanity"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-01,"people were sending death threats to abbys va. people dont understand that abby didnt intend to kill ellie, or her other friends, she was only avenging her father."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,its realizing that honestly joel and ellie basically became the antagonists
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-14,joel didn't end humanity's hope he saved a kid from getting murdered it's my perception as a parent
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-12,the hardest pill ive ever swallowed
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-13,"maturing is realizing humanity been ending themselves along with their own hope for a long time, joel chose the love of his daughter over the possibilities of the world. thats a wise decision in my opinion. people were already so cruel before the apocalypse but since it started people are changed from it and usually only respond to power and domination"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-12,"maturing is realizing that joel was completely right in a sentimental  logical way logically the fire flies are insane for wanting to kill the only known immune person after a few hrs of testing  distributing a cure was gonna be impossible, if they wanted to save the world they shouldve been making communities like jackson instead of killing ppl, maturing is realizing abby isnt a character shes a plot device to move the story along, she doesnt make decisions based on known character traits she just does shit the story needs, maturing is realizing that ellie was right to go back after abby, by that time she had already spent an entire year trying to overcome her grief in a positive way on the farm with dina  it wasnt working, ppl handle grief differently  there isnt a right way to do it"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,this is incredibly edited
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,it's so true. they all wanted these things and look what happened to them in the end. fire edit bro
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-03,he nor elli are responsible for anyones survival
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-19,"thats the beauty of this story. everyone has strong motives that are deeply understandable, so either all of them are right or theyre all wrong in their actions at the same time"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-13,maturing is realizing that joel did the right thing as a father figure. yes ellie was immune but there was also a 99 chance her dying wouldnt amount to anything. joel was right in every way to do what he did bc every single person with a damn heart would do the same even in this situation
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-08,once a legend said revenge is a fools game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-16,its the fact that no one in either game is a villain. no one at all. except david
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,joel's decisions are both cruel and human
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,i love your edits keep going
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-02,this game will always have a place in my heart my parents always said to me that games wont matter when im older and im older now and i still think about this game it is the best game ive ever played so that is why this game belongs with me
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,abby ruined ellie's life when she killed joel like that.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-14,cant wait for season 2 on hbo
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-03,he needed to save ellie its perfectly acceptable 3
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-12,w edit bro
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-18,"maturing is understanding that joel on some level deserved his fate, and that abby is no more evil than he was for what she did."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,"that's true, i wish ellie had a better life , i mean she deserves happiness and she was trying to forgive joel then they could be happy together"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-09,"i assure you, the cure would not help. sure the cordyceps is gone, but people still kill each other for no reason"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-12,hello i love your videos and i your new subscriber
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,"maturing is realising that even if ellie died for the greater good humanity would still have been doomed.  humans are still struggling against zombies, if they want the cure they should at least get ridcontrol the zombies otherwise they arent ready  if they can cure zombified people their bodies would be filled with fungus rotting so you cant cure an already infected person  during gameplay even ellie who is immune dies to zombies which comes back to reason 1 if they cant get rid of zombies they will always struggle  in original game it was stated that the cure had a 90 chance of failing so either case she would have died for nothing"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,whats the plugin fot the text effects? love it!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-16,maturing is realising the story of part 2 was wasted potential
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,how stupid a person should be to say something like that?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,legendary edit bro
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-03,"thats why i love this game series so much! people hate abby so much because they took joel away. but that hate they feel is what abby feels for joel, since he took away her father. this game is a heavy fatherdaughter duo and what they would do for each other when it comes down to it. its very human."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,"according to the game itself is said that multiple people immune just like ellie had been operated before her willingly btw and they could not extract a cure from it. so the chances of them making it work were close to none, and people that praise this game's writing seem to forget that fireflies were also a group of terrorists just like all others, how would they distribute the cure if they even managed to make one since they did not had resources that a lab to develop a cure needed to would they actually go into enemy territory and just offer them a cure, or would they use it as an advantage to take power upon every other group?! i think the answer is pretty clear, especially for a universe like that. only in tlou2 they made it look like everything would magically work if they had operated ellie because they needed this awful plot to work. and oh, let's also remember how marlene would just off someone for a greater good without even explaining to said person wth was even happening. great plot..."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-10,"despite everyone having their reasons for what they did, its just a lesson that your actions have consequences which is why even though abby was only avenging her father there was a cost. same with ellie ending up alone and joel losing his life."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-09,crazy how people still whine about joels death. he had it coming
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,the truth is even if they killed ellie there was a possibility that they still not find any cure but ellie would be dead so yeah
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,yall ever wonder what happened to bill? do you think he did in the show he killed him self or something else?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-04,it's so interesting to see how ellie and abby both turned out similar to the people they hated. ellie became like abby in her desperation for revenge. abby became like joel in her care for lev her silhouette on the beach while carrying lev to the shore even resembles joel when he was stealing ellie out of the hospital
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-02,respect
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,abby literally destroyed ellie's life in front of her that day and turned her into villain.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-24,bro listed the most obvious plot points
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,nah maturing is realizing how dumb the fireflies plan was
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-26,"joel did the right thing tho, the fireflies would just become politicians of the world"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,no spoiler alert bro
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-24,"i agree with every one except the last, because joel fully knew that if he killed her there would've been a cure, but he seen her as his daughter and he didn't want to lose another one. that's what every good father would do"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-17,"maturing is realizing that marlene didnt ask ellie if she wanted to go through with the surgery not because shes evil, but because she knew ellie very well and was terrified shed say no."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-04,the thing about abbys dad is that hes just a random un important npc that they turned into a plot device just to kill of joel for shock effect
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,i knew i liked ellie for a reason we have the same last name lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-19,i understood all this when playing
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-15,my one issue with the cure is you cannot make a vaccine for fungus infections. if you can its really difficult and you especially cannot make one with one sample of someone who is immune one mess up with that one sample and you no longer have any hope for a cure and ellies sacrifice is wasted.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-01,"the world took joel's daughter, joel took the world's possible salvation"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-01,i accept this wholeheartedly. it's just i wanted something else...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,the world was too far gone. there was no saving it no more
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-17,"instead of saving the world, joel saved his own."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-13,three wrongs never make a right. it showed for each of them.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-12,"abby is the most despisable, nonevil character i've ever had the joy of hating. she's brilliantly written, so damn impressive. the way the narrative actively gets you to loathe her through blind bias and hypocrisy is so crazy, especially on a first play through. it's a real tragedy that the live action adaptation seems to be tearing her character apart. the way they just... did away with her physique in la when it's realistically attainable is setting off alarm bells for me. she works because of the conflict in the player. they love joel and they play as ellie, so obviously they're gonna hate abby, but at the same time, she's so easy to empathize with  both for you and for ellie."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-12,"poor joel, he killed abbys father so ellie wouldent die, and he went for all that struggle, only for her to say she didnt want him to do that. he just didnt want to loose another daughter"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-14,"dude, after saving ellie my brain chemistry changed and i said to myself am i a good person?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-14,joel ended humanity's hope for a cure by saving his subordinate daughter and lied and when ellie asked him too. crazy
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-27,i have a crazy thought. what if joel not letting them get a cure is the reason why its called the last of us.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-14,"with society destroyed, groups fighting each other, and governments falling, even if joel had sacrificed ellie, the cure would have been useless."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-12,and ellie did it because he was like a father to her ...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-16,exactly!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-17,"i dont agree with the last one. there was several hints throughout the game that the fireflies had no idea what they were doing. and even if they did, you dont just kill your only hope for humanity. but i definitely agree with the first two."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-09,"abby dad was still messed up, he was okay with killing a child and he didnt want joel to save her."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-12,abby is the goat idc what no body says
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-23,honestly dont think they would've been able to make a widespread cure even if joel stepped in
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-14,"people dont understand the entirety of joels action. marlene was going to murder ellie, using a man that was a veterinarian, not a surgeon. there wasnt a guarantee for a cure either, it was a long shot that likely wouldnt have worked. on top of that, marlene didnt let joel see ellie before the procedure and was going to leave him stranded outside the hospital without the guns he was promised."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-17,for ellie her father and friend was killed by abby and for abby ellie is the reason her father and friends are dead
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-07,"realizing the existence of other stories doesnt make you mature. maturity is about how you handle and accept things beyond your control and understand that you cannot fully grasp a persons trauma, even if you have experienced a similar event."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-16,i used to hate abby but the last time i replayed i found her character development very entertaining
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-17,well abby's father didn't even answer when marelene asked if you do this even if it's you're daughter?.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-16,almost everyone is so blinded by their fanatism towards joel that they simply refuse to see both sides of the coin. happens to us all.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-28,maturing is realizing humanity went on 20 years into an apocalypse and to think that one cure that might have worked wouldnt undo the two decades worth of damage and savagery humans have done to another.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,maturing is realizing that abby killed the cure of humanity that day with joel.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-15,am i the only one that understood abby's revenge on the first playthrough?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-26,"maturing is realising that they would of hever been able tk save the world, it was too late"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-16,"as a wise man said before, revenge is a luxury we can't afford."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-16,in the original game there was only a 10 or 17 chance itd work they changed that to make joels decision questionable
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-28,i know joel killed jerry but abby did not have to do joel like that
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,the cure couldn't save the world at that point
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-13,"letting ellie die for a cure to the infection when the biggest disease was humanity itself wasn't an option though, abby's father was willing to kill both of them, so joel killed him. ellie would probably be willing to die for the cure, but they never asked her either. they were all wrong in some way, joel killed those people because they wanted to kill ellie, abby killed him because she was bitter and angry. joel was not necessarily right, but abby is far from innocent"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-19,"it wasn't 100 confirmed that the cure resides within ellie. if joel had let them kill her for a cure, but what if it was a failure?? joel wouldn't ever forgive himself"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-16,"stop coping, just accept the fact that neil fucked up the story line by trying to put his own narrative rather than how the story should have actually revolved, joel and ellie were the main reason to play the first game, he took away one and the other one failed to avenge"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,"the last one for joel feels a little misleading. theres absolutely a possibility that joel ended hope for one route to a cure, but theres no guarantee that if ellie had the surgery that a vaccine could be made or anything like that."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,"yes, abby was avenging her father but the way she killed him in front of ellie too is something i cant justify. i could if she wouldve killed him quickly, but she beat him to death with a golf club while his brother was knocked unconscious and his foundfamily daughter cried for her to stop. when i first played the game, i didnt even try to kill abbys dad, the game made me. i think that was a problem with the devs truly, if they wanted that to be the premise of the second game, they shouldve made abbys fathers death a cutscene."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-18,"abby start this revenge, joel had no choice but kill her dad, she didnt even talk after joel saved her, i fully understand ellie and feel her pain, she deserves happy end.."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-06,well joel is the viilian but we can understand him
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-06,truth is there was never a 100 percent chance of a cure but a 100 percent chance ellie dies
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-16,in this world no one is a villian
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-11,"abby yes, but the most mature thing to do in that situation would've just been to focus on surviving and forgetting about joel. ellie yup. you reap what you sow. joel it's ironic how the natural reaction of a father of saving his child ends up ending the human race."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-13,"if abby only killed joel, i would agree with a simple vengeance. the fact she tortured him before changes everything and makes me understand ellie and tommys obsession to get her"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-16,full grounded guide here httpsyoutu.benkoce0vpou0
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-16,this part was so much more difficult on the original the last of us
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-16,i usually take my headset off for this part. it makes the whole sequence go by faster
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-08,and the hospital basement is the scariest of part 2.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-27,fun fact. it doesent matter if you grab the keycard first odr try to open the looked door. the 4 stalkers will spawn after you did either of that.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-04,he didnt even see the bloater
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-17,the scariest part of any last of us game was the gas siphoning bit in left behind. but on grounded. you have to take out five stalkers with nothing
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-22,"stalkers and clickers are probably the scariest stages in this game, but the scary thing about zombies in this game is that they arent dead, their brain gets taken over by a fungus. the only way for you to escape being possessed by this is to die. not to mention that stuff like this happens to insects in real life. i seriously hope humanity doesnt go through stuff like this."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-29,this is actually a lot easier than what i did! i mapped out the route from the generator to the door but didnt even think about trying the door first lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-08,thank you so much i thought i had to fight the bloater and was getting really frustrated because it was hard and scary thanks for making this easier
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-11,"holyyy crap this part is scary man. for me it was a little different though because after i throw the brick at that one stalker, there was another one camping the door that you use the keycard on so i had to blow his head off real quick at the end. still works though, thanks!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-14,"i played this part this morning, completely blind. the stalkers messed me up good, as i didnt see them at all until i tried starting the generator, not knowing what it was for. one attacked, i was able to fend it off. started pulling again and the next got me. my third attempt i killed them all and then got the generator started. the horror that was the bloated arrived. on my seventh attempt i beat him and very happily found the door and then had to spend ten minutes looking for the key card."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-20,no the scariest part of tlou is the david  ellie part when he chases you with the knife and then hides and runs towards you then hides again. the basement were not close to being that panic'y and scary as that part!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-31,"first time i played the stalkers immediately spawned when joel attempted to open the door without a key card and i didnt know stalkers existed, i started walking to find the key card and saw one peaking from behind a corner so i shot it in the head and the other 3 ambushed me and i shit myself"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-29,"i have another tactic if you prefer fighting. i did this on ps5 go upstairs into the hallway where there are 4 stalkers hiding behind doors, kill all of these at the end of the hallway sort of like shown in video. now, go down to the generator room and place bombs at the two exits not the broken rubble stairs in the corner, start the generator. once the first bomb goes off and a bloater walks in, run around the locker things jn the centre of the room, and bolt towards the exit, ignore all the stalkers. once at the end of the hallway with all the fungus, shoot all the stalkers running after you. noe you only have the bloater to deal with. you know how in the exit hallway there is a little drop intoa big room? from. that room, there is also a staircase leading back to the exit hallway. use this loop to make sure you dont get cornered by the bloater and shoot it when you can! hope this helps"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-27,i feel like the scariest part is when youre at the college and youre in the basement with that full of clickers and a bloater
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-24,i killed the stalkers before i even got the keycard lmaoo
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-22,bro ive been dreading this part
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-17,i remember i turned on the generator and i s my pants my body left my soul
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-25,stalkers are the scariest infected look like clickers and hit like them and are as fast as runners
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-07,i remember dying in the original because of the cutscene that the door doesnt open
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-28,thanks i didnt know what to doio
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-17,instructions weren't clear...became a stalker.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-25,for me the goldstone building in downtown boston is the scary
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-11-12,i always hated this part trying to do this on grounded i knew this was going to be a challenge but i somehow passed it with the bloater killing me with the spore thingy as soon as i opened the door but it still spawned me to the checkpoint
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-14,thank you som much
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-31,thank you soooo much
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-31,"bro, you didn't say there was a bloater it scared the shit out of me"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-10,pov u got the turned on the generator to early
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-25,you can just run past everything and will get past it so fast
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,the infected spawn before you grab the key card but im playing the original version
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,me watching this while playing tlou on ps3
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-11-24,when i did that there was a bloater when i went to the keycard section
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,dang i did everything but forgot to get the keycard
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-07,nah dont unlock it from before for extra chances of a heart attack
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-23,the fuck do i do if the bloater pops up
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-24,"bro what i did was just run around past the scary stuff and just kill it, but its my first time playing so im naturally on the easiest difficulty possisble. i just heard sooo much about it but yeah after the generator i could just feel them being close behind and got that stress and the goo gooo come onnn gooo and bump in ur throath feeling yeah deff scary if done by stealth and not just run through. but idk if itll work on the hardest difficulty. i just heard sooo much bad about it and just said fk it im not gonna get jumpscared for 5 hours"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-26,absolutely true
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-06,ok ok why didnt it tell mw there was 2 stalkers and a mothers dycka bloater

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-22,what about the bloater lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-11,that's bs because you need power in order to swipe the key card and get a green lught to open the door. just saying.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-09,there's a much easier method than this

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-01,killing off joel was the biggest mistake
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-06,when the story line is a wholesome theater itself
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-04,i love the tlou 2 gameplay but i hate the fact that we didn't get more of joel and ellie being a family dou
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-11,finished both games and omg i never cried sooo much playing a game. this story is insane! its soooo good
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-04,"alright, since were all sharing  i remember playing it the first time like it was yesterday. i was in absolute tears during that scene and when ellie visits joels house. i walked around that house for a long time inspecting anything i could. the rest of the game that followed ensued many emotional responses and when i first made it half way when the story line goes backwards and you switch, i stopped playing for a few days. after many hours and many playthrough with the story, ive had different reactions at different things every time and i learned more and more and noticed more details and connections the more i played. still the best game and storyline ive ever experienced and if i could replay the game for the first time again, i definitely would."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-07,such a great game series and it draws you in so much and keeps me entertained and emotionally invested every step of the way

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-09,same. didn't play for weeks after that. i was devastated.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-04,"you remember that tommy had nightmares for all the days with joel, which brings the question if he had karma waiting for him, he did kill abbys father after all. the story was great, was it executed well, not so much"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-20,"off topic but the way i laughed when u started saying no,no,no"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-01,"i really hated the fact they had to kill off joel like that, such a weird thing to do"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-13,you can i think when he falls onto the platform before he comes down
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-17,"this takes me back. back in 2020 before part 2 dropped. i replayed the first game on grounded. when i got to that bloater fight with ellie, i had only 1 pistol bullet, 1 rifle bullet, amd an arrow. came in clutch."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-19,"you still can, you just have to lower his hp by throwing grenades at him so he'll die in 1 shot"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-26,"bro, such a good transition, i didnt notice for a bit."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-19,"i remember watching anthony caliber speedrun remastered a few years ago for the first time, and he shot the foot clean off and killed it instantly and i was like wait what thats a thing? never actually done it myself though im not that quick with aiming"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-13,there was no way id have been able to complete this part of the game without this trick
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-08,those bloaters are no joke
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-25,i heard bloater without realizing it was about the last of us and got hella confused lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-25,i stumbled across this method a week ago when i replayed the remastered and was dreading this part. i did not even question it when it happened. i was just glad i got past it.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-28,figuring this out while playing grounded was such a huge relief
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-21,bros heart is in his foot
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-06,"i used to be an adventurer just like you, but i got a bullet in the leg"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-30,heyyy great vid dude so much potential!!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-06,for the ps5 version didn't kill him but destroyed his foot!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-29,"it worked for me once. saw this trick a while back. didn't think it'd work, but it did."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-25,i just took my rifle and started sweating like ahw shit here we go aigan bro i saw his head and my gun did the kevin meme kabam go dim
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,"ooh shorts! d i hunger for more tlou content, ty"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-05,guess you shot his achilles heel
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-04,pulled this off on my grounded playthrough and i never felt more accomplished
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-25,that little trick saved me alot when i still played this but once i get my ps5 i'll play it agian
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-27,dang nabit! ive got part one remake save where i keep running out of ammo an was hoping this trick would help.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-12,wow. thank you. i will use this when i play it again
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-18,"did this my first try, i was so happy i didn't have to fight it lol"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-24,seamless loop is crazy
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-21,one shot one kill epiccake mvp mvp momment
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-19,the perfect loop doesn't exist....
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-20,thanks i already suffered through that bastard ass bloater but thanks ill remember for next time i play the last of us
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-20,damn i played that game a lot and died in that mission from that bloater 20 times before i was able to kill it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-31,i did this in my run in the hardest difficulty it helped out so much
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-17,interesting! glad they fixed it in ps5. thats an intense battle! i died so many times first playing ellie because her play style is a bit different and you have to rebuild supplies!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-10,i killed a bloater with one molotov cocktail and thats all it took for me
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-25,"first time playing i tried it, hit its leg but i accidentally used the pistol. second time playing, tried again, but missed with the rifle. third times a charm"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-23,it's pretty much common sense you can't kill a bloater using the pistol. when i play it my go to weapons are molotov cocktails and nail bombs. those are way more effective.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-27,"it doesn't have to be falling, it just has to be the right leg his right"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-21,i legit just played that scene for the first time earlier today and accidentally one shot it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-25,this was horrifying when i faced every time even when i beat the game eight times and now i know this
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-11,i shockingly discovered this when playing on survivor.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-29,why didnt i see this video when i was at the moment
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-05,i did this on accident and thought my game glitched
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-18,if you throw 3 bombs where the bloater lands it dies instantly.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-17,didnt know that but id still go up for the challenge
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-24,i remember killing it in one shot on grounded and had no idea how the hell it happened.. i know now.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-12,man i love ur vids ur like dante ravioli but you actualy upload a lot lmao btw a crossover in some game you both play and you do a challange would be insane since both of you are hardcore gamers and like to torture yourself with these challanges idk i think it could be a insane crossover...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-07,i was only here to see if you can do it on ps5. so thanks for the info.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-30,"you can take it down quicker by throwing a molotov at it first, then shoot it while its on fire itll go down pretty quickly"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-12,i used to do it every time i replayed the game lol. once you replay the game a few times all the bloater missions are a complete breeze
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-04,"they should have kept this it makes sense. you shoot it in the leg it stumbles, it falls, it dies"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-07,"i did it with an arrow on the ps5 with a ps4 disc. it hadnt jumped down yet, i was shocked."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-05,molotov
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-05,in the original version in grounded mode i got away with so much. i would walk behind people before being able to stealth kill them cause they couldnt hear you. of course if i ran things would be different but just simply walking and knowing where they would spawn and go did the trick..
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-11-20,i watched this before i play this part and i legit able to kill it in one try using this trick
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-08,i did this on my first play through by accident and it worked
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-13,my brother managed to do in in the remake
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-07,wooow dope dope dope
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-24,i was playing this on the ps5 remasteredremake it worked with rifle not pistol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-04,i was hoping to use this as i just found out then you said it dont work no more shame im not at this part yet but i'm expecting rage lmao
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-17,"this wouldve been helpful to know in grounded, instead of wasting the few bullets and molotovs i had."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-26,and remembe whenerver in doubt trown  molotov
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-30,molotov and headshots
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-17,"bro, i just beat this level today on ps3."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-18,wish i watched this yesterday...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-07,also in the original version of the last of us you dont have to kill the doctor at the end. i remember just giving him a good punch that shouldve just knocked him out. there wasnt the animation of joel stabbing him like in the remake. i prefer this outcome because joel already kills marlene in the end and the fireflies have a chance of regrouping a bit better with the doctor and abbys friends. and these characters couldve been more fleshed out showing they could be as strong as joel and ellie and we would want to root for them a bit more knowing they didnt kill any beloved characters . so technically in some cases the last of us part 2 shouldnt exist but it does do to flexible story events.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-10,"luckily i have ps3 version, i'll test it once i get to this moment"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-17,killed the bloater that way in 1 try
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-12,somehow with luck i found this out on my own
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-19,yeah it took 3 shots for me to blow his leg off... i'm a horrible shot and i was surprised i took it out lol.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-28,i literally thought the bloater was really easy to kill but yea i just shot his leg off
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-12,you can also 1shot after it falls
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-31,yknow what funny i did this on accident and i was so confused lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-05,my first play through of the last of us i did this and got so confused
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-22,no wonder why i couldn't kill him fast enough
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-26,i did this accidentally and thought it was a glitch
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-01,i tried this and ended up with ellie in the ground with a broken spine
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-31,the perfect loop doesn't exist
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-11-23,i one time did that accidently and i was so confused
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-17,explosive arrows are saying hi oh and el diablo  lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-31,clean loop
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-06,"so i remember one day i was playing the last of us the first game and i was at the part where the first bloater appears in the highschool gym, i killed it with one shot because out of luck i had the ball the bloater was about to shoot and it exploded on itself, i was like huh alright"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-31,i done this on my first playthrough and was so confused why he died so fast
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-08,that's a shambler
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-24,oh that is so cool!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-25,good to know. i have the ps5 version so no cheating
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-15,yeah when you play as ellie and you lr with david a bloater jumps down from this thing and before it jumps onto the ground if you shoot it on the leg it dies instantly
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-13,i killed it in one shot but now i know why
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-23,you can actually one shot it before it jumps down just shoot its knee i figured this out on my first playthough on my ps4
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-30,bloater falling on floor 9 out of 11 family's died
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-29,in the last of us part 1 i killed the bloater with one shot with the rifle. test it it works
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-31,i did by mistake and was like huh. that was easy and then i was almost rapedeaten classic last of us moment
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-22,killed it with 2 molotovs and like 2 shots with a shotgun
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-15,"i thought i had done it before, those bastards"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-05,i knew and i did that in all my playtrough
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-06,i do remember killing him in one shoot on ps4
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-07,you can also kill a bloater with 2 moltovs
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-09,thankfully i have the ps4 version so i did this to not die
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-09,omg thank you
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-31,yeah i just toss the make shift grenade on top before he even drops that way he die immediately
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-19,in the last of us remastered on ps5 you can still dk the trick
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-14,at this point gpu manufacturers just pay the companies that creates games to make those games unplayable on older graphics card.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-15,to most game companies most don't care about graphics if there is a great gameplay and narrative. we can't afford nasa computer if it goes like this.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-14,at this point i'm just going to emulate the entire playstation with the game instead
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-02,"at this point, im just gonna watch a whole playthrough of the game. on my phone."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-14,i remember a time pc games were actually optimized
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-15,better idea don't buy the game. they make it right or they can't sell it. edit people are making the worst excuses...

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-14,meanwhile me using rpcs3
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-30,finally my ps3 is useful
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-01,100 gigabytes of storage so you mean just a typical game at this point?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-02,i got it running on my 1650 with an i5 9th gen. took 4 tries to boot up and had to restart the game every 4ish overs because my vram and gpu in general couldn't take it. so far i avoided many spoilers and the game runs fine. well 3040 fps isn't fine bro i used to play minecraft on 20fps on my old pc. this stuff runs butter smooth for my taste
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-03,console ports to pc try not to be horribly unoptimized challenge impossible!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-05,most optimized modern title
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-02,"bro if thats what i need, the characters should come out my screen"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-16,my laptop would instantly blow up if i played that game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-02,ps3 be like look what they need to do to replicate the fraction of my power
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-02,"the good thing about pc gaming is that if the company doesn't otimize the game, the community will, not only that they will fix every problem the game have"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-05,this game makes rust on full graphics feel like minecraft on liw graphics
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-23,"i'm confident that lower end graphics card can play it, it's easier for companies to just pick the most the popular and the strongest specs to lessen the problems they'll have on release."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-06,it does look very good on high settings tho
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-05,remember this was a game that released on the ps3.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-24,ps 4 am i a joke to you?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-15,bro i like how he says your computer cant run it as if all of us are running gtx 980s
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-22,bring it. gonna grind it with my amd ryzen 7 4800 h and nvidia rtx 2060
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-16,so happy rpcs3 exists later on we will just have a version that will look like the ps4 version of the game instead.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,with those system requirements may we well just emulate it.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-15,my 1660 humbly accepts this challenge
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-12,hope they optimise it at some point
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-01,thats why you save up your money to get yourself something nice. luckily i have a 3070ti. planning to get some upgrades to run a 40 series.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-05,me with a 3060 giga chad noises
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-02,"they since realized it and added a patch, it doesn't do everything so you have to verify the files and force your highest end gpu that you have to be the only one it runs on"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-01,"on a side note this is also a remaster not the original game, they added a bunch of extra details and rendering features so those requirements for max quality are for ray tracing, dlss 3 and amd's equivalent. if you look at it closer it can still be played on 10 year old pc parts just not at high quality i want to see someone actually test the game on older hardware and see the results"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-07,well on hbo max you can run it in 4k with dolby vision and atoms support. even on your mobile device
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-15,it will be better optimized hopefully they are just releasing for flagship hardware
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-03,i just hope my 1660s last 23 years more longer i can't afford to upgrade with how high the 30 and 40 series graphics card prices are right now
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-15,its a good thing consoles are built to handle these.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-02,man a lot of people's pcs must run like really bad i don't have a anywhere near that powerful and it looks good and runs good
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-17,"valorant works so well on my potato pc, which shows how much a game can be optimized"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-27,that's y i watch gameplays at youtube.... the games which has story in it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-04,partly why i have respect for rockstar per se as they happily spend time on pc optimisation for their ips. meanwhile these guys cant be arsed to optimise it for lower end gaming pcs
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-01,meanwhile me who has tlou on the ps3 get a load of these guys.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-07,pov me who played it on ps3 when if first came out
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-03,this reminds me of a dumb argument someone made game devs should optimise games for newest graphics cards
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-04,"bro, this is the first game my pc won't be able to run"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-04,"ok, i can still enjoy it in my ps3"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-03,i have an old ass gpu and it still runs games better than what the recommended one is. i'm convinced it's a ploy to get people to buy more expensive gpus
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-05,ps3 with 256mb of ram be like
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-03,i use dlss on max settings on a 2080ti and i fluctuate around 100 to 80 fps. not terrible at all tbh.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-16,really bro i am running 13600k  4070ti and i finished this game yesterday ran fine
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-08,nah that clicker was having the time of his life
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,storage is not even a concern anymore. you can get like a 1tb decent nvme ssd for 80 or a 2tb decent nvme ssd for 120150

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-24,"i need a dlc about how ellie finds dina and jj again, and how abby and lev are living lemme break it down so this dlc would be called your return it would be 34 hours because its not huge enough to be a whole tlou iii,but half of it will be for abby the other half for ellie, same format as tlou ii, abbys part is simple, know her life with lev at the big dome building, for ellies part as we know, tlou ii ended with ellie putting her guitar next to the window and then we see her walking outside the window, since thats the end of tlou ii, it will be the start of the dlc, so ellie will go to jackson, in hopes of finding dina and jj but no sign of them, instead, she sees tommy and then a cutscene plays of them having a conversation and her explaining that she did what he wanted her to, but at what cost? tommy feels guilty for ellie losing her family so tommy will go with ellie to find dina and jj, the dlc continues but tommy will be with you ellie, it is also great bc we get a mix of tommy bc i know a lot of people want tommy to have his own dlc, this is good too though, they take a stop at joels grave and ellie sits on a bench, writessketches in her journal and talks to joel, then theyll go to various places, like the music shop, where ellie sang and played guitar in front of dina for the first time, theyll go to places that were significantly emotional and important to ellie and dina, ellie visits the synagogue, as a pay of respect to dina, they go to even more places and whatnot until getting a radio signal from dina in the theatre, dina talks about how she was angry at ellie for leaving them, ellie sends a message of her own, apologizing and her hopes for becoming a family again, dina hesitating, agrees, ellie is really happy, she tries to scavenge things to bring even a few toys for jj, they journey to where the radio signal came from, but nothing. dina had secretly went somewhere else, turns out she was just hiding somewhere and wanted to scare ellie, they reunite, head back to jackson with tommy and live happily together. the end. youre welcome. ps. i did come up with this so if you like the idea, spread it everywhere,copy paste it, and screenshots, and credit me! youre welcome everyone, someone tag naughty dog!!"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-26,"unpopular opinion but i actually think abby is quite a good character, she was struck with grief at a young age seeing her own father killed and the grief stuck with her, and she bided her time for revenge, i like seeing her as a victim turned villain, sounds cringe i know but i think her father's death broke her in a way which blinded her into a dark path of impulsiveness and never ending hate for joel, and i think she needs more attention because her character in my opinion is well written."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-15,"33412 the way he dropped from that head shot, dang"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-26,"i started playing this game when the remaster came out for ps4 in 2014,ive never played the original on ps3,but i can say this is the best video game series ive ever played and looking forward part three,its a masterpiece in gaming."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-02,44930 reminds me of wild hogs the movie when the guy says why are we fighting lmao
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-28,the only thing i find odd about this games is there just happens to be loose bricks and bottles conveniently placed near enemies

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-16,"haven't played the game but watching the 2023 show. man, sarah's death from the game actually brought tears to my eyes."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-14,"im currently replaying the game on my ps4 and although its not as good as the ps5 version, it still holds up today. i really wish i had a ps5 and the ps5 version of the game. but theres no way im paying full price for a decade old game."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-05,"as someone who's always wanted to play this but never bought a ps, thank you very much for posting this!!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-17,"not gonna lie, this might be the best looking game i've ever seen."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-30,i love the way your content with video gaming. it's so smooth and groovy. keep it going...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-11-15,"75641 yoooo chill bro, i just took the tool from the doctor, grabbed ellie and left, but you're sickkkk dude!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-21,"spoilers ahead! i think the part where sarah dies is more realistic in the gameat least the remastered that in the tv series. the desperstiom and suffering is way better portrayed here. anyways, is not a surprise the tv series has recieved good reception, since the main source qas already pure quality"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-12,74447 missing scene. why that jump??
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-28,anybody else watching this instead because they dont have a ps5 or pc
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-01,can't wait for this to release on pc. missed a real gem there.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-11,man they did a good job remaking this into a show.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-17,50115 this scene still makes me tear up to this day
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-22,91820 the best sound the dlc so far.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-31,i never understood why they drove into the city at the start of the game. they were literally talking about how it was just city people that were infected like 30 seconds prior.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-26,major props to whoever was playing the game. they did a great job
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-18,"52203 while tommy's wife and ellie are in danger, joel decides to try to study the blueprints of the dam"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-15,i just finished the remastered edition for ps4 and its interesting to compare the changes between the two versions.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-19,"a lot of people complaining the the tv show isnt exactly like the game. i knew about the last of us since it appeared but i really never watched a full gameplay. im watching the gameplay after watching the show twice. not knowing how the game really is, you do appreciate the show so so much, its mainly because you dont have your expectations already set! i loved every single minute of the tv show and of the game. they are both simply amazing. dont be so critical of the show compared with the game. its amazing"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-12,"i'm diving into this game for the first time ever now that i've got my hands on the ps5. it's truly the pinnacle of gaming for me. the depth and immersion have me hookedi feel genuinely invested in every moment. being a dad, i can only chip away at it a bit each day, but that slow pace suits me fine it keeps the experience fresh and prevents me from rushing through it. the last time a game resonated with me like this was metal gear solid 2."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-21,this man is convinced right is left ' 24454 63129
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-31,bought this game at full price twice already so waiting until its on ps plus but damn this makes me want to buy it again.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-06,i have the remastered version of this is there a difference between the remastered part 1 and part 2?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-10-01,really wonderful! enjoyed every minute of this!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-26,"finished the sequel like a month or two ago and it's still kicking around in my head  great games. great, intensely uncomfortable games. i'm generally not a fan of the pseudomovie aaagame design approach, but those two and the later uncharted games actually manage to do something worthwhile with that formula while also managing to actually be fun to play, which is sorta crazy to me. looking forward to the pc port."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-22,does this mean people play straight through with no break? or is it stopped and started again unnoticeably
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-05,74448 the hell kind of cut edit was that...tha fuck
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-01,"honestly, the first last of us is much better than last of us 2, good story, but i hate the plot of last of us 2"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-21,this is exactly like the show its crazy
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-27,bro the part where sarah dies... my emotions if they were coded would go like.. player.emotion  sadness

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-03,54843    xx le
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-16,just started this on ps5 it was like watching a movie  crazy how much difference there is between this and ps4
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,follow me on twitch so we can hang out and drink root beer together httpswww.twitch.tvlukestephenstv
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,quick turn around is literally one of the first things you do in first last of us. its not a gameplay element added from tlou2. just thought id mention that.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-11,"one of the main arguments ive seen made for not having dodge and prone is that part 1 was not designed with those mechanics in mind so they would have to go back and rework a bunch of level design to make it fit in. kind of like what they would do if it was a remake.... oh wait, it is."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"joels daughters reflection in the screen door is actually in the ps3 version too, i was so blown away at the time that i played that actually stuck out for me. its a very low resolution reflection but still very cool for attempting at least."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"we need more games that pushes gore like this, i'm tired of shooters games scaring away from gore and blood."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,that guy being blown apart with the shotgun feels like a most realistic depiction of the fourth rank of the blood mess perk in fallout 4.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"at that price, they should have bundled it with part 2."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"so let me get this straight crash bandicoot n'sane trilogy  spyro reignited trilogy  remakes of over 20 year old trilogies, with new voices and osts, bonus levels and improved gameplay  40 final fantasy 7 remake  resident evil 2 remake  a total reimagining of the original, over 20 year old games, with new gameplay, music and voices, making it a new experience without making original games obsolete  60 mass effect legendary edition  a whole trilogy, with all dlcs, better graphics, and improved gameplay  60 the last of us. part 1  new models  one dlc  70"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"to be honest, im impressed with how great everything looks. its my favorite game of all time and i wouldve loved to pay 10 for the ps5 upgrade. but to try to charge me 70 to play the game again is just a slap in the face. improved graphics, enemybuddy ai, and accessibility features are not worth more than the original game. some of the people defending the 70 price tag talked shit about rockstar releasing gta5 for the 3rd time and ive found that fucking hilarious."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"the mirror in her room is not ray traced, it's just a camera pointing out from the angle of the mirror, then it's rendered and applied as a texture to the mirror surface. this is the way reflections were done in games for a really long time."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-06,maybe i am a loser but this remake actually blew my mind and reignited my love for this game and i think it was a very worthy 70 for me
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"i played the remaster on the ps4 pro and really enjoyed it. i loved the story, but spending 70 more on the same story isn't something i'll be doing."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"i agree with everything you have said, you absolutely nailed it. if the price was 40 i could over look 99 of the lack of additions but at 70 forget it sony."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"i appreciate that alot of work went into this but there is nothing that is going to change the fact that this is the same game. they didn't have to go through years of story boarding to write a new story, didn't need to pay voice actors and write a script again, didn't have to desighn the areas from the ground up and didn't have to throw 5years at it to make it happen why is 70 more than it cost a decade ago justifiable for this product."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-10,there are a few inconsistencies in what he said about the bow and glass breaking the bow reticle can be switched in the hud settings and you can break glass in certain levels and areas  just depends on where you are.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-14,i've been playing through this game and ellie still runs into the field of view of human enemies. what in the hell does this tell us about the so called ai improvement? this game isn't built from the ground up. its actually a play on words.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"my dude got a code and still gave it a stern review. good job, luke. for me, no prone and dodging are the worst sins those two changes alone would convince me to replay part 1, since they made part 2 so much better for me. edit oh and you forgot to mention if the enemies scream out each other's names when they die. judging from the state of things, i'm guessing that they don't."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"considering i was here from quite early, the fact that luke got a playstation review copy feels kinda like a huge milestone, hopefully he gets one for ragnark"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,i thought the quick turnaround was in the original game already. i remember using something similar in the beginning when that truck explodes.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-20,"people way underrated this remake because, having played the game twice already and now playing a third with this remake, i can tell you that it is significantly better than the og and easily one of the most beautiful games ive played on ps5 so far. so much disrespect and cynicism in this video to the amount of work that really goes into something like this, ive been incredibly and continually impressed by it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"overall, i find the the graphics upgrade to be amazing, i love a lot of the changes they made in the facial expressions. much like you luke i am also upset they didnt bring over dodge and prone over from tlou2. now one thing i also liked was the weapons upgrade. i really loved that system from part 2 so much i nerd over it every time i played through it. i think its a system that needs to be implemented into most games. but i really liked how they utilized the tools and combined that with the same upgrade system they had in part 2. best idea they had. if they are going to make a part 3. they need this this system."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"fyi, the 'raytraced reflections' you showed was a basic planar reflection. it's an old technique that only works on flat surfaces, has to be manually set up, and it's basically rendering the whole scene 2ce per reflection so is used sparingly, but moreso in scripted linear games. random puddles, cars, and smaller or more complex objects still have ssr artifacts or cubemap limitations, so rt definitely isn't a thing."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"why am i not surprised as if we consider this a remake, it's definitely one of the weaker ones in this modern age of remakes. especially compared to titles such as the resident evil 2 remake, or mafia definitive edition. overhauled gameplay that's still true to the original. rebuilt levelworld design from a gameplay point of view. etc."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"and that was the last time luke received a review code from sony... great video, you were thorough and fair. i'm glad you held them to task on what should clarify as a 'remake' or a 'remaster', this game clearly being the latter. shame that a few simple changes would slightly forgive the extortionate asking price. i'll gladly wait and buy a reduced copy."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-14,it took 15 versions of skyrim till people complained.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"you can criticize the price tag all you want, but saying they didn't even try is an insult to the people that worked on this, just for a sensational thumbnail. do better"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"seems like ill get just as much satisfaction from watching someone play this on a stream. once they drop the price way down, i might pick it up for myself. thanks, luke"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,i was under the impression the new combat would include the dodge  prone features. super disappointed that isnt the case  feel cheated thats how they were advertising this as a built from the ground up game. it feels rushed to accommodate the hbo series release  way too soon after tlou 2.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,i think the sweet spot would have been 49.99. perfect for people that want to experience the game again while taking advantage of the ps5 power and for people that never played the game and can easily get this and tlou pt 2 for really cheap and dive into the series.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,there's a wave of people calling people broke for saying 70 is to much... but there's a difference between not being worth 70 and not having enough for 70 this is definitely not worth 70 if you've already played both version's. people shill for these companies way to much
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,i really appreciate the overall honesty in this review despite having received a review code. many creators are tempted to succumb into blind positivity when receiving a code so that makes it very easy to recommend you. love the work and the breakdowns you do!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,actually the pullback x mechanic was in the first game but i 100 agree. super disappointed theres no dodging
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,this was a good review of this! i watched scallops and i couldnt believe he supported the 70 price tag. this actually cost more than the last of us part two! its not like they started from nothing theres no way they should be 70. it is a beautified remaster that weve all played at least a dozen times. this is a hard pass for me
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"spending 70 on a remastered game that was released almost 10 years ago is an absolute madness, i think you should save that money for gow ragnarok one more thing is that sony has started to irrationally increase the prices of its exclusive games in a complete silence of the players, sony must take into account the players' love for their platform and abandon greed."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-13,"i honestly believe game developers suffer the same issue as if you wrote out a research paper. you dont notice the spots that obviously need improvements or think adding something extra is unnecessary but when having a second eye read your paper for the first time, they see what needs to be added in a necessary way and then everything just makes more sense and now your paper is more interesting and thrilling to read."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-27,i'm honestly getting sick and fucking tired of companies just constantly rereleasing games that came out two fucking console generations ago to earn more money. like... why not put those resources to helping to make a new game?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"thank you for keeping your integrity and providing your honest feedback even though the copy was provided to you from sony. i expected nothing else but it never fails to be a refreshing feeling when i come back to your channel. well done on all your success, utterly deserved."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"it looks to me like naughty dog is in a similar place that companies like bethesda and rockstar are in right now they became famous making incredible original singleplayer content, everyone fell in love with them, they began experimenting which often removes the widespread love, then proceed to make multiplayer content to maximize profits. now with naughty dogs next game confirmed to be a multiplayer experience, all i can see is the same story playing itself out over and over again. ya had a good run naughty dog! guess all good things must end"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,more then likely ill pick this up on pc whenever it does launch because i do love the fact sony is releasing more of their titles on other platforms. but no way in hell am i paying full retail price for a game i already bought twice on 2 other platforms. once that steam sale kicks in then ill pick up
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-12-13,"for the duelsense, if you go in settings and turn on vibration for dialogue, it makes it immersive as hell, especially with a headset on"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,tbh if they didnt make the doctor look like the dude from tlou2 i wouldnt have cared. tlou2 was the worst game ive ever played considering what it could have been. and then the fact that a character that had literally 10 seconds of screen time in tlou1 was a weak ass connection anyway. and no abby is great to me.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"the visuals do look very impressive in some parts, but the jump in quality isn't big enough to justify the price, if only it was an actual ground up remake and featured new improved mechanics it would potentially be worth the price of a new game..."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,nobody understands that if they were to add prone they would have to change the level design.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,skill up just sucked it off till no end making it sound like the best thing ever.. im glad to see someone warning people from spending full price for a graphic update. honestly i never really liked the gameplay so i will probably never play this.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,naughty dog have now released two ps5 games. both remasters. that is genuinely sad.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"i'll start buying 70 games when i'm mad rich, i'm already mad so i'm half way there."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"i agree with you a lot. this is one of my favorite games, and it looks phenomenal here on ps5. but i was extremely disappointed to find out that the gameplay was practically untouched, as it has aged not as bad as others, but given this is a remake and not just a remaster it's disappointing this wasn't improved much. and to be honest, i wouldn't care if it were just visuals if it were at a lower price tag. but with a 70 asking price, it's absurd that the gameplay isn't modernized. especially considering the ps4 remaster included the dlc as well, so this is a package with less content going for the price of a brand new aaa experience. it's absurd, and i hope it's not a sign of things to come with all the poor anticonsumer decisions sony's been making lately. i was really on the fence about getting this, but given i've sunk 200 hours in the original and this is basically just visuals i'm definitely waiting for a sale if i get it at all."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"great video as usual luke! just a little nitpick, the quickturn was already in the og, there's even a tutorial when you're on you're way to meet robert and the fireflies attack the gates"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"jesus, i've been disagreeing more and more with your content. i get that its all your opinion, but to say nd didn't try isn't even true."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-06,"ain't no way i'm dropping 70 for a 60 8 year old game, with less features. i'll catch it on a steam sale for 30."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"i thought it was just graphic improvements so im quite happy that ai improvements are alison included. i think i would be disappointed if they changed too much, i loved the original and wouldnt want it too feel so different. overall a prettier version of my favourite game is a win for me. not that i would ever pay the full price for it but realistically thats gonna shoot down so quick it doesnt even really matter."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,everyone has basically reached the same conclusion the loup1 is a great game that was remade too soon and is being sold for the wrong price. hopefully sony gets the memo.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"i feel like they should atleast have some sort of loyalty system for players who already bought the games before. e.g, first game ever in series  60 already own part 2  45 already own the original or remastered lou  30 already own both games  20 something like this"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,btw the quick turn around was in the original tlou. it even pops up a tutorial message for it in the beginning when you're trying to leave the zone to go find robert but there's an explosion that makes them close off the gateway
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-07,they changed ellie's face to fit her look in part 2. kinda hate that.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"for someone who owns the remaster, all sony had to do was give me the option of either upgrading that title or give me a discount on the remaster v2. i would happily purchase this for 30. it's just not a good look for sony, and with the price increase in more or less every country besides the us, it just feels like they are going in a more antifriendly consumer direction. however, this is nothing new from sony's other departments. if you look at how poorly they do bluray releases like the new ghostbusters collection, than this is not a new direction for sony. just sony being shitty towards their customers."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"adding the ability to prone would require an overhaul of every single level in the game. the original games level design was just not designed for it. dodging however, should have been implemented. also you can change the settings for the bow to be like how it was before. the entire gameplay can be adjusted in the accessibility options. theyre not just there for people with disability, lol."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"the graphics are not good enough to ask 70 for a remake either. this has pretty much the same graphics as tlou2, which are great, but that was a ps4 game. this is supposed to be a fullpriced ps5 game. have you even seen what the ps5 is actually capable of? because it's definitely much, much more than this."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,i miss joel's old model. the anger and intensity in his eyes has been replaced by a constant look of uncertainty. am i the only one who sees this?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-22,the remake is great. it looks way more beautiful than the original game. saying they did the bear minimum and didn't even try with the remake is a insult to the developers. a lot of work was put into the upgrades and i notice them and appreciate them. the game is not a disappointment to me at all.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,it honestly feels like this remake exists solely so they can put part 1 in the title
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"im honestly very happy they replaced the bow with part 2s  that arc aiming was always so weird for long distance shots, way more satisfying and easier to pull off in 2"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,no dodge and no prone is heartbreaking
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"if halo 2 anniversary, or to a lesser extent mass effect 1 legendary edition, are remasters then this is too. its a very good remaster, but remakes are new games that replicate the story or style of the original. a remaster is a visual overhaul, maybe with some gameplay changes, that's that's built on the foundations of the original."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-09,if it was literally any other game i wouldn't have bought it again
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-02,is everyone just forgetting how insanely buggy the original game and its remaster were? the remake is night and day
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"saying they didnt try is incorrect, saying they didnt add enough and the price is too steep is far more fair"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,if only it had factions. that wouldve been worth it.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"it's just one of those things that isn't necessary. yes, the added accessibility stuff is awesome, but as a whole it has no reason to exist beside a cash grab. even if i personally didn't enjoy the game, technically it was practically flawless. it's kind of shameless."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-18,"if you already played it, spending 70 is. not. worth. it. save you money for new games. not graphically upgraded games except dead space"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,tlou stans have made me hate the word masterpiece
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"thank you for the review. you confirmed what i suspected. i guess i will wait years before touching this one or wait until it is on ps plus. as some have said, i am very happy that you stay consistent with your other reviews and criticized the companystudio even if copy was provided. kudos to you sir"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,ultimately i think it all comes down to is the game worth 70 to you. for some people it will be and for some it wont be. and i think theyre both fair opinions to have
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"i dont like that theyre charging 70. ive bought the game twice already, once on ps3 and once on ps4. i was planning on waiting for a sale, but seeing this footage really makes we want to play the game due to the improved graphics and gore. im going to have a hard time waiting as more footage comes out, im afraid"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"luke, i used to not get a good vibe from your content. i used to not be able to feel your genune excitement for gaming as a whole, i could hear it obviously, but i just couldn't feel the passion. i made the mistake of lumping you in with the samey masses of youtuber reviewers just trying to get a quick buck and for that i am sorry. i see it now though, your willingness to give your opinion regardless of the reception, the grace with which you own up to the fact that some of your thoughts aren't appreciated by the general masses, your ability to actually back up what you are saying in depth down to the specifics and more importantly without droning on just to inflate the length of the video so you can brag about making a 10 hour review of the elder scrolls 4 oblivion... you are now one of my favorite long format content creators when it comes to game reviews and discussions. i even look to your content and the ways you perform for inspiration to how to make my own videos better. you are an inspiration!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"for people who have played this game multiple times on multiple systems with multiple purchases, it's hard to justify buying it again until drops to under 20.00."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"the main improvement i was hoping for was the implementation of the gore system from tlou2, so i'm very happy."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"if you own a ps5, wait for a price drop! yeah it looks nicer in the graphics, animations especially the gore from part 2 is a nice touch up and other stuff like improved workbench and accessibility options. but overall it's the same game from 2013 with no multiplayer, same gameplay same level design,and they want to charge 70?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-25,seeing this game relived with this level of graphical fidelity gave me a satisfaction i simply cannot describe. sorry if you didn't get enough bang for your buck but it's everything i ever wanted from it.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"im so over people like you complaining about companies only caring about their bottom line and making money, while you plaster your twitter, twitch, instagram, and youtube whenever it pans to you. you ask for likes and subs. we live in a society that is obsessed with money. no one is ever content. stop tying the price of this game to the game itself. watch skillup. youll learn something."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"to be perfectly honest, sony should have borrowed a page from companies like ca, or microsoft who gave an outright 40 or 50 discount to people who owned the original game. that would have solved the price issue and got them many more sales. it's simply asinine that they sell it just for 70 for everyone regardless of whether you own any of the previous versionsoriginal or remaster already, which as you said is a huge barrier for people to buy this game on top of 1 or both of those previous versions."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"why are most of your recent videos, particularly the titles and thumbnails, exceptionally negative? they didnt even try. thats so hyperbolic its almost offputting. it takes 2 seconds to see that a lot of effort was put into the game, especially when comparing the environments, animations, and character models. you dont have to even play the game to recognize those things. then they added all the accessibility features from tlou2 into here, and while they might not be anything you or i would use, but its very important to a lot of people and its something naughty dog didnt even have to include. your thumbnail gives the impression that they did the absolute bare minimum. that theres absolutely nothing worthwhile here and it gives viewers a very negative impression of the game before they even watch your review or check the game out for themselves."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"appreciate this analysis. resonates a lot with what i feel. my dad just got back into gaming, and he's going to see this advertised after just finishing the original, and how am i supposed to sell him on it? it's tough. makes me wonder if the new coming fans are really worth alienating the ogs. in business, that formula usually never works out in the end. you never want to punish your loyal customers for sticking through everything, you'll lose more than you gain."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"quick turn is available on the original game, you're introduced to it on the beggining of the game when the fireflies make that car bomb attack when you're about to leave the city with tess."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"let's face it, it's a remaster of a remaster"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-11,1352 the light glitch you point is just light passing through the branches something that happens in real life
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"because they know fanboys will still buy it, they're milking a dead game and charging even more for less content. why would.they try when they know people will buy it anyway?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-08,"as someone who has played all versions of this game, i can safely say that this is the definitive version of this game. it is totally worth the price tag in my book because the overhaul of the graphics are insane. i love this story so much so i had no problem picking it up. also i wanted my girlfriend to experience the game since we started watching the show."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,this is a very rare kind of review where you got a code but still speak your mind. good job
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-05,"i still believe that this game should be aimed primarily at pc players. i know they said it will be released on pc but considering what they're doing with uncharted 4, i doubt it will ever come out."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"look, if youre trying for more views, create a good review. dont resort to a thumbnail with they didnt even try. that is garbage clickbait and you know it. there was quite a bit of effort that went into this, and anyone who has played it can recognize it. btw, plenty of glass is smashable, to complain about one not being while neglecting to account for others is disingenuous and demonstrates your bias. probably best not to let sonys business practices affect your critiques."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-07,this version of the game is obviously made for hardcore gamers and for people who are new to the series. especially for those that are coming from the show when it releases.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"i think skillup made a really good point and comparison when it comes to the pricing of the game. sure 70 is a bit pricy on a first glamce but you you actually compare it to other entertainment products it's not that crazy anymore. many movies for example have been rereleased over the years in many formats. lotr trilogy, i have it on vhs, dvd, bluray, extended and now just recently bought the extended 4k remastered collection. it's the same movies with littlebit better picture but i've spent hundreds in total to the movie sets. so why then would 70 be too much for my goat game when hundreds of dollars were not too much for my favorite movie. it's really how you look at the value. naughty dog went above and beyond with this rerelease actually building it in many ways again for the ps5 and it looks better than ever. it is the definitive way to play this game now. so if it is your goat go buy it support it. if you don't want to spend that much. then don't and wait for sale, that easy."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,"game looks really good graphically, and i know theres some actual changes here and there but i dont see why they wouldnt include all the gameplay features from part 2. imagine if arkham asylum was fully redone graphically to the level of arkham knight but it still kept the same old combat."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-01,"after seeing digital foundry's in depth comparison, seeing your they didn't even try thumbnail makes me think less of you."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"implementing the gameplay mechanics of part ii into part i would have meant they would have have to remake the environments. part iis mechanics were built around that games environments. tall grass, cars and other objects to climb under etc. if this was indeed a remake, naughty dog would have remade the world to fit the new mechanics. they didnt."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-08-31,i think it's interesting that there's a case being made that this was made for people who watch the live action series and get curious to play the source material. but it seems like quite a jump to watch a tv series and then go buy a ps5 to experience this game at its best. especially given the stock issues.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-02,"naughty dog and rockstar games are in a competition for who can rerelease and milk the same game each console generation, i can bet any amount of money theyll rerelease this game again for the ps6 but charge 40 for the patch update, i love that they remade this game since i played the ps3 version when it originally came out in 2013, and then preordered the ps4 remaster a year after, ill wait when its either 20 or 15"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-07,"you sir are now my favorite reviewer. professional, honest, and relatable. what else is to say about this review? perfect"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-04,"i think it's worth pointing out they are charging 70 for a game that literally has less content. beyond just a few small graphical improvements which in some cases i feel the ps4 remaster actually looks better, they cut the multiplayer. you are literally paying more for less. there is no justification for this to cost 70. even if you are looking at it from the perspective of someone who has never played it. games should not cost 70. especially not for a decade old game that has been remastered before. a game that you can buy at a cheaper price on ps4 that has multiplayer and can be played on ps5. unlike say...xenoblade chronicles definitive edition. nintendo did charge 60 for that which is largely a remaster as well. the difference is that they didn't cut content. they updated edgelevel geometry, textures, character models, improved quest tracking, added a transmogappearance system, and a theater mode. but more importantly they added an entire epilogue. there were enough new additions and changes beyond just a visual update to warrant revisiting that title."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,"dont ever feel as though anyone is judging you because youre playing on easy difficulties, whats important is the story"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-17,"i love how he reads the entire newspaper, this is the peak gameplay"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,how do i turn this lady off? besides trying to hit on her. oh my god lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-23,as a father who lost a child. that opening breaks me. every. single. time.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,14 buttons vs 10 fingers. im at a disadvantage
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-13,"it's rare when someone stops what's happening, and actually reflects upon it. great attitude sir."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,"when he mentioned being a single dad, i knew this series will be devastating"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-12,mojave doesnt realize that his ps5 profile picture is joel
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,do they have like a pussy mode? lol i freaking love this dude
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-12,"brother, i'm a grown man in my late 30s, i've played the game three times over the years and that scene with joel and sarah emotionally wrecks me every time. the voice acting, the animations, atmosphere, thinking they've gotten to safety only to be heartbroken, it's so expertly made. you are in for such a treat if you can play this and its sequel, i can't wait to watch you feel it all. cheers!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,do they have a level for the elderly? is my favorite line lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-25,am i wounded? has the smallest amount of health possible
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,"hello, mojaved. this is the first video of yours that has popped up on my recommended. i am enjoying it a lot so far. i have a dear friend that's an employee at naughty dog the creators of the last of us, and i've sent her this video. she works on accessibility features for their games. a simplified controller scheme for elderly gamers may very well be an option they're interested in. great video. i hope you enjoy the game!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-12,723 got me cracking up when he starts telling the voice to shut up
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,all the games he has played so far are so good but this man is going through emotional trauma constantly
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-12,"the look in joel's eyes and on his face when ellie asks him if it can be that bad out there. he says everything to us, but not her, with his back turned., without saying a word."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,wooo! no way! i remember when you said you werent interested in zombie games. i promise you wont be disappointed.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-04,"never need to apologise for difficulty level, or learning or understanding the controls. everyones just here to enjoy a new and unique perspective you offer. videos like this are valuable for developers and game designers. gaming is for everyone."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,"tipssuggestions 1 don't think of the game like you would an open world like rdr2. naughty dog games are beautiful but pretty linear. you can search for materials in the general area you're in, however large or small. just remember that unlike a rdr2 the world isn't seemingly endless. so if you ever feel stuck or lost know that the path or solution is somewhat near by. their goal is to deliver the story first and foremost, then adding fun gameplay around that story so it will kind of lead you forward the entire time. 2 i'd turn on aim assist in the settings. remember, there is no set difficulty or way to play. play on the essiest level with all the help they offer if that's what gives you a better experience. i assure you that they will not leave anything out even at the easier difficulties. all plot points, enemies and materials are present in all difficulty levels. all that changes is the ease at which enemies go down. whatever makes the experience betted for you is the options and difficulty level you should use. set up the aiminglook speed and such to whatever you like. 3 there is not a massive amount of materials and such in tje early game. if you don't see a prompt within a few feel of an area there likelly isn't anything to grab there. they want the world to have limited materials such as ammo so it's not unusual to walk into an encounter with five 9mm rounds, a brick and a bat, haha. 4 finally, you can sometimes go around an enemy but at times the only way to go is through them or killing them. in all instances you can use stealth or world objects to help you. be it throwing a brick to distract an enemylure them away from you to things like stealth kills. you can clear out entire rooms of enemkes with zero bullets if you desire that route. your intuitions are keen, haha. you'll get the hang of it if you stick with it. i guaruntee!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-12,there's something quite magical and beautiful about the fact that we're going on this journey with you now and the final destination is your painting in the background.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,twenty years later?!! i remember having this reaction lol also the army. thank god. made me laugh knowing what comes next.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-20,this is hands down my favorite playthrough of tlou so far. i love the perspective of this man and i love how much he actually sits and thinks about the details to understand everything
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,"how old is this game there are three different versions of the same game. 2013 the last of us  playstation 3 original release 2014 the last of us remastered  playstation 4 the only difference here is the high definition textures 2020 the last of us part ii  playstation 4  5 sequel on a new game engine 2022 the last of us part i  playstation 5 complete remake of the first game using an updated version of the new game engine they created to make part ii. this is the version you are playing in this video we also have the last of us left behind, which is a dlc campaign that takes place before the events of the last of us the last of us, remastered, and part i, however, it should be played after you have completed the main campaign, because it spoils certain aspects of the main campaign."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-12,once this channel blows up smoke em if ya got em is gonna be the de facto channel catchphrase. its too perfect
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,"the opening of this game is probably one of my favorite openings in gaming history, sitting in the back of the car and watching as all the chaos ensues was crazy"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-12,2700 i first got into this game around 20142015 and all these years later the sarah scene still makes me emotional
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,must've seen the sarah scene at least a dozen times and it still makes me tear up. they did indeed do a great job at evoking such an emotional response so quickly into the game. the acting and storytelling is superb throughout the last of us and that's why it's been so highly acclaimed over the the years
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-03,this feels like watching 70 yearold joel  playing the last of us and im here for it... keep it upppp
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,612 hearing that warm aw and seeing that bright smile honestly hurt a little haha
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-18,im a grown man and i am not a guy that crys much. but this game hit different. this game and part 2 are by far the best games i ever played.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,the eyes in this game are what separate last of us from every other game. the eyes of these characters tell hours worth of stories. amazing game brother

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-26,"this is so strangely therapeutic. watching someone who isnt accustomed to a 3d world play games inperson can be rough, but this sorta made me love this game even more."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,"i'm not sure if anyone else has said it yet, but something that may help in combat situations where you can't see the enemies... if you hold r1 the button above the right trigger it activates a listening mode where it highlights enemies through walls and past obstacles. great video by the way man, hope you enjoy the game"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,i have never clicked a video so fast i know u gonna love this game it is honestly life changing
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-20,"i would rather watch you play this game than someone less than half your age. its a very refreshing experience because you come from an entirely different generation. ive seen other youtube channels owned by more seasoned gentleman like yourself play games like this and they always show a different kind of appreciation for the experience, a kind of appreciation you dont see from younger folks like me."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,i don't want a piece of lumber!  what a great start!

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,quick reminder. the game allows you to walk around and explore pretty much whenever you want. so you dont have the stay with the other characters all the time
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-12,"tlou was the reason i got my ps4. the intro chokes me up every time, one of the best video game intros of all time."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,"omg, mojaved! fantastic! i'm so pleased you decided to play this game! great graphics music and acting. i will certainly watch you play. i hope you enjoy!  don't worry. i'm 71 years old too and i enjoy playing these ganes"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,"only tip needed, be patient and observant. learning the nuances are part of what makes it great. absolutely amazing game, another 1010, your people have amazing taste. god bless and enjoy, sir."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-29,"i have a few bits of advice. i realize im late to the party and by now youre much further along, but just in case.. 1. this is a stealth game. very infrequently is fighting  shooting needed, but if you do shoot or walk fast, making noise it alerts all the enemies. play stealthy. crouch and move slowly when enemies are around, frequently using the listening mode to see where enemies are. and always upgrade that listening mode distance. 2. ive seen you frequently ask about how to run, or punch, or do other things. all modern games have a controls section in the settings, that shows you what all the buttons do. 3. ive seen you walk past ammo and crafting supplies etc many times because youre not looking. in every room or location, search every corner and door and behind cars etc. in any video game where looting and finding suppliesammo is a thing, the unwritten rule is, once you identify which way the game wants you to go to proceed, go everywhere else first. and remember, the onscreen prompts to pick up things doesnt show up unless youre close to the item, and looking directly at it, so you should constantly look around various directions with the right stick and walk up close to walls, cabinets, desks etc. this goes for when youre outside too. 4. never be without shivs. you can only hold 3, but a shiv is used whenever you open a locked door, or kill a clicker, so watch your bottom right screen icon to make sure you have a shiv and if you dont, then craft some. 5. never leave behind anything just because it says full, if you can help it. if you cant pick up ammo, pull up each gun and reload to create space in the clip for more ammo.dont worry, the game doesnt let you discard bullets on the ground. similarly if you cant pick up crafting materials, try to craft med kits or shivs etc, to make room in your inventory to pick up the materials. hope this helps. im very much enjoying watching your videos. im a 54 year old man. my dads about your age and plays too. its a fun hobby, as long as you dont obsess. get out and get your needed doses of fresh air, exercise, and human contact too. haha."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,glad you're playing this d! one of the best single player games i've ever experienced. days gone is a game that should be on your future playlist. maybe do a trailer reaction to see if it's a game you'd like to try out
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-02,one of the most amazing opening of any game ever. and i wanted to say its great to see someone elderly be openminded and actually enjoying video games.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,this game is so much more than just a zombie game  youll come to realise that as you play more!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-13,"i've never had a playstation, so i never played this. but i have watched playthroughs of it before, and i have to say, it is the best game i never played. such a great story, great acting, everything."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,"mojaved, stealthy, patient gameplay is imo best in this game. its so much fun!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-03,this is one of my all time favorite games. joel is one of the best written characters. the cordyceps virus they used in the game is a real virus i'm certain insects in the jungles of amazon's. the ants actually grow fungus from their brains and it takes over their functions completely.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-13,"don't worry! this game was very new for us too. we all struggled with finding loot and getting lost in the puzzles. biggest tip i can give is to remember the developers use hints like light and yellow to show you where to go next. sometimes when i got lost  i'd stop, look around, and try to think where i'd expect joel to go if i was watching a movie. lastly  don't get discouraged! there's a few areas that i was hopelessly lost in until i googled it. you're a much better player than i could be with my patience"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-16,"been gaming for 30 years and will happily play on lower difficulties when im just not feeling it. id rather enjoy my limited time in a game than get stuck or frustrated for hours. no shame at all, were here for the story."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-13,it's happy to see elders playing new video games as a youngster. like this person does. i think that he has experienced the world before the birth of video games. it seems that he has experienced video games from his earliest days till now. we all agree that video games are now as advanced as other forms of entertainment. it's very satisfying for me to see the reaction of someone who has experienced video games from scratch. good gameplay sir!! love and respect from sri lanka!

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-11,"this is the 2022 remake of the 2013 game, it's pretty much the same as the original in every aspect except that the graphics are better. however, it's worth noting the original had some of the best graphics i've seen in game and holds up very well even today, and probably did not need a remake but it's alright because the remake looks great too!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-19,ive watched this video for three seconds and i love this man.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-18,as arthur morgan said once shit... dumb move...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-16,ellie kills a wlf soldier  thats the whole game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-14,finally parents can say its because of that damn phone and it would make sense
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-13,put on guard duty face away from the only direction an enemy can infiltrate have earphones in so you can't hear anyone splashing behind you fight back against someone who has a knife to your neck this girl wanted to die.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-22,the sound of psvita dropping on the floor hurts my soul
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-16,that girl was playing hotline miami editthank you guys for the likes
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-05,"revenge is a fool's game arthur morgan, 1899."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-10,the fact that ellie didn't pick up the psvita instantly made me realize that i wasn't playing the same character from the first game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-29,imagine dying before finishing that goddamn level on hotline miami
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-01,the sad thing is ellie didnt even take the damn psvida she likes that shit
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-19,the fact that ellie wasnt going to kill her till she made that wrong move.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-11,"bro really killed her mid hotline miami level, the disrespect is crazy smh."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-12,i like how ellie just holds her arm there for a moment staring at her like seriously bro? and then easily kills her
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-23,ellie literally went on a mad killing spree and then spared the one person she was supposed to kill. this game is just perfect
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-11,she couldve just lived if she didnt attack ellie. you can see ellies expression after stabbing her that she didnt want to do that but the soldier left her no choice.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-26,she was playing hotline miami how could you do this?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-27,its nice to think that ellie is holding whitney back with just one hand while whitney was struggling with both
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-22,ellie's that was dumb is comedy gold
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-19,eli was content letting that lady live that was purely selfdefense
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-04,ellie kills 1000 people for getting to abby when she gets to her nah i'm going to be a saint now and forgive you for killing my father figure
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-10,"ellie hunting down abby spare no one  ellie finally having abby at her mercy remember thorfin, you have no enemies"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-23,she really just killed someones and said  oh that was dumb
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-10,when you ask what time is it in london
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-17,this girl enjoy playing psp in the middle of zombie apocalypse
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-30,so we arent going to have a talk about ellies reflexes?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-09,ellie vs ellie live action
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-19,damn playstation really likes putting their old i like it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-11,yeah... hearig those final words as you bleed out.... seriously a woe is me moment
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-08,the sad part is everytime u get what u want you would let them live but they try doing something that forces u to kill them
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-09,"yeah, that was really dumb."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-15,thank you for being badass and not blurring out the violence.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-12,playing hotline miami really got her confident in fighting back  rip the psvita though
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-14,imagine attacking the person who has a knife against your throat. big brain time.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-15,surprised ellie didnt give her joels interrogation method of starting to kill her because shes taking a few seconds too long to answer
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-03,from playing games to being dead in a minute weird
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-10,"that's not just any wlf soldier, that's.... uh.... who tf is that"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-17,ellie if all of salt lake crew will protect abby then all of salt lake crew will die. also ellie we must be better spares abby
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-09,ayo let her live she playing hotline miami thats goated af
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-27,bro was just enjoying her game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-16,ive always felt bad about killing her she just wanted to play her game in peace
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-14,i feel like wearing earbuds in the apocalypse is begging to get yourself killed
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-12,she rlly poked her ahh  like she was putting a key into a doorknob
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-21,"the fact that ellie didn't manage to kill abby in the end is one of the most heartbreaking and realistic things in this game. she didn't do it because all this time, she wasn't looking for revenge so much but more precisely for a culprit. someone on whom she could pour out all the distress she feels since the loss of joel. but this hatred ended up eating away at her from the inside and destroyed the one joel loved like his child. and because she realized that it would never bring him back, she didn't kill abby. because otherwise, it would mean that she's definitely no longer joel's beloved daughter. and because of that, ellie understood that the person she was most angry with was not abby for killing joel, but her for not being able to save her father. what a heartbreaking moral."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-12,ellie described the entire game at the end there.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-25,let's be honest in this apocalypse world and this group killed ur precious one we would just end up ending all of them
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-11,imagine playing a game with your friends and you hear that on mic
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-31,that was dumb my reaction to nearly every interaction in part 2
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-12,love how in her last breath she still criticized how she tried to handle the situation. lol i mean she is definitely qualified to do so.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-16,ellie really said the fawking audacity!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-13,"if you know this quote, tell it to the motion capture actor for ellie. snake, try to remember some of the basics in cqc"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-17,she didn't hear the water but she heard he whisper
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-16,ellie looked so offended
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-28,imagine being able to take the ps vita and play it in certain scenes and in freetime edit with this many likes i'll be 5 dollars closer to making more moneh for dutch
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-20,she really thought she can get away when ellie id standing there
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-24,bro though she was the main character
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-14,"when ellie stab her in the neck, i felt that"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-10,she gave her a chance to run but rather try to stab her. that group just doesn't understand this chicks craziness
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-31,never knew i needed a lou2 clip with badass background music until today
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-24,"you can't just kill someone without letting them finish hotline miami, that's a crime"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-19,the best part is that she's playing hotline miami
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-02,its kinda funny how ellies fully willing to just let people live but when she goes to put her weapon away they try to kill her.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-14,the fact that she was the only one she was gonna let live
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-12,really shows how much she changed after joel died
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-12,"she thought that allie would have killed her anyway, and perhaps she was right."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-10,"tells the information she wants then gets herself stabbed, top of the line survivor here folks"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-01,that goodnight is the best part of this.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-30,she shouldve heard the water
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-20,ellie before confronting abby literally goes on a fucking crusade ellie confronting abby have you heard of the high elves?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-20,and im like meanwhile with abby like i dont know who has it worse in the hospital abi having to fight the rat king or eli taking on the wolves?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-08,that wlf soldier definitely looks like ellie live action actress
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-03,this shit was brutal when i first played it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-22,theres no way ellie wouldve killed someone chillin on their psp. why tf she even attack
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-27,ellie killed her that easy it was almost like she was playing a game...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-29,"i like how instead of every other game making guards deaf to all noise they gave her headphones so she couldn't hear, that's some great detail"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-20,tbh i knew she went through special military training as soon as she calmly started saying easy easy
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-15,she was playing hotline miami because she wanted to be in a better game than tlou2
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-29,gurl woulda been still alive if she didn't fight back
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-26,"the way she stood there in shock, like what did i do you did exactly what you know you wanted lol"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-02,maybe im tripping but it looks like ellie mightve spared her if she didnt attack
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-15,"love how she kills the dude who held the golf club, opened the door, watched to make sure no one broke in while abby killed joel. but when it's time for abby, she can't do it"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-30,oh i hated it when i had to get rid of her man omfg she was just wanting to game why did you have to try fighting ellie girl? just play the game and say she knocked your ass out
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-10,the only reason im wearing headphones in a apocalypse is if im in the home base
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-11,whats messed up is that ellie was gonna spare her life and at most knock her out but she went and get herself killed.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-06,after all of this and killing all these ppl she just simply forgives her.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-15,that was completely on her bruh. ain't no way you didn't hear ellie come out of the water loud as hell
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-05,i actually feel bad for her she was just playing her game and 30 seconds later she got stabbed in the throat
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-07,"so underwhelming compared to the first one, shes all ruthless out for revenge against abby, then lets her live and forgives her at the end  but shell kill people brutally like in this video"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-14,how our girl has grown from a girl who hides from clickers to a freakin badass woman... i'm proud of her
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-19,ellie was thinking for a sec if she would kill her or not until she decided
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-10,that was dumb sounded so cold
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-15,"that's wendy. you may remember her from fob. playing hard,but great game with nice tunes. as she goes away,abbygailabby's full namesaysfucking videogames. i am not sure when is it that abby calls her like that. is it then or perhaps earlier on stadium. either way it's missable i believe."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-17,i thought i left my mp3 on for a sec there lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-15,the hotline miami music bopping in the background
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-10,"ellie, the masculine daughter that joel wanted"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-11,the soldier looks like ellie from the series
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-14,never have both headphones in an apocalypse
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-04,i just realized she looks like the show version of ellie
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-08,my mom was watching me play this and she said that was dumb at the same time as ellie  shit was
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-20,show did this scene pretty well but i think that theres something about the voice actors that made this scene literally fucking perfect in the game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-20,"everyone talks about the shove or mighty thin ice but the way ellie's voice cracks with the word scared is absolutely heartbreaking and a great acting choice from ashley johnson. ellie tries so hard to act strong because she's constantly trying to imitate joel, but this monologue shows that she's still just a child who desperately craves a parental figure in her life."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-03,"one of the most impactful scenes in video game history, now even better"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-10-11,i love the way joel says you're treading on some might thin ice. he sounds like father talking to her daughter who's in trouble.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-31,"the animation in the remake is actually insane. theres so much subtlety in their facial expressions, having that level of fidelity in a video game actually blows my mind. 3 years from now ill be proven wrong, but it legit feels like there are no compromises here."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-20,"the show did incredibly well, but this is the scene. the subtleties from troy and ashley is what brings this to life. one of, if not, the best game performances i've ever seen, hands down."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-10-21,if hbo doesn't get this scene right they have lost everyone
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-11-11,is this really all they had to worry about? boys? movies? deciding which shirt goes with which skirt? really puts things in perspective.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-02,ellies everyone i have cared for has either died or left me line hits way way too close to home for me.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-10-07,"this scene looks so much better in the remake. in comparison to the original, this looks so much better. jesus."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-20,had to come back to this specific scene after tonights episode
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-17,this cutscene almost made me cry and that show this game is a master piece
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-29,i watch this scene at least once a week. and it always makes me emotional. absolute perfection
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-13,mentioning sarah was a big moment for joel. that was probably the first time anyone had mentioned her in 20 years and joel hadnt fully came to grips with her death. only ellie helped him move on and rediscover his humanity.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-27,"i like how at 151 you can see the subtle change in ellies face when joel says youre not my daughter. its sad because you can tell that in her mind ellie fully knows that she can never be as good as sarah. even through she knew that, it was more heartbreaking for her to hear joel say that to her face upfront"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-10-07,"everyone i've ever cared for has either died or left me. everyone except for you, so don't tell me i'd be better off with someone else because the truth is i would just be more scared. man.."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-15,just incredible to me how much harder it is to do video game acting. these actors are strapped in goofy ass tracking suits in a plain ass warehouse providing oscar worthy performances. the big stars in the adaptation could not do it justice with their whole set and costumes. if only they were allowed to actually look at the performance in the game they could have known the standard.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-26,"i've noticed a difference in this scene between the original version and this remake besides the obvious ones lol. when tommy bursts into the room joel doesn't move, he just looks at ellie's eyes resolutely, like if there was nothing else around them. on the other hand, the original ps3 version shows how joel instantly reacts at tommy's action and looks back at him. it's a little detail but i think it does make a difference wrapping up this emotional scene"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-01,"what blows my mind watching this is that the scene is less than 2 minutes long. holy crap, this is my favorite scene in the game."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-21,"the show did this scene justice i thinkalmost wordforword, accounting for inshow circumstances. but despite getting everything rightthe words, the actingsomehow troy baker and ashley johnson's delivery is so emotionally spoton that even pedro pascal and bella ramsey couldn't quite match up to it. i remember crying in this cutscene from both their deliveries and the deep understanding of the hurt each character is experiencing definitely the same feeling in the show, but i don't know... maybe because i was expecting it? had such high expectations? i was somewhat let down. this versionthe ingame versionis and always will be perfection."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-13,still makes me tear up to this day
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-09,135 absolutely f'ing phenomenal delivery on this line. crazy goosebumps!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-02,"what i like about this remake scene is that at the end of his conversation where tommy enters, joel keeps looking at ellie, while in the original when tommy arrives he looks away."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-10-18,finally i can see ellie's tears more the than the original
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-15,that mighty thin ice line is god damn perfect
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-31,the quality in this upgrade. you can see ellie's eyes water a bit. so good!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-22,i know what happens but every time i watch this im on the edge on my seat holding sobs. brilliant acting. brilliant performance. brilliant game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-20,"they did a great job with scene in the show! my only wish from this episode is that they didn't rush the university, but this was well done"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-05,"ellie everyone i have cared for has either died or left me. joel died, dina left. we feel for you ellie. we feel for you every day."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-22,"i think the show did this scene brilliantly but theres something about troy and ashleys perfomance that just makes me tear up every single time, nothing can beat the emotion and acting from the game."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-15,remake or not this is one of the greatest scenes in game history
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-19,i hope the hbo series doesnt butcher this scene. this scene is perfect
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-26,this scene always hits me fuing hard
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-20,"i remember hearing that ashley johnson improvised the push during cking except for you. and they liked it so much, they included it in the live action scene."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-23,"hbo version is about an 810 this is an 1110, the emotional gut punch just lands better here."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-07,this is the best cut scene in video games ever
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-15,andjelkovic dennis  katsuu !!!!! otsutsuki style 16.05.2023 1600
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-20,"it's great that the series is so committed to the game, no disrespect to pedro and bella but no doubt that the game performance is much better. still first the car scene and then this were important scenes for me and they both killed it. engaging in the game is great and excites me."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-15,this scene makes me tear up every single time!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-14,can we just have a moment of pity for the bandits that ran in the house with joel and tommy sidebyside together they never had a chance.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-21,"i feel like this scene from the show fell a bit flat, but i'm also aware a large part of that is nostalgia. same with sarah's death or the car scene with the porn mag. i can always just hear these original line deliveries in my head and it's distracting. it's like the uncanny valley, but with recreations of memorable scenes instead of robots. it looks and sounds very close to the thing it's mimicking, but not quite. the scenes that have so far hit the hardest in the show have been the ones that surprise me, like bill and frank's story or sam telling ellie that he's infected. just proves that just stick to the game isn't always the right choice."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-30,"this scene is just so amazing, the subtle facial expressions with the new animation, the voice cracking and voice changes. everyone talks about ellies voice cracking but joel going from being angry and standoffish while arguing to able to cry when he said i got 2 walking in is heartbreaking."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-28,"this scene better be an exact shot for shot, word for word remake in the tv show. if not, i'm rioting."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-20,pov you came here after watching episode 6.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-22,after part 2 this scene hits harder than ever because everyone she has ever cared about has died and left her. everyone including joel.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-27,"having now watched both old and new versions of this scene only just got around to my first playthrough in the past couple of weeks, it's interesting how much more body language there is in the remaster. the way joel's head rather trembles on mighty thin ice and know what loss is, the way ashley's voice cracks a little on scared, there's so much more emotion in this scene than just the words being said. i absolutely wanted to whack joel one here and give ellie a hug, not gonna lie."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-07,gotta be one of the best written scenes in any medium
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-13,"its hard for me to show people this without context and expect them to feel. i genuinely welled up watching this for the first time playing. i showed my fiancewho watches the show and she was like uh ok. im like dude, ive spent 12 hours with these two getting closer and closer, and i thought joel was gonna take her in and keep her. and joel just refuses to open up and let her in. its a total 180 from what youre expecting. at this point theres only a few hours of gameplay left"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-18,this scene is unmatched
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-20,fun fact both troy baker and ashley johnson have said that this is their favorite scene from the game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-16,i'm very excited to see this scene in the show!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-25,"powerful moment, which they played almost word for word in the tv version."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-21,l for joel ngl... so outta pocket. you know nothing about loss the 14 years old girl all alone knows nothing about loss ? joel.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-15,troy and ashley are such amazing actors. ill always prefer the game and its acting vs. the show
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-17,hbo absolutely massacred this scene in the show.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-03,the broll of this scene is amazing. ashley and troy killed it.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-11,the show didnt do this scene justice. the acting is sooo much better here!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-23,"i love this scene so much, ashley and troy are able to convey so much emotion in their acting. i watched the hbo version, it was fine i guess, but the scene in the game just feels so natural and emotional. naughty dog cooked so hard with this game!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-24,this scene is soo well done. this and ellie and joel's talk in the flashback of tlou2 are the best cutscenes i have ever seen.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-15,the acting in this game is better than a lot of movies.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-26,037 the acting is so good ellie's reaction is really relatable and what most of us think when someone says something to dodge the point
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,147 cried here
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-12,"this game is perfection, a whole feeling."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-05,aww ellie
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-14,"hbo did this very well, pedro and bella killed it. but nothing tops the emotion in this scene from the game, especially with the updated graphics of the remake"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-20,"so i think they did a fairly good job with it in the show, but they messed up two things my view 1 they didn't really have the impact of ellie realizing that joel was going to pawn her off. she realizes, but it didn't feel the same to me because she doesn't run off. they should have had joel and tommy chatting and then someone busts in and says there's an attack on the dam, a firefight, and then ellie realizes she's being pawned off and steals a horse. having her not run away meant the dialogue about her not realizing how important she is, she's disappointed in joel, etc., didn't apply and therefore was cut. also, there wasn't any tension that she's going to get caught by raiders or infected. 2 they gave joel the physical ailments excuse. they didn't need to. it gives him a veneer of legitimacy to wanting tommy to take her. the whole i'm getting old, i'm having panic attacks, i'm slower stuff from the episode actually kinda makes sense from a survival standpoint. in the game, joel is perfectly fine. he just doesn't want to take her. he's damaged as hell and doesn't want the reminder of sarah, and wants to just continue barely existing in the qz in boston. this comes to a head when ellie calls him on his bullshit tommy knows this area better and then they finally get down to the real shit. to me, that's what made this scene so impactful in the game. joel is keeping her at a huge distance the whole time, she feels like she's getting under the tough guy exterior, and then she realizes she really hasn't, and that crushes her. and then ultimately, joel sees how much it crushes her, and it crushes him, and that starts to open him up. again, i'd say they mostly got it. especially the acting. i think pedro and bella have been great. the show has been awesome overall. but this kinda bugged me, mostly because i felt they made a few changes that didn't add much and totally changed the dynamic."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-23,ellies quote for me hits so close to home everytime
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-04,"to be fair joel lost a lot more than ellie did he lost his daughter, his belongings, his life, his home, his friends, and he was worried he'd just lose ellie too ellie was born into the infection so the loss is less severe but ellie sure does learn loss in part 2"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,this is better performance than the tv show
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-09,neil druckman nailed on the writing and ashley and troy were amazing
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-09,joel's face when ellie told him about sarah
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-26,"this is way better than in the show. and the reason is that they have trimmed down the conversation. they should not have removed a single word, and also kept that she ran away."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-21,"joel in the show just doesnt feel like the same character as his video game counterpart , and this scene from the game just perfectly sums up joels entire character up to this point"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-21,thank you man i will use this for my edit
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-20,whos here after the shows version?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-11,joel has survived this long in the apocalypse and he isnt afraid to beat down on clickers or bandits. but this scene shows what joel fears the most ellie. ellie even asked him what are you do afraid of? i cant get infected! most of us know that joel is having daughter feelings for ellie and hes trying to brush her off to tommy so he doesnt crawl even deeper into those feelings. joel lost one daughter before and hes doing all he can to avoid that situation from happening again. amazing performance from troy baker and ashley johnson!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-22,after seeing the episode i feel like the godfather meme look how they massacred my boy
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-20,"i've seen this on episode 7 and i gotta say they did well on it but wasn't as good as the original scene. joel in the series makes it feel he has a straight face while not having too much of an angry reaction and ellie didn't seemed to be too emotional. just my opinion. in the game,ellie was so emotional that even the actress was holding her tears in or something."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-01,mighty thin ice here that line hits hard wish they had that in the tv show
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-28,its a shame we didnt get anything like this in the second one
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-22,came here after episode 6... holy shit man...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-20,"the show did alright with this scene. while it was good. this is something that should have been word for wordbesides her running away. i find i keep having the same feelings every episode. it feels like they are just rushing through. there's power and strong emotion in each piece here. i also think they missed out at the end of the episode. when joel gets hurt in the game. is a very important scene to me. it was the moment where ellie came into her own. she got joel up. helped carry him to the horse. killed the attackers and got him up on the horse. showed she was capable of keeping both of them alive. while they kind of did it in the show, it really missed the punch it could have had"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-18,they shouldve let ellie let go some tear drops after she said  i would just be more scared wouldve been perfect ! 130
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-24,"you cant out do this scene.. troy and ashely did such an amazing job, def one of their most iconic scenes together."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2022-09-15,why does joel look like he is a second away from the grave
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-12,"what makes it even better is that the shove wasn't scripted, ashley just thought it would be a good fit and she was damn right it was"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-27,so perfect. i can barely blame hbo for not getting it exactly right.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-26,1 minute and i'm sobbing.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,136 i really felt it when ellie said this.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-28,fuck man. everytime i see this scene i start to cry. such a powerful scene.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-21,cant wait to see this scene in the show
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-26,me to the people who vape in middle school 025
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-20,just watched this scene after watching episode 6 to compare. the feels...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-24,this scene is better than the hbo show.... is fucking crazy how the voice actors really put some emotions in their voices
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-31,ff that push from ellie was improv by ashley johnson
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-26,absolute peak voice acting and mocap merging to create the best possible scene.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-07,"everyoe's comparing them to see who's had it worse, but they missed the point that they both went through pain in their own, different ways. even if losing a child is worse, their pain is both valid and both different in their own ways!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-02-23,"i think the show didnt do this scene well like everyone else said, but i feel like we got an even better scene with joel and tommy where joel lets his emotions out. i think that scene worked way better to bring the audience closer to joel. in the game you feel close to joel by default because you are him, in the show thats not a given."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-11-11,you have no idea what loss is. man that line just hits so cold. because hes right. most of us really dont have a clue what loss is unless we experience it for ourselves.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-09,"shame that some folks will only ever see the tv version of this scene. don't get me wrong, the show has its charm, but it holds nothing to the game when putting them side by side. god damn this game is just fantastic."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-06,"if neil is out, then i'm in. if he's in, then i'm out."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,i just need a game where joel is still alive! idc if im picking apples as joel for hours on end just somehow resurrect that man!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,"tlou 2 had an ending that doesn't necessarily need a third game. bro, its the other way around. it was a totally open ending and it left me with several questions. it needs a third game."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-08,let's hope we don't lol. not everything needs to be a trilogy. part ii's ending was a great send off
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,if the first one is about love and bonding and the second one is about vengeance and hatred the third one can be about forgiveness and peace
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-08,betting on a flop to abandon a secured w. so typical of nail drunkard.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,"i think i speak for everyone when i say part 3 absolutely needs to happen, theres just far too many loose ends in the franchise to leave us without a conclusion, even if it means ellie finally getting her surgery at the end"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-06,i hope we dont get another one
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-06,"the story sucked. but, we forget how amazing the gameplay was  best gameplay i have ever experienced. i would love a part 3. especially if they did a prequel and we got to play as joel and tommy."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,oh no! what are we gonna do! anyways....
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,i call bs honestly. theres just too much money sony will force it even if he doesnt want it which i doubt is the case. they are also actively promoting intergalactic rn.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-08,they can just do one without joel and ellie.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,well with what happened during the whole story of the last of us 2 we shouldn't have got that either
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,"i would like to see the third game take place from the view of henry and sam from part one, and the events that lead them to meeting ellie and joel"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,oh no! anyway monster hunter wilds is pretty cool so far
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,"respectfully, we never needed tlos 2 to begin with, a third one would be pointless."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain i guess
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,"a game could potentially be more expensive than an entire season so cost wise, this may make sense."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,he also said the exact same thing after last of us part one
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-15,i feel like theyre gonna change hbos season two and probably make a part 3 with the changes from the series instead of the game.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,there needs to be a prequel to tlou 1
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,"we still have tommy and bill and ellie and abby, so they should finish the story"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-12,"didnt he previously say he didnt want a 3rd game? besides if neil wants it to end wher eit did, thats good, look at kojima who constantly wanted to stop making more metal gear solid games only for konami to make him do it anyways"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-17,"i may pre order a game 1 or 2 times a year! most people are scared of preorders due to huge disappointments but personally i dont regret any of my pre orders because i only do it when i have that gut feeling a game will turn out good even when most are suspicious! sh2 was the most recent! the reason for this is because i dont make a lot of money so i only buy games i know will be good or if from a company i trust like fromsoft or capcom which i dont even need to research! only ever was disappointed by 1 pre order which was 1 of only 2 games that ended up being disappointments! the 2nd one im speaking of was tlou2 but i didnt pre order it for whatever reason but it didnt matter because i didnt look up any of the leaks prior to the release. usually thats a good thing but not in this case! i ended up buying part 2 at walmart 1 day after release so i got to experience this horrible sequel first hand. nd was one of my favorite game companies throughout the ps3 era but the last of us was by far their best game  still one of the best single player experiences in all of gaming imo! part 2 had the potential of being one of the greatest games ever honestly, all it needed was a few talented writers! hell ive seen youtube vids with alternate stories for part 2 that were 10 times better then the actual game lol! joel was one of my favorite characters but i l expected him to possibly die prior to part 2s release but like in the middle of the game, going out like a badass! nope we got the most unrealistic  disrespectful death ever thanks to neil druckmann. after amy hennig  bruce straley left all of nds talent did as well. neil is just an average skilled writer who clearly just wants to be included into the big hollywood club and known as some big film director! just like the rest of hollywood hes just an activist pushing his political ideology into games! hes the perfect example of whats wrong with modern gaming!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,"neil himself said that he wont push the story out of himself. if he wont come up with anything he thinks would be a good part 3, he just wont do it. the same was applied to the part 2. i personally would be glad to play part 3, but if this is it, then i can say that i had a great time and i will miss it. one of the best single player games i have ever played."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,they should of kept going with factions 2 would of kept the game relevant for years like number one...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-15,they messed up the 2nd game so bad sales probably concerned sony
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,part 1 deserves a real part 2. what drunkman made was trash.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,so no more uncharted or the last of us? naught dog is over
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,"not long ago he said there is another story. neil and naught dog are known to lie to throw the scent off, just look at the tlou2 marketing with the jesse joel switch and bait. not to mention they are suppose to be marketing the heretic prophet right now not revealing tlou3. i would put money on there being a part 3."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,"everyone who says part ii was a great ending. youre very wrong. the game ended with ellie sparing abby and lev after seeing that she was about to make someone  lev  fly solo. since lev was a traitor to the seraphites, abbys friends are all dead and the wlf sees her as a traitor too. it also ended with ellies family leaving her and being gone for months, leading to dina thinking that she died and left her to raise jesse jr by herself. theres still more to the story. ellie still has to get back to her family, apologize to tommy. theres even more to do with abby too. whats next for abby and lev? these are all things that can happen in part iii. but i can see why people think part ii could be an ending to the story. you can make lots of theories to help see what happened to ellie after the events of part ii. theres still lots to go for part iii and possibly a finale to the story in part iv."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,"ive played the last of us part 1 and 2 and im disappointed to hear that they might not make a part 3. but it kind of makes sense why because last of us part 2 had a lot of mixed reviews, but the thing about it is that part 2 sold very well. so who knows"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,i need last of us 3 indeed
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,i think the last of us should continue the last of us through the tv series
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,"i think the only real way to end this franchise is to bring joel back into the game and do a happy ending full of raw action. otherwise, i really don't see what other direction the game could go with these characters in the story without going in a completely third direction and out of context."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,"the only last of us that need to happen, is joel before 20 years skip that we saw in the first game  without gay shit in the game"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,the man is just too scared to fuck it up  he knows it. he's scared that the fans will target him again
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,why is everyone talking about lou3 when lou2 doesnt even exist? they have to make the second one first
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,to be honest it needs to be a part 3
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-07,hopefully the druckmann comment is a misdirection leading to a surprise tlou3 announcement down the line
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,he is going to finish part 3
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,which is it? it is or it isnt? word from credible sources says it been in production for quite sometime now
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-12,i guess ellie will die if part lll comes out
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,would be nice if we could finally get last of us part 2 on pc
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,after part 3 that's going to be the last game i believe
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-15,hate how everyone focus on that bullshit but don't listen to him saying they already worked out a story for tommy and hint at it at book store at beginning everyone needs to quit complaining and wait like a grown azz adult and wait to see what happens quit being so selfish and self righteous it'd not your game just a fan of it and pissed because you don't get what you want.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-07,"if they dont come out with the last of us part three then truly, they are the worst game company ever, and they know how to ostracized and alienate all of their fan base, and in one fell swoop will destroy the success of their company"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"the last of us part 2 is not a bad game in terms of mechanics and visuals..but its almost the worst since they just disrespected joel star wars style. i didnt mind abby being unlikeable, but the joel part really got me hating the sequel."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,"the last of us 1 had an ending that didnt need another game, the game shouldnt have happened"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,"i would like to see a new game in the last of us world with new characters , new locations and new gameplay style instead of making a new last of us game.. i don't want to see more stories of the original characters, drag their stories and ruin their storyline."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,sony doesnt talk about games until theyre 2 years or less off anymore. this is just marketing. there will 100 be a lou 3.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,good decision. a good series is a serise which is not streched. and leave some mysteries. have u guys ever noticed last episode of any webseries is the least rated of most of the times. and this series ending with a hit is all i needed
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-14,there's always rockstar
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,sniff... it's a beautiful thing isn't it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,people are so stupid  this dude lied to you several times. do you really think theyd pass up the chance to create a third installment for one of the most influential games ever? good lord.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,that's the biggest lie ever. there's no way they don't make another one. they've remade the same games over and over again. you telling me they don't want to make another one get out of here lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-08,thank god part 2 was dog water
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-11,he knows he fucked up by killing joel off. nobody likes abby. lol. terrible writing.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-21,that's a lie what he said
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-19,tlou 2s story telling wasnt that great. graphics were an absolute 1010 though.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-07,im kinda tired of these cinematic movies as games from naughty dog. i kinda want something that has actual gameplay depth and not just stuff to pad out the cutscenes cause neil wanted to make movies. give me sokething like crash or jak and daxter over cinematic experiences.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,good
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-07,
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,oh no! anyway...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-08,sorry but good . after 2 i dont want a 3rd
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-09,bullshit there will be a 3
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-20,well tlou2 was pretty bad and destroyed what made the 1st so great. a third would be dumb
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-18,good i loved part 1 part 2 was mid
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,the last of us 2 was great just a bad story telling just dont killl joel and make 2 campaigns about ellie and abby not 1 mixing the 2 because you loose way too many momentum to be honest
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-13,"dude, working for naughty dog is my dream job and it became my dream job becuase of the last of us 1 and part 2 with how beautiful the ruins are to how everytime a character talks it feels like im watching a live recording, he'll i love how just by introducing the shamblers and ratking opens up so many possibilities for new infected. just those two games alone have shown me that video games can be a form of art the possibilities and creativity being litteraly endless so no matter if drukman leaves or last of us gets forgotten i'll even try to make the third game myself becuase this series deserves to go out with a bang!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-10,part two wasnt bad the gameplay was really good and its not like the story was complete crap all that bad propaganda turned everyone sheep

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-30,in the ps4 version the clicker just gives the runner a nice little tickle
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-10,runner probably saying friendly fire! friendly fire!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-06,"there's alot of mechanical upgrades part 1 gets from part ii, such as shooting enemies in the knees for a easy melee kill, destroying glass as a noise distraction and some other shit im definitely missing"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-20,joel just puts his arm on the runners mouth
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-10,"i tried this during the car pushing sequence with bill and was able to pull one off, then bill just finishes off the damn runner and i was so damn pissed off"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-30,tasty snack?  ellie
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-31,the clicker just gives the runner a tiny chomp
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-06,"awesome detail there, definitely excited to play it on my ps5, subbed!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-01,most of last of us pt 2 mechanics are brought to the ps5 remastered just not all of them like dodging i think
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-22,"its not something to rely on though, sometimes the clicker just goes around you and kills you instead"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-27,this is awesome  thank you for noticing this!!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-19,"proud of you, so smart boi"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-10,"as someone who only owns a ps4 i got recently and am too poor for a ps5 and just started to play tlou1 and 2, this is really sad for me cause im a  when it comes to zombie horror and i tried this on my ps4 and it didnt work and i died. i actually started crying and screaming for my brother to do the section for me because i was too scared"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-20,ps4 still has that uncharted 3 look
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-13,this is why i can't wait to get a ps5 and get it again so i can play the first game with all the cool mechanics from the 2nd game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-03,"that was something they first made in the last of us 2. ya know, the game everyone hates for no reason lol"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-24,the dodge also a cool and very helpful uprade in ps5
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-13,you can also do that in tlou 2
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-15,on the second one on both devices you could feed them to the clickers
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-05,and bottles actually stun clickers for more than .000001 seconds in part one as opposed to the ps4 version
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-10,i still dont know which button to use to drop a runner or wolf or something if you have caught em
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-02,as a ps4 slim owner i am extremely jealous
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-20,that could be stalkers and runners
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-16,"worth the 70 dollar price tag, for sure"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-03,and i thought the spiderman ps5 exclusive was predatory business practice
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-30,"tried this on tlou2 and it didnt work. made me sad, glad to see it works in part 1 aka a full remaster on ps5"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-08,this upgrade is in the last of us 2 too
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-04,this is the only upgrade
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-21,oh ok now it worth 70
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-10,"thats it, take my 70. im feeding some clickers"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-25,that mechanic was from part 2
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-27,in the last of us 2 dis feature came out
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-31,this has been a think for awhile now since part 2 youre just playing the same game but on part 2s engine
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-19,"the most greatest games of all time tlou 1 and tlou2, i don't even like the other games besides of these two."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-10,me on ps4 playing the last of us remastered right now
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-10,im sorry. you can hold off a clicker at all?!!?!!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-03,i never knew because i never grabbed them i always killed em right away lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-30,meanwhile me waiting for the bug fixes and performance improvements so the game can atleast run on my potato laptop in 720p60fps
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-09,hows that even possible lore wise? doesnt the clicker sense who is infected? or it attacks anything which makes noise?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-07,wow beat the game on grounded with never doin this
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-29,i could have sworn you could do this in the ps3 edition
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-30,im pretty sure this was implemented in last of us 2
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-08,is this feature available in lous part 2 in ps4
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-29,i wish this was on xbox bro
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-05,definitely worth 70
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-19,you just dont get alot of opportunities to do it in the first game sadly.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-25,what about part 2?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-13,yea thats really 60 dollars worth good job naughty dog
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-30,in part 2 on ps4 clicker just eat him
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-15,maybe they should fix the pc version
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-16,they shoulda added in factions again but we all know that will never happen.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-05,ps4 version needs a update for those who cant afford a new concel and 60 game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-03,its not work only on ps4 if its not remastered for playstation 4
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-17,but the remake on ps4 it still workd
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-27,but they couldnt put prone and a dodge button
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-09,yeah this is based from last of us 2 good mechanic
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-12,it works on the ps3
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-12,it works on my ps 4
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-02,bro i played this on ps3
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-12,i haf no idea about this
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-05,you can do that on the ps3
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-09,"disagree. this can be useful, but it's very contextdependent. gyro aim is the best addition in the remake imo, it allows for much more precision while aiming once you get used to it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-25,does it work on part 2? now i have to try it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-01,you can actually play the last of us remake on ps4
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-13,dose this happen on pc?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-13,you can also kill infected by kicking them in the remake.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-07,wait does that work on pc??
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-03,"also cool that they removed factions, and then cancelled factions 2. awesome upgrades...."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-15,"isn't this a remaster, not a remake?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-23,no... i have a ps4 and the clickers will grab and bite a runner or stalker or normal enemy ..
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-31,ps4 can do the same thing
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-12,no dodge
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-09,ps4 makes more sense
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-26,i'm still not buying it
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-28,"thats the coolest upgrade? no new mapssections, which would not change the storyline? no new weapons? no new mechanics? i gotta be honest, nd up doing games but remakes? jaysus mate"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-05,how?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-13,you can use it? lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-06,"yeah man, really worth the 70. picked up a used copy of the ps4 version for 10"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-20,still remake is nothing but a cashgrab
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-28,the same as the part
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-19,"bunch of bs, they do a remake and thats the best thing? how about adding more to tge story line, explore tess's life, give something new, just a money grab by naughty dog"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-27,lmao this game isnt even that scaring or hard tbh great story game tho
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-27,bushit
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-09,because no one wants to play part 2
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-31,"the last of us part 1 is a remastered not remake, which was previously done in 2014 is a next gen port not remastered, dude they build the game from the ground up, they did not use the old engine graphics, they even use the latest engine graphics the proprietary engine that they use in the last of us part 2 , will remain the same they use proprietary

new northlight engineiw engine a whole engine change about cod mw12 but they will use the old and new asset from the original source.... the version on ps4 of 2014 is the next gen made it worse. they still didn't improve it in one of the worse games anyway path of the original ps3, it is the port, not just called the last of us remastered in 2014, because of the fraudulent release because by sony

are not included in the faithful remake because remastered are using the same engine and they did not built the game from the ground up. merged engine with the old engine and new engine from a whole engine change or new engine which makes are still consider as remaster just like alan wake remasteredcall of duty modern warfare 12 remastered and nier replicant this are the beyond remaster they are not remake remastered and remake are not only much different, remastered is for enhancing, hd textures, hd picture quality, whole engine change mechanics or new engine which makes, upgrades and lighting or motion capture acting, and remake is for creating another and creating new graphics or new motion capture data a westerner who did will play the original. the last of us part i was released on september 2, 2022. there is has upgrade path from the ps3 and ps4 versions of the game to the ps5 remastered. the last of us part i is a new game  a groundup remastered of the original the last of us, rebuilt on naughty dog's updated ps5 engine and technology. still considered call of duty modern warfare 12 since the new engine is still remastered and nier replicant from a whole engine change or new engine which makes naughty dog released several downloadable content additions the last of us left behind adds a singleplayer campaign following ellie and her best friend, riley. a port version, the last of us port the last of us remastered but it is a fraudulent release, but they made it worse. they still didn't improve it in one of the worse games anyway, was next gen released for the playstation 4 in july 2014.a a remastered, the last of us part i, was released in september 2022 for playstation 5 and in march 2023 for windows. a sequel, the last of us part ii, was released in 2020. the last of us part i right is a remastered of the last of us left, featuring revised gameplay, updated character models, and improved lighting effects, but still considered as call of duty modern warfare 12 remastered and nier replicant from the new engine which makes. the last of us part i is a remastered of the 2013 video game the last of us, an actionadventure game played from a thirdperson perspective. the ps5 version is the last of us part 1 however, rather than another lighttouch port, this was a complete remastered from the ground up designed to take advantage of the new hardware still considered like call of duty modern warfare 12 remastered and nier replicant from a whole engine change or new engine which makes a unfaithful remastered of the original it is a remastered in the technology sense of the word, not the story or the characters, they didn't even use new motion capture data, we know that. sony and naughty dog consider it some of remastered, because the actual next gen is the ps4 port. the 2014 port is a next gen, part 1 remastered. so remastered and remake are not just much different. remake is to create another one, create new graphics or new motion capture data while remastered is for enhanced, hd image quality textures, new whole engine change or new engine which makes, upgrades and lighting or motion capture acting, because not only is it called the last of us remastered, when sony and naughty dog fraudulent released it on ps4 in 2014, but this is just a next gen port of the original ps3 in 2013. 2014 was a next gen not remaster, it not improved the graphics it's extremely bad, due to fraudulent distribution, but was not rebuilt from the ground up, tlou part 1 was completely rebuilt on an entirely not only different engine with new assets, lighting, look like call of duty mw12 remastered and nier replicant from a new engine which makes ai, pretty much everything. which by definition means it was remastered. just because it uses the same level layout and story beats does not mean its not a remake. they rebuilt the games on a new engine which makes look like call of duty mw12 remastered and nier replicant from a new engine which makes, the last of us part 1 is a remastered interrupt, but tlou p1 is a remastered, not a remake. let me explain it in a simpler way without comparing with other games but look like call of duty mw12 remastered and nier replicant. just look at the very last frame and look at the differences from the windows. in this particular scene they added a whole tree and the exterior lightning from outside and changed henry's clothes to be more realistic, added blood more facial animation and probably even more. stil look like call of duty mw12 remastered and nier replicant think of it like this you buy an house that you like but it is a little old and is in need of some repair andor renovation, or maybe it isnt in your style, or you want to add something to it like an extension. you can choose to paint over some walls if they are faded and be done with it.  like a redux  or take some walls down and rebuild it to your liking with an extension or a new kitchen if you want.  like a naturalvision evolved , but the foundation and most of the construction of the original house  mocap  has to stay intact, or the house will collapse. thats what they did here. they kept the motion capture acting, but changed and improved the set and characters with newer, up to date graphics and lightning stil look like call of duty mw12 remastered and nier replicant. they will able to do that with a remaster. that was only repainting the walls with the same color. now they renovated the whole building. but stil look like call of duty mw12 remastered and nier replicant i hope this is clear enough. they chose to rebuild most of the game in this way cuz of the new capabilities from the new engine and the ps5. stil look like call of duty mw12 remastered and nier replicant from the new engine"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-13,this feels like an actual guide good job
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-21,another thing that makes the molotov strat even better is that nearby clickers will hear the noise of the burning clickers and move towards it. lighting themselves on fire as well

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-07,joel said yummy!!! that got me laughing on the floor
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-15,"i love the fun fact that clickers, when you throw a molotov, they go straight to the fire, making it the perfect choice, likw how our uncle babbygoons always says  molotov's my favorite"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-18,"clickers arent that hard to deal with on their own, because you can easily sneak past them, its when there are runners in the same room that makes them tricky"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-01,the part with david hunting you as ellie has always been the freakiest part for me personally. i think its so much scarier when its a fully conscious person instead of an infected. and david is even scarier
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-12,"5446 oh, baby girl i'm crying"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-06,"me, whenever i play the part inside the industrial building with david carefully picking off the moving clickers, one by one, with a bow, desperately avoiding waking up the idle clickers. gamer anh intentionally uses the loudest weapon possible, in order to aggro the clickers, and then noscope them at close range."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-19,"i've replayed the first part quite a few time but i have never thought to run out of the room during the first fight where david is working with you. it makes sooo much sense bc the infected can only come at you from one side. i need to try this next time. thank you! and also the shot where you nail one of the infected as it is coming down from the roof through the window was so perfect, i gasped out loud"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-06,"i have played through this level a dozen times, and not once ever thought to turn around and cap the guys up on the ridge after ellies horse dies. 2505 question does shooting those two guys on the ridge actually decrease the number of enemies present in the next section with the cabins, bathrooms, boats, and snack bar?"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-04,"joel was the strongest the last of us character, rest in peace legend"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-12,joel can pick up a 15lb brick and beat a young trained exmilitary man to death with it in 3 seconds flat. he's a monster and he's like 50.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-19,"in a battle 1v1  1. joel broken doors and lifted people with bare hands, killed bloater with machete in a cutscene 2. tommy trained by fireflies and expert combat tactician 3. bill held the door against a horde of clickers which abby couldnt 4. abby has great muscles but as a women has strength disadvantage and also the 3 above have more experience"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-19,ive always wondered how dina wouldve be if she wasnt pregnant
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-10,joel miller tommy miller ellie abby andderson bill ellie teen dina tess my most favorite characthers
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-09,dina is brutal. they just dont give her backstory she had.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-18,"always remember when ellie had a shotgun, rifle, pistol, and revolver, with med kits, bombs, a knife, and molotovs, abby still nearly killed her, her girlfriend, tommy, and killed jesse."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-21,only tommy can give a insane extreme battle to joel
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-19,dina is underrated
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-12,good list but this is my list 1. joel miller 2. tommy miller 3. abby anderson 4. ellie williams 5. haven brute 6. jesse 7. henry 8. david 9. tess 10. bill honourable mentions 1. yara 2. lev 3. riley
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-13,dina is actually really strong bc there are times where for example she would have to boost ellie up and she basically threw her like it was nothing while pregnant so dina should be higher im not saying top five but still higher
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-14,i would say 1. joel 2. tommy 3. abby 4. ellie 5. bill 6. tess 7. jesse 8. manny 9. dina 10. lev
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-11-08,abby at 4 is hilarious like she didnt body everybody in the game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-22,"joel, tommy, abby, ellie"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-25,ellie above abby is crazy when the only thing that saved ellie from her on multiple occasions was simply plot armor lol
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-22,he was the strongest even though he was 57 years old
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-14,im getting goosebumps watching this im such a big fan of tlou and tlou 2
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-31,henry in the corner
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-18,after finally finishing the last of us pt1 remastered joel by far is a badass haven't played pt2 in excited to play as joel again story was amazing
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-09,"seeing that background again is so nostalgic . ps3 games that are da goat uncharted, the last of us"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-28,the fact than man put prime abby below ellie is just pure criminal
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-27,rest in peace joel miller
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-17,"just remember, ellie slaughtered half of seattle"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-02,"nuh uh abby is stronger than ellie both physically and emotionally. she had multiple chances where she couldve killed ellie, she just didnt obviously. ellie lost joel and lost her shit. abby lost everyone within the span of days and she kept it at least kind of cool. not to mention abby was literally fighting the rat king alone while ellie was chasing nora. abby made it through the fucking town of scars and at the end when she was literally starving and nearing her fucking end she managed to put up a fight with ellie ellie only lived because abby gave her the permission."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-01,"i think dina is underestimated, shes a beast ! should be up there in too 5 or 6 at least"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-19,mine is 1.joel 2.abby 3.ellie 4.tommy 5.jesse 6.tess 7.dina 8.yara 9.lev 10.young ellie 11.riley

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-02,i miss tess sm
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-26,bro forgot about henrys existence
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-10,guys he means stronger as of better at gun fights etc his order is correct
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-04,lets be real. ellie and joel are just absolute powerful. ellie managed to resist getting her jaw ripped off. and joel managed to kill a bloater with just a machete
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-27,"joel , ellie,tommy"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-29,both of these go together really well im talking about the instrumental
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-26,unpopular opinion. abby was probably the best character besides joel and ellie. they captured her redemption perfectly they make you watch her go from a killer to saving kids and trying to forgive herself. theres a reason she gets so mad when owen mentions crossing the country for revenge. theres a reason she spares tommy and ellie. my 2nd favorite character of the 2nd game. 1st is joel. 3rd is ellie
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-23,never let bro cook again
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-11-28,dina anca iftlemeyi bilir
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-24,fun facttommy's sniping skills exist because he was a marksman on the military for many years

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-08,dina deserves better than 11th she had to carry the baby and stay in the theater all by herself
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-08,abby stronger than ellie
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-30,brute boss brute jesse rat king the player abby who beat ellie with hands and ellie had a knifemachete sarah who tanked a few shots when a kid and never got to see her true power joel number zero bc he beat a bloater with a machete
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-10,"idk if anyone noticed this but i found it really cool, when you play pt1 on ps5 and pick up a ladder as joel vs doing the same with abby in ps5 pt2, the controller has more resistance for joel which i guess means its harder for him to carry"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-31,tess was a strong ass woman tho  i still love her so much
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-04,joel is a 10 out of 10 and tommy its also a 10 out of 10. and ellie its also a 10 out of 10
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-13,abby literally beat ellie

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-29,the last of us joel rip we will remember you joel
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-25,no way ellie is phisically stronger than abby
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-02,thats not riley
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-17,abby is just the biggest fear of tate fans as expected.. i started a google ahh war with this sentence
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-22,marline was the leader of the fire flies one the strongest teams in the last of us
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-16,"could you imagine if we got a prequel mode in the 3rd game where it sheds some light on what tommy went through during his time as a firefly? we get told he suffered through a lot and he's a very strong character people have a good connection to, maybe it'll be good to explore that more in depth"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-01,i guess abby more powerful than ellie
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-19,bloater after killing joel 6 times

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-20,"depends on what you mean by strong but my order is something like ellie abby tommy dina joel lev just cus they're on the bottom of list doesn't mean i dont like them i just like the others more, i like bill and yara too and sarah joel's daughter that died in the first one."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-24,i'm sorry but no way on earth ellie is stronger than abby. abby destroyed ellie. the only time ellie had the upper hand was at the end because abby was physically weak.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-20,in raw strength abby solos everyone
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-23,remove the plot armour and the strongest character is bill. hes the only one that doesnt leave things to luck
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-16,"after i saw the whole game wich is pretty long i cry about everything couse all of the game was full of adventures and saddnes , the end was good but i cried almost a month and didnt pay attention to real world i was stuck in this game for a long time almost 3 years it was in my head and that 3years were the saddest."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-25,1 abby 2 joel 3 ellie 4 tommy 5 bill 6 tess 7 henry 8 david
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-01-22,fist to fist abby is stronger then ellie and tommy
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-19,abby is 1 she's so strong
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-12,tommy and joel are the
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-15,its so sad that tess was completely forgotten after the first game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-26,the saddest moment in the first last of us was when sarah gets shot in the second last of us the saddest moment was when joel got killed ofc by abby rest in peace joel
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-20,jesse and maria crying in the corner
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-28,the special forces who didn't give a chance to save joel's daughter are the only ones joel has memories of now.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-13,david was badass
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-23,only tommy can give a insane extreme battle to joel
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-12,im growing on abby when i started to play her character for 3 hours i still love ellie tho
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-02,the first picture of joel is my home screen
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-11,i swear a fight between joel and abby would have been legendary
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-01,jesse was the only npc that acually killed some enemies in my play through
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-14,the miller. joel tommy ellie
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-01,"bro forgot jesse, sure he wasn't there most of the game, and they did him dirty how they killed. but he was great help"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-21,my quality settings  httpspayhip.combfe2mr
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-22,i wish joel and ellie had at least one more adventure together
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-31,you never realized how much you loved something till it's gone
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-21,honestly ptsd hallucination joel couldve been such a powerful plot point wtf
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-23,"old joel helping ellie on some sort of revenge mission would've been such an incredible and complex game. joel helping ellie instead of the other way around. two experienced killers. man, we were robbed."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-05,"yo honestly that would have been badass, like ellie losing her mind seeing joel exactly like mason lost his mind thinking he's seeing reznov"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-22,man... i nearly cried when joel died at the early part. i never expect to see someone we played as in the early to be dead
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-03,i would have loved if ellie had joel hallucinations throughout the game. great way of showing how he is forever a part of her and she could never leave him behind.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-01,"for real i wish we had this in the game, joel was my favorite character too"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-09,i cant believe they put him in this scene in the trailer but then killed him off
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-24,i wish jesse didnt die bro had so much potential
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-13,sometimes i wonder what the game would look like if joel would try to earn ellies forgiveness in a journey while seeing the damage he did as opposed to what happened to him in tlou2.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-25,i would've cried....i already cried so hard at his death so imagine him returning back there would be a tear inundation
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-01,imagine if joel didnt die but ellie did joel would go on a whole killing streak of a million just for ellie
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-25,"joel, the ultimate not your parent, but all youve got"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-25,hearing joels voice hits hard i miss him
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-24,"in a story where ellie could have been seeking revenge for something that happened to dina, having joel appear despite their estranged relationship wouldve provoked some damn emotions"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-02,"such a heartbreaking conclusion for our boy, such impact and sadness in a short."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-26,joels voice will always be one of my favorites in any game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-14,the last of us part 2 could have had a mechanic where you had to switch between ellie and joel to do some puzzles and sometimes even stealth. but they had to kill joel
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-26,"joel was a wonderful father. he loved and protected ellie like his own daughter. he did everything he could to keep her safe. joel is a complex and compelling character. he's not a perfect good guy, but he's a man worth loving. we all miss him"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-22,that would have been so amazing. i miss joel so much man
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-22,biggest tease of the decade
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-19,honestly this cutscene is one of the main reasons the game upset me so much. they put joel in the marketing for this game so much leading up to the release because people were already guessing joel was going to die when they released the first teaser. and with this scene it confirmed fans were going to experience on more joel and ellie journey. screw them for misinforming us of what the game was actually going to be about
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-02,they deserved atleast one more game together. one more adventure.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-27,oh i wish..  i really missed him. joel is my favorite game character of all time.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-04,jesse was a good friend ngl
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-13,"people saying i wish they could have had another adventure together  thats the point, you never know when you just cant. it makes the time they spent together that much more precious."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-22,shit. all the pain came rushing full speed to me yet again.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-29,you think ill let you do this all on your own.. cause you will
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-05,"if i was to lose you, i'd surely lose myself"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-25,"that was one of the saddest parts of the game when joel died. he was one of my favorite actors in real life. troy baker. he plays in a lot of video games, death stranding, one and two but sad death."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-23,you think i'd be in this game?
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-28,you can strike me down but i will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine  some old space wizard
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-09,i had no clue so many other people played through this game like i did i actually enjoyed it but i do wish they had kept joel around him and ellies bond is what made this game so great
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-23,"wouldve been interesting because joel grew up a happy life lost and regained, ellie grew up with nothing, gained and lost again. her hallucinating wouldve been a good way of saying shes more cooked than joel instead of her being just as violent as he was"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-24,they kicked us all in the nuts with that blue balls trailer.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-07,i was crying that much that i stopped breathing when i was playing the last of us when joel died thats how sad i was
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-11,we all miss you joel
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-23,this short made me remember how excited i was when the trailer came out and how heartbroken i was when reality set in from the story.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-06,i almost cried literally just hearing his voice again
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-24,man i got goosebumps when he said you think i'd let you do this your own
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-27,saw this coming a mile away and still got teary eyed. he was the dad she never had and nobody can tell me otherwise.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-16,having joel as a hallucinations trying to convince ellie to go back would make the story more impact
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-24,there should be a dlc that says joel
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-03,bro i miss joel so much.he was the greatest
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-06,"he didnt deserve to die, he only wanted to save the last person he cared about"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-30,ive never even played the last of us and this shot made me tear up
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-02,i was so hyped before jt came out and i burst out crying when joel just smiled at ellie when he was dying
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-02,"oh hi jessie, thats strange i thought you would be joel since thats what was shown in the trailerstwiddle thumb gaming"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-24,if abby played golf with dina instead of with joel
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-20,biggest false advertising ever in gaming history
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-19,respect to jesse though
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-18,facts  rip joel
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-04,wow. that hurt a lot more than i expected. this breaks my heart.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-14,"now that i've seen this. this could have been a pretty cool spin if we went from flashbacks of younger ellie and joel together, to all of a sudden older ellie starts having a mental breakdown and every time she was having an episode in a dangerous moment there was joel coming back from the dead to be the calm in her head. like imagine a scene where she starts to breakdown right before she goes looking for more wlfs that are on the other side of a destroyed wall and joel comes crouching up next to her, says he will take care of it. then you get to play as joel for a moment, but once you leave the area it enters a cutscene where we find out it was actually ellie the entire time."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-10-19,what an amazing edit...
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-28,"making me cry already in the morning, huh?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-01,we need joel back rip to the man who was our saviour we all wished for him to see his future days

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-18,i missed joel so much and i hated it with my whole heart that we had to play as abby. but i also liked jessie. and abby killed him too!!

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-10,"i swear i will never ever play part 2, joel is still my fav character and will never die for me."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-14,who felt angry and disgusted when they killed joel just like that??
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-01,"im crying!!!! , i love joel so much!!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-01,"its just awful that they actually didn't let joel had his last walkthrough with ellie, i got so happy when joel said that in the trailer"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-06-19,that was such a great cut that i honestly wish that had been the case. that was emotional
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-06,"bro, i got literal chills dude, this wouldve made the game so much better"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-25,"back in the day of the trailers, i thought the vengeance would have been because of dina and not joel"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-01-12,"i keep seeing this, and everytime i do, i cry."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-05,or imagine he's back and he says let's go home ellie. imagine how happy they could've been  man i'm in tears again

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-25,"honestly, naughty dog flipped the bird to everyone with that joel tease. we all theorized that joel would die but putting him as a tease was just them trying to say, see he's not gonna die. personally i think it would have been interesting if tommy got killed. you could pick anyone else but tommy makes since for the rest of this idea. joel, ellie, and tommy are on patrol when a horde of infected comes after them. they happen to run into abby's group and they help each other get to safety. abby and her friends are not fireflies, they are a different group all together, people tommy pissed of in the past before going to jackson. they get to talking and start to bond with them until abby sees the tommy's firefly pendant and realizes that its tommy. that's when her and her crew leave and as joel, ellie, and tommy sleep till morning they get jumped by abby's crew. ellie fights hard, even leaving a permanent scar on abby but is subdued. joel is punching people left and right but gets stabbed in the leg. tommy fights as well but gets restrained by them. abby comes over and starts beating him up and kills him mercilessly. joel and ellie see the who thing and scream. ellie is both crying and angry. joel starts screaming i'm gonna kill you. that's when abby and friends knock them out and leave them. cut to black and the title card. the aftermath ellie, joel, maria, and others are there at tommy's funeral. joel's knee was badly injured in the fight so he can't walk or run as good. ellie talks with joel about revenge and joel knows the location of the group but he insists on going with her. ellie refuses because of his knee but tells him that she's taking dinna with her. they hug, and ellie and dinna are off. everything plays out almost the same just dinna is not pregnant but at one point the two are forced to split up and that's when ellie almost gets caught but is saved as she realizes who it was. she asks, what the hell are you doing here? joel responses you think i'd let you do this on your own. i can't figure out how the rest would go but it was just a sper of the moment idea i have. sorry for the extremely long comment."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-22,i wish it could be true but sadly it will never be
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-22,i wish joel had longer role in tlou2
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-08-04,"this would be so awesome joels spirit helping ellie just like how ethan helped rose in the rev dlc, or she could just be having ptsd or hallucinating and at the end she realizes that he was never real just like how mason was hallucinating seeing vector r or something like that like they would be at the theater and she's talking to joel and dinas like who are you talking to"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-02,"their relationship is plutonic beyond words. the flashes ellie kept having of him, especially during the later stages of the game meant she started feeling guilty for treating him for something he really didn't deserve coz he was the most father figure to her above everything else and really loved her as his own. the guilt took her to a level she thought she'd never realize how much she missed and loved him for always being there for her since they had met. i'm sad there won't be a 3rd part coz this series deserves more"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-01,"joel was, and is, the reason that ellie is who she is. she is nothing without him. she needs him..the stability and the love , regardless of the circumstances or the world around them, and he deserved so much better than the bs that he got."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-17,"i still hope we get a hallusiation joel in pt3 ellie going to see fireflies, and she has him by her side, we. as players will have some time to say goodbye, ellie will have time to let him go, maybe some notes written by him i just think thst it would be a beautiful end of the story. both of them going through america to fireflies again for the cure, because ellie has nothing to live for so it's the way to make her life matter, but just like joel she will find her reason, her family and she will understand him, why he did that, why he lied and she will be able to let him go and live even if he is dead"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-30,bro the 2nd part legit made me cry
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-24,i wouldve liked to see joel appear on ellies adventure sort of in her mind after dinas started staying in the theatre
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-24,imagine if ellie was having mental breaks and seeing joel in her head along with no abby gameplay couldve made this game soooo much better!!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-24,ive always wondered what the story wouldve been if it really was joel right there..
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-21,imagine a ghost joel teaching ellie about fighting his way
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-21,bro i am 28 male  crying right now  i watched this 20 times in a row  tlou is my fav franchise ever. period.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-28,this is what we all wanted a last adventure with joel and ellie
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-08,"what they gave us was nearly perfect to my mind, we were traumatized and learnt how to heal with ellie. obviously we loved him, but hes gone, we have to accept it."
