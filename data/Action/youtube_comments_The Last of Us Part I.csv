TLOU I and II are some absolute masterpieces. I loved both of them. The visuals, the sounds, the music (I absolutely love the music). I don't think a game has ever moved me so much. As a man who's been with Xbox his entire life, TLOU will probably be my favourite game ever. I hope to get a good computer to play them one day and be able to experience it all for myself. I would also love to see factions out again. That game slapped. 

For context, I only got to play bits of TLOU I through my cousin's PS3. Most of TLOU I and the entirety of TLOU II was experienced on YouTube.",1

Finally got a PS5 last November and as much as i loved this game i didnt see it smart to buy the game full price since Current Gen console games pretty much cost 10$ more than games from last gen (in canadian $ PS4 games are 79.99 so PS5 games are 89.99) so waited for this game to go on sale. Thankfully it went on sale for 50% off just before Christmas. As soon as i saw that i immediately bought one. If you really love the game it totally worth buying and replaying the game.

There‚Äôs actually weight to the character models. For example, if someone sits on a chair, or lays down on a bed, there‚Äôs realistic physics in place, the chair cushion will actually press down as if someone is sitting down on it, the bed and pillow will take shape of the persons body and the pillow will even indent in the form of their head.

And now that I've watched the game (never played the full game before) I can tell, that is the series based on a videogame, everything nailed
I feel like the show made us love each character even more, in the game the death of his daughter and Tess aren't that sad compared to the show, and here Ellie is already strong and ready to survive since they met each other, in the show she is brave but she still a 14yr old kid
In the show he didn't killed that guy, she only shot him in the back and that gave her goosebumps but here she blowed his head and was fine, that is not realistic at all
About Bill and Frank I am not sure what I prefer if it is the game or tv show version, besides the fact that they were gay in the show both versions were well writen
About Tommy, they did well in the show, here in the game I didn't like him at all...",1

And we were see some parts of Tess personal Life. Maybe telling Ely that she had a baby boy and died and she was all mest up and there she met Joel. Alot of things that make us wonder and question those characters.  A DLC of that game heading in that direction will be very interesting.  Don't you think so Guys.

*Looks at Ellie and sees what he means*

You're right, the remake did have puppy dog eyes, but her part I model has giant bug freak eyes when you stare too damn close to them.

If you take a very close look to them and you know, pause for a moment.

Her pupils look enlarged and drugged and the iris of her eyes are ENLARGED.

meanwhile the remake didn't have that focus but at the very least it made it clear that IT NEVER MATTERED.",0

0mv0dAwPqCs,@jordanhodder8481,2024-07-22T19:02:53Z,"personally I think this does suffer from demon's souls syndrome where in some cases the art direction decisions are inferior to the original. I'd also say that it's worth noting that they didn't, like, reshoot and mocap the cutscenes so the in the original, they were edited and directed in a way that fit the hardware. I don't know if I'm articulating myself well but I honestly found that, e.g. in Tess's conversation with Joel in the capitol building, the facial animations in the original actually made the scene more emotionally compelling than the remake's fancier versions. I feel like they lean on the worry lines in the forehead and the mouth corners and such a little too heavily. I don't know if I'm the only one there though.

Honestly, ND might have simply lost some talent in the facial animation department after TLOU2's crunch etc, wouldn't be surprised.

Also, I liked the cuts to black in the original tbh. Felt cinematic, whereas the smooth transitions feel a little too of a piece with current trends (i.e. God of War). It works in Part II but that's a game with a very different feel.",0

The visual detail and animation detail/quality is absolutely superb. The sound quality is incredible. The attention to detail is Red Dead Redemption 2 level good. It's like an interactive Netflix series. The voice acting is also superb. The combat feels very authentic and is a very visceral experience. It's a crying shame that games that have this level of detail and overall quality are often tainted by developers and artists having to work 70-80 hour weeks to make it all a reality. Too bad workflows can't be simplified to cut down on the man hours.,0

It made sense to keep everything as faithful to the OG as possible. Remakes like Dead Space and RE4 show that each is served better when focusing on what makes each an individual experience. Dead Space gameplay is virtually untouched too, and I don't see anyone complaining. RE4 is the more exciting, gameplay wise, it's the older game and they did a lot in every aspect.

They would rather remake a game that isn‚Äôt even 10 years old and has already been remastered than actually think up something new and unique.,4
0mv0dAwPqCs,@musicman6773,2023-02-18T23:28:25Z,Naughty Dog is the reason why Playstation is so popular.Can not wait for next big game from this state of the art studio for PS5.,2
0mv0dAwPqCs,@endriuzincenko64,2023-02-18T16:30:28Z,"I just bought the game cause it was on sale on PS store and i have to say it felt like I was experiencing the game for the first time again. I first bought the game for PS3 , then the remaster which i played for about 13 times. This remaster already looked great but it had a lot of bugs which plagued me on every playthrough, having the opportunity to remove them and get a visually better version was worth the money to me",1

I liked how Joel and Ellie didn't get along very well in the beginning, but over time they started to get used to each other until they became friends. The atmosphere of the game was good. I liked how the environment changes in the game, sometimes you are in the city, then in the nature, I also liked that the seasons change. Graphically, the game looks nice. I liked the sounds and music. Infected were interesting. There are a total of four types of infected. It's interesting how the infected changes. The first type of runner resembles a human. The first type Runner resembles a human, while the fourth type  Bloater does not resemble a human, but rather a golem. I also liked the weapons and that could be upgraded later. As someone who likes to explore environments in games, I found a lot of things, thanks to which I could create something, for example, a health kit, then, for example, use pills to increase my health etc. There is so much I could write about this game.

But I assume that console players also have certain expectations... Back then (at release) as well as today. I've actually spent almost 10 hours playing the game on the PC and have thought several times about abandoning it prematurely, which I've now done.
The game is completely undemanding in terms of gameplay, stupid dialog, predictable actions, rarely stupid AI opponents, tedious occupational therapy (push the crate from A to B, take the ladder again and again and place it) and lengthy film sequences, which caused me to release an enormous amount of melatonin. 
I had already agonized over uncharted and hoped that at least with last of usvalles things would change for the better. Ok, fortunately I didn't pay a penny for either, but I wasted my life. Really rarely been so disappointed and with all due love, these titles could have actually stayed console exclusive. I fell for the supposed hype... Well, lesson learned",1

 But so far the only difference I see is that you have added more shadow effect and looks darker. The water on the PS4 ""remaster"" looks mile better and detailed than the PS5 ""remake"".

As a fan of thr first game (part 2 wasn't exactly that great, it was pretty much like recycling the first game, but dragged out for too long), but the game doesn't merit a remake.

Come on Sony and Naughty Dog, stop trying to milk the cash cow, you are only going to ruin the franchise and end up making gamers hate TLOU.

Surely Naughty Dog have new and better ideas for a new title to make or revive, or Sony must at least have some new ideas.

If you are going to instruct Naughty Dog to keep recycling the same titles, then they'll end up being just like nintendo, how they keep recycling the same titles on every new console they crap out.

What does this ""remake"" really bring, new models, better detail and all that crap. End of the day, I am not going to splash out loads of money to buy a PS5 to buy games again when I already own them.

Marlene was the leader of the fireflies which speaks volumes of her strength. On par with or stronger than Tess. In her prime, probably more dangerous than Ellie or Abby. 

Owen was WLF and although never verbally voiced by any characters, it seemed like the Salt Lake City crew viewed him as their leading figure.  

Henry, although not lasting too long, was stronger than younger Ellie and Riley.

Joel and Tommy can fight for 3 and 4 because ellie is in 2 seeing what she accomplished by herself or with people who held her back the entire run except (dina before the pregnancy reveal). And guys I hate to say it but Abby killed the rat king. By herself. In a small room. Along with a second stronger than normal stalker.  While still showing she can do basically the same as Ellie but with more power in her second fight with Ellie. And Idk why Riley or Dina are on here when people like Jesse who did the same tracking thing Ellie and Dina did but by himself and y'all forget about people like Eugene. Eugene was so badass nothing but a goddamn heart attack could take him down.",0

And it‚Äôs not like Jackson is hurting for food, Dina even makes a joke about how when Ellie first got there, Dina found it kind of funny how Ellie was sneaking food for herself as if someone was going to tell her she couldn‚Äôt have more and/or take it from her.

Again, I agree with the message, I just feel like they could‚Äôve chosen an image that showed a more obviously malnourished body. Like idk, nowadays when I think of unhealthy skinny model/celebrity I think of Ariana Grande. Look at an image of the model for this game and one of her side-by-side and you‚Äôll see what I mean.

But Mark if u see this comment then I have a game request for you to play that I think everyone would enjoy. The game is called clamb and it‚Äôs on VR. It‚Äôs exactly like the game called Getting over it, and will surly have you playing it for at least a week or 2. That‚Äôs all for now and hope you see this. By the way my name is Nicholas Likens.

It happens because everything just reminds her of Joel. Abby. Lev. Even her flesh wound reminds her of Joel.

y4prQ8LHRic,@Ralphoifyful,2025-01-27T15:31:28Z,"Thanks for this much needed confirmation that TLOU II is the perfect story to cater to what Kaczinsky would call ""the spiritual leftist"". Although the first 20 minutes you dragged the video through a tirade of descriptive praise for the themes of the game (which boil down to a gigantic non-explanation consisting of ""I like the themes because they are there""), finally in the ""Reflections"" part I get to see what I was already suspicious of what your actual ideas on it were gonna be.
People with 10x more talent and intelligence than you have already described in (technical and beyond-technical) detail how the story of TLOU II is an unabashed disaster in narrative, pacing, coherence and characterization. But that's not the real issue, I already knew that (because unlike 99% of TLOU II unconditional fans, I've been reading classical literature for well over 10 years and continue to do so). The issue is that TLOU II is exactly that for you kind: *_opium_*. A caricaturesque excuse of an actual heroic story delivered to tell you that you're not alone in the face of a human world and reality that you don't understand, that you're afraid of, that you resent and that you feel incapable to face with your own capabilities (""there's nothing as terrifying as becoming an adult in the 21st century"", your words). 
That's exactly the spiritual background and unconscious prey instinct that exudes your only own original and truly personal point in this entire mess of an ""essay"". And it's probably the same for Druckmann himself, who is a weak liberal man who couldn't wait to completely subvert the figure and ideal of what Joel represents, after his main idea for the plot of TLOU I was hilariously thrown to the garbage can by Straley. That's why Joel represents something that will truly never coincide with what you point out to here. Which can be summarized in...:
Neither you nor the ""new generation"" of people who sadly thinks like you are going to change f - ck all. The reality of violence, heroism, manliness, real love for the kin against aliens and against the ideal of abstract humanism... all of those natural human realities will hit you in the face time, and time, and time again. Strong men will always choose force and protection of the own against sheep-instincts of ""humanism"": that's the fact people like you or Druckmann will never come to term with on a spiritual level, because on all levels concerning the spirit and beyond, you are not strong men. Joel was, he made the unapologetic hero's decision. THAT is THE REAL REASON why he's been the make it or break it for both halves of the TLOU fan community.",0

y4prQ8LHRic,@shugaroony,2025-01-15T01:36:47Z,"I agree with most of what you say, especially as you close your piece about the failures of Joel's generation, and its up to Ellie and Abby's generation to build a better world; but I don't agree about Joel being selfless at all. He acts selfishly - understandably - at the end of the first game, damns mankind (and I also disagree about the world still being fucked up if a cure is found, as for every David or Isaac, there is a Jackson where hope that society can be rebuilt, isn't diminished) and millions of other kids like Ellie, to become clickers or worse. He then tries to manage Ellie's life as much as he can. Some may say thats what a good father does, but its not, he's not allowing her to find herself, and by lying to her about the hospital, only drives a wedge between them, especially as he keeps repeating it. What Ellie and Abby go through, is due to Joel's selfish actions, and his failure to be a positive influence on others around him, even 4 years later when they are settled in Jackson. 

Thankfully, in the end Abby does this, by finding the empathy and compassion is still within her and to try to be a better person, and ironically becomes a kind of Joel for Lev. Ellie's journey is a lot more complex due to the fact she is at almost rock bottom by the game's end, but knows that by destroying the killer of her father, won't bring any solace; however, by sparing Abby, she saves herself - Joel doesn't do this, she has to realise this on her own, even at her absolute lowest. The next part of her journey we hope, will be that redemption, to bring her back into the light.",0

But then the Abby playthru would start and in the end you would replay the Elle ending fight and resolution again..

That would translate the message maybe better, and it would satisfied players in mid game. And not to discussed them up to the point to quit the game early.
Like yeah, sure you could quit the game anyway, but I think more players would play it further, due to they know the bitch Abby did pay in the end. And the game would have second hafl of the game to change players mind and let them grow.

When Abby shot Jesse I was super upset, and I wanted to go after Abby and beat her up. I felt that anger. But then seeing Abby's side of the story, especially seeing her go out of her way to help Yara and Lev made me respect and come to root for Abby's survival. 
After Lev's sister was murdered by the WLF, Lev said to Abby that her people killed his sister Yara. Abby's response to that, ""Hey, you're my people!"" Abby won me over. I teared up hearing that. Because I felt that.
I mean Lev lost everything at this point. His mom, his sister, and the very group he was apart of has turned against him, plus it felt like everything was out to get Lev being the infected, Seraphites, and the WLF.
But in that moment Abby was basically telling Lev that she will be there for him. She will be there to help, support, and protect him. Because Lev was like family.
It's crazy how she became protective of Lev and even Yara and wanting to help them despite only knowing them for what like 3 days.
It was her empathy and humanity that made her this way. Granted part of the motivation was also gratitude that they helped her survive at the hands of the Serephites, and also her trauma of losing her dad. But ultimately I think Abby's actions showed her capability for empathy and humanity.

This was my interpretation, and I could be wrong.",1

I felt the pain and anger of Ellie when Joel died. Each person that Ellie killed always made me say ‚Äúthat f‚Äôer deserved it‚Äù not realizing how much of my own sanity was going away. How far was I myself willing to go to get revenge for Joel? That‚Äôs how much I was emotionally invested it‚Äôs crazy. When Jesse died by Abby it came to a shock but because of the situation I wasn‚Äôt able to process his death and basically ignore it for a while. Soon after you play as Abby, throughout her playthrough I never cared about her or her problems and friends. In my mind I was on Ellie‚Äôs side and seeing Abby‚Äôs background story and what she went through I still didn‚Äôt care, never will. During the end when you see Abby looking completely different and skinny in Santa Barbara I did feel sympathy for what she went through, that‚Äôs when I realized what MY limit was and how far Ellie‚Äôs was. Ellie‚Äôs limit was right before killing her. So I wasn‚Äôt that far from behind her but once the vengeance stopped and my own emotions calmed down I saw what ellie had lost in this journey of revenge and when she couldn‚Äôt play Joel‚Äôs guitar that got my eyes watery. Questioning myself at what cost were we willing to go? Burning everything behind you and leaving nothing but ashes. At the end this left me feeling very empty and depressed for Ellie. It really affected me for the time being. I know it‚Äôs just a game but it was a very great game that I will never get to experience this like this 1st time was. But I think we can all apply this traumatic story into our personal lives in a way because from the moment you lose Joel and the whole journey that Ellie embarks what I can personally imply in my life is that ‚ÄúLife is hard‚Äù and as clich√© as that sounds it very true. Losing parents, losing friends, tragedy in life and hardships will always happen to us until it‚Äôs our turn to go. ‚ÄúLife is hard‚Äù but the world keeps moving and doesn‚Äôt stop for nobody, eventually we all have to move on.",1

*WARNING POTENTIAL SPOILERS*

You make it sound like The Last of Us 2 is this grandiose masterpiece about forgiveness and redemption and how Druckmann SUCCEEDED in showing us the natural human condition, and for that - I am certainly uncertain. As for what you described in your video, I see it as; on that basis it tries desperately to make us connect and relate to these characters.

And fact is, it‚Äôs always a hit or miss, especially when it comes to Abby. She is portrayed as this vengeful character who seeks forgiveness and growth, which is awesome. But how it‚Äôs executed is awful. 

1. The pacing, rising tension (during the midpoint) and structure devolves. And never truly recovers after. And here‚Äôs what I mean:

Abby‚Äôs Lev and Yara story-arc is the perfect example. During that point in the story it feels like I‚Äôm playing/experiencing a totally different game. It strays far away from its already built structure. And tries to be unique (which I respect) and over the top, but fails miserably (not the best idea of Druckmann to try and do something very risky on such a beloved and important franchise such as The Last of Us).

A hero is not psychopathic or unabled to love but moral principles that maintain peace and social cohesion have to lead our actions. Therefore a heroic Joel would of did the necessary but because he would be unable to live with the pain he would commit suicide.

We saw what desperation did to Joel. The doctor‚Äôs little voice recorded fantasies about being a hero for discovering the vaccine, then later his frustration and fear when samples and tests DIDN‚ÄôT show what he expected to see, but people were ‚Äòdepending on him‚Äô to figure it out‚Ä¶ 

Well. Like Joel said. This wasn‚Äôt the first time they‚Äôd heard about a potential vaccine.

There's also his slightly impaired movement, which does seem to be extremely temporary, but honestly, I can accept this as Joel just being a badass, fighting through the pain - and that's more than good enough for me.
Also, it's unclear how long exactly Joel was recovering for, especially when you take into account the Left Behind DLC - as well as the time Ellie spent fending for herself - which takes place, in part, when Joel is unconscious in that basement. He was injured sometime in fall and healed only mostly near the end of the winter section, so that's at least a few weeks.",0

There's no new spin on the zombie apocalypse behind a novel infection origin. Same basic struggles to survive and rebuild, a bunch of stock set pieces for a lot of fairly meh combat, leading to an ending which jumps to Kill The Patient so the game can have a conclusion. 

Add a DLC with a great romance but all the same been there done that a million times in the last couple of decades gameplay, and i think less of the game with every passing year, as its mostly ugly environments, competent combat, and easy but annoying environment puzzles... with a lot of good character moments in a predictable story.",0

xtkEQxwy_DU,@DeborahChangMD,2025-01-23T08:00:57Z,"While I can appreciate the attempt at an adaptation of one of my favorite stories ever, I find myself really not enjoying the show. Some of the changes made just seemed to lessen the atmosphere, and distract from what little time we had with the characters we‚Äôre supposed to love, considering it was a rather short tv show as is. It was a good attempt, and there is quality to be found in a lot of parts of the show. But the main attraction to this story, being the dynamic between Joel and Ellie, was utterly squandered in the show. A lot of wasted time on things we never asked for, and that really didn‚Äôt add much, if anything at all to the story itself. In fact, what was added, and a good portion of time was spent on, I would argue often detracted from the main story. It was more so just time spent on multiple plotlines that sort of led into the large plot points of the story that we wanted to see, the emotional impact of which had little time left to really be reflected effectively. The show just seemed to lack development for the two characters who needed it the most. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around why they would introduce so many new plotlines while having so much less time to deliver them than even the game had, while it was only telling one. It just led to most of these story beats feeling half baked, making them feel rather inconsequential, while actively sapping valuable time away from the story we wanted to see. And this lack of development ultimately led to the most pivotal points in the story, feeling far less impactful than they really should‚Äôve. Idk. It‚Äôs probably the best video game adaptation we‚Äôve got just looking at it objectively, technically, visually. But I really just don‚Äôt like it very much, which really is too bad. I didn‚Äôt enjoy the story of part 2 much at all, and seeing the direction that the show strayed in, I am really beginning to doubt Neil Druckmanns sole approach to creative writing.",0

It shows two survivors taking upon a journey through the whole country, a country now infested with morbid horrific infected, traveling from state to state, risking your life, and surviving close encounters for what? To smuggle a cure in hopes it would succeed? Even if it‚Äôs like a low percentage of it actually working? I feel like the game itself gives us the meaning of selfishness and desperation of what would be like to survive in this apocalyptic world. The weight that Joel and Ellie carried throughout the game knowing that the world and not just the fireflies is dependent on them. In the last part of the game, I like how it ended, because the fireflies themselves didn‚Äôt even give him back his guns, or even let him talk with Ellie to say goodbye, and they even just straight up tried to kill Ellie  without her consent to proceed with procedure. In my book, Joel did the right thing by saving Ellie from being killed, they didn‚Äôt give her a chance to make her decision, but Joel saved her enough for her to make that choice, even if the fireflies had their reasons for doing what they needed to do, it‚Äôs not justified and it shows how they‚Äôre much worser then Joel himself.

That is where Ellie closed herself off, and even to the end of Part 2, (aside from Joel taking her to the museum for her birthday and some of the time she spent with Dina) we almost never really see her open back up again. Not that cheery, eager girl she used to be. On that note, the way she kills David is actually reminiscent of the way she kills Nora in Part 2.

Joel, on the other hand but in a very similar way, changes into a guy who just wants to spend time with his family and enjoy this chance he‚Äôs been given to live again.

xtkEQxwy_DU,@withgreatpower6169,2024-08-18T05:38:39Z,"The only thing I disagree with is some of your veribiage on the gameplay. The gameplay is brilliant in TLOU for several reasons. Everything you do, be it shooting a shotgun, throwing  a bottle, choking a hunter, or walking through a decrepit hotel, feels tangible.  I feel a sense of humanity sinking lower and lower with every life I'm forced to take in the game. Hitting someone with a brick feels satisfying and cruel instead of just something i have to do if i want to progress through the game. Creating that sense of weight and urgency in a game is not easy. Never do I feel like I'm just running through people or infected like fodder. It's heartpounding, it's anxiety inducing, it's truly an immersive experience. Something that also really stands out to me is how I feel playing the game even when I'm not taking immediate action. Just walking throughout that hotel or through Bill's neighborhood is engaging because of how brilliantly crafted the environments and details are. I could also get into the sound design and the role that plays. Its always fun to shoot or hack at things but when I'm at the edge of my seat just taking in the quiet moments like walking through a house or a garage, that all goes back to the gameplay creating that experience.",2

xtkEQxwy_DU,@billzco6137,2024-08-07T21:48:31Z,He wasn't right but he wasn't wrong. He should have just threatened the dr and nurses point blank with a gun. Then just take ellie away. The game never said this operation was 100%. Ellie would have died and that's it. They would still have no cure. She was just an experiment with no proof. And I would have not let ellie die either. Joel's mistake was killing the doctor. But the game forced me to do that. If i had to pistol whip the doctor to assure dominance I would have did that then take ellie with me. But the game didn't give me that choice...they would have spent another 20 years after ellie death searching for a cure. And anyone that truly cared for someone else isn't going to let a loved one just die for data. They did it in a sneaky way with a lack of information communication and without consent and it would not have had any impact on a cure. They would need to have multitudes of experiments which they didn't have. Scientists always try to justify in the name of science without any remorse if it fails. Joel is wrong for killing an unarmed man. He's not wrong for saving someone he loves based on bs experiment. Joel should have knocked him out and took ellie away. That's the truth. Abby should have forgave him after saving her from almost getting torn apart by infected. Everyone always over looks that though. Should just let her get eaten then. Joel atleast did a mercy kill painless..Abby did a torture kill slow and painful...who's the monster now,0

zUyX-yEG7kw,@franciscomedipro8580,2024-11-23T21:56:25Z,"In The Last of Us Part II, the creators decided to make Ellie a lesbian, which holds significant value for LGBTQ+ visibility. However, by focusing on her sexual orientation, they missed the opportunity to develop her personality more deeply. This can give the false impression that a tough and strong woman has to be lesbian to be believable, when in reality, a strong character doesn‚Äôt need to be defined by their sexuality.

The problem with this approach is that by putting her sexual orientation at the center of the story, it limits the complexity of the character and reinforces certain stereotypes. Ellie‚Äôs sexuality becomes what defines her, when what should really be important are her strength, her conflicts, and her human relationships.

This approach can make some people think that being tough and strong is automatically tied to being lesbian, when in reality, women can be equally powerful and complex without their sexual orientation determining it. If, instead of focusing on sexuality, the story had explored her character and challenges more deeply, the character could have developed in a much richer and more universal way.",0

Ellis sets out to find all of Abby's friends ending up killing them all. When abby gets back she finds the map that ellie has been using and that Ellie's is hiding in a theater. Abby goes there with a scar (seraphite) (that helped abby live) which leads them to killing Jesse and ellie and her fighting while Dina is asleep. After the 3rd fight dina stabs abby and dina gets shot by an arrow that the seraphite aka lev shot and Abby slams dinas face into the ground while ellie says that dina is pregnant. After a while dina and ellie settle in a house with the baby called AJ. While Ellie is out hunting she comes back only to Find tommy there. Tommy tells her about how he knows where Abby is and Ellie ends up going there one night only for Dina to find her and say ""ellie we have a family"" while ellie says "" i have to finish this"". Ellie sets out and finds a camp called the rattlers. Ellie gets past them to find abby and lev on the Beach in a cross. Ellie cuts ellie cuts abby down for Abby to cut lev down which they get of different boats and ellie says that sue can't let abby live so they fight and ellie had the chance to kill Abby but she let her go. Ellie comes home to find dina and AJ gone.

Edit  The man Abby wanted to find was Joel because in the first game joel killed her father trying to save Ellie

2. In the game, the outbreak begins 9/26/2013. If you don't believe he is 52 after the prologue,  he says he had Sarah pretty young, and she is 12 when he is confirmed by ND to be 32 in the prologue.

hPxnxHun1cU,@LastBrainCell01,2023-05-30T20:49:54Z,absolutely loved this game ..ofc it has alot more potential...id esp like an under the sea section where they found that big ass alien thing and set it apart from DS and grow into some of its own grand set pieces (like that leviathan or 0G gameplay areas) ...enjoyed the game alot and looking forward to the story DLC,0
