5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I guarantee we're going to see loads of people getting Ellie's tattoo.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Don't know if anyone noticed, but the window from the menu background of the first game seems to be the window from the room where Ellie is in the trailer. Or they look really similar.
"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"So it looks like the story will be something like this:

-Fireflies find Ellie and Joel
-Fireflies kill a lot of Tommy's village people
-Feels
-Ellie and Joel will hunt the fireflies
-During the hunt Ellie will learn the truth
-More feels that I cant handle
-Bittersweet ending like the first"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"It might be just me, but I'm getting the vibe that Joel is actually dead, and that Ellie is saying that at the end to avenge him."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,First Red Dead Redemption 2 and now The Last of Us Part II. My two favorite games are getting sequels and I couldn't be more excited. Maybe 2016 isn't entirely the worst.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I really wanted a sequel that followed another story in the same setting but god damn if I can't help but hype as hell for this. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"As a 33 year old man, I have played a lot of great games in my day but this is the top the list for story driven gaming. Absolutely fucking incredible. If you've never had the pleasure of playing the original, go now. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The Last of Us was probably one of the best games ever made - the story, the characters, the gameplay - it was really at the level of a masterpiece.  This trailer completely sold me on Part 2.  Amazing."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Yo is Joel dead? Is that why she's killing fireflies? Is he a hallucination?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The Last of Us was announced in December 2011, and released June 2013. Hopefully this gets not later than a 2018 release."

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I was always one to think that The Last of Us didn't need a sequel, but this game is looking awesome, even though it has only a small trailer. Definitely going to play it.

(Also, Ellie should have been playing Johnny Cash for the lolz,  Logan looks very much like TLOU's atmosphere and I LOVE IT).﻿"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The Last of Us is the best gaming experience I've ever had, from the gut-wrenching opening through the gut-wrenching ending and all the gut-wrenching in between (especially those rats in the hotel basement). For me it elevated video games onto an equal footing with all other forms of storytelling art; if Roger Ebert had seen TLOU he would have been convinced. When they announced the film adaptation I was crushed; there is literally nothing about a film that could improve upon the experience of the game. It's the first game to make me feel that way. And it's the first game to make me feel the way I feel right now upon seeing this on the front page.

Some are saying the first game was a complete story and doesn't need a sequel. They're not wrong. I don't care. I needed this *badly* and with the same team behind it I know they can do no wrong.

Let's do this."

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Reasons Joel may be dead and he's just a hallucination: 

1. He asks Ellie if she's ""really going to go through with this"", which seems to suggest that she's alone in whatever she's facing (could be that they had some sort of falling out or poorly chosen words if he intends to help her) 

2. He doesn't appear to have any blood on him whatsoever, even though Ellie has several cuts and blood flowing (could be that he just found her and she did all the fighting before he arrived) 

3. A possible motivation for Ellie's anger is that Joel was killed by whomever she's going after (though there may be another explanation) 

4. His hair and beard were graying in the first game when Ellie was much younger and it appears that it looks the same even though she is clearly older now 

5. He appears to emerge from the sunlight as if a ghost as he enters the house 

Reasons Joel may not be dead: 

1. The grass, mud and water appear to move as he walks through the scene 


Please let me know if there's anything I missed. I tried listening to the song but didn't come away with anything other than she appears to be incredibly angry and vengeful against her enemies, perhaps not even caring if she dies.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I honestly think (and I hope I'm wrong) that Joel is already dead in this trailer. Just how you never see him properly, the way he's just stood off in the doorway, as well as the fact that Ellie never looks at him directly (can't tell for sure where she's looking in the closeup at the end). Would also explain who Ellie is going after.﻿"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"In the first game you could find a piece of paper that explained that 40% of the world's population was dead or infected. That still leaves a majority of the human population to rebuild. They would just need to stay in walled cities. I wasn't really conflicted at the end of the first game because of that. Humanity isn't doomed, things just got set back for a while."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I'm too hyped for this game. One of my all time favorites. One of the reasons I got a PS3. Then bought it again on the PS4.

But, when did ND decode to revisit Joel & Ellie? I thought when TLOU 2 was rumored ND said they were done with those two. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Holy fuck, my butthole puckered at least 8 times throughout that trailer.  It's been a few years since I played.  Do we know who she wants to fuck up?"

Unless they have a really good reason to include the Fireflies again I worry that we'll get a rehash which fails to explore new issues. I'm sure they can pull it off if they really want to, I just want a good reason for the faction to be back at the center of things."

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Damn right thats jizz on the front of my pants
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Is it ok to preorder?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"When that guitar came in, I was almost expecting ""You are my fire. The one desire. Believe when I say. I want it that way"""
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I've been so happy all day because of this
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,So excited. It cannot come soon enough!!!!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Too bad they won't let me buy it on PC.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The Last of Us is easily my favorite game ever. At first, I was thinking a sequel wasn't necessary, but a while ago I became more open to it after realizing that Naughty Dog can't make a bad game after playing Uncharted 4 and realizing the story can actually still go places. I'm pretty goddamn excited. 2018 is way too far away. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Holy shit. I don't care if I have to wait two years for this I'm getting on the hype train right now.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I really wish I played the first. The only time I'm ever jealous about being an Xbox owner is anytime I see The Last of Us or Uncharted. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"If I had cancer, this would have cured me."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,2020 is going to be awesome. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"This...can't be real?!?
I was so, so, so worried this was going to be fake.

I now wish I hadn't watched it.
It's all I want now!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Red Dead and Last of Us coming within one or 2 years? I give in, Playstation I'll buy your console"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Meanwhile I'm still waiting for The Wolf Among Us 2.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Fucking chills
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I'm so freaking excited right now! I've been waiting for this to get announced!

Also, my theory on what it going on is that maybe Tommy's place got attacked, but no one really died. BUT, Ellie was raped and now she's pregnant, hence ""Are you sure you're going to go through with this?"" Joel doesn't want her to put herself in danger if she's going to have a baby. Abortion doesn't seem like much of an option, unless you go with old-school ""you will probably die"" abortion. I know, it sounds dark, but The Last of Us was already dark.

Edit: Though my theory doesn't really explain why Joel isn't upset. If someone did something to Ellie he would be totally ready to kill them."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,what's so good about this game? ALso is there a version for pc?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Ive been thinking about if TLOU2 would be a good idea. After this trailer I am so fucking confident in Naughty Dog. I can already tell that this game is going to be fucking amazing. Just amazing.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Excuse me while I clean up my jizz.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"This is the best news I've heard in a while. God, can't wait to play it when it's released. TLOU I is my all time favorite game. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Last of us made me cry
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I would pay 60 dollars to get a copy that is a. Recording of someone else playing the game. I prefer to just sit and watch the last of us. I watched every minute. My roommate was like do you want a turn and I'm like. No im good. Hah. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Joels voice again... 
"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"You know, I love my gaming PC but this is probably the one console exclusive that actually makes me want to buy a PS4 ;-;"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Finally, still playing the first 1 for the 5th time now.
Played it on all different modes.
Now im on the last mode survival mode and its hard to play, almost by the end now."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"My respect for cinematic narratives in video games has a ""before Last of Us"" and ""after Last of Us"" divide.

I mean, a game has *never* made me cry until the first level of LoU. I felt a deep and visceral hurt for Joel. It changes my entire outlook on video games (and, for the record, I'm an Xbox guy, so I literally stole my buddy's PS3 to play it, haha)

I am not gonna hype myself too hard for this, because those kinda moments only come around once every other generation, I feel - but it isn't easy not getting too excited."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Naughty Dog slaying the competition!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm so excited for this!! I've played the first one three times. It's one of my favorite games of all time. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Man 2016 straightened right up after the Trump win.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Is this one gonna make me cry, too? Cause I dunno if I can handle all that "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,ugh y??? I don't wanna buy a console but I loved the first game so much!! the feels!!!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I've never played the last of us because I only game on the pc but I heard its got a good story
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The song being played is called Through The Valley by Shawn James for anyone wondering
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"My theory: Joel is aging and suffering from his long-term injuries, so Ellie becomes the new caretaker. Master becomes the student. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The best trailer I've seen. Wow
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,yee

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,FUCKING YESSSSS
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"If this came out on PC, I'd be a happy man. I love games with good campaigns and I have wanted to TLOU for so long."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,This trailer has been the best part of 2016 so far. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,This hype train ain't stopping. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Goosebumps.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Better sell my Xbox and buy a PlayStation

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Naughty Dog games alone are good enough reason to own a PS4.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Looks like I need to buy a PS4 and play the first one now...
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Whoa
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Well it's time to buy a PS4 now.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,So much gold on this thread.  We are that excited about this game

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,When will this come out? A few years still?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"My hard erect penis is already trying to reach my wallet to spend money on a game that plays on a system I have never played in a long time. Please help me. I am in desperate need of a game like this to grab me out of my depressing life of loneliness. My goosebumps are as high as mountains, and I am not being sarcastic when I say this. This announcement surprised the shit out of me and it already has over 10k upvotes.  "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Is anyone here more excited for their multiplayer? I still play Factions 'til this day.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"This is the ONLY game that I found myself emotionally invested in. Stopped playing as much near the end b/c I didn't want it to end.

Haven't played any games in years but with Red Dead Redemption and now The Last of Us, I'm gonna have to get back into it for sure."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,All new gameplay mechanic: Ellie can swim
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm probably gonna miss Ellie as a child. Her being out there for the first time ever created some of the funniest moments I had in a game for a long time.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I guess Joel did teach Ellie to play guitar after all. I recall him mentioning he would when they reached salt lake city. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I want to be excited but man, that first game was seriously depressing (it was ""good"" in the sense that it was emotionally powerful and got under my skin, but ""bad"" in the sense that I don't like the lens through which it viewed humanity and the world in general - basically, it was not at all *fun* for me to play, just interesting). Honestly don't know if I can take a second one. :/"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,PLEASE DONT FUCK THIS UP!

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Even as a PC gamer primarily honestly TLOU was one of my favorite games in the last decade.  Rebought the remastered on PS4 and fully intend to make this one a day one purchase.

Words can't describe how fucking excited I am for this game"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Saw nothing about this until today. So pumped.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"So what happened to Tommy's? Why are Joel and Ellie on the run? Who/what is Ellie seeking revenge on? So many questions. What if the fireflies attacked Tommy's because they saw the power of the dam and also because they wanted Ellie, and because of this Ellie wants to hunt down every last one of them. I mean... It did show the fireflies logo on a stop sign... Symbolic maybe?"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,You guys realize this is just a giant feelz train coming straight for us.... :'(
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Time to stop all this PC nonsense then, buy a PS4 *throws laptop in incinerator with shaped like Ellie's face*

In all seriousness, Naughty Dog has never let me down. Ever since Crash Bandicoot (the ones by them, those DS spinoffs and shit sucked) they've been one of my favourite devs. I still dust of Jak and Daxter every now and then. If there were any reason for me to buy a PS4, it'd be them. Who needs Steam when you have The Last of Us? (Ratchet and Clank would be great too, but I haven't really enjoyed one THAT muchsince Up Your Arsenal)"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,This announcement made me so emotional. It will undoubtedly be a masterpiece. Neil Druckmann knows exactly what he's doing.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Holy crap, loving how Ellie's face has changed over time and the reference to the Window from the menu screen. This is gonna be good!!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,I am going to say i
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"I'm a PC guy. Might have to grab a ps4 for this to see what the fuss is about, cause I wanna bite. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Personally, I want it to be where the fireflies are trying to find and take Ellie in because they've run out of candidates (killed off all the immune they could get their hands on, or couldn't find another and having been trying to track her down since) while trying to find a vaccine for the older generation, and Ellie is wanting to kill them because they're coming after her. 

As you play through the game, Joel is getting old, wistful, and even more tired of the world, and seeing his faux-daughter becoming so angry is making him question whether or not there is any humanity left in the world (I'm going off the theory that Joel saved Ellie not only because she had kind of replaced his daughter, but because she was his idealized humanity - someone who cares enough for others to willingly die just at the chance it might save people), and it starts to slip just all he did to save her, and she begins to realize that she could of been the cure, and that this whole time Joel has been lying to her. At the climax, she leaves him. Literally just turns her back on him and walks out after learning the full truth (and probably somewhere along the line they'll divulge she does have antibodies that are replicable or something, so she'll see it as Joel's fault the world is still the way it is, so that her reaction and decision makes sense). It won't be where she leaves him to die, but she'll do something to save his old ass, and then just leave him, probably with a ""we're equal now"" quip, and it'll destroy him completely. His first daughter was taken from him, and so he tried his hardest to keep people from taking his second daughter, but doing so led her to leave him. 

It would also tie into how joel asks ellie if she really wants to go through with killing the fireflies, as he knows that the greatest chance of her finding out the truth will present itself as they interact on any level with the fireflies. 

It would be brutal throughout with a good fuck-tonnage of feels, but that's what I hope happens "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Can we get the first one on PC? Pretty please?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,YESSS!!

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"What's that song Ellie was singing and why can't I download it? I hope they make it sort of like a theme song. In my book, MGS: snake eaters theme song is the best gaming song to date! Perhaps this could top that"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,The only good thing to happen this year tbh. The feels are real.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,yep I cried a little while watching this.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,You don't know how pumped I am for this. The last of us has been one of the best zombie games I've ever played on console. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,I loved the Last of Us. I felt emotionally connected to the characters and I felt the isolation that I figured they were feeling. Truly a great game and I hope this lives up to it.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Damn! I can't wait. 

I'm glad to see Joel is still alive in this. 

I guess he found some time to teach her the guitar like he said he would. 

I can't wait to get back into the stealth kills. Shooting arrows, throwing nail bombs, tossing fire bombs, slamming people in the head with spiked pipes.... and hopefully other new things!!!

Naughty Dog... TAKE MY MONEY!!!!"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"I just want to share this with some of the people on the 'imaginary Joel' bandwagon- the SAME ACTOR who played Joel played the hero of BioShock Infinite and in the second DLC plays the hero again but you play a girl and the voice actor who plays Joel/Booker plays the main hero... but he's dead and in your head.

I seriously don't think Naughty Dog is going to make Last of Us 2's 'B. plot' (for lack of a better term) use the EXACT SAME device from a game that had the EXACT SAME voice actor.

Also, you do not see his face,

puberty you grow a lot more than a 40/50 something regresses,

if you make it to 50 with hair and mass you aren't bald and skinny by 55 unless you get cancer,

they do not show his face and light works on hair somewhat so you don't know his hair color- wait for a poster for Christ sake,

and she killed the people in the house or got into a fight, Joel walked INSIDE from the OUTSIDE and had a gun so he probably didn't have to scrap- she obviously did, they could've been in different places,

so cut that Mr. Robot trope shit out right now with your assuming asses

Get a job

edit: the game director said The Last of Us is a story about THESE TWO, they will both be big players, in an interview about it 11 hours ago. I think he's being quite literal. "

Not because of the game mechanics or gameplay..but the story. I played games from the early 90's I never cried in a game..this was my first game I cried ffs. The story was amazing, the voice acting was 10+... 

I just can't wait for this game..omfg "

This game is a cutscene! a movie with mediocre, average gameplay! Yeah that story telling is good but as someone who values gameplay over narrative, I can't fathom why people love this game so much.

I just hate how people rave about how perfect, and flawless this game is when as a game it's actually quite flawed.

I really wish we got more, but a new cast."

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"They are going to ruin it. Even if the game is decent which it might well be.  :(

The Last of Us is unique and special because it is a wonderful standalone story and it is that *because* it is a standalone story.  The ending and the uncertainty is what makes it all better. 

At least they could come up with something new. There's a whole fucking world out there. But $$$$...."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Fk the dont preorder game sht! This is the only excemption for me. Ima preorder this sht right now if i can even if it doesnt come out til 2018

The story had been told. I would have much preferred a sequel, exploring Tess & Joel's relationship or what happened between Tommy and the Fireflies.

Instead we get a stupidly hyped up trailer with the setup simply being ""Gotta kill em all"". Are you serious? That's the best they could come up with?"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The Last of us was a gaming experience unlike anything ever published. I cried at the beginning of the first game. So many touching moments. This game could surpass dare I say the original. I'm all in.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Holy. I have high expectations. But I think Naughty Dog is ready. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,AAAAAAAASSA AAAAAAAASSA!!!! 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm gonna be hard for the rest of the day now
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,HOLY FUCK.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Fuck. Yes. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The honest truth about this, for me, is that I can't wait for this for two reasons.

1.  My wife might play it through and I can watch
2.  World of Longplays on YT will definitely have it after a while"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,OH MY GOD. I almost fell out of my chair. Second favorite game of all time.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"**OMFG** 

YASSSSS seriously with the cancellation of Silent Hills (yea i'm still hung up on that) this is the news i needed!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,How do you continue that which ended so perfectly?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Development of The Last of Us began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. TLOU 1 came out June 2013. 

So... Uncharted 3 came out this past May... safe to say we could be waiting until ?? 2022?  lol hopefully nowhere as long as TLOU 1 though... "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,God i'm ready to get hurt again 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I read that as the last part of us, which would be a good title for the franchise finale."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"TLOU2 announced. Internet collectively shits itself.

As to be expected. Excuse me whilst I watch the trailer solidly for the next 18 hours "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The song she sang is beautiful and was written by the very talented Shawn James out of Fayetteville, AR. If you have never heard his music, prepare to have your life changed."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,**YESYESYESYESYESYESYES!!!!!**
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Calling it now.

Joel dies. Games is about ellie"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Not going to lie I was really hoping for just a really brutal prequel that would make you hate joel
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Spotify:  [Shawn James - Though the Valley](https://open.spotify.com/track/2MM8qDOkfV1natcOHC5kER)

Expecting that to shoot up in popularity this week"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,!!!!!!!!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Let me just say that song fits that trailer perfectly 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"damit...now i have to buy a ps4
"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Holy fucking shit, is there an official date yet?"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,YAY
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Gotta really hand it to the Naughty Dog cinematic team. This is incredible 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I love the Last of Us so much. Seriously. I cannot wait for this!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,This game is going to be amazing!!! I just hope that they include the infected in multiplayer this time.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Can't wait. 

Hopefully its not a long wait. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The Last of Us, Read Dead 2, and Mass Effect... 2017 SAVE ME!!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I don't even have a ps4 and I'm gonna go jerk off over this game
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Hello, my name is Jon. I'm 21 years old. This game looks good."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Can we take a moment to talk about how drop dead gorgeous that trailer was? Like seriously if that's in-game then the new bar has been set for visuals... and I'm a PC player. I suppose 60 fps will be too much to hope for on a PS4, but it's stunning none the less. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I just bought an Xbox One. I dun fucked up. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Well fuck. This is the ONLY exclusive that can get me to buy a Playstation 4. Rip 400 bucks.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I trust Naughty Dog to make a great game, because that's kind of their thing, but I can't help but be a bit disappointed that they're following the same characters after that perfect ending. 

*Spoilers* A man loses his daughter, his heart turns to stone as he struggles to survive in the apocalypse, learns to love a surrogate daughter again after resisting it so long, and then, upon facing the decision between loosing another daughter or watching the world's last hope disappear, chooses her, and speaks the lie that may end the world. Cut to black. /spoilers

What a perfect stopping point. I hope Last of Us 2 doesn't end up in the same spot as Telltale's Walking Dead Season 2, with that beautiful ambiguity smashed to pieces."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm so fucking excited. I had tears in my EYES. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,YES YES YES YES
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Haven't played the first part yet, but am already excited and looking forward for the release. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Can someone tell me when the expected release date is? Thanks
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"So is this gonna be a theatre release, or straight to dvd?"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Yeah I knew there was a reason I kept my PS4! 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The best part about the higher difficulty in TLOU was that it didn't really allow you that luxury. I constantly felt like I was scrambling for bullets and crafting materials. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"You don't really need them anyway. 95% of that game is passable with stealth, bricks and melee weapons."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Then waste 6 of them firing at a clicker without hitting it once!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I'm not the only one who finished the game with a completely full inventory right? My husband and I would take turns playing and I would get so mad at him for ""wasting"" ammo lol. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"""Seven times at least"""
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Played through the original 7 times on different difficulties and own multiple copies of the game. 



I agree with this comment. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"You know what. I stay in my room all day, playing games and watching shows. So nothing different."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,No no no. We must have incredibly low expectations concerning this. I hear they are planning on making this more a spiritual successor to L4D.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"~10 years before my life expectancy, I'll have to stop playing/watching new series/games/books, in fear of missing the sequels."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Welp, I definitely feel like I'm going to die now that I read this. Yay. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Not the fact that a second game coming, but seeing Ellie and Joel again was unexpected to me. I could've sworn the devs said they were done with those two. I'm still excited to see what happens next, but I'm not sure I'll be ready for the potential feel trip, they were safe after the ending of 1 :(."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"In case anybody gets too excited, I'm guessing we're going to have a bit of a wait to get this one. Fall 2018 maybe?"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Like /u/PingPongMyDingDong (great username) said, the reveal of another TLOU game wasn't surprising in the least, just that Joel and Ellie are in it."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,That shit gave me goosebumps. My body is ready.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"See this is how a movie should create it's trailers.  It's obvious you know what it'll be about for the most part, but the plot hasn't been completely given away.  It leaves you excited and waiting for more. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Welp. Guess I'm buying a PS4.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"My only problem with this announcement is that the first game had the perfect ending, I felt relief at Joel and Ellie's survival like never before playing a video game, yet the somber realisation of what that meant, the sacrifice Joel made. I really hope Naughty Dog have the narrative mapped out for this. But damn, I can't wait to play it."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"This trailer is fucking brilliant. It barely showed anything, but it got people so fucking pumped. Also, brilliant idea to release the trailer with people's reactions in the background. Hearing the crowd going wild at the key points makes this a whole new experience."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Damn near had an orgasm when Joel spoke. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,[deleted]
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Is there a version without the audio from the audience?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Im getting it on my butt
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Where the hell did she even find the time or person to give her a tattoo?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I did notice that. I wonder if that's on purpose, like perhaps they sort of planned this the whole time. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Looks like the dead guy in the room was killed with her knife, or at least a similar one to hers as well.

EDIT: Think i'm wrong, looks too big. Maybe a machete?"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"It's [not the same window](http://imgur.com/pVS7CTs), I'm afraid.  "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I will send you $10 if Joel doesn't die over the course of that game.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"At the time of the trailer, Joel could be already dead. Look how much Ellie has aged, while it looks like Joel hasn't aged at all. The fireflies may have killed Joel, and Ellie is trying to avenge Joel."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I think ellie does know the truth already, they had a little prologue that only some people saw, where joel and ellie were mending their relationship, or at least trying to"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,My bet is one of the big choices in the game will be if Ellie should kill Joel or not.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Well I have a new favorite song for awhile 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Jesus christ that dude has a hell of a voice

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The Rasta Bus
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,For a while.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Do it. The remastered release of TLOU is amazing, & I'd highly recommend ND's much more lighthearted 'Uncharted' games as well (another PlayStation exclusive). With the release of the PS4Pro, you should be able to pick up a 500GB pretty cheap."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,It's pretty rare that a game with as good of a single player story has such a great multiplayer mode as well. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Such an underrated MP. Fantastically tactical. Required more thinking and trap setting than most other MP. Can't wait for the entire package. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Yes!  I poured hours into this multiplayer.  It was unlike any other multiplayer out there.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Was it really that good? I never played it 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Multiplayer being a thing in this didn't even dawn on me until your comment. Now I am even more excited than I already was! The Last of Us had such a unique multiplayer that I can't wait to see what they will do with this one.

But as a huge fan of Uncharted 2 and Last of Us multiplayer... I was really, really disappointed in Uncharted 4's multiplayer. So I hope they get this one right and just make a highly improved version of what they already had."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm still playing factions to this day. Best multiplayer indeed. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Hope they expand the little settlement part of the multiplayer, it was a little undercooked in the first game"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"yea i feel that way too since they didn't show his face, maybe he's in her head"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Oh god. If his death is in the first 20 minutes, I guarantee you that I will be sobbing uncontrollably "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Yes! That makes so much sense. How else is she gonna be so grim about revenge if it weren't for Joel?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I really think she will kill Joel, somehow. I don't know why, but I feel it in my gut."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,[deleted]
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Idgaf how long it takes. I want this game to be perfect. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Naughty dog is Sony's bread and butter, so they'll get all the time they need for sure."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Me too!! And I'm a guy
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Don't forget Nioh, Last Guardian, Spider-Man, Detroit

Sony nails variety unlike any other publisher"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm actually going to cry man 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Wait what? A new Uncharted?!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Xbox could pay for as many exclusives as they like, but they will never come close to PS because of Naughty Dog"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Don't forget about Red Dead Redemption 2
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I had mixed feelings. On one hand I really wanted to see Joel and Ellie again, but on the other hand their story was perfect and adding anything to it could mess it up."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Best game ever made in my opinion
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Before this I always said I'd like to leave Joel and Ellie alone but make more games in the universe. Needless to say this trailer changed that.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,[deleted]
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Music too. Score was amazing. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Theories and observations I've seen and made so far:

- Joel materializes out of thin air

- He appears to move through the tall grass in the doorway like a ghost

- He steps over the puddle, and does not step on the grass (it appears to move out of the way if his foot, but it could just have been the wind)

- He looks remarkably fine despite the battle that just took place"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,that was blood running down the gash on her forehead
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Guessing they came for Ellie, killed people close to her (Joel's brother?) and now she's gonna fuck them up. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The Fireflies track down and execute Joel. Ellie is on the war path for revenge. 

""Joel"" throughout the game is going to haunt Ellie, trying to get her to turn back and let it go, because she knows that if she doesn't, she's going to be killed.

The first game was a father dealing with the loss of his daughter, and this one will be about a daughter dealing with the loss of her father."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"My current theory is that the settlement gets overrun by an opposing group, maybe firefly remnants, with only a handful surviving including Ellie. I get the feeling they'll pull a fast one with Joel and show that he's dead and is haunting Ellie in visions/dreams"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I assume someone has come and killed everyone at the little town they ended up at 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"We just have to wait until we have the PSNow service available for the PS4 so we can stream it to PC.

You know, since Naguhty Dog is *never* going to go cross platform"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Hsha naughty dog ever done anything not for playstation?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Speaking of what song Ellie should've been playing, remember in the first game when Joel said he should teach her how to play the guitar? Well... This trailer shows that he actually did... I don't know, but I think that's so **fucking cute**

(Had to curse there to reinforce my masculinity)"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,THATS CRAZY FAM NOBODY ELSE POINTED THIS OUT
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,That's good to know. I assumed it would be somewhat realistic otherwise they wouldn't have chosen to show the hands etc.  
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Original, $249, Slim $299, Pro $399. There's still sales going on."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Butthurt fanboys. From PC and Xbox
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,A girl who was already 14 or 15 looks way different at age 20-21 while a dude that was 40 doesn't really look much different at age 45.  Even if it is 10 years and Ellie is 25 and Joel is 50 he would not look much different.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Me too but damn I'm hype for just about anything naughty dog makes 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Remember when Druckmann said we'd never play as Ellie? Naughty Gods lie a lot to the press, and I am so glad they do."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-13,:(
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"they said it's still in very early development, I wouldn't expect to see it until 2018, at which point ps4 prices should be pretty affordable to buy back in"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Eewww, it's almost like he'd be banging his surrogate daughter... Wait, he would be!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,They didn't seem to be much in ruins to me. The big chase scene had a bunch of them pretty well armed. All we saw was a few dead doctors and a named higher up kick the bucket. They could still be around in force. They probably found another doctor and then went back after Ellie since they knew she was still alive.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Probably xbone or PC people who are bitter they won't get it
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"there's a ridiculously active amount of positive comments flooding my inbox, probably someone botting it with downvotes"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Why two consoles? The first Last of Us is on PS4 as well
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2017-01-07,Pretty much no chance sorry 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-26,The story. And personally I love the gameplay.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-24,Storytelling basically

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"you could use PS Now to play it, last of us is a supported title  https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/explore/playstation-now/ps-now-on-pc/"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Disgusting to see so many people saying good things about an amazing game. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"In a world of 7 billion people, the answer is always no."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"I played it and thought the game was good, but certainly not amazing as a lot of people do. I think our opinion is absolutely valid, but you have to understand that when you add the last line of your post, ""Now bring on the downvotes!"" you're de-legitimizing your point, because it comes across as you not liking the game only to be a contrarian and rustle jimmies. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Wow, its almost like people have different tastes. If you don't like something move on, never understood why people feel the need to say something for the sake of saying it."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,There are dozens of us!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Nah... it's a great movie trapped inside a crappy game.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Agree never preorder.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Don't think you opinion will last long here. Props to ya for being honest and all but I fully disagree. I liked the gameplay, like a lot. I played through it on all difficulties. But none the less I ain't hating. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Totally.  I want more LoU, I loved the first, but I didn't want to see Joel or Ellie ever again.  This has so many ways it can be completely ruined."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"When has Naughty Dog ever made something subpar since partnering with Sony?  
Even their lowest rated titles are still in contention for GOTY for their release years."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Exactly what I said. Updoots all around. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"didn't notice, guess so"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,the only way this won't be ps4 exclusive is if it jumps to ps5
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Watch a Stream/Lets Play of it on YouTube, it's essentially exactly the same experience as the gameplay elements are...

erm.."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,There's a trailer in this thread that shows Joel and Ellie. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I never thought there would be a part 2 ... 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I played it on the hardest difficulty the first time through and thoroughly enjoyed it (except for the graveyard clicker stairs that automatically make you not crouch walk when you touch them...). Felt like I had to count bullets and plan it out prior to each encounter, but could do it without bullets if I really really needed to.

Played it the other day on an easier difficulty to revisit the story and discovered that *Joel has radar*."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yeah I'm pretty much a master of mortar, everywhere I went I just shot bricks out the fuckin ass"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Lol when I saw clickers I shot everywhere but their head
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"> My husband and I would take turns playing and I would get so mad at him for ""wasting"" ammo lol.

is that why you killed him? "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"""On each difficulty."""
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"""And make sure I get the Platinum trophy."""
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Can't wait to see how they've expanded upon the multiplayer, too.

TLOU 1 surprisingly had an amazingly underrated multiplayer that wasn't expected by anyone. I'm just excited to play a newer version of it"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Nothing bad can happen to you if you never leave your room
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I really hope they can pull off another story with these two without forcing it or ruining the story arc of part 1
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Common story telling is leading me to believe we are going to see Joel die...and I feel tears build up just at the thought of that
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm so excited to get invested in their lives again. Never have I been so invested in two peoples relationship 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"What if that wasnt Joel and he's dead? Thats why Ellie is furious ?! 

*just a theory*,So hyped for the game."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"At best. March 2019, you heard it first.

RemindMe! Two Years"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,2019 the earliest for sure 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I'm thinking either fall 2017 or spring 2018.

I am willing to bet it won't come out in 2019, that's not how these things work. Remember, it's been in development for at least a year, probably even more than that. 

There's no way it'll come out later than first half of 2018."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I'm welling up, they even included the ivy covered window from the opening menu!

So fucking stoked!!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Same here. I was a little worried about them revisiting Joel and Ellie because the first was so good and I didn't want them to ruin it, but this trailer that barely showed anything makes me feel like continuing with them is just... *right.*"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I'm a grown man that witnessed the birth of both of his children and cried. Watching this is like watching a third being born, so much [emotion](https://media0.giphy.com/media/NmuoUzacWAPOo/giphy.gif) right now. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I want to be fully excited, but I'm nervous considering it's Ellie and Joel and I thought part 1 was a near perfect video game. I mean, Naughty Dog definitely deserves some trust, but I'm apprehensive. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Nah man it's essential for a trailer to give an outline of the entire movie's plot, so you don't need to actually watch it to know it sucks"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Literally the game that makes me buy a PS4.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Don't forget Horizon Zero dawn and mother effing Death Stranding! Oh and a little game called GOD OF WAR all coming to the ps4, i think it is safe to buy one just for those games!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Joel is one of the most fleshed out characters in any video game ever. He is grey as fuck in his moral dealings, and at the same time completely relatable in nearly every situation. He quite possibly doomed humanity, but you can barely fault him for doing it. Fuck, I loved the characters in this game!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"It is Naughty Dog we're talking about here. They're arguably the best game-based storytellers in the business. I mean, they made Nathan Drake, an Indiana Jones-esque 10 year old fantasy hero come to life-ish character seem relatable in Uncharted 4 and Ellie is up there as the one of the most connectable (autocorrect tells me that isn't a word but bleh) game characters ever made. They're capable to say the least."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"You felt relief? Man that ending was super sad. They may have survived bit all the trust in their relationship is gone. Joel lied to Ellie and she knew it.  Ellie will always stay near Joel as she has no one else but nothing will ever be the same between them. They may have survived but Joel did the wrong thing and although they'll never say that, they both absolutely know it. 

Heartbreaking.  "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"> This trailer is fucking brilliant. It barely showed anything...

Man, you must've loved OP's picture then. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,">  Also, brilliant idea to release the trailer with people's reactions in the background. 

That was just because the person recorded the livestream."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,You must be really easy 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I kinda think it adds something to it 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,but then you'd just be left with 'nce'
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,[deleted]
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Someone at tommys safe zone community probably, that's where they've been all this time presumably. Ellie definitely looks older"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"If you can get inked in a supermax prison, you can get inked in a fungal apocalypse."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I don't think that it was necessarily ""planned,"" as much as it was probably put there as a reference.

I recall after the first game's release, in an interview with someone at Naughty Dog, they said the team hadn't planned a sequel and it was about a 50/50 chance that they'd make one."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Plot twist: ELLIE dies, no cure, cut to black as the rest of humanity is fucked"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Someone posted above that there might be a twist. Joel is dead already, that she's seeing visions of him. Throughout the game you think you see Joel around only to find out at the end, his death is what started her crusade."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I reckon Joel in the trailer is a ghost and they killed him.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Remind me! 2 years!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Are you expecting Joel to go bald and lose all muscle mass in like 5  years?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I think you're spot on. I think the Fireflies killed Joel and now Ellie is hallucinating and seeing him, driven by the anger of the death of her best friend she is out for vengeance. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,That's what happens with children and adults...  children age faster.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,You can't decipher anything about Joel's appearance from that video other than he has hair and a beard. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The first game was about a father dealing with the loss of his daughter. This one will be about a daughter dealing with the loss of her father.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"She looks to be wearing Joel's old jacket with the sleeves cut off. Pictured [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ba/0e/75/ba0e75d8d6da08f48cebbc1e952772c1.jpg). 

Edit. I think the shakey hands are going to be some serious psychological problems. Ellie and Joel probably lived in peace for a while, Joel taught her how to play guitar and than the fireflies come to take Ellie by force and Joel dies protecting her. There's a bounty on head so everyones trying to get her alive but only the higher up's in the Fireflies no why. Ellie will have visions/haunted by Joel's ghost while seeking revenge for his death and eventually finding out the truth about how she was saved by Joel. An how he sort of doomed humanity and lied to her. Coming to terms with everything she will have some sort of mental breakdown losing hope and it will get extremely dark. This is all me going crazy with hype lol. Please Naughty Dog i pray at the end they somehow find a way to make a cure with Ellie that doesn't involve her dying and that Joel made the right decision in saving her after all and she can forgive Joel. An done crazy theorizing lol"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Where was this
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Where does this info come from? I don't think they would leave something that important out of the actual game because it affects their relationship so much.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I need the full Ellie version too D:
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"In all honesty I thought it was going to be name something like this. The rest of us, or the next of us"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"So, that's it huh? we some kind of the last of us part ii?"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,🎤we gonna rock down to The Last of Us Part 2🎤
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The Last of us 3: The Search for More Us
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Just bought a 500gb slim for 249! Uncharted 4 bundle sadly, I've only played the first. Wouldn't be fair playing the most recent one."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The comment reads like Sony marketing, heh."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Does anyone still play it on PS4? I never actually played it.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,">Required more thinking and trap setting than most other MP

That was definitely one game where a 4v1 in the last round was never a guaranteed win."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yes, it rewarded skill and teamwork."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,It was a masterpiece. I've been playing it almost daily since 2014 when the ps4 remaster came out

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Don't you put that evil on me Ricky Bobby!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"No, they never would start you off with something this sad at the start of the game."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Nooo:( I wouldn't be able to take it
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Well it looks like they are a few years in the future.  I'm just guessing but maybe she is sad that all the people of the town they are in (probably the one with Rick's brother) were killed when they tried to capture Ellie.  So killing pretty much all your friends and neighbors could give the reaction that Ellie had.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm hard and wet. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,God Of War 4

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Spiderman: Detroit sounds like a badass game 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,DLC with Chloe from Uncharted 2.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I think calling it Part II is the best way to assure it won't hurt the original at all, because the original is just the beginning of their story. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,You shouldn't have mixed feelings.  Naught Dog does not know how to fuck up.  
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,I agree and it's my personal favorite. There has never been another game that I was so invested in. I have always wished I could get the experience from that initial play through again. It was like reading a really really good book. And now I'll get that chance.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I felt the same.  The story ended so perfectly. But this... it was like seeing old friends, and I can't wait to hang out with them again!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Story is what separated it for me.  I was so emotionally invested
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yeah you're not wrong. I replayed it the other day(s) and some mechanics still stick out, like how close you can be to enemies without them seeing you. I understand that it's a game but it sorta breaks the immersion. Still, the story is what made it. All the small interactions really built up their relationship. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,There it is. Worried for my guy but it'll be interesting to see if they do take that on. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Ahh, that makes sense. If she's bleeding, then they're still fighting!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Ellie goes rambo?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"I think he's still alive, the emphasis the camera did on joel's gun gives me hope, there's no reason why a hallucination would have a gun, makes no sense, but who am I to say anything? I don't even think hallucinations walk through doors!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I like that theory! I can see this going very well!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Stream? STREAM?!  haha no thanks.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,They've only developed for Playstation ever since Crash Bandicoot.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"I know right? I can't believe the gall of the people in this thread, how dare they be excited for the second installment of a game they loved? Pathetic imo. "

Well. 9th time lucky."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,You can still have an aneurysm.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Not a big Naughty Dog player, but have they ever blown it on a story?"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I don't think it will end with Joel's death but I think his death will be part of the climax and Ellie will be forced to move on alone or with a new character we meet. In the first one I thought Joel was going to die when he fell on that rebar. I actually thought the game was over for a second. That was a tense moment. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"long as it's not in the opening scenes or too early on, i wanna do cool shit as him!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I feel like he's going to be a hallucination for the game. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,My theory is Ellie is getting revenge for the death of Joel.  and the Joel in the trailer is a hallucination.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"The game kept surprising me in how emotionally attached I was to these characters, something that usually doesn't happen to me unless I'm reading a great book.

I'll never forget when I killed those doctors to save Ellie, I literally screamed ""STAY AWAY FROM MY BABY GIRL!!!"" at the screen in the middle of the night, waking up and scaring the shit out of my housemates. Not many games can get that kind of rise out of me..."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Maybe Joel died, she wants revenge, but starts hallucinating visions of him talking to her. Playing through the game we think Joel is there the whole time then realize it's just in her head."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,She could be insane and that could be ghost Joel.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yea I'm going to hop on this train of thought as well, Ellie is all busted up so I'm assuming she did all the killing and Joel (who looks clean) talked like a manifestation of her conscience, plus Ellie looks like she is beyond pissed and half certifiable, feels trip is going to be one hell of a ride. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Affirmative. I'll message you in 12 hours about ""hot slut takes fake bang taxi"", ah wait, that's not your request, is it. Oh well, I'll see you in 12 hours!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Fuck.. I have to not die for almost two years?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Announce it to ""Fall 2018""

then delayed to ""2019""

then get released by 2020 

as always"

I'm sitting there rocking my new daughter with my foot when i started up the game, by the time his daughter gets killed, im losing my shit locking doors and just sobbing, not knowing at all how to handle all my new emotions.  It still makes me think a lot.  Made me realize I would trade my soul and coukd be capable of awful things just to protect that little girl; something i hadnt considered before her birth."

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"> near perfect

No way man. If I've ever played a perfect videogame in every way possible, it was The Last of Us"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Blame all the dumbass people who complain that they don't want to watch a movie that they don't know exactly what it's about. Those are the same people who within the first 10 minutes of a movie starting complain that they're confused and don't know who everyone is. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Its thoughtful of them really
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Yep.  The first one was the only reason I bought a PS3.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Don't forget to grab Bloodborne when you pick up your PS4.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"That was huge for me. How they created this PERFECT incarnation of a moral choice where the right thing and what's best for humanity comes down to a single choice. How many times we think that we would step left but everything in the entire game built up to a moment where it was so, absolutely crystal clear that the right path is the one we walked down. I didn't question Joel for a second in that last segment. 

I was legitimately speechless at the ending, just felt so agonizing in some ways. That's how you know it was real. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"This one gets me every time, a vaccine would not save humanity at this point IMO. Most of the time the runners and clickers brutally grab the person and kill them rather than turn them. On top of that the fireflies are a group with an agenda, they would most likely use it as a weapon, like spread spores to military to eliminate them. Also since they have had people like Ellie before and they didn't just let her wake up and tell Joel this is what she wanted. The fireflies are shady as fuck so The decision like every decision Joel makes isn't black and white IMO"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The point is that humanity is doomed whether or not Ellie lives or dies. It comes down to who are really the bad guys? If we flushed out everyone with the parasites, humanity is still going to be evil. Joel realized this and made the choice figuring that Ellie's life wasn't going to be the end all for evil. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"If you're the father of a little girl, his decision wasn't even controversial imo. If the choice was literally my girl's life or the human race, you'd have to take her from my dead hands. Maybe it's biology, I don't know."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,">He quite possibly doomed humanity, but you can barely fault him for doing it. 

Joel did not doom mankind, they were doing just fine when they were working together (like in that village halfway through the game).   It's the human who were causing their own misery in nearly every case.

I mean, yeah, the initial epidemic  killed people, like Ebola, like Black Death, but it's people fearing each other who turned everything to shit.   "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Ding. 

This is why they are bringing them back. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"To be fair, Ellie could simply be evidence that humanity is slowly adapting to the spores. So while Joel may have made humanity suffer for a bit longer, there is still a high chance, imo anyway, that more people with Ellie's condition (brain change after being bitten or whatevs) will appear in the future."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Not to mention in a post reveal interview they talked about how they were so dissatisfied with the stories they kept coming up with they almost gave up on a sequel all together because they refused to tell a story that would dilute the first game.

Which means if they're doing it they know they've hit on a really good narrative."

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I was so excited when I didn't see anything.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Nope. Brilliant.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I'm so dumb. At first, I thought that she was performing in front of a crowd of people and then it showed her in an empty room then I thought that she was just performing in front of a crowd inside her head. I didn't realize until when Joel walked in that it wasn't supposed to be apart of the video. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"When they see that firefly symbol, they know what it means, they know."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Not sure why but when I see trailers for long awaited games/ movies like this with the audience exciting reaction it makes me teary eyed as fuck
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The moment the fireflies logo came into view people started losing their shit, I got goosebumps when I saw that."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"There's no ""o"" in audience



Edit: Just saw your name... woops"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Joel must be about 60 now. Shit.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I mean, it makes sense. There's no set-up for anything else and the story is entirely contained, albeit open-ended. It very well could have been a one-off."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,">cut to black as the rest of humanity, minus Bill, is fucked.

~~FIFY~~ FTFY"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Why should the rest of humanity be more fucked than before? They didn't have a cure for the first 20 years and neither did they for the years after Part 1. 

It will just go on how it always did."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Honestly that would be worst. If Ellie dies and it ends that Implies a Joel suicide. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,That would be 2016 as a game.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"If Ellie dies, I will riot."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Joel pulls a resnov?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"That's some M. Night Shyamalan shit right there, and not in the horrible way "

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Notice how Joel just kinda materialises as he approaches the front door? Could definitely be a subtle clue hinting she is imagining it
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"If this is the case, I hope they mind fuck us and lead us to believe he's actually alive and with you on your journey til plot twist: he's just in your head."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yes you are the only one to pick up on the shirt.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Set in India. India is very rich in mythology and mysteries so will work as a perfect place for their adventure.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,They also called the hangover sequel part 2 so you never know
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I guess that's true. If it was any other company I'd be afraid. But ND really knows their shit. So I can't help but feel pumped.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-07,Just bought the remastered edition the other day after seeing this post. Wanted to see what all the fuzz is about. Just finished it. Holy shit. Great fucking game. Def in my top five. Highly recommended. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"What do you expect in an announcement thread for the game that's regularly cited as a favorite to those who have played it?  90% of the downvotes sum up to ""I don't get what all the hype is about.""

It's a game that won 100+ awards and is receiving a sequel after almost 4 years, but somehow you're angry that fans are excited for it??"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"It's way more fun without it, trust me. I just used patience and camera angles and it was a ton of fun... the whole radar thing didn't seem to fit the game. Joel's not a clicker!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"That's Grounded Mode (the hardest difficulty)

No radar, less ammo, smarter enemies. "

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Just spit-balling here (and tagging just in case); [I think the people she killed in the house there were Fireflies. The framing makes it seem like their mark was on a stop sign outside the house and it was their territory. My guess is that Joel tells her the truth pretty early in the game (first third at least) and then the full story along with new information we get makes her want to kill them all](/spoiler)
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Perfect.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Damn you beat me to it lmao

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yep, me too, and I never played much else on it. Crazy how Sony basically got me to pay $400 to play a single game."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Pretty much the same here. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Just finished Bloodborne and I haven't had that much fun in a while. And stress...that too
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Literally the two games that made me buy a PS4
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I absolutely question Joel's decision . Ellie had made a choice, and he stole that from her.  Not for her, but because he himself couldn't stand losing her.  He possibly betrayed the world to save Ellie, but ultimately, he betrayed Ellie to save himself.  Which is why he lies to her in the final moments of the game."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Eh, that depends on how you did it I think.

I perfect stealthed the last bit, didn't kill anyone and got into the operating room unseen.   My logic was that ""holy shit that's a lot of machine guns"", so I thought I was supposed to do that.

Turns out most people just killed everyone including the surgeons and nurses, and I feel like killing the doctors was kind of unnecessary.  But, in retrospect, I think killing absolutely everyone was the canon ending."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Seems to me the primary threat of infection comes from airborne spores rather than direct contact with infected. A vaccine would be hugely helpful.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Replaying it, they do point out in the beginning that some people get infected just from spores growing in their homes.  The spores might keep spreading--in that case, a vaccine might be the only way."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"> Also since they have had people like Ellie before and they didn't just let her wake up and tell Joel this is what she wanted

They really did have others like Ellie? I thought that Joel made that up completely."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"How the heck did they think they were going to make a vaccine out of nowhere? 

Do you know how long it takes to design a vaccine vector and test it?!? Factoring in their lack of manpower or infrastructure... impossible! Especially as it was just the fireflies. I think the only way would be as a collaborative effort with several governments around the world. Assuming the rest of the world has a surviving population."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I think saving Ellie was the right choice as well. Was humanity meant to be saved? Think about all the bad people you met in the game, then think about the good people. Two black guys, and one camp. The rest wanted to do the worst to you. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Oh, I bet the fireflies came in and killed everyone where Ellie and Joel were staying, trying to get her back.  And now she wants revenge."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Wait. I thought the ""had immune people,"" was part of Joel's lie. No one had shown immunity before Ellie. Unless I missed something."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"I saw it as more of a conflict of ideologies between Joel and Ellie, and the whole cure thing is just the backdrop. Everybody Ellie cared about was killed by the infected (apart from Marlene, but she doesn't know that), and she sees dying for the sake of possibly finding a cure as like her calling. She's willing to sacrifice herself to get rid of the infected. 

Joel on the other hand, everybody he cares about is killed by humans. They kill his daughter, Tess, and they would have killed Ellie too if he hadn't intervened. So his only real purpose is just to hold onto *something* that people can't take from him, whatever the cost. 

So in the end, even if the main characters don't fully realize it themselves, the main conflict is Ellie's selflessness vs. Joel's selfishness. And of course Joel wins completely. There's a little ambiguity at the end about whether she believes his story or not, but either way it's a pretty tragic ending for Ellie IMO. 

So yeah at the heart of it I see it as just a deeply personal story about the differences between those two characters (bear in mind also that Ellie has probably lost at least as many people she loves as Joel has) and the whole apocalypse thing was just a stage for it to play out on. As far as the story is concerned, what happens to humanity doesn't really matter. :)"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Yeah that's the background of Joel decision, specially after seeing the game introduction. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I think an interesting plot narrative would be that he dies while trying in some form or another to tell her the truth about her.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Literally just bought a 100 ps4 pros because of this brilliance.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Same here, I thought she was on a stage singing to people."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"IIRC he had his daughter early, and he didn't go to college? So he was probably ~50 during the first game, late 40s?"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The first game explored how many younger people prolly wouldn't survive post-outbreak. I could imagine there being a scenario where Ellie is one of the very few her age who actually survived. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Not that they even know for sure if they can reverse-engineer Ellie into a cure, which is one of the reasons why the first game ended like it did."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yeah, and even with a cure I think it's too late for most of them anyway. (not saying a cute is a bad thing, but it won't fix everything)"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Without the torture of course.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,ALL MUST DIE
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"and on top of that, he looks like he didn't just fight and kill those people. He looks clean and unscathed, not like the brutal Joel we see throughout the first one. Plus, he'd be a few years older and is bound to be slower, which makes him being unharmed less likely.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Also in my opinion the hardest(/best) part about Grounded Mode was there being no HUD at all. You literally needed to count every shot so you know when to reload, and you don't know your health at all until you're critically low and Joel starts holding his arm.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"the story was a mess but all the returning characters were fine in it, it was just the ideas and the badguys that ruined in the terms of not ruining the arc of TLOU1 i think they can do that just fine"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The thing is though, you have to wonder if it would truly be Ellie's choice, or if she would make the choice because she felt obligated to do so. Saving humanity at the cost of your own life is a heavy burden for a 14yo kid. 

Obviously, Joel loves her and had his own personal reasons to lie to her at the end as, but I also feel that he did not let her make her own decision because, ultimately, it wouldn't really be her decision. It's easy for us to say that a single life is a small price to pay, but I don't blame Joel for not wanting to force that sacrifice upon her.

Besides, there was no guarantee that the experiments would even successfully create an effective vaccine that could be mass-produced. And even if it did, the fireflies proved themselves to be a shady bunch. Think of the power to be had by controlling the production and distribution of such a vaccine!

The humanity that Ellie could have maybe, possibly saved, perhaps, would then be at the whim and mercy of the fireflies."

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yeah, Uncharted 1 and 2 were made by the same team, with the addition of Amy Hennig as the lead writer. Uncharted 3 comes along, ND splits into two teams - Neil and TLOU team, and Amy/Evan and the UC3 team. Amy ends up leaving during UC3's production. For UC4, you have the entire team back together, sans Amy, with Neil as the creative director. 

At least, that's to the best of my recollection. I may have gotten a few details wrong. "

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Back in 2003, Manhunt was considered controversial for focusing on violence.

in 2018, this is the main game at Sony's E3 conference. It's more violent than Manhunt."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Is it still coming out this year? I can't wait.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The multiplayer though just imagine!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"When that girl kisses Ellie, you can see Ellie's nose smush against that girl's cheek... no clipping... it's crazy how much detail ND puts in these games. Reminds me of Drake's malleable chin fat in Uncharted 4, most people wouldn't even notice but small details really sell it "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So is Gustavo Santaolalla doing the soundtrack on this one too? The soundtrack was incredible in the first.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,My body is ready.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Naughty Dog is nearly a perfect studio are they not? I can't think of a title they've released that is not high quality.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"To borrow a phrase, this ""gameplay trailer"" was so tightly choreographed that the demonstrator might as well have been waving a conductor’s baton."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Everyone is praising the animations, which are amazing, but I was just sitting there terrified of Ellie getting hurt, after a while I realised I probably didn't have to be, because she's an absolute killing machine, but still.

Man, that was an emotional rollercoaster, kind of wish I'd bought a PS4 now, but I'm not sure I can justify the purchase for one game, even if I did love the first one and this one looks even better."

Crooked Still getting some Naughty Dog love..."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This game looks so damn good. They managed to step it up even after how good Uncharted 4 looked/played. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Christ the comments on YouTube and Facebook are toxic who gives a flying fuck about two girls kissing, the trailer is amazing and the only one from E3 I’ve bothered to watch multiple times now."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The Last of Us is the best gaming experience I had.

I’ll have to get a PS4 to play this one! I’m excited!"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"r/watchpeopledie .... Oh wait. 

Jesus that was incredible."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The way the AI searched for Ellie has got to be some of the most realistic behavior I've seen. The way they split up and look around every corner just amazed me.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,As a fern enthusiast I am SUPER FUCKING HYPED. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I’ve been listening to Crooked Still for YEARS, and I never thought I would hear them in a trailer for The Last Of Us Part II.  What a weird time line. "

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,As a PS4 owner I feel so spoiled by the incredible lineup we've had this past year or so and what we have to be stoked for in the future. Sony is absolutely killing it. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The chat room I was in thought every single thing was scripted. They were shitting on every single game though. Glad to see there’s less pessimism here.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Soo hyped!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This looks so goddamn good.  last of us 1 was great. Naughty Dog does no wrong it seems 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,And more bigots here too. Then gamers wonder why they get a bad stigma. Also seems like the downvote brigade is in all these sections regarding this game.

I WILL nut"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I love what this game has become. Unknown coming out of the gate (I was criticized for preordering it), GOTY awards, surprisingly amazing MP, cult fandom of even XBONE and PC players. 

Now the sequel's trailer is on the front page of reddit. I truly hope as many people as possible experience The Last of Us story. It's truly amazing."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"If that's actual gameplay footage, my mind is officially blown to shreds "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I lifted my hands attempting to press the square button before realizing I didn't have a controller. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I could see myself buying a PS4 just for this game.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I just watched the video...
Sheer genius. An absolute work of art. I've never seen a more realistic and immersive game in my life. Bravo. I'm sincerely blown away right now. Just. Wow."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Honestly I was super hyped when she went through the space between the self things. I’m not sure why but that’s what I remember.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"They mention her ""old man"" so Joel is basically confirmed to appear in this one, hype!"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Ellie is the hero we deserve !
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,EllieGBT
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Why do you have to be PS exclusive???? D:
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Loved it and all, but I think I would have preferred a trailer that was gameplay alone. 

You get one guess why Ellie is on a murderous rampage."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"the stage thingy was so cool lol, also I am watching the stream of the super best friends and they're super right about something, you can tell the ""last of us"" feeling this game has, so many games copied the stealth mechanics of the first game, but you can tell what's the real deal."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Even if the final game doesn’t look this good it’ll still be absolutely stunning. I was on the edge  of my seat the whole time.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This actually looks so sick... goddamn
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,holy fucking shit
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,yes 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Now I truly believe that Joel is dead
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Oh my god.. this looks absolutely incredible. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This looks great! It’s kind of interesting with the lack of the infected zombie-people though. Guess that means humanity’s pulling it together here.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Aaaaand I’m going to have to buy a ps4
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"With all of these PS4 exclusives doing so well, it's making it ever more tempting to buy a PS4"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I can’t actually deal with how stunning this game looks. The first Last of Us is easily one of the best computer games I’ve ever played, and I reckon this one looks set to match or even surpass it"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So smooooooth
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Speechless with a shit eating grin on my face. Amazing!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,they made ellie look more like her VA in this. which I don't mind.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I need it 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I feel compelled to buy a PS4 now...
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Holy shit this looks good. Like really good. I'd pre-order it tonight if I could. That scene alone would be worth $60 even if the rest of the game sucks (#itwont). I'm definitely taking a long weekend to myself to play through this game as soon as I get it.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I was wondering, how did they get the two actresses so close together for the kissing scene? As far as I know they're wearing a headpiece that is protruding from their forehead to record the eye movement's and facial cues. How would they be able to get so close to each other without bumping that clunky mo-cap gear?"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Maybe it's just mods doing their job but I'm very happy to see an almost total absence of ""OH MUGAWD yucky gay kisses in ma vidya games stupid sjw's and their virtue signaling!!!""

This looks incredible."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Don't forget this is an official gameplay trailer captured on dev kits. They can augment detail, draw distance, and every shot has been expertly composited by movie professionals to remove aliasing, and all natural defects. 

Not slamming the game, I'm sure it will be great. But official trailers and screens have been heavily augmented."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Badass! Can’t wait for this game.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Cannot wait for this game 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"We should keep our expectations in check. I remember *The Last of Us* 2012 E3 trailer had awesome AI reactions and interactions during combat. The final product's AI, however, was never as smart as the trailer's. This trailer was carefully curated for its audience. That final animation where it transitions from combat back to the cutscene is an example: I'm not convinced we'll see the same thing in the final product."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I might be wrong, but I'm like 95% sure this wasn't actual gameplay, merely something pre-rendered and pre-recorded in order to give players a good idea of what the game would be like. The animations were just a bit TOO smooth, and the transitions between gameplay and cutscene were a bit too seamless, even when triggered by completely random events like simply crouching under a truck or killing a particular guy. This kind of thing happens all the time (for example the first gameplay demo of ""Bioshock Infinite"" shown at E3 wasn't a gameplay demo at all, since the enemy AI wasn't done yet - it was all scripted), and it wouldn't surprise me if Naughty Dog used pre-existing assets and animations in order to create their own demo, which is either completely pre-rendered from scratch and made to look like in-game footage or actually in-game footage, but extremely heavily scripted and most likely playing itself in order to trigger all of the scripted events at the appropriate time. I'm not saying that the game won't be amazing, because it's Naughty Dog and it'll probably be, but maybe don't expect the final release to be quite as smooth and cinematic as the demo."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Very excited to see Ellie hopefully find love and continue to be a badass!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ellie's sexuality has been heavily hinted at since Left Behind. This isn't a surprise. But, why does she look like an entirely different person instead of an older version of herself? "

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I thought ellie crawling under the truck was scripted but i noticed her crawling in the bushes right before seeing the guy get disembowled so it must be a new mechanic. Really excited for this game all i need is a joel trailer next.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Good to see Ellie smile like that.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Im not watching this cause I dont have a PS4 and Ill just hate myself for it.

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"As much as I loved the ending to the first game and don’t need it needs a sequel, I am excited to see the implications of Joel’s lie."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This will set a very high bar for the future of gaming.  It looks like a legitimate next level.  Well fucking done.  Can't wait to immerse myself in that world!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Anyone else super pumped for the multiplayer? The multiplayer in the first one was incredibly good I thought.

In game rendered cinematics that transitions smoothly into gameplay. 

Sonys studios in general makes freaking awesome games. 

Only CD Projekt Red could top them."

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Almost a reason to get a Playstation.
I wish this game wasnt an exclusive console title"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This looks next generation, so incredible!"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Holy Fuck.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I haven’t had a PS since the PSOne and have been an avid Xbox gamer since, but when TLoU came out I single sessioned it on a mates console on Survivor and was blown away. 
The original was easily one of the most engrossing and polished games I’ve ever played.
Seeing this trailer, once again, blew me away at the level of world crafting and detail that has gone into creating it. 
One of the smallest details that actually blew my mind was when Ellie is hiding behind the car and has her hand on it, it slightly adjusts as her body and camera does. 
I know it’s small but when developers put that level of detail into a game you know you have an unforgettable experience on your hands.
This time around I am so tempted to get a PS, I actually don’t care if this game is the only one I ever play on it. Easily my favourite trailer of E3 and there were some superb ones, but this was truly outstanding."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This looks fantastic. Its so seamless. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Sony killed it this year! I'm so happy I own a ps4 pro.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That gameplay blew my mind
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Definitely looks good. I was sold on it anyway, but good to see some more. "

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I can't help but feel that chick who kissed Ellie is being manipulative in some way. Anyone else get those vibes? 

But yeah, gameplay looks tremendous. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Anyone else worried about the fact that we've not seen any clickers in the trailers so far?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Holy fuck  


Literally have shivers"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Wow I can't believe how impressed I am. How are they so good at their jobs? 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,And it will be completely entirely ONLINE
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I hope that there is harder difficulties, the fact that she moves around right in front of people's faces and is still in stealth is such a tired mechanic. I understand if you move by relaxed sentries and stuff like that, but not NPC's on alert. 

What was cool to see was the mobility hits, getting shot with an arrow hurts your speed, I like that. I'm curious to see if there is a bleeding mechanic, whereby open wounds sap health and mobility over time. 

I can dream "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"A few notes,

Looks like Ellie's love interest is a player. Seems like she's leading Ellie on, I'm sure at this point Ellie has a reputation of being a bad ass and protector. 

Ellie's friend mentions her ""old man"". Nice reference to JOEL. he also states that the old man has been critiquing his patrols. Joel is alive.

Graphics look impecable. Foliage is massively improved and resembles Uncharted 4's beautiful landscapes. Fog is also noteworthy.

Crafting seems to be imrpoved. Very fast in this demo, we'll see how it plays. Looks like there are plenty of new toys to play with (explosive arrows!!) along side classics like the med kit. 

Combat is absolutely brutal. Not for the faint of heart. 

Vaulting and jumping looks so smooth

The environmental interaction is really what gets me excited. Bullets shattering glass, Ellie diving under the truck, Ellie getting thrown through the glass in the store... Animations are truly impressive. 

Easily my most anticipated game."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"""Oh Ellie, they should all be terrified of you"" 

That line gave me chills."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Game of the Show. This game is gorgeous. I love the animations when she sneaks through tight spaces. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I hope it does not disappoint, because I have really high expectations after this,"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Dude, I'll legit get a PS4 just for this game alone."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It’s truly never been more depressing to own a gaming pc and an xbox. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Holy that was pretty fucking good!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Stop I can only get so erect!

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,And I jizzed... In my pants. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I want to believe this is what the game will look like, but the trailer seems a bit ""scripted"". Enemies don't seem to move as they acutally would ""let's check this corner twice by 3 people."" As well as it might get downgraded as many other games, but i will hope for the best."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This might be the game that’ll make me buy a PS4.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I’m honestly flabbergasted. This exceeded my every expectation. I could not be more hyped for a game!!!

Also I wasn't too impressed with Spiderman, but that cliffhanger got me. I can't wait to find out who he was talking to. I genuinely thought it was going to be an Avengers teaser and that Marvel was doing with games what they did in their cinematic trailer. I bet it's Miles. Who the fuck was Peter talking to? Was it MJ? It got me good."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Looks very scripted gameplay. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ill be a bit of a buzzkill and remind everyone not to take naughtydogs word on how good the AI looks. I have a ps4 and LOVED the orignal last of us, but they would not shut the fuck up about the AI in the first one during its marketing blitz. Go watch some of the first gameplay trailers and youll see how far off the trailer behaviour was to the final product. Id be over the moon if the game actually looks and plays this well but remain a little skeptical. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,is there a reason why 'the last of us' games are not on PC?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This gameplay was very scripted don't expect it to be this fluid in the actual game 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That was amazing.

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"They added Stormtroopers to the game I see, Hmm... interesting."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Amazing. Let's all just lose our minds together.

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Recline and enjoy, people. She’s back. At last."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"When this was in early development I could've sworn they said it was going to be on pc as well.
Guess I'll be dusting of my PS4 cos the first game is the best I've ever played

Edit: bloody autocorrect"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Naughty Dog in the lead at E3, followed closely by Bethesda and CDPR"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Goddammit...Now I HAVE to buy a Console again.
The Last of us - was the reason I got my last Playstation, and its probably gonna be the reason I get this one as well.

The Last of Us - Best money I ever spent for entertainmnet. Price of the Console included.

God Of War almost had me pull the trigger. But I managed to hold back. But The Last of Us Part2, ye Im allready planning where to put it. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Can't wait to play this game. Looks so amazing!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Not gonna lie. I teared up when Ellie cheesed at the end. Such a masterfully produced trailer!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Happy pride month! We all needed this.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That gameplay was crispy af 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I have a copy of the last of us and I’ve never played it. After seeing this I’m definitely playing it now 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This won e3 for Sony hands down 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Holy shut this looks amazing
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Holy shit. I could have watched that gameplay for hours. Film quality stuff.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I dont know if any of you are old enough to remember the original TLOU E3 hype. People were swooning over the fluidity of combat and amazing AI. The game kind of underdelivered on that. So im skeptical.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"To the bottom of the page I go: I don't think this will be the final game. A lot of the mechanics look too fluid to be really inside the game as such, and with their original trailer for the first one being full of broken promises just like this, I'm skeptical - very skeptical. Still, I hope it will be good obviously."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"A lot of this ""gameplay"" isn't actually gameplay. It's ""cinematic"" gameplay, that's *highly* scripted, uses camera pans, custom animations, dialogue, scenarios, visual effects and more, that won't play out the same way (or at all) in release. The original E3 ""gameplay"" reveal for The Last of Us was the same way, except this time they took it to a whole other level.  
I'm sure it'll be a fantastic game, but to call this ""gameplay"" is stretching it pretty far."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,JOEL?!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Honestly with still no release date and how advanced it looks wouldnt br surprised by a ps5 release especially since bethesda mentioned stanfield and elderscrolls vi being next gen 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"my god it looks so good, this game is going to be an emotional rollercoaster I am so fucking ready "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Is there a release date? 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,No release date?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Anyone know the music being played?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Ellie Savage
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Hopefully it has a multiplayer it's so underrated in the TLOU. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Hot damn. If that’s supposed to be what actual gameplay looks like... just, wow"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Where is Joel? 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It looked great but in the end a lot of details never make it to the end product.  Same happened with TLOU1’s E3 presentation.  We’ll see.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Wow, arrows through chest, gaping neck wound, light on the torches.  This looks ground breaking.  "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Of course I can't know how good the story is gonna be but those graphics and that detail is very promising.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Naughty Dog doing work. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It honestly looks too good to be real. I thought ""Why?"" when they first announced this game, but holy shit now I'm just at awe."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The gunshots seem so realistic. Incredible detail when it comes to the impact and bullet paths. Also the variety and brutality in the take-down shots is so fitting for the game. So excited for whats to come!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Literal chills anticipating a game that has everything that trailer just showed.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Holy shit...I'd watch someone play that and have a ball
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That looks like fun :)
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I got downvoted for saying that Joel is probably dead after the first teaser came out, but I’m still willing to bet it’s true, or that it’ll happen early on in the game. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Game looks great.

She looks a lot different from the earlier promo art."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The most realistic game play I’ve ever seen. The reactions in the fights really stand out to me! When she’s dodging stray bullets. Just so many small things that make this trailer AMAZING!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I gasped and held my breath like 30 times throughout this entire trailer omg
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I'm HYPED
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"lets hope this trailer isn't overly scripted, i would love to see the boundaries get pushed yet again by this series. the attention to detail and the over all emotion that they're bringing to the table is something that I'm very excited to see. if the game does flow and build around the player as well as get directly affected by the decisions and quick choices you decide to make like they do in this trailer. Imagine then  the gameplay that will take place against the infected. I'm genuinely excited to play this game and see where the journey goes. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Fucking nutted on those scavengers. I wonder how they play into the story and if we’ll see any Clicker gameplay soon. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I dont even play this game or have any consoles but this looks amazing.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,that is un-fucking-believable. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"While I love this trailer, it's important to note that most of the stuff you see is scripted. Since it's Naughty Dog I'm willing to say that what you see is somewhat close to what we'll get, but at the end of the day it's certainly not gonna look like that 100%."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Dammit, there are just too many games worth playing on the PS4 to pass up"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"YouTube comments full of people ""Clicked"""
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This game looks amazing. The gameplay looks great and the graphics are just amazing. Wanted to see Joel but that's fine. I don't know if I am more hyped for this or death stranding tho 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,LOOKS GOOD.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"still havent finished the first one, fuuuuck"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I was screaming like a little girl while watching this. So good.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Incredible
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The movement looks heavy, you can see momentum carry through as Ellie moves over objects. Not abrupt in turns, or suddenly stopping to change direction. A commendable detail to have in the game. It was almost hard to tell between cinematic scenes and actual gameplay if it wasn’t for the hud.

This is the result for spending extra time to get those details in motion capture."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"All the combat and stealthy action is awesome, but the thing that impressed me the most is...the faces are just incredible."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Holy Shit. I’ll buy a PS4 pro for this. Done. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"That was a perfect trailer, I'd rather watch it then any action film."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It honestly looked too good.  Like how is some of that stuff possible? Stuff like picking up then throwing the bottle immediately. Is that actually possible? I may need to actually give the first one a go. I played it a lil bit but if that trailer is normal gameplay I need to try it again. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Hope Naughty Dog reads this whole comment section!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I am hyped
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Is it weird that I don’t want to watch this so I can go in as blind as possible when I first play the second part of my favorite game?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Mother of God
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This in VR would be so intense
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I believe the graphics can be this good and the animations this fluid. What I dont believe is the camera and camera angel will be anything like this and thats what makes to video so smooth.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Watch her hand on objects while she’s sneaking and hiding, the realism of its movements is uncanny!"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Well I guess it's high time I get a PS4
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I'm gonna upvote but I won't look at the trailer. To excited. My girlfriend is gonna soooo angry when I turn my phone off for months leading up to it's release date so for the time being I'll be nice. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I got the first one for free with my ps4. How does it hold up to time? Was thinking of doing an easy level play through for half asleep after work play
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That was sick! 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,No I haven’t actually 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Is this worth getting a PS4 for? 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I'm so fucking jelous of you guys who have a PS4 or whatever. I have a potato laptop and y'all are gonna get to play this amazing game. FML. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah, Im buying a secondhand PS4"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Beautiful. I can't wait.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"As amazing as I expected this game to be, this still blew me away!"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,OH MY GOD THEY'RE MAKING A SEQUEL?!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Now this is why I love video games. TLOU Part 1 is my favorite game of all time and this looks unbelievable
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Now I can die in peace
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The fight engine looks amazing. 
"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I can't help but wonder, with the recent talk of PS4 getting to the ""end of it's life cycle"", will they do like they did with TLOU and release for PS4 and have the plan on a release for the next console as well. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The first one deserved its universal 10/10 and this one looks even better!!

I'm wary of judging by trailers, but this is Naughty Dog, not Ubisoft.

Can't fucking wait!"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Wow..just wow.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I love how the blood remains on the floor during the fights. This attention to the details creates a really immersive experience.

They made an amazing work."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It looks absolutrly incredible! But gameplay-wise it looks exactly like first one. Maybe that's good.. or not.

Anyway, wow. Once again, insane job from Naughty Dog. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I may not have a PlayStation... But goddamn, I love TLoU's story. Cannot fuckin' WAIT!"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I wish this would be released on PC.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Is it worth getting a ps4 just for this game? 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Damn I thought that was glen and Maggie in the beginning. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Looks wild
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Aw, fuck. Now I gotta get a playstation. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"What does the guy say at the end?!
Looks absolutely amazing "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I might be the only one here but I just wanna watch a YouTube video of someone going through the story and I’ll be satisfied. Loved the first one
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This was amazing. Graphics and animation is on a whole other level than anything else out there.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,FUCK YEA!!!!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That was fucking epic
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,/u/mnk411 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,OMG this will be amazing once again 😁
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I was too busy drooling over the gameplay demo. Was there an announcement for a release date? 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,She's having a rough fucking day
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The music at the beginning is “Little Sadie” as covered by Crooked Still for those who wanted to know. The song is an old folk tune sung by many others at different times.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Did anyone else think this looked a lot like the Hunter town from the 1st game?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I was telling my brother I couldn't tell when the cuts ends began and what was game play, and that was some scary good stuff. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Guess I'm getting a PS4 now...
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"God please let there be multiplayer. I loved the story of the first game but the multiplayer was where it was at for me. Stealthing around, shooting people with a bow or sneaking up on them with a shiv.

 It was the game that made me love being stealthy in multiplayer games, I do it with every game that allows me to, but nothing has lived up to the feeling I'd get from Last of Us. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Watching this just puts other games to shame.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Just shut up and take my money
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You naughty sons of bitches. I'm gonna have to buy a ps4. What the fuck guys
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I wish this wasn't an exclusive 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This, Resident Evil 2, and Death Stranding were the highlights of Sony's weirdly structured conference. I cannot wait for The Last Of Us. The atmosphere, and those transitions from that happy memory to her stabbin' that dude in the neck chilled me to the bone."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Just happened to notice Ellie is wearing that girls bracelet when she's stabbing the guy in the neck.  But she wasn't wearing it when she was playing the guitar from the first trailer..?  I would have guessed that the reason she wanted to ""find and kill every last one of them"", was because they hunted and killed her.  But no bracelet in that scene, soooo...idk...o-O also what's with them calling Ellie 'wolf'?  I have so many questions and not enough answers!"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm just watching this thinking ""I can't believe this is not a cutscene"""
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,But where’s the clickers?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I wish I had a PS4
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm absolutely blown away by this:  

**[Just look at the facial expressions of the NPC's during combat in The Last Of Us 2.](https://youtu.be/cQRqT-PaTSQ?t=630)**

Watch the bald guy's face as he is fighting: The shift in facial expressions that show his exertion as he is swinging, as he takes damage, and when he is defeated.

Absolutely fucking incredible.

"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So damn realistic
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I was blown away by this one, I feel like they’re purposely not showing anything with Joel because just looking at him will probably give away a huge plot point. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,i like the 'frog tech' https://youtu.be/btmN-bWwv0A?t=240
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I wish they'd have shown actual gameplay and not a prescripted gameplay. I mean, i understand they wanted to show off a specific confined and controlled part of gameplay but like, have someone from the team actually playing it and not some preplanned exposé. 

It looked nice none the less but I want to see real gameplay first and a demo of the online."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Just take my money damnit.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"That gave me so many different erections that lasted lo.ger than 4 hours. I had my doubts ts that naughty dog could make a game better than the last of us, but this looks incredibly promising. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Fuck. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,!remind me 1 hour
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I love ellie but man am I gonna miss joel
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Those graphics look amazing omg 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"What I really like about this is how advanced the vegetation of the landscape has gotten over time. I thought she was in a regular old forest, until I saw the streetlight."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,PS killing it with these awesome single player games; time to get a PS4 to experience what I've been missing😎
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I have never fell in love with a GP trailer so much before
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,ahhhh so exited!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I sat and watched this game played through for 11 hours straight. It was a masterpiece and I couldn’t look away. 

I could probably do the same with this one if I don’t end up buying a ps4 again honestly. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Sony is doing a great job making me want to buy a PS4.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"FFS, I think its time to buy a ps4.... "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,My wet dream
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,2020 gonna be lit af 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Looks amazing. I'm hoping we get some fights that include both humans and zombies at the same time.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"All I was wanna say is when Ellie went under the car, I had flashbacks of MGS1. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Looks like they moved the shrub hiding from U4 and the dodging from the end boss of U4. I hope that mechanic plays like god of war, so great"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,When are they going to reveal The Last of Us 2 Battle Royale I wonder?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,how the fuck
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I don't even play console games anymore and I want this....and I don't own a Play Station.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,im thinking a ps4 pro is on the list 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"i hope this comes out no longer than 2019, i cant fucking wait"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I lost my shit when she got underneath the car. That was some amazing detail the way her hand was moving and never seen anything like that in a stealth game. Just wow 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Seriously need to play the last of us
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'll be honest.. I wasn't a huge fan of the first one partly because I hadn't used a controller in so long, but this looks incredible.  I might have to try again."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I would buy this on PC in a heartbeat...
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,My body is ready! 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The gameplay looks more impressive than the cinematic trailers for other games.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Are the zombies still a threat?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,MOTHERFUCKER I WAS THINKING ABOUT TLOU WHEN I CLICKED REDDIT! FUCK YEAH!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This reveal looks simply amazing, if its 80% true to the actual game it will be great. The only “problem” with Naughty Dog is that they raise the bar so high that all other games seem shit in comparison... "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"So these bad guys are some form of religious group? Judging by the poster seen in the background to the left at 4:05 and the man talking about sin when gutting the hanged guy. Also the use of wolf to describe Ellie, when they are meant to be the sheep. The last thing the ""Leader"" seems to say is ""For he...."".

Just wandered is anyone else had noticed or had any theories."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Well I for one cannot wait. This is going to be amazing
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Joel...
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,When is this being released then?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"If the undergrowth moves like this in the real game I will be very pleased.
"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I haven't beaten Last of Us yet. Will this trailer ruin anything for me?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,My erection can only be so hard. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Sold.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,AWESOME 😍
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This game looks sick...

...pun not intended."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Holy sweet Jesus this looks amazing.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This game was just absolutely stunning. I might buy a PS4 to play this. (And Spiderman)
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Welp
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Oh fuck yes
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,holy fuck this game looks good
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The hype is real. Been waiting for TLOU 2 on the edge of seat!!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Looks like a massive improvement over the already incredible TLOU. A proper sequel.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Please be 60fps please be 60fps...

If this and Ghost of Tsushima are 60fps on PS4 pro, then I'm going to buy one."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,this game is going to be great but these comments make me cringe.  graphics and detail don't make a good game.  I mean sure that cum shot at the end made the video but still
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Can't fucking wait. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,When does this game come out? Looks amazing 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"As someone who hasn’t owned a PlayStation since PS2 and hasn’t really kept up with console gaming for the past several years, this kind of reminds me of Metal Gear Solid (from a gameplay perspective).  Am I completely off base with this?  I used to love MGS but haven’t played a game like that in years cuz I haven’t had a PlayStation for the past two generations. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Some of those animations just look too good to be true but Naughty Dog have given me no reason to ever doubt they could do it. It is unbelievable what this team is capable of. From when she crawls under the car and scans the area around her and shooting the enemy through the cheek and the blood pouring from there. The way she bounces off the car as she’s charged into only to dispatch one enemy and eventually kill the other and smoothly picking up the machete. This gameplay is a work of technical marvel. Naughty Dog are going to provide us with a real game changer, that is something I will confidently say until the game is released. 

Also, appreciate the off comment about Joel in the beginning. Ellie is going to reach some dark places in this game. Such a believable step in the narrative. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Traaash
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Your mom walks in during the makeout scene, guaranteed"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Everything about this trailer was sexy.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"My breakdown after watching a few times. It’s long, but I hope worth the read:

Alright. So. First scene takes place before all this gameplay obviously. They live somewhere with power, music, where they put on balls/parties. Neat. Things have advanced well since the first one. Joel is mentioned in passing, Ellie seems weary of him. Ellie along with others is set to be going on a run, this always makes Joel uptight because he takes on more responsibility with preparing the groups. Cool. 
Ellie and the girl dance, kiss, all cool. 

Now, as it transitions from the kiss to this.... hunt she is on, we see her stabbing this guy in the throat. NOTICE, she is now wearing the bracelet that was being worn by the girl she was kissing. I’m imagining something happened to her. (Probably on the run they mentioned preparing for or why would the story be picking up right there? That run will be important. Things will happen.) So we will have to see how she came to be in possession of it. 

Unless Seattle, which is a confirmed game location, is where they’ve settled as a group since the first one, she has traveled here for something since the first scene. Now remember, the clip we got of the woman being dragged and hung up in a tree by a group of people played out almost EXACTLY the way the scene did here. They’ve got a guy hung by his neck, standing on a bucket, and they shove him off and cut him open. A lot of people, myself included, have been thinking that clip was of Ellie’s mother before Ellie was born, and we’d be going between two timelines. But if that is the case, the group doing this.... hanging and gutting have been doing that same things for a LONG time. Right? Like... 18 years at least. So now I’m not so sure about the timeline of that first scene we got. 

Backpedaling for a second, as Ellie leaves was coming up on that clearing, there is a brick wall with graffiti of a woman with text reading “May she guide you.” 

They refer to Ellie as a ‘wolf’, and they’re still tossing around things like ‘wretch’ which were used in the clip we got months back. So this is the same group, some religious seeming nutjobs. But I can’t yet figure out how they will get on Ellie’s radar unless this is a group that had something to do with her mother. And it’s some long overdue revenge. 

Thoughts? Thanks for reading, guys. Can’t wait to get our hands on it. "

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,SUPER EXCITED Oh my god this is the best game ever
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Rip Xbox 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"She is a legit badass. 

If they end up making the movie, it better be at least as good as this gameplay. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I loved the animations and all the new possibilities but I don’t understand how this would be possible in gameplay. Like I would never be able to take arrows out of someone for ammo, how would I learn to and how would I know when I could ?"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"When I was young, such gameplay could only be dreamt of. MAN THAT LOOKS AWESOME"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Oh my God, seriously amazing. I fell in love with the first one, again with remastered, now.... I'm smitten all over again. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I fucking loved one. This looks amazing. I don't even have a PS4 but I'm buying one just for this game. Seriously would pay 500 dollars to play this game 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Loved it... countdown to all the idiots talking about it's over the top unnecessary violence. They did the same thing after the first teaser. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Leave to Naughty Dog to have so much detail in not just the visuals, but the gameplay mechanics.  The fluidity of Ellie jumping a gap, running, grabbing a bottle (while running), then throwing at a target (still running), and finally grappling the target.  Also, she actually physically pulled an arrow out of a dude to add to her bag.  The arrow didn't just magically vanish."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Reminds me a lot of the notorious Killzone trailer. A bit too smooth. Hopefully I'm wrong.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I’ll believe it when I see it. Anybody remember what a vertical slice is?! I’m not falling for this bullshit again. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,People seem to have forgotten that the AI displayed in E3 demos for the first game was nowhere near representative of the state of things in the final game.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Everybody are talking about the gameplay which does look phenomenal, if the whole thing has not been scripted. Others talk about Ellie being a lesbian, which to me is like \- duh. But nobody talks about the dude in the beginning that just saw his, supposedly, good friend making out with his ex\-girlfriend after the good friend had assured him that everything is going to be fine in a week. If that was only a tease from the ex\-girlfriend and she has no intention to pursue anything with Ellie \- well, this sucks as well for Ellie. That being said if they do hook up \- poor guy. But we do not care about those anymore right? "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This game is the master of dadification, if I ever have a daughter I could only hope she came to be anything like Ellie"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That's one durable chick....
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Give it to us on pc please!!!!!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Hey where is Joel? Is he meant to be dead or something?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Man I wish I could get into these games. They just don’t really hold my attention :(
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I'm gonna have to be the skeptic and say that was particularly scripted gameplay
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"How is this possibly actual gameplay footage? The amount of little cinematic moments that happen in the middle of combat seem unrealistic, but goddamn is this amazing if it's really in-game footage."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,YEEES YES YES
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Why can't I play this series on the PC
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Holy crap I want this... love the story of the last one now I’m interested in this one 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This is everything I hoped it was going to be. I’m so damn excited!
"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I really hope that when it comes to actual gameplay, and by that I mean real people playing the game, not a ""this is gameplay footage"" video, that it is as smooth and as fluid as this. It looks very much like a cut scene, which is tremendous if this is what we'll have throughout the game. I'm just concerned that a lot of the animations and movements are staged for this video. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What that last guy (the one with a hammer) said to ther before she kills him?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This is gonna be going head to head with God of War for my game of the year.... Difficult choice. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Anyone notice that at the start of the gameplay a man is being hung and stabbed. It’s the EXACT SAME scene as the second trailer where we meet those three characters. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This is horrible lol, first time i'd say i don't want to kill anyone in a videgame, at least if i can avoid it at all cost... "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I don't have any problem with Ellie being gay, but the opening scene of her making out seemed forced and awkward. I mean, even if it was a straight couple I'd feel the same way. Interestingly, I've never seen a straight couple presented in a trailer this way. It's obvious what they were trying to project, but I wish they would allow the player to experience her relationships naturally. Unnecessarily forced, especially for a premier trailer. Everything else looked fantastic though. "

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It looks good but whole gameplay was completly scripted . No way we will see that smoothess in final version.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"So, the part that ellie is lesbian was drop down at this e3 or It was know a long time ago?"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Scripted like twitch said haha
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Preordered

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Trying to cash in on the LGBT craze? kinda stupid IMO but the game itself looks amazing.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Fuckkkk I just sold my PS4. Can we get this on PC pls?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The Les of Us

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,And then I came.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The first game was about fighting zombies.

Now we're fighting the patriarchy."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So what new gameplay mechanics were added? Or was it just pretty graphics 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Comment just so there are 667 instead of 666
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,not feel it but that ninja game look cool a ninja witcher also death stranding fuck me hard 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[removed]
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Welp, a 60 bucks well saved here...dodging this turd."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Wait is Ellie as lesbian? I think Naughty Dog needs to make this more obvious because it matters so much.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I feel like she had plenty of it already, he just taught some more stuff. She was pretty brutal there at the end of the DLC"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Ellie has always had more of a violent temper than Joel. Now she's larger and more experienced so she can back that up.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,And I'm so glad she did
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I really liked how interactive with the environment you are. Like when she dodged next to the car she crashed into it and pushed off. Also when she got grappled next to the counter and the guy threw her over the top. Details like that are what really help with immersion in my opinion. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,She shot that chick in the face and there is a god damn bullet hole in her cheek leaking blood. Holy shit.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Seriously loved how she grabbed the bottle and threw it in one smooth motion. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I really hope to god this isnt a bait and switch because my jaw was on the floor the whole time in particular watching the the AI patrol they moved so fluid and realistically that had to be done with macap or something. The whole thing FELT more real than any in game footage ive seen before.

Imagine this level of gameplay and detail in VR....."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It was the realistic movement animations which really shocked me in the first one. So I can’t wait to see them in action in this one . 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Wrenching out that arrow!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"At the risk of sounding like a creep, that kissing animation was one of the most realistic kisses I've seen on a videogame. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I love how she picked up the arrow and added it to the quiver.  And you can see exactly how many arrows she has. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"nice catch!  you know in dark souls the ""ring of the evil eye"" gives you health upon killing enemies.  something to be said i suppose..

i'm hoping she gives Ellie the bracelet before she goes out the next day.  these things never end well :("
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Right? :D

Crooked Still has been a favorite for me for a long time. Was super excited to hear them in the trailer! "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I am going to use the *fuck* out of those arrows, dude. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What about Joel?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Are we sure it's not fake? In some cases it looked TOO fluid...

Biggest red herring for me is her pulling the arrow out of her shoulder when she was in cover. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"At first I was like, ""who the fuck is Glenn??"" Then I remembered. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,He was obviously hiding under the dumpster again.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Did I miss something? Are naughty dog and TWD doing a collab here? 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[When I saw that hand to hand combat](https://i.imgur.com/5KHejsm.png)
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"If it was any other developer, I would think it’s all scripted bullshit but...it’s Naughty Dog. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Lol, watching this made me think of Tomb Raider in so many ways. This looks like a more refined version of it's combat, but I'm still plenty excited for the next Tomb Raider."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"As a longtime fan of the Tomb Raider franchise, it’s a little bittersweet for sure. But I’m really happy for ND and I can’t wait to play TLoU pt.2."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I was thinking the exact same thing. I was considering buying Shadow, but I like naughty dog, and square enix managed to fuck up both hitman and deus ex. Maybe I'll snag it at a redbox. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Guerrila Games also raised an eyebrow or two when the red haired girl hid in the tall grass to avoid being spotted by cult members. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"the graphics were so fucking amazing and the gameplay was so fluid

The AI reacting to your moves, the different cover, the multiple paths.

And that hand to hand combat is outstanding. 

It's easy to see why Naughty Dog says this game is based on ""Hate"" whereas the last one was based on ""love"""
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It was wasn’t it!?
The one thing that pissed me off, during the live chat a bunch basement dwelling cyber warriors (fat losers) were pissed about the lesbian part.
So pathetic, put a bad taste in my mouth."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm preeeeety sure the AI doesn't behave that way when she loses then in the grass and hides under the truck. You know, complex and clearly scripted conversations involving custom animations and NPCs instructing other NPCs on tactics and strategy. That part seemed BS to me.

Still, I'd be perfectly happy to be wrong. REAL happy."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I want to believe but if you compared the last of us reveal to the final game it didnt run exactly like that. I really want to believe the final game will be close to what we saw today because I looked amazing.

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I imagine they're in a building somewhere, waiting for some dumbass to walk in. Noms. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"They were in the second trailer (this is the third), so they're around."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I want some FUCKED UP new infected
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I would be happy, lore-wise, if their numbers are falling by this point in the timeline. They can't reproduce, they don't seem to be great at taking care of themselves, there are fewer and fewer humans to infect and the ones who are left are obviously a lot smarter and more savvy than they once were. It seems like natural attrition (starvation, injury, disease, age and obviously human aggression) would have thinned their numbers considerably. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"In the beginning, the guy says something like ""Your old man really laid into me"" or something like that. I really hope that's Joel, but then the gameplay part seems like a skip forward in time so who knows what happens from there. I'm so fucking pumped!"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Is that who the Asian dude was referring to when he said “your old man really laid into me today”? 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ya playing as Ellie could be cool, but I still want Joel present. One of best parts was the interactions between them. 
"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"He’s probably almost 60 at this point. Ellie 14 in first game, he was 45. She’s probably early 20s. 25? So he’s 50 - 55, having lived an incredibly brutal and damag8ng lifestyle for decades in a world with limited healthcare. I’d be surprised he’s still fighting unless he really has to, which, of course, he will have to. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Buy it. Get Last of Us 1. Get God of War. Get Horizon Zero Dawn. Get Uncharted. Get Infamous Second Son. Get Spider-Man when that comes out.

You’re missing out on so much and you won’t regret it once you buy it. 

EDIT: Forgot Bloodborne. Souls games aren’t my cup of tea, sorry for leaving it out

EDIT 2: Also forgot Detroit: Become Human. Sorry

EDIT 3: Agh, I forgot Shadow of the Colossus too. I’d say sorry again but I’m probably gonna edit this about 15 more times anyways

EDIT 4: Not actually adding anything, but clarifying something about this list. 

These are all PS4 Exclusives. They’re what makes the system worth buying over an Xbox or PC. Games that are available on multiple systems (I.e. Witcher 3) aren’t being included. That doesn’t mean that they’re bad, it’s just that they could be purchased on more than one system. No one buys Nintendo consoles for the games that you could get elsewhere. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Idk why you haven't yet
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I did a month ago. Wouldn't even think twice about recommending to anyone. Its 100% worth it.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I was always an XBOX guy but got really into retro gaming over the last couple years. 

I finally got a PS2 about a year ago and then a PS3 6 months ago and have played all of the previous generation titles I never got a chance too.  I’m currently price checking PS4’s and trying to justify having two current gen consoles."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"That DLC was perfect, just the right length, gave us some new stuff to do and was an emotional gut punch. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Honestly Left Behind was GOTY worthy in its own right. Everyone should play it. 

But based on how relationships go in TLOU universe, I'm worrying about that other girl"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It doesn't even matter, either. Like, she's gay, so what. Cool. Back to the AWESOME GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm not surprised by that so much as Ellie saying to CoolAsianGuyTM that he'll be back with her in a week, then openly kisses her..."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I wonder how her sexuality is going to impact the story, if at all."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Pft people were still denying it. 

""It was a kiss between friends"" was a common theme in threads about the DLC.

As if its somehow unfathomable that a woman can be a lesbian. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Hopefully the romance has substantial relevance to the main game like MGS3 or Uncharted and not some tacked on uninteresting subplot just to eat up more cutscene time.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Eh.  It makes sense considering the dlc for sure but I can see why some people are still surprised. I mean, if every girl who ever kissed another girl in their preteen years was a lesbian the world would be a very different place I'd wager. Experimentation with sexuality seems to be a part of being teenager for many people and it's hardly a sure thing at that age. That said, Ellie is a strong character regardless of her orientation and she's a badass now. Normally, I'd be skeptical that they were shoehorning in the romance in most cases, but Naughty Dog does characters right. I'm sure all their inclusions add relevant depth to the story and the characters."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Or listened to her... Like at all.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I just loved the callback from the ending from the DLC to the ending of the main story.

Being all poetic and shit."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I didn't even realize it was the game until they showed Ellie...
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I don't think it was worth the awkward ten minute intermission.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The only reason I played it was because my PlayStation 4 came with it as a bundle. I’m so glad I did because that game is perfect.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Stop whatever you are doing and go play it. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"omg, i actually got a ps3 a few months ago (hadn't played a playstation since the original at my next door neighbour's house - we used to play a lot of twisted metal 2). 

I used to have an original xbox and played a lot of halo/halo 2. Anyways, i decided to get an old ps3  few months back and ended up guying the Last of us for $5. I had no idea what it was about, but just heard that it had good reviews. I actually just beat the game about 3 weeks ago and it was absolutely outstanding. Quite honestly the best game I've ever played.  I fucking love ellie. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I played it about 6 months ago and was fucking shocked. It's the greatest game ever made.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I've put off playing through my fourth time for too long 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That running bottle grab and throw. Wow.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"ND might've created a new 'class' of scripted gameplay tbh.

Assuming the trailer isn't being misleading, there are a LOT of things going on VERY quickly. A ton of bandwidth and no discernable hitching/chaining in the animation, amazing stuff. I've also never seen that many concurrent scripts/AI entities look so fast and simultaneously smooth. Not without extreme corridor constraints to lighten the load. Incredible work."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"First game was the same way. Blew people away the graphics it had on PS3, me included. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It's really crazy to think  TLOU1 was ps3.

5 years ago almost to the day."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Just curious, why were you pissed? I didn't watch it"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,People have short memories. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah, ND are masters at this sort of semi-scripted sequence. I love it! Like being in a movie. Same in the uncharted games."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah I don't get the confusion. The trailer is impressive as hell and the dynamic bits like that one archer dying, dropping four arrows and Ellie picking them up MIGHT be a bit scripted, but the general gameplay ""loop"" (if you can call that with TLoU) in the trailer was 100% the stuff you'll be doing. Heck, one of the upgrades you could get for Joel was a big crafting speed increase, simply because you might need to craft that shiv right fucking now. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Maybe a little scripted... But the first game had some amazing sequences.  If you played the first and knew what naughty dog is capable of this isn't much if any of an exaggeration 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Overall, you got a lot of camera control in the first game. I don't imagine they'll change that. Gotta be able to keep an eye out for the 7,000,000 assholes they throw at you in a situation. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,ITT: its a mixed bag
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Watch a stream with game only audio of the first one with her. My girlfriend cried 3 times while she watched me playing it.

The first two times I asked, ""should I turn it off/do you want to do something else."" She stuck it out, and the third time she cried, she asked ""there's no more?""

Truly the game pulls you in, and when its over, you are left wanting more."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It is an entire media hub that can replace everything so long as you have internet access. Sports, youtube, netflix, hbo, hulu, roku, amazon prime, spotify, plex, and USB playback. It also has a decent blu ray player that also plays 3D blu rays and DVDs. Doesn't play normal CDs which is a bummer.

All in all though it is pretty damn versatile machine."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I just bought mine and put up with her shit for a couple of days
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Considering Uncharted 4's cut-scenes were all entirely in-game, I'm going to assume the same for this game. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The cut scenes are game engine... o_O Of course not.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Seriously! The multiplayer was seriously the best multiplayer I’ve ever played. It just felt perfect to me. 

And I usually hate multiplayer. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The Multiplayer in TLOU was on par with SP for me. I had so much fun playing it with different weapons and gear. School is best map fight me one v one no molotovs.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,They mention him at the beginning but I’m bummed we don’t see him :(
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So do the NPCs.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"No. No. Ellie is gay. Randy Marsh is male.

*Edit fixed name from son to dad. Whoops*"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"True, but have you seen Uncharted 4? "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The faces yes, I'd say God of War might have a more ""stunning"" environment. However, LOU is designed to have a dreary look to go along with the story/soundtrack."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's sad that people who enjoy playing stories in the shoes of others would lack such simple understanding
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Which is funny because she was gay in the last game. So they must be too young to remember and are shitting on a game they’ve never seen 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Apparently you can’t just have a genuine lesbian character in a game without people acting like it’s a big deal, it’s their own damn fault for automatically assuming Ellie was straight. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,My guess is that the settlement she's with gets massacred. The last game involved tragedy.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Not a chance it's out this year
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"They never said it would, and it won't. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Multiplayer in the first game was wildly underrated.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Naughty Dog is what the industry should be like!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It was still rendered in game though right? So at least visually that was true to what we can expect when the game comes out
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,TLOU came out 5 years ago and had smooth gameplay similar to this. I fully believe there will be plenty of combat gameplay with built in cinematic actions.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Has Naughty Dog ever not delivered the same experience they demonstrated at e3? Ever? Not once when I played Uncharted 4 did I think that the game was not following the quality of the gameplay reveals. The player interacts with the game the same way Naughty Dog demonstrates. Unfair statement to make there. I don’t think you know as much as you think you do. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Welcome to the dark side. Mwuahahhahah
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Its the same in movies and tv soaps.
Always off putting."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This entire generation has had incredible games that will stick with me for a looong time. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I mean, they are not wrong. ND is know to make highly scripted demos to sell the promise of a game. The difference is, they usually come insanely close to delivering on that promise."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"In fairness, it looks as though the overwhelming majority of comments are positive, and pretty much everyone who isn't a complete reptile is just talking about the game and Ellie being gay is just ""Oh, okay"".



Although it is true that virtually every single comment that's actually negative (since I don't think cautionary comments that the game might not look as good as this presentation graphically don't really count) doesn't have anything to do with the game and *are* about Ellie being gay.



Because shit people can't help but be shit."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It’s just a filter to figure out who’s played the DLC or not.

Scroll through the comments, you’ll see some users screaming SJW as if making Ellie lesbian is a new thing."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,20GayTeen has truly been kind.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,so fucking hyped. that's gonna be a good long weekend for ya. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Probably filmed separately and combined
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ever seen how the movie “Avatar” was filmed? Similar way.

Note: The blue People, not the last airbender"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Sort by controversial buddy. There's plenty of ignorant comments to be had. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The comment above yours literally reads ""EllieGBT"". 

But its nice to see how some people like you can still be so optimistic about people and how rational they are."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It's always a specifically crafted part of the game, or even an in-engine demo without actual gameplay. Neither of these show what the final version will be like.

That's why wait before you buy."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Why the downvotes?  I mean , I wasn't sure it was Ellie either until he said her name."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"For this kind of game, definitely. But there’s lots of genres out there. Nintendo and Rockstar are also unrivaled at what they do 

It’d be hilarious to see Naughty Dog compete with Zelda and Mario, just like it’d be hilarious to see Nintendo compete with TLoU and Uncharted"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"She's part of a family of identical nonuplets who have managed to keep each other alive throughout the apocalypse, only for their entire family to be wiped out by Ellie's rampage.


Sad, really."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,if you've played a naughty dog game before you know that it's going to look exactly and play exactly the same 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It’s because they are owned by Sony.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I haven't done it yet but this along with Horizon and the two newest Uncharted titles is why I will have to eventually get a PS4. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Apparently Jessie (Asian guy) might have a thing with that girl.

I’m calling now. That girl is a conflicting interest for both Ellie and Jessie."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,fuckin rights.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It’s amazing to own both a PC and a PS4pro. Can play modded Xcom, AC Origins at 4k 60 and all the big ass popcorn exclusives Sony releases."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Naughty Dog is known to push the Playstation to its limits. No doubt the Pro version will look fantastic in 4k.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,you've got to add the /s or people take you seriously
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Lol exactly. Right wing conservatives getting pissed at all the females in games are pathetic.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Sony funds the development of the games so in return they have to stay exclusive to ps4.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Sony contract with Naughtydog

So much potential of maxing out graphics... the game looks amazing."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yeah like when she was found hiding under the car the woman was shocked as soon as she saw her . Would be amazing if situations like that could play out differently
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,CDPR way ahead of Bethesda always online garbage
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's pretty good
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"dude, i just got a ps3 a few months ago. i had vaguely heard of the last of us and checked out some reviews and decided to buy it for like $5. i just beat it a few weeks ago. You need to play it. It's incredible. The best game I've ever played. I really felt like I was there. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,PLAY IT NOW!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It was like 6 years ago dude. How old do you think people on this sub are?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"> Is Ellie gay or bisexual

Druckmann said, years back, that he wrote Ellie as being gay. Things can obviously change, so take that as you will.

The immunity, however, isn't genetic immunity. She was infected with a strain that grew inside her but didn't take over her brain in the way the regular strain would. So now where she is bitten or inhales spores, the fungus can't grow over what is already there. It's why they needed to remove her brain to get a significant sample in the last game."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Two songs by Crooked Still. Little Sadie was first, then Ecstasy. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"While agreed, I doubt they'll show that aspect in preview. Story of first was held pretty close to chest with was important."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yes
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Hell, the re\-mastered version of last of us 1 is worth getting a ps4 for, let alone this beauty of a game."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Absolutely
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It’s likely...

The first game released about a year before the PS4 came out. I don’t see why not."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Probably not. When you add on other exclusives like Bloodborne, Horizon Zero Dawn and Persona 5 I’d say hell yeah. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Looking g at how advanced it looks, I'm imagining it's a ps5 game now. I can't fathom how they could make all that a.i run on a PS4 old mobile apu. Must be running on a dev kit for ps5 I gotta think."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,He is referenced by the boy
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the new trailer tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is Joel not in the trailer? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Joel to be in it and be GOTY. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought everyone loved Joel in the first game???? This is so fucked."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,yeah same. I loved the story but I found that actually playing it boring as hell. I just ended up watching a LP
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Since it probably won't launch in 2018, the choice will not be so hard"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Nah, not as forced as sex on a dead unicorn. Felt pretty natural to me. Close dancing leads to kissing more often than not."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This is one of the few times I've agreed that a comment got downvoted unfairly for disagreeing. Solid, respectful point. That said, upvote and fuck you TLOU is a masterpiece."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,They showed stuff like this leadong up to the original and it was pretty damn close to the actual gameplay.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Shown in The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC as part of her character.

Sounds like you haven't played the first game, I suggest you check it out."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I don't think it's a major plot point, just some nice juxtapositioning for a trailer of her having a normal life and being a god damned one woman army."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,would you think the same thing if a straight couple kissed in a game trailer?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Some people are gay.

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"What game has ever had a gay protagonist, though? Would you have preferred a straight, macho, white guy, or are you just complaining to be complaining?"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,And who fuckinga cares? There are barely any gay character anyways.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So is everything with straight white characters also inclusive to straight white people? Cause... There's A LOT of inclusiveness for that.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Gotta be inclusive? To me it seems like they’re just trying to have a unique storyline with deep character development. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"What does it take away from the story that the main character shared a kiss with a girl.  Does it make her any less bad ass? Does it make the story any less compelling? Do these questions make you uncomfortable?  Are you so obtuse to not understand that a strong character that may be gay takes nothing from you, but might give some kid that struggles with these issues a bit of solace and strength?  Seriously? Really?  Does this actually bother you?"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Just admit you wanted to fuck Ellie in your fantasies and now you’re disappointed.

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,She's was gay in the first game 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Craze? Even if that was true, they revealed her as gay in the DLC which came out FOUR years ago..."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,They already explained she was lesbo in the dlc.... the character is gay. Get over it.

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,HIDING UNDERNEATH VEHICLES! 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Being invincible. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,She’s a lesbian in the first game so they aren’t randomly gonna turn her straight to appease people like you
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What's the sjw agenda? To turn your kids lesbian? Kids shouldn't even be watching this. But I'm sure you'd let them see the guts flying out and extreme violence than two humans kissing. Right wing get outraged over the smallest things. Almost like snowflakes... How fragile.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Holy fuck your comment history is hilarious. Do you enjoy anything?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Oooo, edgy!"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It’s obvious if you played the DLC. Also she was kissing a girl that’s fairly obvious.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"""Oh, by the way, I'm a lesbian."""
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Jumping those guys and stabbing them over and over and over and over 

Way worse than a good old fashioned skull crush with pipe hit from Joel "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Joel’s just a bitter tired survivor. Worked his ass off to survive as a single father, abandoned families to protect his daughter, turned to banditry in order to survive, murdered an entire facility of good people to protect Ellie. I never felt rage behind these actions, even against Marlene, just dogged survival and guardianship. Ellie’s lookin’ vicious in comparison."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I hope they're able to deliver on the AI, too. In this trailer, we overhear one guy in the squad being called ""Ethan"" for a scripted conversation, and then later different guy shouts Ethan's name when he sees Ellie kill him.

The Original Last of Us also had an over-the-top awesome E3 trailer like this one, full of deep AI behavior and subtle animations, but they watered it down in the actual release."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"And think about all that being contextual, you may go through that entire area stealthily and never have any of it happen, but they still took countless hours making sure it all worked together. Naughty Dog is something else man."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The one that I noticed was when she pulled the arrow out of the dead guy. That there’s actually an animation for that now, compared to the wafting hand movement and the arrow simply disappearing in the last game... it’s so simple but it makes it all look so much slicker."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The way she squeezed through the shelves.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"That was in the original Last of Us even on PS3, you shoot someone in the forehead and you can see blood flow. Crazy how they managed that on such old technology."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"See: The Division

I absolutely want this game to be as amazing and as detailed as it looks here, but I'm trying to temper my expectations"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You could already do that in the first one kinda right? I guess it looks a bit smoother here tho.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Maybe they mocapped shitloads of animations and just use them in general patrol animations.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I reckon they already have walking animations down. It's stitching together the movements that's ridiculously impressive here. It looks amazing. It's like pre-rendered cutsxene quality. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"When the baddies are at the door covering angles and especially when axe man comes around a corner raising his axe just in case. WOW.  
I never felt so bad about a character killing an AI as the woman checked under the car and Ellie pops her. Damn, we finally here."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Completely unexpected, but incredibly welcome. :)"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Crafting specialty arrows and shit? Colour me HYPED
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,For the fucking bloaters
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"YOU GET A EXPLODING ARROW AND YOU GET A EXPLODING ARROW, EVERYONE GETS EXPLODING ARROWS!"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I mean, he showed up in the first teaser, which takes place AFTER whatever tragedy makes Ellie go all murdery, so it's safe to assume he's at least fine following the initial tragedy."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"He was mentioned. The guy says to Ellie ""your old man"""
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Hell if I know mate, I was also left waiting for his appearance. He was on the reveal trailer and was mentioned in this one tho, so at least we know hes alive."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Then eye remembered.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Been rewatching TWD, I didn't really like Glenn the first time through but episode to episode he's grown on me."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"No, it’s just a dumb “all Asian people look alike” joke. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"'I'm just gonna pick a random planet to land on...how about this one right here....cue Jurassic park music'
"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Definitely some scripted unrealistic stuff in here, just like their tlou 1 demo"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Square Enix has already made 2 Tomb Raider games and they were great. The third game is probably very similar to those so if you liked the first 2 you're probably gonna enjoy Shadow. Also Shadow is gonna release this year and Last of Us 2 is unlikely to this year so you can play both :)
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"And the hyper realistic face animations that the NPCs did. They actually reacted to being attacked.

Also, that cheek-shot when Ellie was hiding under that car, blood started dripping from the wound on that woman's face.

Naughty Dog has this magical quality where they can program 5 extra GPUs into a PlayStation."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,">  based on ""Hate""

i see it. some of those hits were vicious and bloodthirsty."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Can we highlight the hyper realistic wounds as well?! 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Remember that the AI seemed like that as well during the original e3 reveal for the first one. But it was really dumbed down in the full release. 

I hope they fix it this time around."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"> gameplay was so fluid

especially true for melee. one of my biggest gripes with the first game was the clumsiness of the melee combat but it looked really cool in this trailer."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That's facts. It's poor boy szn
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The animation when the woman who checked under the truck got shot in the cheek was slick af. I'm pretty sure we won't get to see it in-game, but hell if we will I'll fucking lose my mind. That animation seemd to be specially made for a character crouching down, and getting shot in a *specific* part of the head.

If there really are multiple headshot animations and different hitboxes in the head.. that's CRAZY. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I know I've played several games where the ai will call out commands to other NPCs, like flank him left, or search here, etc. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Just went back and watched it. It actually played very similar. The combat and moving mechanics are exactly the same. The big miss from TLOU was the enemies didn’t behave as intelligently as implied by the gameplay reveal.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm pretty sure it will, look at Uncharted 4, the epic chase scene was exactly the same (maybe even better) in the final game."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The only thing different from the reveal to TLOU was the AI wasnt as smart, but the gameplay was basically the same, the melee fighting like picking up wooden bar and beating the shit outa people was just as dynamic as they showed in the trailers"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I doubt it. TLoU1 went back and forth between human areas and infected areas. Only in the DLC was there crossover between the two enemy types. I’m sure this was just a human area. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Im guessing certain areas are more developed while some are just infected havens
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I hope they’re still pretty integral to this one. I loved the infected characters in LOU. It was so intense trying to evade and fight them.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"If you remember the first game though, you spend a substantial amount of time figbting other survivors. This could easily just be a sequence without infected. Although the idea that they may be dying of is interesting, and would honestly make sense. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Infected animals please
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I thought the gameplay part was a flashback? The chick is joking about Ellie being terrifying, and then Ellie thinks about she is, maybe, just a little bit, *actually* terrifying.

I also thought it was funny that Ellie thought a little bit of sweat was gross, but is more than familiar with having her hands full of literal gore."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Or Tommy?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I think so. I'm 80% sure that's who he's talking about, he could also be talking about Tommy but I doubt it. Still, I want to see Joel- I know this games main spotlight is on Ellie, and thats fine, but they can't just give us this grizzled bad ass we grew attached to for an entire game and then just make him disappear. I just hope he plays a bigger picture than what is being shown."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,He was in the other trailer. My guess is that they are separated and you play different segments as joel and as ellie. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Did I read somewhere it was 5 years later? Putting ellie at 19 I think.

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Gotta edit and include Until Dawn!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Don’t forget to squeeze in Bloodborne! 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,There’s this thing called money 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm basically just waiting for a Spider-Man bundle, I've been feeling guilty of buying a new console when I have huge backlog in other platforms, but one of the few things I like more than games are comics so Spider-Man outweighs it all."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Money doesn't grow on trees.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Apart from the final bit with the silly waves of enemies
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Considering the very first trailer/teaser (Ellie clearly wanting revenge), I'd say you're spot on."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I still have nightmares about those fight in the mall on grounded difficulty. Damn that was tough, but sooooo fun!"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Easy there with the GOTY. Left behind was like an interactive flashback in TLOU. It was very cool for what it was, but there was one meaningful fight in the entire thing."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I loved the DLC but calling it GOTY worthy is a little gas.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Considering Ellie is wearing her bracelet when she stabs that dude in the neck, I'd bet a thousand dollars she dies. Probably abruptly and brutally "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,People should worry less about Ellie's sexuality and more about how she has the kiss of death. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Look at the bracelet she’s wearing, then check Ellie’s wrist in the gameplay segment."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Not to mention the bracelet the girl is wearing in the dancing scene is the same bracelet Ellie is wearing when she’s destroying everyone. 

Unless they’re pulling a switcharoo and the fighting happens *before* the dancing. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Lol GOTY worthy, i know people love to praise TLOU and rightly so, its an amazing piece of storytelling but that statement is just riduculous, its a 2 hour expansion. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Lmao no one else has mentioned this but that was what I was shocked by
Like damn
Ms steal yo girl I guess"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I thought of this after watching the trailer. The Asian guy doesn't seem to understand why Ellie's ""old man"" (Joel I hope/assume, maybe Tommy assuming they're in Colorado) is so protective. Maybe nobody knows of Ellie's immunity. 

The play here is by her being a lesbian she wouldn't ever pass the possibly genetic immunity to children. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,There are literally hundreds of games and movies where the main point of the protagonist is to save and or get revenge for killing wife/significant other. I highly doubt it's just about showing her being gay.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"“A kiss between friends” is what I told myself before I realized that no, I’m just a fucking lesbian dating another girl."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Why is this getting so many dislikes? Completely agree—the romance should serve a point, like any romance should in a video game. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I have faith in Naughty Dog not adding it frivolously.

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Definitely this. I am a ps4 diehard, and did the Playstation Experience bit at a theater.

Everyone was really annoyed at the intermission, especially the dude saying 'just a few minutes now!', 'just a few seconds now!'.

Also, flute guy.

But **besides** that, it was A++"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Seriously, nothing could be more important."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yeah nothing beats your first play through of TLOU. I wish I could forget it and play it again and have my mind blown again. Can't wait for the second one and I so hope Joel isn't died. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I remember the first one coming out. It was hailed as a masterpiece across the board by early release reviews. I rented it because I wanted to see if the hype was real. It was.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I used to ask the people on my friends list their top 3 games of all time. It's amazing how few left LOU out.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Naughty Dog is a bunch of fucking wizards, man."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's the modern Half Life. Games that make you rethink what's even possible in a video game.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm not the guy but my guess is because it was kinda meh. The new ip's were toss ups. Everything cool has been shown before. We were just shown a little more, and lastly. Why the hell wouldn't they at least tell us the state of FF VII remake. They know that's what people want to know about. But it's going to be used as bait for years to come. At least and official statement on the development would be nice. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That multi-player was beautiful. The snow lodge and school were some of my favs

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Lou animations are just better tho. That's why I think their better at least
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm painting with a wide brush here, but it would typically be ""playing stories in the shoes of others *as long as they look like me*""."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yet people had a hard on during the lesbian scene in God of War trilogy even though they weren't originally so. Makes total sense. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Oh my god I played Factions with my buddy literally every day for years. I hope it makes a comeback with crafting and what not. It felt so damn visceral!

Might sound crazy but it's one of the only multiplayers that I really felt like I was part of the game world while I was playing, like actually immersed!"

It gets fuckin tiring being gay and a gamer, seeing people screeching that nonsense every fucking time a character relates to you."

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I was being sarcastic.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Although, if you think about it, she almost has to be worse. Joel could fuck a person up with one massive hit, and that's just not something Ellie has the size for. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,nothing beats the braindead nature of the stealth ai in far cry games. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"In the new Tomb Raider gameplay, there was a part where two guards are chatting, she distracts one of them and kills the other, then the last guard turns back to the guy he was talking to and just goes ""a body!"" Made me sad :( Too hard to just call him Geoff and have his friend be sad when he dies instead kf just being 'alerted'?"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and say that just like the first game's insane reveal trailer, this doesn't represent typical gameplay."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"“Watered down” as in, actually made it a system instead of a semi playable scripted trailer, like this one.

Naughty Dog games are amazing, but they absolutely create a perfect play through of a section to show off their game, and it never quite actually works that way in real gameplay.

Still extremely impressive. But that’s def the reality. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The thing about good AI is that it's based on cinematic-like direction.  
Naughty Dog is very very specific about having film-like planners for the environments.  
It's not ""generic mashed together forest environment"", but rather each area has a specific, almost choreographed environment where if you run along the path, their AI tends to work around it very very well.  
Grass is placed in a way that it can be used to flank someone. Cars are placed in a way that you can hop over one and quickly slide under the next.  
Working around this environment, they can probably build ""environment macros"" that are specific scenery types that work better with their AI than others, but if you do weird things, the AI starts to fall apart.  
I think some companies are trying to build ""real"" enemy AI, but the problem is, a computer whose goal is to try to shoot you, can only get better by being more accurate and deadly, which makes it non realistic. Real AI should be about knowing how to pursuit, but also being human enough to make mistakes.  
GTA V is probably the best example of poorly made AI. And Fallout 4.  
Hard is literally just ""they can shoot you from really really far away with very powerful guns"".  "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Thats because this was scripted gameplay. It's an advertisement, that's it."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"True, but even if we only get half of what we see here in the trailer..it'll still be an auto-buy for me.

Curious that we didn't get to see Joel tho. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I kinda disagree mate, [check here](https://youtu.be/kbLOokeC3VU). Last struggle for the shotgun seems scripted, the rest was all as delivered, maybe the delivered version was better. And I finished The Last Of Us like 6 months ago."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Are you saying the original Last of Us game wasn’t over the top awesome?!. I get what you’re saying, but that game was nothing less than a masterpiece."

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Before she did it I was totally thinking ""movement has been great so far, I wonder if she can squeeze through there."" Then she did. I hope the final product is even close to what was shown."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,PS3 actually had really advanced hardware (at least on the CPU side) for the time.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yeah you could. Auto-aim throw bottle > run in for a free execution. Bottles and Bricks best weapons in the game lol. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"You can but something about how she was running by, grabbed it without stopping then SMASH. Hell, even when she grabbed that arrow out of the one guy while trying to hide. It took a struggle to get it out. 

It's the little details that make it awesome. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Odds are its not a bait and switch. The first one had incredibly impressive ai and voice cohesion in its trailer and didnt disappoint in the finished product, and theres no reason to doubt a sequel that naughty dog has spent years carefully crafting"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Fuck yeah! Head shots with those bitches are gonna be insane, and they'll be useful as fuck when dealing with bloaters. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Well you're sure as fuck not going to want to melee those monstrosities. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"A girl she has a relationship gets killed, perhaps the one she's dancing with in this?"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Assuming that's actually him and not a vision. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I just hope they keep the dynamic going somehow. A massive part of what made TLoU so good was their relationship. It'd be a shame to see him sidelined massively in favor of new characters that tag along.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I'm thinking the game has flashbacks to whatever time this dance was and Joel will be alive then. It'll follow Ellie up until Joel is killed and that'll explain the present of why she's killing people.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I was hoping the trailer would close out with Joel's appearance. He's one of my favorite video game characters , so I hope he gets a decent part in this. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I could not have thought of a cornea joke
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Fuck you.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I watched the first few seasons. Stopped watching around the time they killed Shane. Not because I liked him, he was a prick, I just lost interest. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"That's what I was thinking too, but then I remember thinking the same about Uncharted 4, and that one ended up being pretty close to the e3 demo promises if I remember. 

Could be wrong though, been a while. Either way, I'm looking forward to it."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Besides the shotgun grappling near the end of TLoU1 demo, pretty much everything in that demo could be replicated though. Under the right circumstances, enemies do beg for their life like the end of the demo. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The shotgun at the end was scripted but what about the rest? Enemies begging for life? Ellie giving you a moment to attack by launching a brick? That all happens in gameplay.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I think some parts were scripted. For example the part where she shoots the girl in the cheek, If that was not scripted it's simply mindblowing."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's also amazing how the surroundings are integrated into the fights. Like when Ellie got thrown through the glass in the abandoned store! That trailer WAS fucking incredible to watch.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"> Naughty Dog has this magical quality where they can program 5 extra GPUs into a PlayStation.

I was listening to a cool podcast a while ago about the history of naughty dog, and when they first made crash they put so much more into the game then the playstations memory was capable of handling. They had the console always spinning up the disc for the next chunk of data and sony was worried that would drastically reduce the lifespan of the console to mere weeks.

 Luckily the part was super under rated in terms of durability and worked out fine but it was a really clever bit of programming from naughty dog to make much larger levels and have more polygons on the same hardware."

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Am reading thread as i watched the trailer. yeah, i totally agree. that was absolutely ruthless."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I hope they keep the arrow being stuck in you mechanic. It'd be awesome that if struck with an arrow, ellie has that animation to pull it out when you find an opportunity to stop moving. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,PS3 being old as fuck was a huge reason for that. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It has to be scripted though, it was to perfect not to be."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Dollars to donuts they can just RNG specific hit location and it will be fine. 

Create hitboxes for different areas (e.g. head, upper left torso, etc.), and roll for a specific hit location and play through maybe 3-5 corresponding animations based on the RNG.

99/100 times, it'll be plausible. 1/100 times, you had gun to cheek and it somehow plays an animation for a high center forehead shot. Welp, you're playing a videogame. "

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The animations are way slicker than they are in the final game, which is something that happens in pretty much all naughty dog e3 demos. Joel never picks up a revolver so fluidly and he never drops the shells into his hand like in the trailer and etc"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"That's because that chase scene was mostly on rails, the player can choose close to nothing in that sequence."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Luring Infected to the group of humans in Left Behind was fun. I hope they have larger areas where that is possible
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm sure they will always be a main part of the gameplay. I just mean that they seem to not really be a focus of the story this time. Since TLOU is such a narrative-driven game, that would be a great way to shift up the mood for the new game."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I know in that one trailer, where it's raining heavily, you can hear them coming towards the end. Makes me glad this is just a game, cause that's one of the scariest moments, ever. I like the focus of this new trailer. It felt just as gritty and chilling, as anything else involving the infected."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I think they just want to still have cards to play as more trailers and teasers come out 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Joel hadn't aged in the first trailer and showed up after all the fighting without a scratch on him, which lead most people to think he's dead and Ellie is just thinking of him and what he'd say to her."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Nioh and nier are on PC as well. Not PS4 exclusive

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yup. the moment they stepped into the dance floor, the chick must probably be a goner so the game could set up Ellie on her roaring rampage of revenge."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Plus they did the typical good memory flashback to awful current situation cut you see in lots of movies. That's usually a telltale sign of remembering a dead person.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,How could you tell the chronological order of the trailers? It sounds logical but maybe it's Joel that dies. I'll be royally pissed off if he does.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Also, it was only 2 hours long.

I'm still mad we never got an Ish and the tunnels DLC."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That's an interesting narrative take on it. I wonder if they would try to put a moral spin on it but I personally doubt they would.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Quick correction, Ellie is not genetically immune, she is just infected by a strain of the fungus that doesn't progress past the first stage of infection.

Not enjoyably."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I think the girlfriend knows her immunity. I think that's part of the ""they're jealous of you"" line. She didn't strike me as an arrogant person who'd say ""yeah all those guys are jealous of you, because you have me and I'm so sexy and awesome"" and it didn't come across as a self-deprecating joke. Maybe that implies that more people know of Ellie's immunity and that's where the jealousy stems from.

Or she just means ""They're jelly, cuz you're a super skilled killer."", but that'd be just weird to say. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I like to imagine that ""I kissed a girl and I liked it"" played on a loop in your head till you acknowledged that you kissed a girl and you liked it.

The Last of Us was probably one of the best story games I've ever played. I haven't even got around to God of War yet, but that's next on my list. I never really pre\-order games but I'm 100&#37; going to pre\-order The Last of Us Part 2.

As for affordability, I bought my PS4 second hand on Ebay for £150 and I have had no problems with it. It came with a fully working controller and  all the cables, and CoD Infinite Warfare came included (I'm probably not gonna play it ever but oh well). I'm sure you could find one for at least the same price, maybe less. I'd try to avoid getting a PS3 as the games tend not to run as well or look as nice as the PS4, and future games will not be released to PS3.

I still buy most games for my PC but PS4 has so many amazing exclusives that I had to buy a PS4 and haven't regretted it since."

Spiderman and mary jane, Nathan Drake and Elana, even romeo and juliet. ALL of these pieces of media portray someone in love with someone else, it isn't the complete cornerstone of the story. But it is a good chunk of it. So just because a character is gay doesn't mean it's trying to be inclusive, they are just portraying a realistic human being with thoughts and desires. "

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yup. You just very rarely run into those situations, because you're either not gonna fuck with most of the enemies, if you can avoid them, or you turn the game on Easy Mode and just turn it into a fun shooting gallery :D"

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Just how accurately they model where shots land is impressive. How each shot lands with purpose in a precise location and is then represented precisely on the body. Every shot and every swing of the sword had weight to it and resulted in a wound that actually effected the movement of the NPC. This is exactly what I’ve been waiting for in a combat system and a lot of people might think they just painstakingly put that together. But it really looks like they just opened up the door for how we look at combat in a video game. If they actually pull off the final game with what we saw today, they’re going to change the industry."

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Imagine how hard it must be to find other gays after the apocalypse. It's not like you can go down to the local lesbian bar to hit on women who won't look at you weird for doing so.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I might just die if Joel gets killed off.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I don't know, I really like the discovery of what happened in the tunnels. I feel like a full showing would be too much. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So why could she walk through the spore sections with no mask on?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Couldn’t she just go around biting everyone so they don’t become infected with the original fungus?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Where was this said? It wasn't in the game, and she's the only person to have been infected with that strain? Without a cannon source, I'll stick with immunity"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"No, Ellie actually has (or had, if they're changing things) an immunity. Her body caused the virus to mutate.

I find Ellie kissing someone important, as it was suggested that she could still pass on the virus by biting others."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Wait so if she got bitten again would she be zombified or still no?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Don't forget that in the first trailer with the guitar we see that she's been bit again but around the collarbone area if memory serves me right
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The ollllllllllllllllllll' turkey baster trick.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That'd be really dark.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yeah flute guy should be a staple of every e3 press conference. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The only thing that comes close is the new a God of War. Same level of quality way beyond everything else, incredible story telling and characters that jump out of the medium"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The Avengers project also had no news. I was hoping to at least hear about FF7 or Avengers, but nope. Nothing."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Since ps2 at least. I remember when rumors were going around that ""Mr.T was being scouted to voice Barrett"" 

I knew we wouldn't get anything really new. But a small clip we haven't seen with an official PR bull statement on why it was moved in house would have been nice. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Tetsuya Nomura is directing the FFVII remake.  It will come out 10 years from now.

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Still is and will probably always be my favorite game. Unless I like 2 more. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Fuck, I think I'm gonna have to replay it. Again."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,or when there is absolutely no way they should know where you are yet still somehow start walking toward your general direction 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"""Looks recent""

A guard in the Tomb raider Gameplay showcase, checking on his dead buddy he was talking to 10 seconds ago."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I’ve been playing this fucking game for years and I didn’t know that there’s a difference between them. You just made my current grounded play through so much easier
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ok, I... I had no idea. That sounds kinda cheap though lol. So yeah. Brick best weapon. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What the fuck you can?  God dammit
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I suspect that was because trying to slave an NPC to the player's (moment-to-moment totally unpredictable) movements AND have that NPC's movements capable of breaking stealth for you is utterly unworkable from a game enjoyment perspective, especially in higher difficulties (remember, the game is basically one giant escort mission, haha). Is the same reason why I almost always avoided traveling with companions in Skyrim.

Imagine being on one of harder difficulties, where you've had to really conserve resources to survive, successfully stealthing your way through almost an entire particularly difficult section, only to have Ellie go in a random direction other than the one you want because the AI pathing says to, thus breaking your cover and forcing you to either waste those precious resources or start the area all over again.

It's one thing if the player stuffs up and breaks their stealth (then you're just mad at yourself), but an NPC doing it is just infuriating. Again, looking at you Skyrim - carefully avoid a trap, then NPC follower just walks straight through and triggers it, ruining your attempt at stealth and bringing everyone running (on that note, no idiot companion, sniping with bow and arrow from stealth does NOT mean it's time to charge into melee if they're only wounded and get in the way of my follow-up killing shot! -_- )

Yes, it can lead to some silly moments breaking immersion with Ellie in plain sight of totally oblivious enemies, but it's that and be an otherwise fantastic game, or marginally more realistic, but far far more infuriating, if not almost game-breaking in parts."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"they were useless even outside of ellie being there, they just walked on the same paths and checked the same corners waiting to be taken down no questions asked"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"And those bandits seem to be the same weird cult we saw in the Paris games trailer a few months back, so they clearly have some larger role to play..."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yep, these games are emotional torture-porn. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I just know not to get too invested lol. If the protagonist loves you, you're fucked."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Haha..yea...I immediately thought ""oh that's ghost joel"" when I first saw it."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's completely possible that that part of the trailer was a flashback.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Or she legally owns an old manservant of sorts. Kinda like Alfred. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"> We can assume Joel ~~is~~ was alive and well

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,*Por que no los dos?*
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I think it's gonna be both. I'm getting the feeling it'll be a ""lone survivor"" type situation for Ellie."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I’m sure it was scripted in the sense that they programmed the level to show off the best animations/gameplay elements but I bet pretty much all of that is doable in game, it just won’t look that fluid unless you’re really good at it aha. 

Also I doubt there will be a graphics downgrade, ND are wicked good at getting the most out of the system. 

But maybe this is just hope and hype speaking, we’ll see!"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The fights in Uncharted 4 are amazing, and they look scripted even when you are playing it on the fly, so... I think it will be alright :)"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Even if it's scripted it's still pretty amazing because it doesn't look like she was forced to end up under the truck in the first place.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I played it years ago, so I don’t remember enough details like that, but I honestly don’t doubt it. I remember it being very well made, like this one looks."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm jealous of people who've never played it because it's such an amazing story. It was one of the rare games where it wasn't old on the second or even third playthrough, but the first run's story was so special. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I almost never cry during movies and never from playing video games. Still don't know what black magic they used to get me bawling my eyes out only ten minutes into the first Last of Us.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Most brutal game opening ever imho.

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,No space for another strain to grow. The initial infection is still all over her brain.
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah that different strain thing sounds like bullshit. Literally the first time I've ever seen or heard anyone say it. Without a canon source, or the developers outright saying it, I'll continue to believe that Ellie is simply immune."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yeah lol
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Guess I underestimated, thanks for correcting"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I mean, might as well have. Big white dude macking on some girl at a dance would've gotten no complaints from you."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Then what was your point?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Honestly this kills me in stealth games. I got Styx shards of darkness in the humble bundle last month and had this happen. One guy found someone pretty far away from me, yelled, then the guy that was near me looked right in the barrel I jumped into. I stopped playing after that."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Agreed.  That's not just stealth games where this can happen either.  I remember in GTA V using a silenced sniper rifle from a very far distance, killed a guy, and now the cops show up several blocks away from the crime scene since I have a wanted star and are walking behind the house I was sneaking around."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Fallout 4 tried to fix their stealth gameplay with that. Ruined it a bit for me. If I stealth kill someone from half the map away, no one sees the hit and so on, they don't magically know where I am and come running jesus fuck. 

Turned into a game of ""Okay, kill this guy, make everyone ""cautious"" and just tank their random fire in my direction and kill them as they stick their heads out of cover one by one."". "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Bottles: louder, attracts more enemies

Brick: quieter, but can be used to melee 3 times"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Jeez I can’t imagine grounded mode without bricks. 
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It's a godsend on the higher difficulties where you have almost no crafting supplies, and thus no shivs, and also can only slow-sneak without being noticed. 

Seriously, Grounded mode on TLOU is the hardest thing I've ever done in a game. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah, this is one thing that ticks me off about the criticism of TLOU.

The developers knew this was an issue, but the alternative was far worse. I'd much rather have the occasional jank of an enemy ignoring an AI companion than have to worry about them fucking up my attempts at stealth, any day of the week."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Nothing more satisfying than murdering psychoreligious cultists
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Piss off ghost!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It almost certainly is. ""here's how happy she *was*. Bein' gay at a hoedown. Now get a glimpse of how fucked up she gets."""
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Not who you replied to, but I think Joel is such an important character that they'd really have to pull off something amazing, story-wise, to just write him out like that.

  


For the sake of transparency, I haven't played all of the original game but I've seen enough to know how well the two characters work together from a story point of view."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Biological double jeopardy!
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So it's like when you get fooled?
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah they're bullshitting. If you listen to the audio logs in the hospital, the fire flies we're theorizing Ellie developed some kind of anti bodies since the infection never grew on her brain, but they weren't sure how. And that's as far as the game ever got into explaining how. 

Not sure where they made that shit up from"
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I only got a third of the way through Styx. I really love the original Thief series, and I like the atmosphere and environment of Styx, but it was just too hard. If an NPC saw me at all, that was it. I was dead. I couldn't fight (unlike Thief) or run and hide effectively (unlike Thief). It's a shame because everything else about it was so good. Loading times were a pain too."
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Gta V had a bug where animals could report crime, which is a big part of the ridiculous things such as these. Birds OP"

8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I liked Styx a lot but there is absolutely no way I would have ever finished that game had it not have the instant-save feature.  I quickly developed saving OCD before I attempted to do *anything* in that game because more often than not, I would fail the first (or second, or third) time and nothing sucks more than to start at the beginning of a level or room like lots of other games make you do.

Was that in Bill's town?

If so, oh boy it just gets worse. Playing Ellie's level was downright unbearable. "
8qev7k,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Something that game did very well that I hadn't ever experienced was the mixing of churchy-type music with gunplay. It just fit in so well. Using a silenced AK and putting a few rounds into someone's skull while in the background can be heard ""Let the water wash away your sins...""

  


It just worked. It helps that the OST in FC5 was pretty spectacular as well."

I think i did some different difficulties because i wanted a specific shirt or backpack?  Its been a long time.  "

With The Last of Us Part II no more than a month away, I thought what better place to start?    


Hope you enjoy and would love to hear feedback or any suggestions for other titles that you think should receive a similar treatment.

gmpto7,2020-05-19,2020-05-20,"I honestly don't think I'm emotionally ready to play this game. 

It took me forever to play through the first game after *multiple* restarts. Not because it was a terrible game - it's probably my favorite - but because the first game's story and melancholy atmosphere kept wrecking my fucking world. 

I have the Ellie edition preordered. I very rarely preorder games - and **NEVER** a $230 preorder. But Jesus Christ that preorder is one of the best I've ever seen. And this series has such a special place in my heart. This game... I'm just not ready for it."

gmpto7,2020-05-19,2020-05-19,"Man... The blatant homophobia that exists in this sub.  I know that as gamers, we're toxic by nature, but I also like to think that those of us who dont waste our lives on MOBAs have a bit of civility and tend to lean progressive.

What the hell is the issue guys?  Leaks never tell you a story, and whoever did leak the game more than likely did so with a homophobic agenda, trying to get people to voice their discontent over plot point x or y.  I've avoided most of the spoilers, save for the fact that there is a homosexual relationship involving Ellie.

...but again I have to ask, why the hell is this such a big problem?  If there is something else that was seen in the leaks, then why not take those things with a grain of salt, as ND have said that the leaks werent wholly accurate.  There could have easily been someone intentionally trying to make the game sound bad.

I dunno.  But then again, as someone who played the original 20 years ago, I loved the hell out of the FFVII Remake... If peoplr want to be salty and hate things to hate them, I suppose that's on them.  But hating people for loving who they love?

People arent things.  Dont hate people for such frivolous and trivial reasons.

If the story was the worst ever made, I could just skip the cutscenes. 99.9% of my enjoyment of the first one was from actually playing the game, not watching the movie clips. I don’t even think the story in the first one was all that great, pretty generic. But I’m pumped as hell to play the second one."
gmpto7,2020-05-19,2020-05-19,"I mean the leaks are true. What happens is true. That’s enough for me. I’m actually sad at how relieved I am that the leaks happened and I commend the leakers.

Man, it's tough trying to avoid 'politics in games.' Might be easier to stop nitpicking and just enjoy the game. What did gamergaters used to say?

nah. it's an extremely manipulating story because it's a pseudo dilemma: there is no even remotely realistic scenario where you can justify killing an innocent person because of good intentions. At how many people killed would development of a cure be worth it? Even if it's only one person, doctors scooping around an innocent person's brains will always be murder. But you don't even know that it would take one person and you never know that in an remotely realistic scenario it would take one person.

Many of us have fought long and hard to be treated just like everyone else, only to have shit loads of bad will stirred up by a bunch of people (often not gay) that seem determined to force unpleasant portrayals of being gay onto audiences that have made no bones about expressing how unreceptive they are to that.

   This is practically anti-gay propaganda as it stands.

1. As I state in my other comment, the devs are totally unconstrained in designing characters, and in Abby they've literally given us a monster. What am I supposed to think about that?

    There's a huge difference between writing a story that is challenging and a snuff flick. We've all seen the gratuitous violence, we've all seen the *killing of dogs* spruiked as feature. Who are these sickos writing this stuff? Why would I want to put myself in the position of participating in what currently looks like a *brutal violence on rails* experience?

is it morally wrong to kill someone? well, most people would say yes, for good reasons.
but if there is an extinction event, and you could save humanity as a whole by sacrificing one person, the situation changes.


the thought experiment of saving one, or saving many has been done quite often, and imo there is no correct answer.

thats why i said he is the villain, depending on the point of view.
he might have doomed humanity, and thus is a villain.
at the same time he stood with his morals and protected whats important to him, making him the hero.


he also killed a bunch of scientists and guards though.

gmpto7,2020-05-19,2020-05-20,It is not even a 'cure vs a person's life' dilemma.  They don't have any cure - they just have one person with funny brain chemistry that is somehow immune (or at least highly resistant). And if their first idea is 'let's kill her and root around in her brain' then I doubt they have any researchers competent enough to have even a remote chance to develop a cure.
gmpto7,2020-05-19,2020-05-20,"Oh no, consequences are fine.  Honestly Joel NOT dying would have been unexpected to anyone not currently sucking on their toes..  Storytelling can be pretty simplistic, and people writing for videogames are usually not laureates. You sacrifice the hero character if they have something to die for, especially in a sequel.  I'm just confused why they decided to have the climax from the villains perspective.  The beginning, middle of the story? -cool choice, nice small sequence.  But the whole end?  This is no Empire, it is a video game that people waited 7 years for.  If they have an Expansion in the pipeline, they should announce that now and quell everyone's fears.  If that is coming out in ~1 year then this is actually fucking brilliant, but I highly doubt that.  Imagine generating this much hate and getting to play as Ellie again, it is too genius to be true."

Didn't seem hamfisted to me.  She's a lesbian living her life. If they replaced the girl with a guy this wouldn't even be conversation. It's not like they are preaching equal rights or something like that, it's one minor characteristic of the character. You called this a ""brutal violence on rails experience"", have you played the first last of us? It's pretty violent.

>in Abby they've literally given us a monster. What am I supposed to think about that?

In the leaks it implied that  [Spoiler](/s ""Joel killed her father."") She wanted revenge and she got it. I don't think that makes her monster, but if that's you opinion, why is that a bad thing? Anyone has the capability to be a monster.

I also want to point out that the leak only gave us a vertical slice of the story. We don't know everything that leads to those events. Your opinion of how the characters are handled might be different with the scope of the full story."

gmpto7,2020-05-19,2020-05-20,">in italy they had to decide who gets to live because they were lacking ventilators.

First things first, a bit off topic but this is a proven FALSE story for both Italy and Spain

Secondly, doctors do chose who to treat first in like a car accident incident based on severity, judging who is in most danger and who has more chances to live. 

Both these cases are irrelevant to us because we are not talking about dying people.

> you could save humanity as a whole by sacrificing one person, the situation changes. 

That's why I said the dilemma is a false one and it's just manipulation. There is no situation where killing someone would result in the life of everyone else. How could the doctors know that they would have to kill JUST ONE PERSON before the cure? Literally impossible to know. If anything this means that the doctors actually killed many others previously to get to this point. 

There is no point of view, you cannot kill anyone just to experiment. There is no ""dooming humanity"" because you can't possibly know HOW the cure can be made.

> in the end, there is no actual good or bad in this post apocalyptic world. its everyone for themselves. 

That's nonsense. Of course there is. For example for Josef Mengele, the Nazi's failing WAS the end of the world. That's why he did all the horrific things that he did. You are justifying the same logic."

gmpto7,2020-05-19,2020-05-19,"Not saying for or against anything here, but most of the time, it's because it never feels organic to the situation. It isn't ""A character that happens to be X, Y, or Z"" it's almost always ""HEY LOOK AT THIS CHARACTER THAT IS X, Y, and/or Z!""

A lot of things; movies, games, books, etc. They fall into this trap. They include stuff for the sake of inclusion. Which is fine, but it's going to look and feel bad for people on the outside.

This is especially so for.... oh idk, a game company that fires one of the best game writers in the entire business (who happens to be female) and replaces her with a man who says he wants to empower women in gaming, and proceeds to throw her script and story into the garbage.

That's what ticks me off. Not the character existing, just the fact that the character wasn't intended, and feels shoehorned into a plot that already had a direction before being stripped of it's old identity, and we are left with very little reason why and can only make assumptions.

&#x200B;

Of course there are just some bigoted assholes that just outright hate her because she MIGHT be trans/gay/masculine/whatever. All I know is that even people I hold close to me that are LGBT+ fucking hate this character and the guy who got the original writer kicked off. It's not always about the exact message someone is trying to say, it's WHY and HOW they are trying to get that message across>! and giving our previous main character the same treatment as a golfball in an undignified death by a random AF character is 100% the wrong way, especially since it 1) makes Ellie look weak since she couldn't save Joel, and 2) makes the supposedly ""strong"" female character look weak since she couldn't win fairly!<"

gmpto7,2020-05-19,2020-05-20,"Well if they decided to shoehorne dinausaurs instead, people would complain about that as well. This is shitty writing on their part and that wouldn't change even if they had made the character different"
gmpto7,2020-05-19,2020-05-20,"Abby isn't trans.

You're feeling facto bitching about Ellie who was gay in Left Behind."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,For those at work: **February 21 2020**.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I’ve never played a game with such a gripping and emotional story as the first one. Left me feeling empty after I finished it. So ready for Joel and Ellie again
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Ellie has bad luck with the ladies.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I have NEVER been this excited to hear a clicker - GIVE ME THIS GAME
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Ready to get emotionally wrecked by this game, 2020 can’t come soon enough!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,it looks like dina was killed. You can see Dina's bracelet on Ellie's wrist in one of the shots of the trailer so I think that confirms it.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Ashley Johnson is going to kill it again. She’s a MONSTAH!!!
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Inject this shit into my fucking veins
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,BIG NUT
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,They're bamboozling us; Dina ain't gonna die this early in the game... right?
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I literally cried when I saw Joel
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,*You think I'd let you do this alone?*
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I swear to god, if Naughty Dog kills Joel in this one, it might be one of the saddest things to happen in the history of video games."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I think that Ellie has found out about Joel's lie in the time between the last game and now and parted ways with him over it, hence her not too enthusiastic response when he shows up at the end of the trailer"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,My wife and I are expecting a baby that week. Who needs sleep anyway...
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,That Joel moment got me to shed a very manly tear.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,The trailer could have use a dash of Gustavo Santaolalla.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,This is going to be cross generational isn’t it??
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,If Naughty Dog mocapped my erection after seeing this trailer they'd have all the animations they needed to create a game about Rocket Propulsion
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Feels like I’ve been waiting my whole damn life for this
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Holly shit this looks intense!
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,It looks very good.

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Is it just me or is there a huge spoiler about her gf ? Or are we just made to believe that? Hmm
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Oh my god... 2020 is gonna go down in history as one of the best years for gaming.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Planet Zoo, Potentially RDR2 on PC, Dying Light 2, TLOU2, and then Cyberpunk?! Good lord."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Okay so the plot will probably resolve around the revenge around ellie her new girlfriend! I was scared it would be revenge about Joel. I am very excited about this and how the relationship between Joel and Ellie will develop.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Okay, but why is Ellie wearing a mask?"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,For thos OOTL who's Dina? I feel like I've missed something big
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,How the fuck did this not make it to the front page and COD did?
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"So we got the El Camino trailer, and this, and a move towards impeachment all on the same day?  
WHO FIXED WHAT?! WHERE AND HOW?!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I’ve been waiting so long. And now the release is in sight. I’m ready for what I’m 100% sure will be a another amazing game. 

Here we go."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Nice
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,AUUUUUGH Tears in my eyes when Joel finally appeared.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Looks gorgeous! However, being a revenge plot kinda worries me in how generic it could be (at least what the trailer suggests). But naughty dog is pretty great at turning genre conventions upside down, in a way."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Preordered this game in 2017. Been a long wait but I’m pleased Naughty Dog are releasing when they feel it’s truly ready.

Joel and Ellie on the road again!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? THIS IS RELEASING THE DAY BEFORE MY WEDDING. THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE JUST BECAME THE DAY THAT DELAYED MY LAST OF US PART II GAME TIME!

You can call out sick for your wedding right?"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"HUGE SPECULATION: 

Between this and the very first trailer where we see Joel enter through a doorway of light, I'm guessing Joel is also dead and Ellie is hallucinating him as she goes further down her path of anger and revenge. It is where her mind will put what what is ""good"" in her so she can compartmentalize and be a guardian angel/the voice of her subconscious, et cetera. I'll stick by this until when/if we see him in action and actually interacting with the world outside of being a comforting voice for Ellie. A big part of the marketing of the first game is how Ellie is helpful in fights and we haven't seen *any* of that sort of marketing for this yet (granted, it may be so we'll known that they don't need to now).

Either way I am so goddamned psyched. And Ashley Johnson's performance from the trailers seems phenomenal. Which makes sense, she is so talented. But like...a new benchmark for performance capture. So excited to experience this game."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,That literally sent chills down my spine. So many masterpieces coming soon I cant wait!
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"People are saying the Dina death could be a fake out and it's actually Joel who dies, but it could also be Tommy who dies. And of course Joel would go on a revenge mission with Ellie to avenge Tommy and possibly rescue Dina (if she'd been kidnapped).

EDIT: someone in the comments mentioned Dina could be a firefly spy, and while that remains an interesting possibility, I think another alternative is that the fireflies somehow find out where Ellie is living and still want her for the potential to create a cure/vaccine against the cordiceps, and try to kidnap her and fail but end up taking Dina instead and using her as bait to draw Ellie into a trap."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I'm so fucking glad Naughty Dog is still making single player, story-driven adventure games their way. It's pretty much just them and CDPR holding the line against shitty games-as-a-service microtransaction-farming bullshit."

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Major spoilers, fuck"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I am hoping this will come out with the ps5 next year, loved the first one, on the ps3"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Damn I was seriously expecting this to launch alongside PS5 next year. I'm shocked
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I have enough time to go through the first part!
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Who else is going to miss the Joel daddy moments? This one is supposed to be a more hateful game than the first.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,The first one is why I bought a PlayStation.  Please be good.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,This post reminded me that I have a PlayStation console.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Oh fuck yes... this looks great
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Super glad that her character model more closely resembles her from the first one. Looks like they did some tweaking.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,so RDR with zombies?
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Foaming. At. The mouth.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"The more I think about it, the more I don't think either Joel or Ellie finish this next game alive."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I still feel like Joel's dead and Ellie is just imagining him as the voice in her head.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Hoping like crazy that this trailer is a big misdirect and that the game doesn't fall so cleanly into the simplistic ""my girlfriend is killed now I gotta kill everyone"" trope (especially considering how overdone and harmful that cliche has been in a lot of media over the years; ""bury your gays"" and all that). 

I mean, Naughty Dog has a reputation for messing with its fans. They literally promised people that Ellie wouldn't be playable in TLoU 1 and that was an outright lie (which I love)."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,My mom died February 28th this year. It'll be nice to have something like this to experience on that one year mark
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,2-21-20.  For those who are too excited.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I loved the first game, but in recent years I don't really play games anymore. Too busy with kids, work, boring adult stuff. All that said, I think I may make a PS4 just for this game. It comes out the day before my birthday so I just hope I have $500 to spare."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I really wish I was into this game, seems like a masterpiece. But I hate horrors, stealth and jumpscares with a passion.

  


I'll try the first one since it'll be free but I don't think I will enjoy it"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Ah man I hate February, I guess this'll make it a 'lil better."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,My body is ready by my emotions are weak rn
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,The wait is almost over!
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"We all know Ellie would be dying in Joel's arms by the end of this game, that's just how it goes with women in his life"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,So fucking pumped! Can't wait to hear more about multiplayer.  The first game's multiplayer is seriously underrated
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Kinda wish they kept a few of those plot reveals out of the trailer. That being said, I am so stoked for this game to break me in half emotionally and then ask for more!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,ah fuck no wonder its taken 6 years already
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Why would there still be a meaningful number of stage 1 infected?
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"This moment right now is a sad one...
Thanks bud."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Now we get to see clickers in this level of detail. They weren't scary enough huh?
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Goosepumps hit me every damn time while I’m watching this.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I just got chills...from a game trailer.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I knew I should have gone back to my ex gf's to get my playstation
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,It's gonna hurt but I will wait for PS5 to play this. Last of us 1 was incredible on ps4 in comparison to ps3.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,The hype is real right now.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"You know what, I don't think I've ever seen dirty snow in a video game before."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,So fucking hyped
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Nice
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Oh shit! It comes out on my bday!
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Holy crap, that's literally my Bday!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,One of the few games too scary to play alone and too compelling to leave alone.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,He touched her.........
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I felt a sigh of relief at 2:40.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Game of the generation incoming ladies and gentlemen
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,It's been so long I've actually stopped caring about it.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Ahhhhhhhhh now, please now!!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Holy shit the way they introduced Joel. Literal goosebumps. Let's hope he doesn't pull an Arthur Morgan by the end of TLOU2.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I’m so, so scared that there will be no multiplayer. Looking at the digital content for Pre ordering, and Deluxe edition, there’s no indication of it existing!!!!!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Do I finally need to buy a PS4?
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,I still need to play the first one. One day I’ll get around to buying it.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I'm ready for the jumpscares, intense fighting scenes and insane plotwists. Also hyped for the Dynamic Duo to comeback."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Looks better than the first
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,So this one is about Ellies sister or some new girl?
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Yes! It’s her friend. Lol. I’ve never felt so relieved.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Holy Shit!! Been waiting on this one for a while. And Joel too!!
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Where can I preorder 🙌
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Another fucking 5 months!? It'll be 7 years since the first one by then! FML.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,150 days
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,The hypeeeeeeeeeeeee
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Everybody better get really good flowers, chocolate for their significant other a week before this comes out on Valentine's day, cause a week later, you'll disappear for 3 days playing this. Super pumped to play this game."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,There he is!!!
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Oh fuckkkkkkkkkkkkk yisssss
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,I always wait until games get deep discou.... Last of Us Part II? ...nevermind

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I still haven’t played the first one, I’ll probably do that soon"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Fuck yeah!
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"i started bawling when i saw Joel was alive & my boyfriend asked if I was okay bc i held my breath through the whole trailer i love this game so much. 
when i first played it I was crying constantly, I connected with it so much it's so good & I'm so proud of the devs and voice actors for how hard they've worked on this game 😭💜"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,I totally forgot this was in the making.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Goddamn about time it got a release date!
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,RIP Dina.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I really hope Joel isn’t dead and appearing as a ghost/conscience like a lot of people are saying. It’s such a cliche and overused trope at this point and Joel deserves better than being killed offscreen between the two games.

I believe he’s alive and estranged from Ellie and the camp due to the mistrust growing between them after the lie he told."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Oh lord take me, for my body is ready."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,This game looks very polished! It will also probably cause the heat death of my PS4.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,I really hope the up the creature types/body horror in regards to the infected compared to the first game.  There were a lot of fantastic unused pieces of concept art.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,I got a fucking chubby when Joel was shown on the trailer
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Ellie is wearing a gas mask in the trailer against the spores, so her community probably doesn't know about her bite!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Anyone know where to preorder? Cant find it on amazon?
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,YEEEEEET
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Well, time to make one exception to the ""remember, no preorders"" rule I guess."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Me and everyone on the Internet : Never pre-order

&#x200B;

Me now : Ok, maybe just for this game"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Looks absolutely amazing, what a great time to be a gamer."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Not convinced that it’s Joel who puts her hand over Ellie’s mouth towards the end of the trailer. Looks like it jumps from an outdoor scene to indoor (honestly looks like a basement). Definitely some  editing trickery going on here.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,This game is the only one that could get GOTY ahead of Cyberpunk imo.

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Im hyped, but im also feeling anxious. I bet a lot of the game is going to be Joel trying to keep Ellie from finding out there coulda been a cure. Prob gonna be some decent angst."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Yeah, I've never played the series at all and this trailer honestly makes me wanna try it.

EDIT: Oh it's ps exclusive. NVM. Guess I'll just watch the story."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Spoiler warning.  I disliked that they expected me to just shoot the doctors though at the end when I entered the operating room.  Had an awkward standoff where I didn't shoot them, and then realized I couldn't progress the story without shooting them.  I didn't really want to shoot them.  Hell, I wasn't even sure they were making a bad decision.  But the game didn't do a good job of making me do it.  Should have had one of the doctors pull a sidearm or something, instead of just making me cold blood murder them."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Telltale's The Walking Dead is above TLoU, but not by far."

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I was excited by what looks to be a new mutated infected at 2:10
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"As soon as the screen went dark and I heard the clicking sound, I reflexively curled up in a ball and held my breath

One of the most terrifying creatures in video game"

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Heard that and immediately got chills. Excited chills. And then they kept coming!  Cannot wait!!
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,A week after Valentine’s Day? I’m ready to get emotionally wrecked TWO times in one month!
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,He looks like he's been through some shit.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"*cough cough* and you know, ellie talks about getting revenge and you hear her scream after a gunshot in a situation where it’s obvious dina was kidnapped..."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,That was some Walking Dead level of foreshadowing.  The game will be amazing though.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I think this trailer revealed waaaay too much, even the Joel reveal.

The death of Dina would be 10x more powerful if it wasn't revealed in a trailer months before release"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,good... because i want a game about joel and ellie anyway.

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Damn dude you don’t say
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,She would like to RAGE
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-26,"Hey! Aasimar are people, too!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,The first game literally opened with Joel's daughter getting gunned down. Dina is too good and pure for the world of this game.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Bold prediction: Dina gets kidnapped, Joel shows up to help Ellie rescue her. They finally track her down to find out she is part of the Fireflies and her kidnapping was staged to lure out Joel and Ellie. Dina kills Joel in front of Ellie, then Ellie goes on a revenge tour."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Probably a bamboozle. Why spoil such a pivotal moment in the story like that?
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,It was like Joel talking to us thinking he'd be dead for this game. God damn it.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Didn't we all.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Literally?
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"You know it's coming lol, he's not going to die of old age"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Since the ending of the first walking dead game.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Oh, she knew the moment the credits rolled in the first game. That's my take, anyway."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I think Joel is dead and ellie is a wee bit crazy
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Same dude. I think we're going to have to live off 17 minutes of sleep a night..  Give or take.

Edit:. Congrats!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I get it, you gotta get that baby on an all nighter to finish the first one before it can play the second installment."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Congrats all future parents! I don’t know what’s more terrifying, the thought of changing all those diapers or the Clickers."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I'm expecting a baby about a week earlier lol. I guess we'll have something to do after being woken up countless times in the middle of the night
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"In all honesty, you'll probably get a pretty nice amount of gaming time in during that first month or so. Don't get me wrong, you'll be tired as shit and your entire life schedule is going to be thrown in the blender, but newborns sleep a LOT and there will be a lot of time where you can just sit with them in a baby carrier as you game away at like 3 in the morning. So not all hope is lost :)"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"My wife gave birth to our daughter 3 months ago. We named her Ellie. Can't wait for this, although I have no idea when I'll have the time to play it. Children are exhausting. Good luck my friend!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"It’s actually the perfect time. When my little dude was born he slept enough that I finished my PS4 platinums for uncharted 1-3, and finally played through the RE2 remake (and platinum). Babies sleep a lot in the first while and even when awake mostly just want to be held."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Congrats, and.. my condolences for your free time.  You will have none."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Man i'm at work trying to hold back my emotions from seeing Papa Joel lol
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,It will be the same as the first and will release on PS5 a few months after its release
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,r/rarecompliments
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,I thought the game was coming this year. I was saving my gaming budget for it. This is the only game I have waited this desperately.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Could go either way.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,You never know what happened to her. Maybe she betrayed Ellie and killed all her friends. Or she does die.  Or she was bitten and had to be killed by the dangerous group since they idealize sins and suchs and now pursue a cure going against Joel because she says she has to finish
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Maybe because she (still?) does not want to disclose to everybody the fact that >!she's immune!<.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Must be part of the story DLC, I missed out on it too. Is the DLC standalone and available on the ps4?"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Orange man bad
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,not if you want to keep your spouse.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,No! I don't want it to be true but it's what I also speculated after the first trailer. My hopeful guess is that Joel is not dead and will just be the secondary role like Ellie was in the first game. I have a feeling Joel may die in this game but I also think there is a chance he might live since there is bound to be a third and final game and they both need to be in it.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,I think these games are a bit too grounded in realism (aside from the zombies) for that to ever be a driving force in the plot.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"This isn't a question.   Ellie needs you.  Joel needs you.

Cloud still has dumb hair."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Well supposedly all PS4 games will be backwards compatible on the PS5 so that's a plus!
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,That would be Undead Nightmare.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,you are in for a lot of emotional pain then
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,I'm sorry dude.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"You can play on the easiest difficulty setting and breeze through it pretty easily and enjoy the story, at least."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Nice
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,I never played it on the first one. I was pretty miffed that the platinum was walled off behind mandatory multiplayer.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,You could. Or if you feel like waiting until November 2020 the PS5 will likely be out by then.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I just, finally, played it for the first time a couple weeks ago. It's such a fantastic game. Really grew on me and got to me emotionally. Get it!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,If you have Playstation Plus it's actually going to be one of the free games for October.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,i think its one of next months free games
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"> appearing as a ghost/conscience like a lot of people are saying.

That's such a cheesy dumb idea, lmao. No chance."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"why?

I mean, it's your money...do what you like, but what difference will it really make?"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"THOU 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Death Stranding, Final Fantasy 7 Remake...

not enough me to go around!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I'm curious. What would a story centered around a gay relationship need for you to not consider it agenda-pushing?

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,What? How does this in anyway hint towards ps5?
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Did you play it at all?
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I can understand that. It's definitely not a game focused on really in depth gameplay. It's there, just not as mechanically complex as some games. The story is meant to be the driving motivation to keep playing."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,It took me a few chapters to really get into it but after that I was totally sucked in.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Spoken like true gamers
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,This would make sense if the gameplay in the first game wasn't fantastic and this looked even better. Grow up.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Did you even play the first game? Also how does Ellie's relationship here in any way affect gameplay?
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Go back to complaining about women and minorities in Battlefield
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,No. PS4 exclusive if you are being honesty in your question.

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Never gonna happen.

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"People say this a lot, but we have no idea how much of anything was actually revealed until we know the full story"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,Red dead 2 was on two discs and all it affected was changing discs during the download...
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"God fucking damn it. FF7 Remake, Cyberpunk 2077 and now Last of Us 2 in such a short time frame.

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,This game was revealed over three years ago.. This is the release date Trailer :D
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,They revealed this december 2016.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"> I hate when people try to say that it was trash or overrated. 

Who are these philistines you are surrounded by?"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"My best friend never played it, he said “the zombie trope is overdone and stupid”. I’m hounding him until he plays it, even gave him my copy, because it really is so much more than a “zombie game”. It isn’t really even about the infected, the human elements are the majority of the story, and I hope I can get him to play through it before TLOU2 comes out."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Not sure if I would agree for the claim being best storytelling. The most recent God of war game would give TLOU a run for its money. It has depth, inter and intra personal growth from both Kratos and atreus (quite similar with the growth between Joel and ellie), both games have amazing voice acting that I would say rival many AAA animated movie titles out there.

I would say horizon:zero dawn would make a close 2nd runner up when it comes to storytelling and game play mechanics.

I've played all 3 titles (all with multiple replays) and each offered unique storytelling techniques and game play but best of all, offline main campaign mode FTW."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,That’s how I feel about RDR2
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,It's a good game but it's severely overrated.

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I’ve heard it’s good but I haven’t played it, or any Telltale games. As mentioned above, God of War was also great, and The Witcher 3 story got me as well. I guess I just love father/child stories lol"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I always though that as a carrier who is immune, Ellie's kiss is a one way to clickerdom"

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,I thought it was just a bloater.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,And dogs are now a threat too. This game is gonna be soo hard on survivor mode.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Absolutely the most terrifying enemy I've ever encountered.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"As hype as I am for this game, I am a bit disappointed they revealed that in the trailer. I would have like to learn about Ellie's bloodlust through playing the game."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"It's gonna be so hilarious when they swerve the shit out of you guys and it turns out Dina was a plant by the Fireflies to get close to them and Joel is the one she's watching die... Which is why you haven't seen Joel in any of the gameplay stuff. Which is why the Dina relationship is somewhat new in one of the trailers. Which is why she says, ""I'm going to finish this,"" suggesting a prolonged conflict and not just them randomly targeting some girl that had nothing to do with any of it. Which is why she looks at Tommy with a shocked look and says, ""what are you doing?"" because he isn''t willing to avenge his brother. Which is then coincidentally why a hand randomly grabs her further during the journey back at the city where the last game ended and it's actually Tommy showing up to help. Finally, which is why they used that tricky cut between the hand grabbing her and an entirely unrelated scene with Joel inside a house.

As emotionally guarded as Ellie is, you could actually take this swerve really deep into the story and it still make sense and turn out really powerful."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,yep I was more commenting on the bracelet than anything and trying to drum up discussion. it is pretty obvious but you never know it could be a fake-out by Naughty Dog.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"> The death of Dina would be 10x more powerful if it wasn't revealed in a trailer months before release

It wasn’t though. Nobody actually knows if she dies."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"People complain about spoilers, but the reality is that a trailer needs to show a character's motivations. For people that aren't sold on the game, they'll understand Ellie's desire for putting herself in harm's way."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Joel was in the very first teaser though.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Everyone had already guessed it from the last trailer...
Naughty dog is master storyteller...there are more, bigger things to uncover in the story"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,After reading your comment I'm starting to agree with you. Too many plot points were revealed here. Teaser trailers these days are more like how the actual trailer should be.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Joel was revealed back in 2016.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,You REALLY think that they would spoil something like dina's death? LMFAO. They are jebaiting you are you are falling in the trap like a rat with cheese. Hilarious. Naught dog and marketing
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Or if you have time you can replay it again, because it seems the first one will be free with ps+ next month."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Dina wasn't in the first one. She's just been shown in the trailers for part 2, and we don't know much about her other than she's another resident of that community and has a crush on Ellie (put mildly b/c we don't know how deep their relationship is yet)."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,You should really replay it. Might as well before we get part 2!

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,I’m digging this theory. Something about Dina just seems too perfect to be true.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"It's the inciting incident which typically isn't a spoiler for most stories. That being said, there could still be more to it."

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"That's a good point, wasn't thinking about that. I guess I figured it was just a well known fact to Tommy and his settlement, but I guess maybe only Tommy and his wife know."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"It's just the trailers, she's not in the dlc. However the dlc is 100% worth getting, is available on the PS4 but I don't know if it's stand alone"

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Hey there!  There were three important reasons I didn't enjoy TLoU.  First, the sidekick would run around through scenes directly in front of enemies because they were invisible to the enemy AI.  Unfortunately, so many of these events over the course of the game during key scenes destroyed any concern I felt for her safety, and pulled me out of the suspense.  Secondly, I didn't like how the gunplay felt, so as you can imagine, that's an important part of the package.  Finally, I found the route through the game extremely linear, and felt that I was punished when I searched for supplies off the obvious path.  I consistently reached dead ends that were tedious to come back from, especially empty handed.  Visually the game was excellent for the console, but otherwise I didn't enjoy it.  Hope these make sense!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I'll chime in.

The narrative was really compelling, absolutely. The gameplay however was kind of dull. The gunplay, the crafting, linear nature of the levels, immersion breaking companion, etc, just didn't captivate me anywhere near the level the story did.

Cinematic games just don't do it for me anymore unfortunately. I have no ill-will against anyone who likes them, I can definitely understand why people love them. 

It's the same reason Control felt like a slog and so did God of War (to a lesser extent): Just derivative game-play mechanics we've seen over and over for the last 10 years, kept going/fresh by a compelling narrative. 

It's why a game like Rocket League will always get more hours of gameplay then anything else. Again just IMO, but I'm one of the ones who didn't completely enjoy TLoU and why something like Death Stranding or Cyberpunk will get my money over the TLoU2 due to how the focus seems to be primarily on gameplay."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I just recently played it for the first time and I've been telling myself that the reason I didn't think it was as great as everyone said was because it felt dated, I'm sure at the time of original release it was phenomenal."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Im sorry but God of War has nothing on Tlou in terms of storytelling. I loved God Of War 2018 and it surpasses tlou in terms of graphics, gameplay, and much more but the story was just alright. Atreus really took a dive in terms of writing before Kratos revealed his power to him. We get it your angsty and have a bunch of animosity towards your dad but whiny writing for the kid that drags on isnt enjoyable."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"It’d be hard to choose between God of War and The Last of Us, but I think Horizon is just a tier lower than those games."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"As much as I REALLY enjoyed Horizon: Zero Dawn, I was not quite as invested in the characters as I was with TLoU.  The overall big picture story of HZD was amazing, and learning about the downfall and the whole truth about Zero Dawn was pretty mind-blowing, but it didn't make me cry the way that TLoU did on multiple occasions, of 

I still think of it as the gold standard for storytelling and connection with characters.  I was emotionally invested, not just in Joel and Ellie, but others as well.  The guy with his little brother in the sewers really hit hard too.  I also felt a lot of panic with TLoU when it came to shortage of supplies and especially ammunition and First Aid.  Every shot HAD to count and I don't think I was ever at full health through almost all of the game."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,When I was watching this trailer I was thinking about that GOW game. It was great!
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"TLOU has a great deal of depth. You can prefer whichever one you want, but it has depth."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Yeah, God of War was great, but story and characters have nothing on TLoU"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Another classic. I personally preferred the first RDR but RDR2 is up there with the best
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"> The controls sucked and the story has been done a thousand times before

You definetly haven't played it then, and tell me wich game or series already did the plot of TLOU. TLOU is unlike anything else, in term of plot."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"That she shouldn’t kiss on the first date? I mean, we’re a little more progressive, but I guess second or third date will be okay."

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Can't wait to be unable to finish Grounded
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Yeah I'm super disappointed in myself for watching the trailer.  It gave away what felt like a lot, all that seems left is to uncover the outcome of the story.  Unless everything shown in the advert is a bait and switch and the main plot is awaiting us all in the latter half of the game."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I mean, pretty much everybody predicted Dina was gonna die. It could be a fake-out but it just emphasises that Dina's death is not the point and we're definitely gonna see Dina dying quite early in the game.   
  
TLoU was a story told time and time again about the rough and tough guy reluctantly forced to travel with a young kid who he eventually starts caring deeply for. The predictability didn't stop TLoU from being an awesome story but [imo enhanced it](https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/ssol.3.1.09lea) because it was all about the journey and not the destination. Same thing goes for TLoU2 I imagine. It will be about Ellie's personal journey of loss, grief, and redemption. I don't need twists and surprises, I just want a well-crafted journey."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I mean ellie's GF had more death flags than the Unite Nations has countries. first trailer showed she wanted to get revenge and the second showed her having a relationship. kind of obvious what would happen. The thing I'm looking forward to is how does that death impact her journey for revenge. they can lead into a lot of interesting situations like john wick story arc, deal with the devil, hamlet, etc."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I feel like they sorta gave it away already in the previous e3 gameplay trailer. Right after she kissed Dina, it transitions to her killing a guard and she is seen with Dina’s bracelet."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"That could be the opening scene though,  just like Joels daughter dying started off the first game."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Hmmm....I'm convinced.  Can you do Star Wars Episode 9 next?
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"As much as I wish the plot was more complex in this way, it seems like you can see Joel's face and beard in one of the mouth grabbing frames. It could be a sort of ""ghost Joel"" thing though."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Yeah that’s certainly the easiest assumption atm but it doesn’t really make sense to me to give up so much of the plot. It’s suspiciously too obvious for me to believe that’s what happens.

For example Elle could have escaped and found the bracelet in the process. Now it’s not a revenge mission, it’s a rescue mission. Won’t know for sure till we play it.

All that aside I’m excited to see a more mature, possibly darker version of Elle than the original. Maybe a less apathetic, calmer John too."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,They’re clearly in a relationship based on the trailer.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I can see that. I think because what we've seen of her so far has been so...sweet, I think? that it's clear she doesn't *fit*, and it's throwing us off so either she's evil or she is just too sweet to live."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I mean just look at the trailer smoking the devil's lettuce and turning Ellie to the gay side. She's a delinquent of the highest order.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,My theory...and people probably won't like it. The trailer isn't necessarily in chronological order. The whole scene with Joel near the end of the trailer is at the beginning of the game. Dina is taken and Joel is killed. I could more easily see Ellie going on a blood fueled killing spree if that was the case.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,u REALLY think that they would spoil something like dina's death? LMFAO. They are jebaiting you are you are falling in the trap like a rat with cheese. Hilarious. Naught dog and marketing
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Yeah I have a strong feeling this trailer is intentionally misleading is. If Joel doesn’t die I’d be pretty surprised.

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I used to be cautiously optimistic about Bloodlines 2, but then I saw the gameplay footage.

The graphics and combat system have obviously been improved massively, but the charm seem to have gone. And said charm is what made the first one such a cult classic, that's still enjoyable to play to this day, despite how clunky it is.

If the demo turns out to just be a poor example, or something that was later completely changed, I'll buy it.

Oh also, the disco music in the sequel has gotten a massive downgrade."

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Don’t understand why you’re being downvoted. Your opinion is interesting and valid. 
I’d like to reply with my personal opinion on it. 

No game is perfect and bugs are bound to happen. 
The last of us was very much a story driven game rather than relying on mechanics and exploration, it focused on character development, emotion and suspense. It’s intentional that it’s linear. The same way a movie is linear. It wasn’t about making choices but about discovering the reason the characters made choices. You lived their story. 

The gun mechanics were supposed to be difficult and the intention was to avoid using the gun. The lack of ammunition made it more realistic. Stress and fear can make aiming difficult etc, etc. 

I noticed the bugs and issues through my many play throughs. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The story and acting was worth a little bit of coding errors/ bugs. 
I’m looking forward to LoU II and have been for years!"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I agree with all of this, and for that reason I simply thought the game was okay. But, it's so loved by so many people (and justly so), having a mediocre-to-low opinion on the game makes it sound like I hated it. That's what I've always felt anyway.

Also it was the same year as BioShock Infinite and that game was better in every category for me and I will absolutely die on that hill."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"That's kinda the point of those dead ends. Sometimes there's stuff there, sometimes there isn't. It's supposed to make you feel more desperate and low on supplies."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I would agree with you on the gunplay part... however... I kind of put that down to the fact that Joel is just a guy.  He's your average working guy next door; he's not military, or a cop, or anything else that would've had extensive firearm training.

With that in mind, it made sense that the gunplay was clunky.

I also agree that the game was linear, but I didn't mind that since it was done to tell a story.  I loved Uncharted and they were all linear as well, and I'm really enjoying Detroit: Become Human which is even more linear.  But it serves the story.

Games, like TV, movies, books, or any other artform, are subjective.  People like what they like."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I just finished playing this for the first time yesterday. While I loved all the characters very much, thought the game did a good job of humanizing Kratos (which I didn't even think was possible), and adore the various storytime moments in the boat and on the world tree, the story itself fell flat pretty badly in the end.   
I think they were trying to go for leaving the audience wanting more, but instead I felt like there wasn't enough given in the first place. Or rather perhaps too much of the wrong stuff. It seemed like most of the story was about Odin and the various mysteries of what he wanted in Jotunheim, why this Tyr guy wanted to stop it, and all that. And by the time I got to the end, I had almost completely forgotten about the whole ashes reason for the journey. Meanwhile, I barely cared about Baldur. I expected him to be a bit player for the whole story. Kept waiting for Thor to show up and lead the way to Odin being the big bad. I guess that's still the plan, but they paced it so poorly for that to be the plot of an entirely different game."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I also love the game. I thought the sharp turn in Atreus' character after finding out his power, and then the sharp turn back once he gets set straight, was pretty jarring."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Horizon was a lot more *fun* than TLoU and GoW2018. The worldbuilding in Horizon was pretty cool, but the character drama was less compelling."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Horizon's surface-level plot was fine and got the job done, but the fucking lore they came up with for that world is next level awesome."

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I'm sure it will still be good. NaughtyDog has only gotten better at story telling.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I wouldn't be so certain. The scene where it looks like Joel grabs Ellie and she says 'what are you doing here' is different from the scene where it shows Joel's face. There is a jump cut there, from outside to what looks like the inside of a building. There is a bit of editing trickery going on here, and I bet it might be Joel who is the one who gets shot.  Remember, the game left off with Joel slaughtering a bunch of Fireflies...he didn't kill all of them."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Well Naughty Dog did trick journalists into thinking Ellie wasn't playable for the first game. Then on release, she actually was lol"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,I’m hoping it’s about as relevant as Joel losing his daughter. But even that was a huge “hook me in” moment I enjoyed experiencing when I played...
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I’m betting those events happen pretty early in the game.. revenge is probably going to be the meat of the game.. 🤷‍♂️
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,It could very well be that everything they showed in the trailer happens in the first hour or so. Just the setup for the story.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Naughty dog has been known to deceive with their trailers. The story may be entirely different than what we think it will be.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I'm guessing for a plot switch half way. I bet we only saw a quarter of the story, which based on the completion  time of the last one it's only 3-4 hours."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"True to an extent, the majority of TLOU’s story was pretty standard as far as plot beats, just well done and sealed together with the central’s duo’s relationship. The finale however is very much unpredictable. It’s a huge gut punch melding between a very good ending and a very bad ending that plays off our desires experiencing it."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"I thought the same thing, but Tommy also has a beard and scraggly hair nowadays. He and Joel look very similar now"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"True, I just wasn't sure whether to label Dina as Ellie's girlfriend, love interest, or whatever else."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Nahhhh Ellie has always been on the gay side.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"Definitely could see this, well said."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,It would be weird if Joel died before Ellie finds out that he lied to her at the end of the first game.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"If they kill Joel, I'm blaming you and you're gonna have to hold me"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,I think the main story will involve the fireflys looking for Ellie and causing havok in the village then Ellie will feel guilty for not being their to protect them while she was out on revenge.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"It would explain why she has Dina's bracelet also. Maybe she wants to go out and find whoever killed Joel. So she is ready to head out and Dina gives her the bracelet and tells her, ""I want you to come back to me"" or something like that"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I can't see them including Joel's death in a trailer, but I think your point about it not being in chronological order is correct"

And how the relation between those two is going to evolve. A man that lost a daughter and don't want to have another daughter figure in fear of loosing her once again. And a kid don't know if her life is worth risking the life of others around her. There is much more than what i just wrote. If you just played the game you would have known.

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,"I was literally just explaining to my friends how I don't watch trailers anymore because they are filled with spoilers for the plot. Also broke my policy for this, I mean how could I not?"
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,Naughty Dog knows not to reveal everything in a trailer. You can be 100% confident there is a twist somewhere that there is no way for you to know by the trailer
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,I'm on media blackout... Now
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Am I the only one who *doesn't* think they have been coy with Joel? I mean, he was in the very first reveal *""You sure you wanna go through with this?*"" trailer back in 2016, right?

The fans then went batshit sayin', ""Joel's dead!"" or ""It's his ghost!"" smh..."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,This is what I think. You’d think if she didn’t know she would be excited to see him. “WTF are you doing here” isn’t exactly a warm welcome...
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Yeah, the creative director for the first game said as much about the ending. He said Ellie never believed Joel’s lie, and decided she needed to make her own choices, so they end up parting ways."
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,I wouldn’t be able to guess mate; I’m currently at work too.
d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-25,"Horizon's gameplay in those terms is outstanding.  Its action isn't just ""look how well I dodged and smacked the enemy"", but instead a constant, on-the-fly, reactionary strategy.  It's like if you took Monster Hunter's ""hunting"" combat and combined with Zelda's ""puzzle"" combat.

I wish more games had you fight difficult foes in that manner, rather than just ""evade it and hit it a lot."""

d8svdg,2019-09-24,2019-09-24,">hard to comprehend that other people have different opinions

That seems awfully presumptuous. I enjoy a discussion and as such I enjoy when other people have different opinions than mine, otherwise it's an echo chamber and that's no fun. Sorry if I hurt your feelings or something but I was only looking for a discussion. If you don't want one than fair enough, but can you understand my misreading your intentions? When one asserts, ""x is shitty,"" that usually means they feel strongly enough about ""x"" to have a conversation. I played the game and thought it was pretty good, not masterpiece maybe but pretty good, and I was open to having my mind changed. Anyway, as you were."

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"""At its core, The Last of Us Part II is still very much about Ellie and Joel, but for this reveal, we wanted to showcase several new characters that are integral to their next journey. We’re sure you have many questions after watching this scene.

We’re also pretty sure that we’re going to see all sorts of theories about whom these characters are, where and when this scene takes place, and how all of this fits into Ellie and Joel’s next story. For now we’re keeping mum, but we’re excited to see what y’all make of this piece of the puzzle."""
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Can any beat Naughty Dog in the realistic human animation game? Touches like her nose bending as she picked her face up off the ground are perfect. The lighting and effects work is top notch as well.

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30, Curious where they will take the story. Maybe a cult is involved?

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,This was brutal.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Christmas 2018 or March 2019
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,That went super dark quick.. I want more 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,A huge amount of money + time + Naughty Dog equals The Last Of Us Part 2 equals Masterpiece. I'm afraid to imagine how much awards this game will win?
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,I'm thinking this cult was responsible for taking out Ellie and Joel's friends at the house from the first trailer and now they're getting revenge. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,I really hate how they announce a game generally 2 years before its released. Looking at you Days Gone.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,I never finished the first one. I should do that. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Fucking hell, the comments below the video are horrible. Worse thing is that they're actually serious."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,I don’t really like this “trailer”
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Not sure what to make of this trailer 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Man Naughty Dog games are some of the few I can still get excited for. The industry is getting so much worse IMO that it almost makes me give up on it but Naughty Dog reminds me why I fell in love with the hobby to begin with. I'm sure this game will be fantastic
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Incredible. The amount of tension within this scene is consuming. The cinematography on display is honestly second to none in the gaming industry and everything just builds so perfectly until the final frame. Naughty Dog are masterful at what they do.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,So is that an older Ellie?
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,That was fast
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Good thing they still got roids in the apocalypse.

Im actually excited its less Ellie/Joel.  Those two are perfection, and im so terrified this game is going to ruin what made the first so good."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,I mean it was cool but i want to see gameplay. Felt like i was watching walking dead or something. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Graphics look great, but I'm not hyped at all"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"OK, is this ingame grpahics or a renderfarm trailer?"

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Very cool.

But Naughty Dog. Can you do me a favor? If you're going to show of TLOU Part II again, can you show some gameplay?"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,I didn't know if this was a trailer for The Last of Us 2 or Outlast 2 when I was watching it.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Pretty sure that's not how nooses work.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Are those PS4 gameplay graphics or cut scene graphics?
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Man, when we were watching this live, we weren't even sure it was The Last of Us, (it is a fabulous trailer though) but damn was it brutal. And those clicker noises at the end gave me CHILLS, that's how traumatized I am by them. (Basement with the generator anybody, eh)

Really excited for this game, Naughty Dog has released nothing but gold, and The Last of Us is one of my top 10 games ever made. Can't wait."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Protip the youtube comment section is cancer
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,There will be like 5 men in this game and they will get their ass kicked by a 5 foot 2 girl. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Holy shit was that really ellie?

Edit: Okay, it sound like is a new character "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Kind of a meaningless trailer to be honest. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Could be Ellie's mom. Though I'm pretty sure she is assumed dead, right? Anyways it looks like the lady wanted to know about her ""womb"". Like she birthed someone who's immune."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Oh boy... 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Man, this game is really turning out to be great. The character switch sounds great."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Can't wait for this.   I'm gonna savor this one and try not to binge play it right away....crap I might have to replay the first one now.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,So we're playing a whole new set of characters? Nice!
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,How do you beat the first? Its like trying to one up Half-Life.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Is anyone else blown away by the cinematography?! It looks like something that Emmanuel Lubezki himself would shoot.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Ellie got dem man-arms
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"So I’m thinking of 2 ways the plot of TLOU2 could go:

1) Joel and Ellie’s story is done. The guitar trailer doesn’t support this, but this trailer introduces the new characters that are going to have to have a role in the story. We follow the 3 survivors seen in this trailer as they survive in another area of America. This separates them from Joel and Ellie’s story, and could have them going against a new threat we haven’t seen/heard of yet. This would need to be handled carefully though, since the basic rule of story telling is telling a story that NEEDS to be told. Naughty Dog isn’t stupid: they understand this and will most likely not go with the “rival survivor group” route a la The Walking Dead (TV). I’m hoping for a Firefly-like threat, but not an exact duplicate of the Fireflies.

2) We follow Joel and Ellie, and later in the story they run into these 3 characters. We stay in the general area of where TLOU1 left off, with maybe a road trip thrown in there for variety’s sake. Then they all either fight this group of crazy zealots or the above mentioned Firefly-like threat. The only difference between possibility 1 and 2 is that Joel and Ellie are the playable/main characters."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Let the circlejerk begin!
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Look, I love TLOU as much as you do. I love that it's gritty and real.

But this, out of context, felt like way too much. It felt like shock/torture porn. If we had more context, which we will when we play the game, it would warrant this scene.

This game will be incredible, don't get me wrong. But, especially when the past two weeks have been filled with violence against women, it just seems in bad taste."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Im gonna say it, I don’t care, that trailer was bad. 

The entire trailer had me wondering if it was even LoU. It didn’t feel like it, it didn’t look like it, it didn’t sound like it. The audience didn’t know either until the title popped up. 

It looked like Days Gone, and to me, thats a big mistake. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,I couldn’t watch 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Was this Ellie or not? I am confused and really cannot tell. She did not look like Ellie from the guitar trailer (maybe older?); but she did resemble Ashley Johnson a lot. She also looks a lot more built than I would imagine Ellie is going to be - however not impossible or unrealistic given her/their situation. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"What if Joel and Ellie are on the 'bad' side in this game? It seems weird that they are not the focus of a new trailer yet it feels like the woman being hung might be our new protagonist. It feels like something Naughty Dog would consider, I never wanted a sequel if it was just going to be Ellie and Joel on another road trip so I hope they might have a twist in regards to the characters"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Probably will get down voted for this but what happened to the sexual harassment allegations? Seems like they just swept it under the rug. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Well that was ... underwhelming :(
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"**My Theory**

Left without Marlene's leadership, it looks like the Fireflies broke down and a religious aspect took hold of the militant group. 

I still believe the plot will be that the group tracked down Joel and Ellie outside of Austin and attacked when the two weren't there abducting Ellie's child and killing her husband and everyone else there. Upon returning from a trade erran Joel and Ellie find their ""village"" razed and embark on a journey to hunt down the group and save Ellie's young child. 

This is like the two brothers, they're important side characters and that was a remnant of the Fireflies. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Big Last of Us fan, thoroughly put off by this trailer. I understand that Sony probably has a thorough marketing schedule and will actually show gameplay sooner or later, but it's just goofy that anyone thinks pre-rendered cutscenes are a good way to market a game. It probably works on a commercial level but it's creatively bankrupt. The longer they hold back on footage for gameplay that's more or less just gonna be run of the mill third person shooter gameplay, the less I'm interested."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd its time to buy a ps4 again.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"I can’t wait, the first one was amazing, by far the best mix of story,action,emotions and music in any game. 
Btw I forgot the girls name but damn she looks like a huge dude! "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Damn. I might actually bust out my PS4 again for this.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Why not just make a movie? Take away the beautiful graphics and it's just a run-of-the-mill 3rd person cover shooter. Same goes for Uncharted. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Where the microtransactions at tho?

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Her arms were very manly
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Will this one be as boring to play as the first? Also hopefully they have more different kinds of infected this time besides the ones you have to sneak by (clickers or something?) and the fattys.

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Oh look, another piece of media where the villain is a strawman representation of a religious person (and white, of course)."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Hopefully it's not as bad as the first one.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,I'd wager 2019 or later.

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"I think this was a flashback to toward the start of the outbreak of the disease. The woman who was tied up might be Ellie’s mom, who passed away after birthing Ellie. Hence why the clickers were referred to as demons. Not sure though, that’s just what I have been reading. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Keeping “mum” huh...? 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"My best guess is they've travelled to a region that contains factions with a more religious twist to them. Whatever reason it is that they are in that region will obviously remain to be seen, but the opposing factions these characters belong to will probably play an integral role in the story. Perhaps them finding out that Ellie is ""afflicted"" will have each faction scrambling to capture her either to ""kill"" her or deify her.

EDIT: I'm thinking in a somewhat similar vein to Outlast II, but it could go in any direction honestly. I'm excited either way though."

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,I guess I should finish the first one.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Is whom used right there?
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Wow. Dicks.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"> We’re also pretty sure that we’re going to see all sorts of theories about whom these characters are

Yeah, that's going to get really annoying after a while. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"I honestly don’t think so, TLOU was released in 2013 and the graphics honestly are still better than most stuff today without even being remastered. And with how good uncharted 4s graphics were... it’s gonna be amazing I’m sure. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"When she was laying on the ground after being cut down from the noose and the veins in her forehead were popping... it's just so much wow for me. It assists so much in the immersion of their games, I was holding my breath 3 or 4 times and the thing only lasts 5 minutes. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Currently, probably not; LA Noire's facial animation still looks great but the textures are still real blurry even in the remastered trailer.

Half-Life 2's were cutting edge for the time, but that was over 13 years ago (holy fuck 13 years).

There's a couple that come real close if not on par as Naughty Dog, though ND games typically have a lot more.

One things for sure: in-game graphics of any average game today beats all the pre rendered stuff from the 90s."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Naughty dog best animations in the biz
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Yes, studios like Blur look actually visually better than this

https://youtu.be/8F7OgOCzph4?t=6m7s

This is one of their animations from 3 years ago and it looks better than this"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,The facial animations in Injustice 2 are pretty damn good. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Hours spent making facial expressions look good: 99,999

Hours spent making that kids bowstring drawing arm look right: 15 minutes. Looked like Kermit the frog's anatomy."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Naughty Dog's animation is now totally in the uncanny valley for me, I was too focused on the faces looking off to pay attention to the events of this trailer."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"To be fair TLoU is a mediocre game with a worse story. The lack of depth made the game a total snooze fest to play through 😴

Therefore the characters  shouldn't matter too much. Just stick Chuck Norris as Joel and Bella Thorne as that red haired rodent and we're good for a sequel"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,The only time to be happy to see a goddamn clicker 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,But.... the title.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-11-03,where was this shown?
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Nah just Asian level
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Reminded me of Joel in the first one when he was torturing that guy.

""that's alright.  I believe him"""
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,oof ouch owie
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Yeah, no kidding. Oof. Naughty Dog making me *feel* those hits. Dang."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Just the kind of brutality I expect out of this series. Return to form, I see"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Then she acts like nothing happened, it was really jarring to me for some reason."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,The hammer kill shortly after was so satisfying. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,*woman's 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,I just got done playing Wolfenstein 2 and that trailer was even with the brutality. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,I don't think the trailer represents the gameplay graphics. This is a cinematic trailer.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,It's a cinematic trailer. It won't look like that. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,I'd say to watch it.  It's just a clip and doesn't reveal anything from what I saw.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,I would watch it if I were you. Not much going on in terms of spoilers. It's just a scene with some people we've never seen before. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,What's a GOAT
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"You will not be disappointed. It’s as brutal as it should be, without giving anything away. Whatever this new game is going to be about will be the perfect sequel. 

Definitely worth a watch"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Could be, or by wings they meant she was a firefly."

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,I was thinking the same thing.  She's built like an MMA fighter.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Same. Nothing like a girl built like a Disney princess fighting off multiple men built like UFC fighters to rip me out of the moment.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Yeah, I loved that."

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Yep, first thing I thoughts was ""I want her workout routine"" lol. Living in the apocalypse but straight up jacked."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Agree. Very toned.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Same.  I mean having a guy do shit that's not possible is one thing, but when it's some 100 pound woman, it somehow crosses the believability line as unfair as that sounds.  Good to see a woman depicted as what one might look that actually had to scrape a life together in tough times."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Hard times make women be like that. That's why they are so strong.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Relevant XKCD https://xkcd.com/311/
Comon you know you'd watch it anyway."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,The zombie ant mutant people keep the realism going for you though?
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Nothing makes me hate a comment more than when someone doesn't know the difference between 'then' and 'than'.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,">, nothing takes me out of a movie or game more **then** a 100 pound chick beating the shit out of everyone.

*than"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Nope, but they did show a persons arm getting busted. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,I skipped all the torture scenes. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,A dude in the back had some intestines hanging out.

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Noone here seems to get what you mean. This is exactly shot like Kojima shot MGS 5 sequences. I am calling it sequences since he did everything in one shot moving the camera constantly into new perspectives without having to cut.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Which is a bad thing
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"When you're living a life like that, it's survival of the fittest."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Of course. It's a game also starring Troy Baker. Bailey has to be there, I think it's in their contracts."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,I mean they were both in the original trailer...
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Yeah, my first thought was ""why the fuck are they stringing people up?"""
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,What was better before then?
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,But not the most important characters name :(
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Buff chick is Jaina Proudmoore. Obviously.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"That's the one problem I have with this so far. It's such a tired cliche.

I'm sure ND knows what they're doing though. They haven't disappointed us before."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,At least make it Muslim or Jewish or some weird cult like Scientology

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,The first one was kind of brutal in its own emotional way. Looks line it's time fore some physical pain !
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-11-01,Found one link where they were better. Got Whiplash switching too this link.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Please fix this.
"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"If you have a PS4 it's $20 to download it.  You won't regret it.

Just checked and if you have PS Plus it's only $10."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,FUCKING MASTERPIECE. not exaggerating. If you have a ps3 or 4 you are doing yourself a disservice by not playing. It's not too long either ~10-12 hours. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,If there was one game that I could recommend to people it would be this one. The last of us is literally a masterpiece that is head and shoulders above the rest as the best game of all time to me. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Very fun game.  Highly recommend.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,TLoU is the best game I've ever played.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,play it if you can. It's a work of art.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,I agree with the Polygon article. The excessive gruesome violence is unnecesary.  Same reason I stopped watching Walking Dead when they introduced Negan.  If you can't sell a story without resorting to shock tactics then maybe you need to write a better story.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Anyone who can afford an up to date PC can afford a ps4...
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,How come? 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,No.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Based on the in-game clips in UC4 I guess real time with toned down rendering when you play.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Was Ellie even in this trailer though...
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,No release date. Also it doesn't spoil any of the story at all. In truth it raises more questions than answers. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Sadly, no"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"No chance, friend. These will remain on consoles forever. :("
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-11-05,"In game cutscene, gameplay will look similar to this. Reference: Uncharted 4"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,No it was a new character
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Just speculation, but it could be her mother from before Ellie was ~~porn~~  
Edit: born LMFAO"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,They said they're just introducing some new characters in this trailer. Whether they're playable or not has not been revealed.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,But... Half life was one uped by half life 2.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,That's not Ellie.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"""At its core, The Last of Us Part II is still very much about Ellie and Joel, but for this reveal, we wanted to showcase several new characters that are integral to their next journey.""

"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"The music was totally TLOU, same goes with the brutality and everything else. 

The goal of this is to create more questions than answers, and they accomplished that. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"The ending made it look like Days Gone, but I think that is the point though. They are SLOWLY taking their time with marketing this game because in reality they really don't need to. I  had a feeling they were going to show new characters in a trailer. In reality, we are going to forget about this trailer when more videos come into the light and the same with Days Gone. It is VERy hard to make a trailer a mistake trailer. The first trailer of Dead Island was a big mistake, I don't know too many games that the first trailer ruined the game in the long run. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"I think they did that on purpose, it's not ment to be obvious that its TLOU 2"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,What made it look like Days Gone?
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,It's not ellie
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"I'd assume, as with any company, it is being dealt with internally and privately as it should be. Why should the public have any knowledge of an ongoing investigation (if there is one) before an outcome is determined? "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Allegations are allegations. No proof so I give no shits
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Well elaborated 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"You're making a LOT of assumptions. Like, a lot a lot."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Ellie is a lesbian tho?
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Do you forget how they marketed the first game? They didn't even have pre-rendered cutscenes for the longest time. It was just footage of ants/zombie-ants. There wasn't a lick of information about the game but that marketing strategy amped up a lot of people and garnered a lot of attention when they did release footage from the game.

I think Naughty Dog knows what they're doing. There's nothing wrong with pre-rendered cutscenes. That's been the industry standard for the last 20 years. They're just teasing us with tiny bits of content to get the hype going for what promises to be another amazing game from Naughty Dog. They don't do crap so there's no reason to lose interest. The longer they take to release the better the game will be."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Considering a big part of the game is cutscenes I don't mind. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"I don't even get you reservations. When has ND ever dissapointed you when it came to TLOU or Uncharted? TLOU will not be a run of the mill 3rd person shooter, I can guarantee you that"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"If you're playing The Last of Us for the gameplay you're doing it wrong.

And this is the second trailer for a story based game, it's hardly surprising that we got to see a cutscene. Actual gameplay footage usually follows closer to release."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Then fuck off and cry elsewhere?
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Lol
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,who said that? this the smallest snippet of gameplay you cant tell anything from this
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,So the entire game happens at night and around a campfire?   Welp color me uninterested.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Then don't buy it twat.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Username checks out...
"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,If it's out by Christmas 2018 that would be perfect.  I'd obviously prefer they take their time though to make the best game possible.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Didn't they postpone the first one? 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"I seriously hope you're right, I can avoid buying a ps5 altogether if that's the case "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Oh hi Mark
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,This is a thing that actually exists though.

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,remember in TLoU 1 we traveled to 4+ completely different regions in the game.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"I'm thinking this is a flashback from before, or soon after, the safe zones were set up. This cult is clearly religious. And that woman (played by, of course, Laura Bailey) is Ellie's mom."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Quite a far way aways from ""Definitely"" I wouldn't be at all shocked if Naughty Dog released it this way deliberately to make people think that.

"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Hanged guy the camera pans up to also has his stomach slashed open, could just be their way of killing people."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"You conspiracy nuts do realize that the guy who was hanged in that scene also had his stomach cut there, right?"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Nope
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,in game graphics are different then rendered cutscenes though. Assuming these are rendered
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"LA Noire looked really weird with those great facial animations mixed up with those blurry textures. Too shame, cause it would do much better with better textures.

Yes, remaster is coming out, but too late and not even better textures for PC. Classic R*."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Blur does incredible work but it's a whole different ball game. Blur makes highly polished rendered animated shorts which gives a lot more room and freedom to rig and animate, not to mention light. Naughty Dog's work is all realtime in-engine which is just a whole other level of difficulty. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"This. Most animations were terrific, some mediocre at best. I am referring to the two men dragging a body builder like she weighs 20 kilos, the man pulling the noose (again like she weighs nothing), the kid cutting the rope, the kid drawing the bow. On an unrelated note, I also found the sound of the hammer hitting the woman's arm really unrealistic. It's almost as if he were hitting chainmail..."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Haha, what."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"I can see you're getting downvoted for this, but for what it's worth I agree with you. I'm not denying that the animations are super technically accomplished and miles ahead of the first game, but same as you I feel like they've now landed squarely in uncanny valley territory."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,The sound sends chills down my spine.

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,I started howling and clapping and shit at that scene. Joel is a cold mother fucker.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,One of my favorite scenes in the whole game. Made Taken’s interrogation scene look like a light slap on the wrist.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Joel is highkey a badass

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"It wont be far off, considering it's naughty dog."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"I wonder how many times I will catch myself with... ""och, I'm in control again - the cutscene has ended"". Happened to me plenty of times in Uncharted 4."

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"in Slovak, it is figure of speech, ""to cut the wings"". But yeah, could also work for fireflies."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Given the religious connotations, could be a 'fallen angel' sort of situation."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,I didn't even think of that!
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"See, I feel like that could really happen. Religion has been a part of our history since... forever. I think if something like this ever happened, a lot of people would turn to religion."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,If your religion mirrors anything from this video then it probably should have a negative light cast on it.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"If you see anything close to your religion in this clip, maybe that's the problem.

Its not like when real-life cults do crazy shit, everyone blames the Pope."

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Definitely a cult.  Probably some group down south who's convinced that God caused the plague for some reason.

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,-said no one ever
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Please know the difference between a teaser and a trailer
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Good question... I picked 10 years arbitrarily. 

I think the last game that got me really wrapped up in the story was the original Half-Life and it's expansions. As well as 2 I suppose. But for the time, the original consumed my life like no game really had before. 

I honestly have a very hard time immersing myself in games. So when it does happen it's pretty special. I bought Sleeping Dogs on steam the other day on a whim because it was like $5, but I can't even bring myself to open it. Can't even explain why. But this happens often. I know it's a great game too."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"I'm not sure who you are talking about. 

*Edit: I finally noticed that the name is blacked out and Laura is the actress's name.*"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,It's gotta be Anna :~)
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,The Bride
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"It is a cliche that makes sense though. Religions spend a lot of time concerning themselves with the apocalypse. Eschatology is huge in religious studies. It makes sense that certain people will lean heavily on their faith to explain why the world is the way it is, and to guide them going forward. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Well we got like, a three second bible verse and an apostate reference. She could just be a nut, in the same vein as Jared Letos character in Blade Runner. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"I mean zombie game was also a tired cliche.  As long as it's the setting or central conflict of the world rather than the focus of the story, cliche is good.  It means they don't have to devote much of the script to explaining it and can focus on the story they want to tell."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,The setting is the US though where Christians are the overwhelming majority. It makes only makes sense with how the Bible ends with the apocalypse & the coming of Jesus.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"we still might see some flashback. I mean, this woman looks a bit similar to Ellie from TLOU2 teaser and in this video that woman was about to cut her unborn child from her, so we may presume it could be Ellie.

Also what was Kratos´ son doing there? Came to say hello from another trailer? hehe"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"I think at this point its just become a jokey meme with little jabs, nowhere near as serious or heated as it was between PS3 and X360."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Sometimes you find a win where you can no matter how pointless it is. 

Look at sports, a bunch of millionaires who aren't even from the area's they play for but everyone is rallied behind them like it means something for any of them. "

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Yeah but maybe not both. At least me :(
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"I can understand it - it's quite confrontational. The series itself is, but if you're not up to date on it (or even if you are, it's been a few years and time does dim the memory), it can be a bit of a shock."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Personaly, got some TWD stench from it. Semi religious quirky groups and all that."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"oh no!!, I think I'll have to buy a PS4 Console then.  :("
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-11-05,Thanks for the reply! Hoping to upgrade to a Pro this fall :) 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Yeah, remember, Ellie now has the floral tattoo on her forearm now. First thing I looked for. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Lmfao

Before Ellie was porn

I’m laughing at work thanks "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"This make sense because it's slightly implied the woman is pregnant. Could explain ellies immunity.

Wild guess, ellies mom got pregnant from some sort of mutated half infected man she loved. Ellie was born with immunity."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Wow...that last word there...

I mean I know Rule 34 but yeah"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Actually... you're correct.. maybe thats why they dont bother will HL3 because its impossible
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Oh shit lol who the hell is it then??
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Oh sorry I didn’t see that lol. Thanks for the info!
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,The first trailer did exactly that in a better way. This was just confusing and seemed like an afterthought. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"The use of wet deep forests and hanging people (the last trailer reveal for Days Gone actually brought out real hanging people for the audience)

The muddy and orange color palette (Last of Us used more of a green and yellow color)

No recognizable characters or signals (no fireflies, no fungus, no guitar music) "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"I just hope something is being done, that statement they put out was pretty lame. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Man you mother fuckers are cold, no wonder it difficult for people to come out with this stuff. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,I'm saying it's a theory not the correct plot. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-11-01,Or Bisexual. People keep forgetting they exist.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Well that's one hell of a hole.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Maybe she just dabbled?
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Never cared for Uncharted, even having played 2 and 3. But yeah, in terms of gameplay unfortunately that's an area where The Last of Us is a mostly unremarkable third person shooter. In fact the mobility of Uncharted actually makes it more impressive to me, although not by much. That was always a disappointment for me. I don't expect 2 to raise the bar much higher but I'm optimistic even in spite of what I think is a silly lack of gameplay footage. The storytelling is compelling and the art direction in the first game is good, and I didn't see much of that in this clip.

If this is just how they market the games(don't recall the marketing for the first one besides the initial teaser with joel interrogating the guy), that's fine. I just didn't find this clip compelling on any of the levels that made the first one compelling to me. If that offends people, I'm sorry."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"> If you're playing The Last of Us for the gameplay you're doing it wrong.

Don't presume to claim that there's a right or wrong way to enjoy a game, that's just silly. 

If you're marketing a game without its gameplay, you're doing it wrong. I don't see Scorsese marketing his films with still shots of the screenplays or storyboards, because those aren't films. Pre-rendered cutscenes are not games. Gameplay is what makes games what they are, so marketing campaigns that seek primarily to advertise things *other than gameplay* are doing the game a disservice and actively dissuading people who care about gameplay first and foremost. Not sure what it is about that sentiment that seems to be hurting feelings, as it's an extremely common criticism of game trailers.

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Both the Last of Us (first) and Uncharted 4 release their debut trailer 2 year before release. if Last of Us 2 follows the same timeframe, it should be out 2018. Most likely Holiday time."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,The first game came out in June I think? Around e3 during the summer. Considering it's only the second trailer and it's just a cinematic with no gameplay I wouldn't expect it at all next year.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Only by a month.  UC4 got delayed by half a year.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"It's a shame that the PS5 coming out is already such a realistic claim, and chances are it won't be coming out on PC either"

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"I just meant the phrasing could be a hint as to who one of the characters is! “Mum”—>”mom”—>”Ellie’s mom” Then again, he could just be messing with us."

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,You mean the safe town were Tommy went? That would be intense! But the grittiness of this serious is what makes it so good.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Definitely is
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,That was true on PS3 but on Uncharted 4 everything was rendered in front of you. I noticed the transitions seemed really good and then I noticed there was no cutscene viewer like before. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Almost no games use pre-rendered cutscenes anymore.

That being said, this game is in super early production and I can guarantee this is a pre-rendered animation and not from in game.
"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,it'll get a non VR PC port in a year after launch. Rockstar is greedy in the sense they want you to buy more variations of the copy instead of gyping you
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Yeah it is insanely impressive in ingame cutscenes they are the best no doubt
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"This trailer's facial animation was in the [uncanny valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) for me. I was too distracted by how weird the faces were to pay much attention to what was going on.


Uncanny valley is a subjective thing, so you might not see it."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"And yet, a warm sense of nostalgia. "

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,You could reason that she somewhat ignored it because of adrenaline and maybe.. just maybe because she had to kill that other bitch to survive.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Adrenaline and shock are a hell of a combination. Speaking from experience, I have had bones broken and didn't feel the full pain until later on."

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Uncharted 4 was probably the best looking game I've ever played. I think The Last of Us 2 will be just fine in the graphics department.

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Exactly the opposite.  They are casting a bad light on exactly what religions need to avoid murdering people: structure, dogma, and public beliefs.  Those are needed to use terms like apostate.  "

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Since it’s tacky and amateur 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,A teaser and trailer are about as different as a beta and a demo in the modern videogame industry.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"If you don't mind retro and haven't played them already, check out Chrono Trigger and FF6 (3 as USA original release). Two of my all-time favorites with fantastic story, music, characters, and more."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-11-21,Playing Sleeping Dogs is like being in a 90's John Woo Hong Kong action movie. Definitely in my top games with TLOU
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"She's dead tho, from the first TLoU."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Beyond this, religion is a way to understand death. There was a study that found that those who were exposed (I.e. reminded) to death immediately and uncompromising clung to their belief systems. If you're exposed to death daily, you're going to need a belief system to cling to to cope. Religion fills that void for many."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"He isnt saying if it makes sense or not. He is saying its a tired cliche, I agree. Its seems like its one of 50 this year to have it."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,But still a cliche. It would be better to try to re interpret the role. Make them the victims instead of the guys in power or something new. I felt like watching some resident evil type of post apocalyptic world instead of tlof world. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Well, Leto's character acted that way because he realized he was making *people* and saw himself as challenging God, especially since he kind of delayed the apocalypse.  I doubt that's the case here, so probably a cult."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,[removed]
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"I don't think the woman was pregnant. Unless i missed something in the trailer explicitly stating it.

Given where she was going to be hung it was most likely a tree meant for heretics and sinners who could not repent.

edit: given the girls reflexes and how she ""snuck up"" on her executioner while being hung i'd wager its ellie."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,I guess you weren't around during the SNES/Genesis days. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,I'd say PS2 and Xbox was even more heated. They were the last two fighters in the console wars for sure.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Hah, if only. Some really salty, aggressive fanboys on Youtube, what used to be Neogaff, Destructoid and such. Obviously some from the Xbox side as well but the majority of the time when seeing it on a Nintendo or Xbox article, it's been PlayStation fans since the PS3."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,I wish I had time to play through it for a third time.

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,Yea for me it's this and Red Dead Redemption that teeter back and forth between #1 and 2 depending on which one I played the most recently usually. Right now it's the Last of Us. Really just so good.

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Not confirmed yet, Naughty Dog didn't give us her name but confirmed she's being played by Laura Bailey."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Why should I believe an allegation with no support? Compassion? Alright, let’s just start jailing people based on baseless allegations. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"The whole point of the game is the story, all the gameplay and combat exists purely as a vehicle for the story."

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Well the way he said it makes it seems like he's using ""mum"" to mean quiet like the phrase ""Mum's the word."" I guess we can't know for sure but on twitter they revealed the names of some of the new characters and I think one is heavily speculated to be Ellie's mom since she's the only one they didn't reveal the name of. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Neil Druckman the director confirmed this is an in game cutscene 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Yeah dude, I know what the uncanny valley is. 

Naughy Dog is the single best developer on a technical level when it comes to animations in video games. To say that their animations fall into the uncanny valley is to say that every single animation in every single video game is utter dogshit.

What I'm trying to say is: your statement is ludicrous. 

Besides: [This is what uncanny valley territory ACTUALLY looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNeg7CJBME), not what's being shown in this trailer, which is nigh-on movie-level CGI. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Yeah, but, like... part of the point of that scene was to make you start to consider that Joel's only alive because he's hardly any better.  Yes, he cares about Ellie, which makes us empathize with him, but he's also become a pretty f*ked up person who clearly enjoys killing people in brutal ways at this point.  By the end of the game I felt that it's big achievement was making me root for a guy who, in his own way, is a selfish bastard.  I think Ellie feels the same way.  She definitely knows what actually happened, but she forgives him, because she understands why he's so protective."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-11-20,"Yeah right. Dwindling resources, lack of actual food and being stuck in a large settlement for the winter? Of course they're gonna be cannibals. Doesn't make them any less shitty, but that doesn't justify his torture either. Joel's hardly any better than them.

But whatever, keep telling yourself that if that makes you feel better about yourself."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Yeah I just rewatched, what a beautifully brutal scene. Almost makes the end predictable."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,Then chin-checks him. Love it.

I did sink a fair bit of time into BF1. But I think that's just because I have a need to unlock everything in games. Once I do I no longer have a personal objective and abandon them. "

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"It was officially said it was different people. So it is officially not Ellie.

And yeah, they were gutting more people, even guys, but from what she was saying, it felt like she wanted to cut out some fetus or something."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,I only played it once a whole year ago...conpletely forgot almost all of the story line so I'm stoked to go through it a 2nd time. Should I just man up and go for hardest difficulty?
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-11-01,Actually I prefer Mad Max: Fury Road. History of Violence. Gladiator. Robocop. Oldboy (Korean Version) and so on. All violent all have good stories. No hard feelings :)

Hoping for some bumper Black Friday console deals. A few already out there but not yet :)"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"lol somebody had downvoted you to 0 for saying ""that's not Ellie"".... wtf? Anyway, thanks for the info. She looks to be a badass new character!"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Definitely Compassion, I never said to arrest anybody without investigation. You can take something seriously without wholeheartedly believing. You can be skeptical. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"I understand that. I mentioned above that it's only really the art direction and story that I think are remarkable. That said, I still want to see gameplay. Everything else falls apart without the gameplay. Strip out the gameplay and The Last of Us just becomes a tropey, less emotional retread of the Road and many other post-apocalyptic stories that did it better long ago. It fails without the gameplay and art direction driving it, I think. It's great if you think the game can stand on the merits of its story alone, but I don't feel that way. Consequently this clip isn't grabbing me."

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Yeah i'd say most likely another 1.5-2 years, as there's a massive weight on them and next year will be gameplay. GTA/UC are probably the only other nonNintendo series where fans expect a solid genre defining 10. "
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,I'll ignore that and anticipate a 2018 release ;)

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,I was wrong. Good to know though.
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Whether or not something is in the uncanny valley is entirely up to an individual viewer. The uncanny valley effect is more likely the better animated something is, since the effect is caused by something being almost near photo realistic."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-11-20,"I most certainly didn't root for him one bit. Hated the game for making me play as him towards the end. He even took advantage of someone who gave him a chance.

Hundreds of families who are gonna have to continue to live in danger, horror and violence thanks to him and his selfish decision. The entire fucking planet will continue to be hell because of his decision. I'm sorry, his inability to get over his daughter's death is a tiny little problem compared to fucking over all of humanity.

I hope ellie gets to decide the fate of her life herself this time around. Either that or the game shows the consequences of Joel's actions, i.e., everyone is gonna fucking hate him."

> Plenty of terrible people have used words from the Bible.  
  
Which is like .01% of Christians, yet what percentage of characters in games are religious and terrible?  Seems to be like 90%.  Then of that 10%, most are anti-structural.  "

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,If you're going for purely the challenge yes. If you wanna enjoy the story at all NO. It took me forever to finish it on Grounded mode on my second playthrough since I'd get burned out and take like a week or 2 break after dying 30 times on one part (I felt amazing when I finally beat it though) . I'd say Survivor mode is the highest one you should do.

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"Just my personal experience with the hardware. I bought a launch model (when the buttons were heat sensitive and not actual buttons) and over the years I've had a lot of occurrences of my system resetting itself, or spitting my discs out mid game, or even turning itself on when its not in use and then spitting my discs out. Sometimes it will randomly start beeping even when switched off. Just yeah really disappointed with the hardware quality wise."

79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"exactly! obviously they meant keeping quiet, but the use of “mum” as opposed to “quiet” was the curious part.... it could be a double meaning was all i meant"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,It's still probably in-engine instead of pre-rendered. 
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"Again, ridiculous. This is 1:1 facial CAPTURE. This isn't even animation in the strictest of senses. Point being, it's you, not the game."

Park Ma Plen Tu-Sun"
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-31,"90%?! Is that a joke?

There's just so much wrong with everything you've been saying.

1. Religion has clearly been abused, including by the Catholic Church, to commit violence.

2. All video games have someone going to extremes. How else would you have reasons for the setting? There are also an abnormal number of doctors and scientists doing terrible things in video games. Does that mean games are anti-medicine or anti-science?

3. It's the goddamn apocalypse. Acting like video games created or are a particularly large portrayer of ""crazy religion in the post-apocalypse"" is absurd. It's a trope that's been around for forever. Hell, even in real life most cults are apocalyptic.

Stop acting like a victim just cuz your group is now the target. How much media shows black people or Italians as gangsters? Or businessmen/lawyers/etc. as corrupt and evil? Muslims as terrorists? All of these are similar percentages in real lifeas to how you're describing Christians. And that's not even mentioning the vast majority of media that shows passionate examples of the caring pastor, or the person saved through their faith, etc.

Media with an excuse for violence always takes certain groups to extremes. Acting like there's a particular targeting of Christians is insane."
79oyew,2017-10-30,2017-10-30,"yeah and that definition is archaic and you're using it to infer that physical strength and the appearance of it isn't inherently feminine lol

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Got curious about this and did a little counting. Of the publishers that have gotten more than one nomination for ""Game of the Year"" at TGA, the list looks like this:

\- Sony: 13

\- Nintendo: 10

\- Bethesda: 4

\- Capcom: 4

\- FromSoftware: 4

\- EA: 3

\- Atlus: 2

\- Blizzard: 2

\- Square Enix: 2

Fromsoft self-publishes in Japan so I went ahead and counted their Namco and Activision international releases as their own games. If we went by developer instead of publisher, Bloodborne would also be theirs but the whole list would look very different.

Also split the companies that publish under multiple labels. Xbox, Activision, Blizzard and Bethesda were counted separately and the same goes for Rockstar, 2K and Private Division."

They've been doing just fine since the PS1 days.

As a Nintendo fan, I'm actually proud of Sony for releasing great games to this point, because this makes for a great rivalry and competition in the gaming industry. For me, I have way more respect for Sony and Microsoft than any 3rd-party dev.

For goodness sake, they've humanized Kratos, they've surprised Japanese historians with Ghost, gave us TWO stellar Spider-Man games when the series had dropped stinkers up to that point, Aloy became a very likeable character in Sony's portfolio and now they're competing for GOTY with a child-friendly robot whose purpose is to make players experience all of the Playstation's features.

No joke, good on them :D"

Nothing in 2009 from them, but 2008 had LittleBigPlanet and Metal Gear Solid 4 which isn't owned by Sony, but was a Playstation exclusive and was directed by Kojima who also did Death Stranding of course. Sony has done well at the VGAs for a long time now."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Some absolutely phenomenal games there
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Come on, Sony. Bloodborne will be 10 years old next year. Maybe it's time to release a sequel."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I’ve taken single player gaming more serious over the past couple of years and it’s the best thing I’ve ever done.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,God there are some absolute gems on here.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,You can hate Sony but they are vital for the gaming industry
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ghost of Tsushima was so fucking good. Underrated multiplayer too.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"...the fuck, bloodborne is 10 years old?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bring Astro bot to pc!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne turns 10 next year so my copium levels are nearly through the roof as I pretend that means we get a remaster.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Good fucking God, Bloodborne was 10 years ago???"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Over 10 years. TLOU won 2013, journey won 2012. Uncharted was nominated in 2011... It goes on"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,ohh my beloved bloodborne
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,just want to say that astro bot is awesome and I was happy to vote for it.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart was robbed!!!!!!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Horizon was so fucking good but had the misfortune of being released the same year as Breath of The Wild.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They make good shit
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,We have been so spoiled since the PS4 released.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Microsoft can learn from this.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Man, I love Ratchet and Clank. Been playing those games half my life."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sony really love Horizon series huh?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Just finished R&C Rifts apart on PC
Maaan, I'm a middle aged man but this game turned me intoy childhood. Such a pure, innocent fun with astonishing graphics and lovely characters.
I want more of this!"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"All of those games are really good, so they deserve the game nomination"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I’m an old guy I don’t really like cutesy cartoon games, but after seeing Astro Bot as game of the year, I decided to check it out. Wow! So fun and creative, and no one has come close to leveraging the Dual Sense like this game has. It really is a love letter to the PlayStation."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,That 2015 game looks interesting. I wonder if there’s a remaster of it
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And if there was a worst game of the year, SONY will probably have a nominee for those every year as well."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They pay for it
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,They havent made any of those games. They pay studios to make games which they then sell.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"ive never played any of these games, am i missing out or not"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I suspect bribes. ""Death Stranding"" was a lot of things. GoTY candidate it was not."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Should Death Stranding really qualify?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Does Death Stranding still count now that Kojima bought the rights back so he could release it on Xbox?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Was death stranding worth it? Never played it. Genuine question, I'm looking for good solo games"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Astro BOT is so boring! A ""cheap"" game that's not worth it."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Is this not like all other industries where you just fill out a form and pay a fee to get nominated for industry awards?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,How the heck did Death Stranding sneak in? That game was a turd.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Cool but Forbidden West does not qualify as a GOTY nominee on the grounds that it's a sequel which is inferior to the first.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,This would be like saying I won a popularity contest every year when my mom is the judge. Those fake awards are Sony bias.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I wouldn't count studios that they don't own as PlayStation
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"13 games listed, and if I'm being generous, maybe about four of them are actually worth playing."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,And only one of those games actually deserved the nomination lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,but wins nothing
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,Idgaf about those snobs at Gaming Awards
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"you see that 2015 game, do that again please."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Red Dead Redemption 2 not winning GOTY still pisses me off so much
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Shouldn’t rebirth be listed here too? I know it’s square enix but it’s still a ps5 exclusive the same way bloodborne is a ps4 exclusive despite being made by fromsoft.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,AstroBot's gonna win this year. For sure.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Honestly some of these being up there feels in support of the idea that nominations are rigged and that Geoff just wants a designated “Sony” spot to ensure they keep supporting and show up to the event. Ratchet and clank was not a top tier game and uncharted and death stranding were so niche in their audiences that they feel forced. One of my biggest problems with the game awards rn is how token a lot of the category nominations feel. There’s always the token Indy, token Sony, token PC game and then the 2-3 games that actually got the most attention buzz surrounding them that actually will likely win. Then they have 16 categories so every triple A game can get something despite the title really grasping at straws."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Hot take: All of these are mid
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"A. The ""nominees"" are chosen by industry shills.

B. That doesn't make them good games.

C. GOTY isn't a real thing. It's a popularity contest decided by industry shills.

D. Sony didn't make Death Stranding or Bloodborne.

I own every single one of these games. I've played all of them, more than once. The second time was only because of PC releases so I could get the achievements. They aren't experiences I'm desperate to have again, though I will definitely buy Ghost of Yotei, Venom and whatever Naughty Dogs next game is (assuming they don't somehow fail to deliver a very well produced game.)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They deliver but I still don’t like PS exclusives games, im glad final fantasy will no longer be a PS exclusive."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Looking at the nominations for GOTY this year Astro Bot is the clear winner for me. Team Asobi taking an already great game in Astros Playroom and somehow improving just about every part of the gameplay is a rare achievement in game development these days
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Well considering there are probably 100s of publications giving out GOTY awards that’s pretty meaningless.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Because the whole thing is pay to win advertising.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yes, PlayStation pays to have a goty nominee every year."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,wow this is some serious glazing
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,DEATH STRANDING is Playstation?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Literally every game is a GOTY Nominee/winner somewhere.. this isn't an achievement (got nothing against those games just that this ""stat"" is worthless)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Same goes for PC, not sure what the big deal is."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Astro Bot is good, but it's hard to believe there wasn't any other game this year that would take that spot."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's pretty wild when it's listed like this. What an absolute banger list of games they've put out over the years.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Shows how good Sony’s first party games are.

I’ve bought most of Sony’s Steam releases."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Well it is the Sony awards.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ghost of Tsushima is such a good game
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Uncharted 4 should have won that year
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"From 2020 onward, only sequels.."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The Last Of Us 2 ♥️
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Breaking News: major game company makes games.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Yet only two were actually exclusive to Playstation, so what's your point?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Okay, what even is Astro Bot? I know every other game but I've not even heard of Astro Bot until it came out and every game journalism gave it 9s and 10s. 

Does it play like Little Big Planet?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Okay how many of them won?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Meanwhile Xbox hasn't had a single GOTY nominee in the past decade.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I'm not surprised since a lot of sony's games are the Oscar bait of gaming. I'm not hating though, they're generally good games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's honestly insane that God of War actually beat Red Dead Redemption 2 for GOTY in 2018. God of War really hasn't aged well with its level design and Ragnarok was a huge step down. Meanwhile, people are still discovering amazing NPC and world interactions in Red Dead Redemption 2 over 6 years later."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Helldivers 2 should have been there as well
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They make good games

Too bad they also force me to join PSN on my PC to play any of them"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I was about to say ""where the hell is Returnal ?"" but I realised it wasn't nominated as Game of The Year. Damn, the public was rude with this one."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"With my new PC I plan to build in Spring next year, I can't wait to tackle all the PlayStation games I missed:

God of War (2018)  
Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection  
Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart  
Horizon Forbidden West  
Ghost of Tsushima  
God of War Ragnarök  
Spider-Man 2

I really hope Astro comes to PC as well next year since I love 3D platformers."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Almost like Sony makes good games
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne is still the best game on that list as far as I'm concerned. And not even ""for it's time"". I mean it's STILL the best game.


Edit: downvoted for having an opinion? Fucks sake "
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Longer than a decade
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Feel old now.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"In 2025, let’s bring it full-circle with ‘Bloodborne II’."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Tbf all of those are bangers. The 2 that maaaaybe wouldn't deserve to be nominated are ratchet and clanck and astrobot.and even they as far as i know they are really good games, i just haven't heard that much about them"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What about ff7 rebirth? Isn't that PlayStation?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You can't be telling me that God of War, Spiderman, and Horizon Zero Dawn are from 2018 and 2017 💀"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I’d hope so. They’re the second biggest gaming company in the world lol 
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Anyone else get floored by the PS1 startup sound? I don't want it to go away, best console startup sound ever."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Lack of a nom for returnal in 2021 is criminal
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Games were nominated and won game of the year selected by people
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,9 years and i'm still hoping for a Bloodborne PC release :-/
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Isn't that a given that the platform has a nominee for goty? Why would they not have a nominee? That's like a political party not having a nominee during an election.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And that is why the PS5 Pro is $700. You want quality games, get ready for a quality monopoly. - Sony Executive probably."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They make a certain type of games that attract you or not. 
Noy sure if I would spend money on any of these games. 


But I'm also not such a hardcore single player story fan."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"What is that game at the bottom? It looks funny, like it doesn’t exist anymore."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean, obviously? They're one of the largest video game manufacturers in the world lol"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Rift Apart still feels like the only next gen game on that list.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I hope Astro Bot also releases on PC
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,GOW:R changed my perception on single player games. I was almost exclusively a multiplayer / competitive gaming person but this game was insane
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And here are the first-party/independent developers of these games:

###Astro Bot
Team Asobi

###Spider-man 1 and 2, Ratchet and Clank
Insomniac

###Horizon games

###God of War games
Santa Monica

###Death Stranding
Kojima

###Uncharted 4 and The Last of Us II
Naughty Dog


###Bloodborne
FromSoftware"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Yeah but how many actually won? Not being condescending just genuinely curious
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne is due for a remake.

Seriously. 

If Sony can get Bluepoint to remake Demon's Souls (and quite excellently at that) then surely we can get the same treatment for Bloodborne? 

It's probably some sort of licensing quagmire but if there's a will, there's a way, as the old saying goes so hopefully it happens.

At some point.

Yeah. 😒"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Man im behind. I have played none of these except bloodborne.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2015 was almost a decade avo excuse me while i enjoy cobains last meal ye ole 12ga
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Uncharted 4 should have won!

\-Sony"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"2024 should have FFVII Rebirth as well. It may be a temporary exclusive game, but so are some other games here like Horizon or God of War."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Xbox could have won it all if they stopped being cowards and made a Third Viva Piñata
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Couldn't even vote for most of these games cause I don't own a playstation. It's been getting better over the years but seriously give me bloodborn!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Most of them are available on PC.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I feel this is like congratulating a movie theater for showing Oscar-nominated movies.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Is Astro Bot really that good?  I have read such high praise for this game, but the only console exclusives I have played in ages are those that trickle their way onto PC."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,goty from one random outlet that is meaningless

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Your title says Playstation but you mean ""Sony"".  Playstation having a nominee every year is not remarkable as there are only 3 consoles and PC and like 5 nominations.  But Sony as a publisher is different."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Astro Bot and Bloodborne are the only two not on PC yet. Death Stranding is the only one that (just recently) came to Xbox, but that's because of ownership change. Would it even be considered a PS title anymore, technically?"

Ratchet and Clank is probably the first game series i fell in love with, and I'd love to replay the old ones and/or play the newest one. I have both Xbox One and PC."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Only one of these is a standalone with no prequel or sequel. Sony we need to change that
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sooo  one of the most dominant gaming consoles in the last two decades paid had games of the year published on their platform?   What a nothing burger.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PS4 games and their sequels more or less, Sony needs to get some new ips in the mix, or maybe revive some more ps3 era ips."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"not to rain on the parade, but Sony is one of the biggest distributors/developers/whatever, where one of the 4 console (including pc) choices are made by them. 

idk how many nominees there are in total, but if they werent getting 1/4 of them every year i'd be surprised"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Mmmmmmmm…
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,yeah I probably should have bought a play station back in 2015
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Astro Bot is just Mario Galaxy.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why did they stop at 2015? Seems like they had some in 2014 too ...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"That's because Sony is a whole ass platform that farms out a bunch of games, and the rest are typically made by individual publishers who make a game every few years (outside of the yearly garbage like CoD, FIFA, etc)."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"That Forbidden West banner is a little baffling.  You can't make the protagonist look like that no matter what camera angle or post-processing you use, so I guess they just reused an asset from the first game."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Fun fact, every single game on this list other than the newest, and bloodborne, have either come to PC or are scheduled to come to PC soon"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I think playstation has perfected the third person action game
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And yet no Bloodborne 2 😔
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The existence of bloodborne in any list should be a shameful reminder to Sony of how they let the franchise die
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,All the single player games just goes to show ppl would rather just be left alone sometimes
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Death Stranding isn't part of Sony
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,deserved
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What is Astro bot?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They do make games after all...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bangers@!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I have never played Bloodborne and probably never will, but WTF? It was released in 2015? I really thought that it is only 4 or 5 years old game. Time flies way too fast nowadays."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I'm not following. 1 game nominated each year for game of the year? Seems like it should be more. How many has Nintendo had in the past decade?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Did any of them win?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Never heard of astro bot
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ratchet and Clank for 2024
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Damn, like what is even the point of xbox anymore? Gamepass? Why would i buy that, when i have a console with so many great games on it. Xbox need to step up with their exclusives."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How's astro bot?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Horizon got smacked both years. Releasing beside a Zelda and elden ring. Amazing games and incredible story telling.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,That happens when you pay a lot of money for your games to be nominated.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Jesus Christ, Bloodborne was 9 years ago 💀"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne man! What a game
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne 2 and they'll actually win it as well
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why was Spiderman 2 nominated? It was aggressively mid
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne is the best game on the list by far
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I have played 0 of these games lol. I'm 34 and I own several of these on Steam. Where is Days Gone? That game was really good.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Wouldn't really call Death Stranding Sony's game. They don't own the developer and wasn't sole publisher for the game.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2015-2019 are GOAT and winners in my eyes. The rest up until now not so much…. Except Astro bot that was a unexpected surprise
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Call of Duty BO6 could be up there this year
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Good god 8 years since Nathan Drake
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The only game I've played and didn't enjoy from the list was Bloodborne. Does anyone else share the experience?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Oof Xbox.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I gotta play that ratchet and clank game appearently.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"What a surprise with them having the largest market share in gaming, truly baffling."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I've only ever played Uncharted out of these.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,THIS IS THE SIGN. BRING BACK SINGLEPLAYER ONLY GAMES THEY WERE PEAK 
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I have never heard of Astro bot
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Three of those games have already gotten a remaster…
:("
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,2018 was crazy
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I picked up Spiderman remastered over the weekend and it's sooooo boring. How did that get nominated for goty?!? I LOVE spiderman but even that couldn't keep me playing. After 7 hours I gave up
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"2018 might be the best year ever. God of War, Spider-Man, and Red Dead Redemption 2. What a year."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"My favourite of these is Bloodborne.

I think I'm officially old, media's not being made for me anymore"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I liked death stranding but game of the year nom is a stretch.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"You're telling me that one of the biggest video game corporations in the world, nay one of the big 3 (Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo), has games that are constantly seen in the mainstream public eye and are nominated in awards shows that target mainstream games?

What's next, you're gonna tell me Nintendo owns Pokemon?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Bloodborne should have won GOTY.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Hopefully we get another Ratchet and Clank game by the start of the PS6
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,The power of money.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Probably because PlayStation is all modern gamers know about gaming
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's a shame that as a company, Sony and subsequently PlayStation are fucking terrible. 

Why does every company that makes legitimately good blockbuster titles also have to be complete scumbags who treat their communities like shit?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,2020 was a helluva year.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"weakest year ‘20, ‘22 or ‘24"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Hmmm, I've got some Platinums to catch up on. Couldn't do that all these years later if there are multiplayer trophies (looking at you AC Black Flag 🤬)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I think I’ll play Bloodborne again, thanks!"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,4 years later last of us 2 still not on ps premium smh
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,That’s crazy to think about
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Only one nominee? Or are there others?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Astrobot definitely deserves it. Amazing game.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Bloodborne 🥺
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,How the fuck is Bloodborne nearly 10 years old...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,you know it's a slow year for gaming when astro bot makes Goty. not saying i dont have love for platformers but i felt like there were better more mature nominations imo.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Only game I like out of those is Bloodborne, the rest I don’t care for."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Maybe Sony should just dedicate to games & forget consoles. Same with Xbox, go PC software streaming"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,TLOF is really good
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Not surprising. Nintendo was on life support for the first couple years, third party publishers have mostly been chasing rushed live service nonsense, and Xbox has been an also-ran since the end of the 360."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Have they won?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Ghost of Tsushima is 4 years old but I still can’t buy it for cheap
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"That reminds me, I still have to play Death Stranding and Ghost of Tsushima from my physical backlog."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"That reminds me, I still have to play Death Stranding and Ghost of Tsushima from my physical backlog."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,That is so crazy
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,With how big Helldivers 2 was i'm surprised it's not beside Astro bot. They really shot themselves in the foot with that one.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Spiderman2 on the ps5 is hot garbage. Hopefully fixed on pc release.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Horizon twice GOTY??? How?? It is a boring-ass game with good graphics
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's the entire point of this. They aren't just Sony games, they are Sony exclusive games, heavily subsidized to attract attention to the platform. Yes, the studios are extremely talented, but they Sony was only able to pull this off because they had a big market advantage with the PS4, and they saw this as an investment in their ecosystem. Most studios, even AAA, cannot afford to pull this off."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"A lot of comments like 'it's come to PC or other platform, then it's not sony game', lol."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I question the legitimacy of this. As majority of console players I know only ever have a sports game such as NBA2K, NHL/FiFa/Madden, GTA and Every years CoD."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,And an Ubisoft infection by the looks of it.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,2022 i was eating good
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,At least 80% of these Games are mediocre at best. But these Awards are all PAID.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Spiderman and Horizon are so overrated.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,That 2015-2018 Playstation run was legendary
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"2018 was such a good year, God of War, MH World, Red Dead and Spiderman Celeste. Im blessed to say I’ve played each one"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,If astro bot is all we can muster for goty then it was a sad year for gamers
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Meanwhile, Xbox with all its fantastic IP’s sitting in a closet like “what gives?”"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Nothing to do with marketing.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,2022 and 2023 is a joke (although I liked the Ragnarok).
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Man, 8 years without an Uncharted? And we got that shit movie instead? Sad."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"In fairness 8/10 of those years Nintendo was nominated too. Of course 8 is less than 10 but the variety on offer is broader than Sony’s.

I can’t get behind Sony’s current business plan, we have a Pro console, the Portal and a bunch of Bluetooth peripherals but barely any PS5 exclusive games. Most users are still using the PS4 platform."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I thought astro's playroom and astro bot are just little funny games and was even a bit angry when I saw astro bot is selling for full price. Then I got to play both. Amazing games, totally deserved GOTY nomination, amount of content per level is just... I have no words for this, amazing"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Sony SUS
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"You have to remember : 

Award shows are highly sponsored and often skewed to make those sponsors happy. Nominations are the easiest to do, even if an award isnt won. Sony has a huge budget for PR, and they love to use it. 

Not really a marker of pure quality (not saying they dont make quality games - but there are many others out there similar or better), but a marker of how much marketing money they have to toss around. Or are willing to use."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"They could do something really nice and given us Bloodborne sequel and port the game to Sony's Steam lineup...


Surely with 10 years of GOTY nominations they could spare us this?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Last of 7s, Spiderman, GOS, and GOW only deserving spots."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"Is uncharted 4 actually any good? I played an uncharted a long time ago, I think if was PS3/4 and it was just a very bland and uninteresting gameplay"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"Bloodborne and astroboy are the only ones worthy of the title tho.

The rest are just generic triple a blockbuster games. The fastfood of gaming. 

It would be like calling mcdonalds the best restaurant of the year..."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,Crazy part is from that list the only games I kind of care about is God of War and possibly Death Stranding with maybe Spider Man 1 coming in third.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,Atrobot saved this year... next year will be hard to partecipate
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"Nominating Horizon for GOTY shows what's wrong with the industry these days. An absolute average game, with all sort of mechanics that has been already invented before just put in one game with (apart of hunting which is the best part of the game, but still only hunting). Brand new universe with new characters, story and few twists is way too little to be considered a GOTY pretender."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,I am sorry but horizon game are not GOTY contenders.......
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-13,"I have a Playstion 4, yet as a Xbox player. I don’t even think any of those games are fun. It’s definitely rigged."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,We throw the word GOTY around too loosely
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Completely deserved, as a person who plays a lot of single players, almost every one that releases per year playstation have some of the most quality games I've ever played "
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Would be interesting to see all Games of the Year since 1994 and first Playstation.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What is an action adventure game for 500 please
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Astro Bot 🥰
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And next year its ghost of yotei. Mark my words. It will win
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Which GOTY award? It seems 6-10 games release a game of the year edition these days.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,[deleted]
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And not a single game in there I give a f*** about. Well, except maybe Astro Bot. The Playroom was decent.

Shows how much different personal tastes can be. None of these games would be even in consideration for GOTY for me."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They all deserve it honestly
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Do you think this could be related to selling more consoles than Xbox possibly
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,with all due respect i see absolutely no reason Astro Bot has a goty nomination let alone half of the nominations it does
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? That also got a nomination
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Jesus, I did not realise Uncharted 4 was that old now...Still replay it once a year at this point!"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I just want Bloodborne on PC
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Tried to like Bloodborne. I have the game on disc. Couldn't get into it. The witcher is better. Looks more beautiful too.

Bloodborne tries to hide graphic quality with darker environments. Too me doesn't look as good graphically. But most importantly there is just more to do in the Witcher.

Horizon games was awesome too. The ones i have played on PS4 that has frozen wilds expansion. I paid for the expansions for it separately."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PlayStation really does know how to make amazing games, especially single player story games"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,At least half are mediocre
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They make the best single player games out there.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"just release bloodborne on PC Sony, omfg You absolute clowns"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Of these I have only playing Death Stranding and can 100% recommend it for game of the decade and/or game of the century.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"WOW ITS ALMOST LIKE SONY RELEASES GOOD GAMES EVERY YEAR AND IT HAS THAT SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT!

OP : ""No, this is clearly Sony paying money to have their games listed on nominee. There is no other way. It MUST be this"""
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Astrobot

Military_Clown.png"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why is this notable to anyone? Sony is a mega-corporation that is also a game publisher. They aren’t the ones actually making the games. Stop praising the suits and higher-ups and give credit to the game studios who actually worked on these wonderful projects.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Lots of those shouldn’t have been nominated honestly
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,We all kno some of them don't deserve the spot but it's sony
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,And i wouldn't have voted for a single game on this list. Shame.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's simple, a certain type of game tends to win these types of awards. (same goes for the Oscars, a certain *type* of film always gets best picture) 

Sony is publishing a lot of these types of games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Every single one of those games I don't give two shits about, reminds me why PlayStation since the PS4 era is dead to me. And I grew up adoring the PS1, PS2 & PS3. 

I'm just expressing a personal opinion. I don't mean to shit on all the millions of people who like these games. it just got to a point where Sony stopped making games that interested me."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Xbox sucks
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Most of these games aren't very good frfr nocap.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What worthless content. Goty means nothing but marketing
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And they're all on PC expect AstroBot and Bloodborne....
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They make good games
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Death Stranding = walking simulator.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I hate exclusives. No reason to have them. You are literally taking money away from yourself. Consoles are sold at a loss.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Well when you have money and own a massive portion of the industry you're going to get benefits even if they're undeserved. I say this as someone who enjoys my playstation, but god damn do the stinkers they pump out get absurdly high reviews."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Major publisher has had a GOTY Nominee Every Single Year in the Last Decade
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,All sequels lmao
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Never played any of them
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Which is sad since many of them dosnt deserve it...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,So what? Only one really good game - Bloodborne
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,There’s like maybe 3 games here at most that deserve it lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"HZD is mediocre at best, how is that Goty worthy is beyond me"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"and yet they still want to triple down on live service bullshit.

They were banking so hard on Concord. how did so many people see that garbage and go ""yeah, a ton of people are gonna love this"". All it took was one trailer for everyone to know it was a dud, but none of the people making it knew? or did they all know but didn't say anything because they'd get fired?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Astro bot is nice but i don’t think its worthy
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And they only won 2
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They absolutely didn’t deserve one in 2023.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"games that are platform exclusive should not be nominated for game of the year. They def shouldn't win, at least."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They didn't make these games, they published them. At least the few that I know of. Fromsoft made Bloodborne, for example."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,BG3 best gave ever
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"As a self-proclaimed sonypony since PS2, a bit worrying I’ve only played 2 of those games, being Bloodborne and Ghost of Tsushima, although all of those games interest me."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Helldivers 2 should be nominated.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Spider Man 2, HFW and GOT don't deserve it, Ratchet was a great game, idk if it is a GOTY candidate, the others are worthy."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Honestly hell divers should be on there too. 
Butttt let’s just go with the single player narrative."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Like give them a category where they can shine, but None of the games are truly addicting, which was what games use to be.

I like these games too."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2018 should've gone to Red Dead 2. Absolutely ridiculous.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I really want to play astrobot but I'm 100% certain it will be a PS monthly or ps extra game at some point and don't want to buy it. I really wish sony would do more day one releases on big names like xbox does. PSN is a decent value so I'll keep it, but waiting for shit to be added is annoying."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"My only objections are TLOU II & Astro Bot. Because, why?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Nice to see the walking simulator got nominated (death stranding)
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Love all these games but you can also just see a downward trend in overall game originality and quality each year as well for their best game..
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,crazy how Oc players play the HZD or Ratchet and clank and it’s all “ okay games”
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Returnal was not even nominated?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Just so everyone is aware, every single one of these games are also on PC."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Greatness is what that is.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They don't deserve to claim Bloodborne
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Wtf is astro bot? Playstation people are so weird man. Tou can get an xbox with literally double the amount of games and the controller isnt designed for sangheili. Like wake upppppp
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Seeing Bloodborne pissed me off because it reminds me Sony is about to own Fromsoft
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Streak probably should have been broken in 2019 lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne and Death Stranding are not PlayStation games, otherwise impressive."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What the hell is Astro Bot?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sony owns and pays the judges thousands of f****** dollars I don't give a s*** what their game wins. I love all those games though. But f*** they're b*******! Like they're the only goddamn gaming console on the planet! Why don't you go remaster another 5-year-old game you f****** moops!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"How many won again? Not being salty, just busy at work."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not to mention RDR2
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,No Returnal is insanity
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The crack someone was smoking in 2016 to nominate Uncharted A Thief’s End for GOTY must’ve been some good shit
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2018 was such a good year for gaming
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I have almost all of them and never played them...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I liked the game, but Spider-man 2 didn’t deserve to be nominated"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ghosts should have beat LoU2. A story of a Jin throwing away all honor and samurai tradition as they have showed to be a weakness Kahn knew. To start fighting using stealth and less honorable means to defend there homeland over a story of basic revenge that doesn't solve anything 
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Surely this isn't that notable? It's hardly surprising that a major games console has a nominee for Game of the Year every year.

All that means is that the console is popular enough to have games developed for it which are good enough to be nominated for Game of the Year. I'm pretty certain the same is true for PC."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,To bad they are a shit company that scammed me out of 180€ after their paper thin security got breached for the 10.000 thousands time.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I think this kinda shows that in some of these years, either the releases were not that impressive, or a sony game must always be nominated.

Like, you might have liked it, but it's ratchet and clankle that memorable in comparison with other titles in this list?

I don't think so in all honesty."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How many did win GOTY? I only remember God of War being a winner? Not sure to be honest.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne and Spider-Man are fantastic games but everything else seems pretty mediocre. Astro Bot looks like a nice little game but I wouldn't expect it to be groundbreaking.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Tbh no console exclusive title ever deserves to be goty
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"and for half the years, they deserved to have one"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Crazy how bloodborne is still the best on that list
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How many of them won it ?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Ratchet being nominated in 2021 over Returnal is so wrong...(I'm happy Astro is nominated this year, I just think Rift Apart was a forgettable platformer that overpromised and underdelivered)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Most of them are the same game with a different skin.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And I'll never get to even try most of them since I won't go for a low effort, cash grab PC port.  Something getting GOTY or even being nominated for it used to mean being worth buying a console for, but that value has gone down and the games aren't getting better by enough to make up for it."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Weak
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,honestly only a few of those I'd ever touch. but it's cool people get into these awards and think it means something
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If they can pay for exclusives, they can pay for nominations.

Sony buys a head start to every race it enters, and still manages to lose most of them."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Who’s game of the year? Culture Crave? Gaming awards? Aunt Beth?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Helldivers 2 is better than Astro Bot. But thats my 2 cents.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Great list, but Spider-Man 2 was riding on the coat tails of the first one"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Gonna be an unpopular opinion but Horizon is one of Sony's most overhyped just ok games of all time with no real reason being nominated. 2017 was really only between 3 games and they had PUBG on the nominees to fill slots, 2022 was when Elden Ring released and you could argue they put half of the nominees that year also to just fill slots cause it was definitely between Elden Ring and God of War."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Isn't the GOTY just an industry price, where everyone is petting there own shoulders and say how great they are?
Also isn't the GOTY a pay to get nominated price?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nominations don't mean much when you are one of the big 3 consoles and spend hundreds of millions per year pumping out AAA exclusives. If they weren't gonna get any nominations, they wouldn't be paying for those games to be made since if they aren't good enough to be nominated, they aren't good enough to sell to make up for the dev cost."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"""Game of the Year"" according to whom?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"To be real, even though they're all good games, some of them were nominated only because PlayStation®."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,So you're saying Sony's list for games of the year is all Sony games.... Interesting.....
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Death stranding, nah. Definitely not a goty"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,[deleted]
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Thise games are shit
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Funny that the ones that won didnt deserve it at all lol (TLOU 2 is debatable)
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"How are these even PlayStation games? Most of these are on Pc as well, and death stranding’s on Xbox."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,“bUt sOnY WiLl rUiN fRomSoFt!!!”
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"The only good game on this list is Bloodbourne. The rest is the equivalent of ""Oscar Bait"". Pretty games with shit gameplay."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"""Almost"" only counts in horshoes and hand grenades. How many did they actually win?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Astro bot was great!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,What in the world is Atro Bot..?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Spider-man 2 doesn't deserve the nomination, game just automatically gets nomination if it Sony at this point"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Lobbyists
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Astro Bot making this list is a sign of things to come. GOTY quality games have just shifted to platformers designed to only be played for 30 minutes. Gaming is officially dead; as we know it.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You would hope so right? I mean, they're a massive share of the market."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,":l These games look pretty...but they're boring. 95% of these games nowadays are boring to me. If a game can't hold my attention for YEARS, it ain't my type of game. Not for the prices they charge nowadays. I have a PS5 and still play the same games I bought on my PS4. I don't think I have a single PS5 exclusive game that I play/enjoy more than the games I've been playing for 6+ years"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The fuck is astrobot?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Reminder.... they think astro bot on the same level as wu kong or elden ring... goty really means nothing
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What about Sekiro?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Dont let the xbox fanboys see this.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Playstation just doesn't miss. The worst game on this list is probably TLOU 2 which is a damn great game, just has some questionable plot choices."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How did uncharted 4 get nominated that game sucked. Nevermind it's just the game awards.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Feels odd that I have not played any of them and none of them appeal to me, in the least, to warrant me playing them."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Pussies allowing for dual winners in a year
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03, Can’t get into Horizon
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Horizon, GoW/Spider-man… Horizon/GoW, Spider-man. 

What an eventful decade!"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Looks like a downhill
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This is a shame, because all these games are mid."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If this is the list of their best games from each year, it's no wonder they're losing"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Couple of those didn’t deserve to be nominated to be fair lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Just to five an honest opinion as an xbox player.

None of these games would ever make me want a Playstation. 

I've bought 2 play stations in my entire life, one to play grand theft auto 3 and one to play little big planet when it first came out. 

The games on this list aren't enough to make me purchase another."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,A Thief’s End was sony’s end.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Shame that 4 of the 9 years had the same IPs.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"All this shows is that the nominee list is far too wide for things like Horizon 2, Rift Apart was shockingly mediocre, death stranding, last of us part 2, and spider-man 2 to get the nods as goty. 

Im not sure if there is a more disappointingly generic open world series than horizon. It's so close to being great, giant mech dinosaurs are cool, but holy hell that story and gameplay."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How the hell did Horizon get nominated?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sony should make more multiplayer games
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I get people (fanboys) will celebrate this, but does anyone else feel like when they look at this list, Astrobot (while good) just doesn't really stand up compared to the rest?  

Like Blood Borne, God of War, Spider-man, Uncharted...  Such a feast.   It's just strange to put Astro Bot next to Ghost of Tsushima, or Death Stranding, you know?  

It also feels this year's GotY are a bit light.  Like no game is really bad, but it also feels like none of them would be in the list in any other year."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's almost as if industry awards are supporting the industry...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Really? Death Stranding? I felt like a UPS delivery guy the whole game
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Western gaming media has a strong bias to the type of games Sony make, so not surprising."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Really? Astro Bot?  I feel like goty should be somthing much bigger than that
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Hell yeah, two good games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,i would argue that a few of those were undeserved tbh
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Hd2 is so much better than Astro bot.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And none of them deserved GOTY. GoW stole RDR2s win and TLOU2 was a joke.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Every console does :D What bullshit marketing is this?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And its still has no game.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I see 2. Two worthy games. What the hell is this?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Meh conveyor belt games with marvel writing.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PlayStation didn't have those nominations just because the games in question are exclusives. Sony didn't make most of those games, third party developers did. Credit where credit is due."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,You can really see the decline
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"\-Bloodborne, good but not excellent.

 I think thats the way!"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Horizon is a cookie-cutter Ubisoft open world clone that holds itself back by trying to be everything it shouldn't be.

I'm not saying that they don't deliver, but having a spot alone isn't that special."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And they had to *reaaaaaallyyy* stretch to get Astro Bot to fit
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,these awards are such a joke what even is astro bot and why would it be getting game of the year over something as epic as the other games on that list.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Wow..one of the big three consoles had a GOTY nominee? 

Insanity"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How is astrobot on there?  Is it actually a good game?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The only games on thatt list that i consider worthy of GotY aare Bloodborne, God of War, Death Stranding, Ghost of Tsushima and Astro Bot."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Really good games on that list, but I have an unpopular opinion about game of the year. If the game isn’t available on multiple platforms, then it shouldn’t be considered for GotY. If the majority of gamers can’t play it, then the game is really just a “best of <insert system here>” to me."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And more than half of them are mediocre at best. Conclusion ? GOTY awards are fucking trash
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Well yeah they're on the committee that chooses which games get nominated lol.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Its a fucking 2hrs commercial. Sony buys adds there and therefore gets awards and nominations.

Uncharted 4 (really??), Last of Us Part 2 Remake Remastered and remade again, and Death Stranding the walking simulator should never have been contenders lol"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,K
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"As a massive ratchet and clank fan, I don't understand how RA was nominated for GOTY. It's objectively gorgeous and a fun game overall, but it's painfully easy compared to past entries, even on ""hard mode,"" and I was really disappointed by how short it was.

WHY ARE YOU BOOING ME? I'M RIGHT lmao"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,So the demo that got some dlc was the best they could do
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ok
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Game of the year is a generic term, they are hundreds of GOTY each year so no surprise SONY is nominated each years, unless it's for a specific ceremony?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Except Death Stranding isn't Sony production and they don't have any rights. They only published it for certain time before it went multiplatform
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I have played 0 of these and have almost no desire to play any of them.

Edit: wrong, ghosts of tsushima was excellent."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Shouldn't there only be one game of the year for each year? Seems weird that God of War has to share
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,We were all lost to the pandemic era.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Fr wtf?! Is there gonna be another one? Im not up to date about R&C stuff
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I just picked it up on the Steam sale since I don't have a PS5. Wow, it's good."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I'm on the PC timeline so only 2023 for me ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This is the second recent one, the other came out around 2016"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Hi there, I tried to make a post but it got deleted saying I need karma? I'm not sure what that is but I would really appreciate someone helping me out by answering a question. I'm trying to find games for my 21 year old grandson who is getting a PS5 for Christmas, and the man at Best Buy tried to sell me a blue paper card that had a yellow plus on it for $100.

I'll be honest, I'm in my 70s and I'm not sure if he was trying to scam me or not. Was that real money for the PS5 or fake? Please help whenever you can, thank you so much!"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why deal with the toxicity of people when you can have an enjoyable experience
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Except Overwatch only SP games have won the award
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not only that but they're all Third-Person games.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean single player games are much more likely to win GOTY regardless, and multiplayer games are more often than not going to benefit from being cross platform not exclusive.

The big 3s major IPs are all single player focused, even Halo and Gears are usually touted for their single player campaigns over their multiplayer."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why is this a noteworthy question? The PS barely even gets multiplayer games that aren't cross-platform to start with
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sony publicly announced that single-player is their focus since the PS4 era. Makes sense they are recognised for what they focus on.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Funny enough, I think of multiplayer and single player games as completely different media, and I often immediately associate something like game of the year or greatest of all time with single player games.  I love multiplayer, but to me it’s like comparing a sport to a book: not really compatible"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean, this is also a brand new reddit account go for easy karma farming posts so I wouldn't give it too much attention."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nope, it is not a coincidence. Single player exclusives move consoles. I was thinking about getting an Xbox but I can just wait till Spring to play Indiana Jones so no more Xbox console for me."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not that Sony makes many multiplayer games in the first place, aside for their yearly MLB title and occasionally some others (they do also publish MP games every now and then, such as Helldivers 2 this year)."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Sony Pictures understands movies, and their PlayStation division understands games. 



Together they help make some Banger stories and adventures. 



I'm a PC gamer, and I will gladly admit PS is probably one of the best gaming studios and will probably buy a ps5 just for GTA6.(GTA games hit PC 2-3 years later)


Sony has an exclusive marketing deal with Rockstar Games, and also looking to acquire the FromSoft studios."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,No. Single player games are just better
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I still wish for a 5, but I understand that they can't just keep coming up with these massive lost cities that somehow were never found in the modern world"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,UC2 still unparalleled imo
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"What really sucks is it has a fun multiplayer mode.... That you can't play on pc -_-

It's a great game with a fun MP mode locked to ""ps4"" only (ps5 has to run the ps4 version to play) so you are also stuck on 30fps."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Grant us eyes!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"it seems like the more we ask for it, the more Sony/From Software wanna starve us"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Between how much fans are clamboring for it and how reticent the higher ups are to even acknowledge that it exists, I honestly think that there's something actually *wrong* with Bloodborne. Like, they lost the source code, or the ghost of Kentaro Miura is threatening to sue Miyazaki for copyright infringement or something, and they only recently started making headway on solving the problem."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The fact that FromSoft has the same number as Bethesda and Capcom is pretty remarkable.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,That simple list took a lot of work.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This requirement would’ve been limited to only the largest publishers.  Who else can fund the production of many high quality games in a year?  Also, who publishes the title would have less to do with quality than who created the game. 

Is this criteria resulting in a list that is more about size or quality?

Are they the best of the big publishers or the best publishers?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,If Supergiant gets another nom with Hades 2 (I would guess they will based off the EA) it would be kind of wild to see them tied with the likes of Blizzard and Square.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If I remember, God of War won 2018 and TLOU2 in 2020. That is it from this list I think."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Quick rundown of the GOTY category of the game awards in this time frame. 

2015 - Witcher 3 over Bloodborne, Fallout 4, MGS V, and Super Mario Maker

2016 - Overwatch over Inside, Doom, Titanfall 2, and Uncharted 4

2017 - LoZ:BotW over Horizon, PUBG, Mario Odyssey, and Persona 5

2018 - GoW over Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Celeste, Spiderman, Monster Hunter World, and RDR2

2019 - Sekiro over Control, Death Stranding, The Outer Worlds, RE2 Remake, and Smash Ultimate

2020 - TLOU 2 over Animal Crossing, Deem Eternal, FF7 Remake, Ghosts of Tsushima, and Hades

2021 - It takes Two over Metroid Dread, Deathloop, Psychonaughts 2, Ratchet and Clank, and RE Village

2022 - Elden Ring over A Plague Tale Requiem, GoW Ragnarok, Horizon FW, Stray, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3

2023 - Baldurs Gate 3 over Alan Wake 2, LoZ: TotK, Spiderman 2, RE4 Remake, Mario Wonder"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,just did a quick search: god of war 2018 and TLOU2 are both winners
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"at TGA? Only a few. But overall gotys they win more often. Like uncharted 4 had the most gotys tracked in 2016, but overwatch won at TGA. Death stranding had the most in 2019 but lost at TGA.

I'm still shocked that horizon 1 finished 2nd in 2017 (behind botw obviously) in overall gotys. It finished ahead of mario odyssey even."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Horizon had the misfortune of going up against Breath of The Wild.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Oh man, SOCOM was so good."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Some of those old ones are so funny. Like wow didn’t get a single nomination in any category in 2004 or 2008.

Madden 04 beat Kotor. 

COD 4 didn’t even get a nomination for goty. As stacked as 2007 was and there was only 3 nominations to begin with."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Well this post seems to be about GOTY from TGA. I don't think there were TGA goty awards before 2015.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"UC2 being the one that won it is kind of wild imo, and maybe i’m looking at it through 2009 lenses but for as much as i love UC2 i think Arkham Asylum was a far better game"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Idk about that, Spider-Man 2 felt like a step down from the first one. I liked it alright, but I was a little disappointed as a follow-up to SM1."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not when some are taking up space where much better games could be included. The Outer Worlds being there in a year that gave us Outer Wilds and Disco Elysium is crazy.

Another example. Nominating Deathloop when you had games like Hitman 3 and Inscryption.

Then you've got cookie cutter open world games like Odyssey, Horizon, Tsushima etc. Games that have great elements in them but the lack of creativity in their open world design is very apparent. So not games that really stand out enough to be one of the best of that year"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">and now they're competing for GOTY with a child-friendly robot whose purpose is to make players experience all of the Playstation's features.

No kidding. And (from what I've played of it so far) Astros Bot is *fantastic*. It reminds me of the old Mario Galaxy games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I've only owned a PS4 and PS5 but I have zero regrets. I've had some of the best gaming experiences I've ever had on those two consoles. I have limited time to game so I'll take one good single player experience a year over endless multiplayer.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I just miss the ps3 days when they were more wild and experimental
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne on pc.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Now if Xbox could manage to step up their game. Because at this point they are looking more like late 90s Sega. Which isn’t a good sign. We need at least 3 big consoles. Especially since 2 of them are dominated by 1 country.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Naughty Dog hasn't released a new game in 5 years.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,To me it's now that I'd rather play their big games on PC and knowing i'll get them eventually means I won't get a ps5. They have blockbuster exclusives but the thing is this list basically is all their notable exclusives for the last 10 years. I can't justify buying a 500-700 dollar system for that few big exclusives. Also this spans 2 generations of consoles.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I agree. The first console I ever bought with my own money was a PlayStation 2 with Gran Turismo 3 and I’ve never looked back. 

Nintendo (NES) was my first actual console - bought by my parents, of course. I cannot say the same for them. They have declined so much."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-06,In 2009 they had Uncharted 2. It was the winner that year too.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Everyone knows GOTY is a circlejerk until it validates your opinion, then it's a flawless and objective judgement of quality"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not only that but they're just not interesting games for the most part. Or they're sequels, or cousins of other games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How many GOTY editions does it take for people to notice?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Matpat has a good video about GOTY bias. Basically it's all old dudes deciding the games so the picks are all cinematic dad games, which is exactly the type of game sony makes."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They celebrate the developers too lmao. They LITTERALLY bring them up on stage and are personally handed the award every year
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Shout-out to Microsoft's Hi-Fi Rush for being nominated in other categories ;)
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Per the Psychonauts 2 docu though, MS buying Double Fine absolutely expanded the resources available for the game. It was only as good as it was because MS helped out, they definitely deserve the credit on that one."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nintendo doesn't have one this year either, do they?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Xbox had Forza Horizon 5 and Flight Simulator in 2020 which were two of the highest rated games released that year and neither got a GotY nomination because they're from niche genres.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I mean from this list nowadays the only exclusives are bloodborne and astrobot arent they?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Forza Horizon 5 was the single highest rated game of 2021.

Ori Will of the Wisps wasn't nominated with no explanation given but presumed because it was ""too small"" with a 90 metacritic, same for Ori and the Blind Forest with an 88, but Stray was nominated with an 83.

Gears 5 (84) and Halo Infinite (87) were not nominated, but Death Stranding (82) and Ghost of Tsushima (83) were nominated.

There was no chance an Xbox exclusive was ever going to get nominated at a show where the dorito pope chooses selection panel."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Whose game of the year is this? Don’t a ton of places release their versions? Is there one that is “definitive?”
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> Deathloop was exclusive to PS5 for that year

It wasn't. Deathloop was a multiplatform release (PC + PS5) in September 2021."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I still think we need to take a step back and appreciate Microsoft once had a GotY That was exclusive to Playstation 5.

This timeline is weird, man."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Probably the Geoff Keighley Show featuring Geoff Keighley and Geoff Keighley.

But he DID do a great job at making his awards show the definitive one (also thanks to the name)."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The Game Awards, the by far biggest Award type thing we have had going for the last 5+ years?

At least that's what I assumed because its the obvious one"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Agreed, seems like this is to just fill the vacuum left by no E3.  These are just to drum up hype for whatever is next."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It sort of replaced E3, so yeah, their awards seem to matter more to people now for some reason. I don't see any value in it, though it is nice when good developers like Larian get their spotlight."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"An industry controlled by two companies might not technically be a monopoly, but it's certainly not healthy.

The concerns about industry consolidation are a lot deeper than just the fanboy console wars."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It was until recently.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's from *the* specific and prestigious GOTY award known as The Game Awards (AKA The Geoff Keighley Show featuring Geoff Keighley)
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,God of War and The Last of Us Part II
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not really because Bloodborne isn't just made on PS4, it's a Sony intellectual property

It's not just a game that FromSoft made on PlayStation, it's a Sony game that FromSoft made *for* PlayStation

Same deal as Demon's Souls, FromSoft doesn't own either of those games' trademarks"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They are listing Sony published games. Rebirth is from Square Enix as usual for the franchise.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne like Demon's Souls are Sony IPs...

Sony didn't even want to release Demon's Souls in the West which is why it was published by Atlus in the Americas and Namco in the Europe.

They did similar shit with earlier PS IPs like Devil Dice/Bombastic \[XI / XI go\] for the PS1/2.

Sometimes they fund and co-create great things and lock them in the closet until another publisher recognizes its worth and brings it out for the people to enjoy.

Sonys play with Final Fantasy and a lot of other 3rd party IPs is the opposite, they throw some cash at the publisher in terms of marketing or lower license fees for the privilege of not releasing the content on other platforms. They have no ownership there just a fuck you contract to owners of other platforms."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This is just first party stuff or else youd be seeing FF7, Black Myth, and alot of other exclusives here."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"In that same vein, should Death Stranding even be on that list as a “Sony” nominee? Kojima Productions is an independent studio and DS is now on xbox."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Calling Uncharted niche is wild. It sold 15 million copies.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Did you play Rift Apart? It was an excellent game. I'm not sure how you could call Uncharted niche in any way, it's a third person shooter with puzzles. Crystal Dynamics made an entire trilogy of Lara Croft games, which the first two were great, almost based entirely around the same gameplay aspects. Metaphor: Refantazio is nominated for GOTY and is about as niche a game as you could get. A lot of the categories are for specific genres too, do you want it to just be 16 awards for indie games? What are you even complaining about?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And Spider-Man 2 was completely mediocre.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Dude you bought and played most of these twice, and liked them enough to state you will be buying unreleased and unannounced future games, but they're not good? lol"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Sony’s Japan Studio approached FromSoftware for a new game, it was a cooperative development."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Seems like they're just stating facts.
Like the fact that Xbox hasn't dropped a game that's been nominated for like a decade"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,that’s what she said
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They owned the IP until just this year when Kojima bought out his contract. I do agree it's kind of a grey area where more 3rd party though.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It was funded by Sony.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It was a PlayStation exclusive at launch, but was made by an independent team and has since come to PC and Xbox."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's only referring to The Game Awards, which is generally the award show people mean when they don't reference a specific one."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Astrobot and Metaphor ReFantazio are the best reviewed games this year and share the highest metacritic score of 94. No other game this year scored above 93
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Guess they weren’t good enough?  


I don’t get the point of down casting games cause my favorite didn’t make it. Hell I didn’t play Balatro but with the way ppl spoke about it all year I ain’t gonna say it doesn’t deserve it."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Making consistent bangers for a whole decade and winning multiple GOTY awards isn’t some mundane accomplishment, it’s the epitome of consistency"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's a platformer like Super Mario Galaxy
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Same. Not heard anything about it until I saw it was a nominee. Thought it was one of those free demo things you get with sony and really didn't know what it was doing there
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,1st 3d platformer outside of Nintendo to really hit the quality of Mario imo
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Meh, not really"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nah, both those games are fantastic, and that's coming from someone who never played a previous ratchet game or astrobot game until these ones. They're both so well polished and pure fun to play."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I didn't enjoy God of War. I skipped out on Astro Bot
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,They definitely putting money in someone’s pocket
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,God of war won that year. And I believe tlos2 as well
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The Game Awards hasn't been going since 1994 though.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Out of about 14k games released each year, a list of 10 games is pretty short."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,This list is just Sony owned IP nominees.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,You’re not alone.  Couldn’t care less about a single one of these titles
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"IP wasn't owned by PlayStation at the time of release(it's why Death Stranding is on this list) 

FF7R is a Square Enix game."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Which one?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I quite enjoyed Bloodborne, TLOUS2, and Uncharted 4.  Rift Apart was quite fun, tho the game was a bit light."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Bloodborne maybe, but you are right about the others."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"There have been many winners and nominees that aren't cinematic and graphics heavy tho.  But yes, Sony does make a lot of cinematic heavy games.  From that list tho, Bloodborne and Astrobot are very different from the rest."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,What games do u like?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Hey if you want to play on PC that’s perfectly fine!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Who cares
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"With thier new timed exclusivity policy, it's probably a matter of time before Astro Bot comes to PC.

No comment on the other one though."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There are several very valid and legitimate reasons to dislike the game or find it boring, but calling it Walking Simulator = ''I didn't play the game and I'm not basing my opinion on what the game actually offers''.

It's more of a logistics planning game like Eurotruck Simulator but in the apocalypse, with horror touches, tons of unlockable futuristic devices to tame the terrain and optimize your deliveries, an innovative asynchronous multiplayer system, and fights against bandits, terrorists, antimatter ghosts, lovecraftian tar monsters and sometimes skeleton soldiers revived from the world wars."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Exclusives are the reason that Sony is dominating the console market. Seems like a pretty good reason to me.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There is a business reason to have them. Say I wanted Spider-Man, I’d have to buy a PlayStation when it released. And now that I have a PlayStation, what am I also going to buy? The other exclusives. Sony continues to get a cut from software because you now are in their ecosystem. You don’t have an incentive to buy all of their games if you’re not invested into the hardware to play them."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Exclusives allow for games to be developed faster and better.  Having to optimize for a particular set of hardware is a huge advantage in that process.  It should allow for better games.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I think as a publisher, Sony is the best in terms of the quality of games that come from them and their owned studios. 

If they released their games to all platforms, they would sell so many games, it wouldn't matter about Playstation or not. People who like playing on consoles will still buy them."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">Well when you have money and own a massive portion of the industry

This reminds more of Microsoft Xbox, do you know the 75 billion dollar Activision acquisition is the biggest gaming acquisition of all time and the only comparable acquisition in the entire entertainment industry was Disney buying Fox in 2019. Xbox has more dev studios than Playstation and Nintendo combined."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,MS is proof owning the market and having all the money don't mean shit if you have 0 talent.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I would love to hear what you find good games then with ur incredible and divine taste.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You say that like it should be expected, but no other publisher has achieved that not even Nintendo"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Platform exclusive? Most of these are on PC now, just still owned by Sony."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sony owns the vast majority of the studios that made the games though.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne was made in collaboration between Sony Japan Studio and Fromsoft. Sony also owns the IP.

Guerrilla Games(Sony studio) helped with Death Stranding, it was also developed using their engine. Sony owned the IP, but they transferred the rights to Kojima this year.

All the other games came from their own studios"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Santa Monica Studios (God of War), Naughty dog (Uncharted, The Last of Us), Team Asobi (Astro Bot), Insomniac Games (Ratchet and Clank, Spider-Man), Guerilla Games (Horizon, Killzone) all fall under PlayStation Studios.

So yeah, Sony made most of these games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,bloodborne and death stranding are the only 2 where sony had no say. All other games are made by children studios of ps.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Literally every game listed here expect for bloodborne is from a PlayStation studio
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"""Largest console in the world paid to have good exclusives that mostly didn't win GOTY"" isn't as good a headline, I suppose."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Death Stranding is more like Eurotruck Simulator but in the apocalypse, with horror touches, realistic traversal and management mechanics that no other game has, tons of unlockable features, tools, weapons, exoskeletons, vehicles, accesories and infrastructure types to optimize your deliveries, fights against bandits, terrorists, antimatter ghosts, lovecraftian tar monsters and skeleton soldiers revived from the world wars, and an asynchronous multiplayer system in which players collaborate with each other by leaving ladders or climbing anchors, building bridges, roads, safehouses, watchtowers, recharging points, ziplines, donating gear and materials, signaling dangers and points of interest, returning lost cargo, even during boss fights another player's character can emerge from the ground to give you weapons and healing items."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,If that was the case why is Balatro nominated this year lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Journs and shills
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not Sony’s list. The Game Awards.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Have you played it? It has 92% positive user reviews on Steam, the majority of people who actually played it enjoyed it, that's why it's getting a sequel. Obviously there are seas of people who don't like it, some for very legitimate and valid reasons but many others just for prejudices and absurdly reductionist memes that don't even correctly portray what the game has to offer."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,One of the highest ranked games of all time.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Agreed

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not a Sony product. An Activision product.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not even PS exclusive

I'm happy for playstation owners they got to enjoy these great games. I'm still waiting for the new fable.."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The logistics planning game is bad when it's actually a logistics planning game.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And what’s this imaginary “narrative”?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Yes
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,So having a platform for indies and well some games like Baldurs gate is trash gotsha let them rot
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Calling Death Stranding a Walking Simulator = ''I didn't play the game and I'm not basing my opinion on what the game actually has to offer''.

Although it's valid and respectable if a post-apocalyptic logistics planning game with shooting action, horror touches and many unconventional gimmicks is not your cup of tea at all."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Like give them a category where they can shine, but None of the games are truly addicting, which was what games use to be."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I’d bet you cash money that it’s going to win quite a few game of the year awards when all is said and done.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Playstation exclusive franchise. I didn't realise there had been many Astrobot games until recently. It's weird this one is being nominated because it is actually the same game they've made many times, this one just has references to a lot of different Sony franchises."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It’s a start to finish Mario rip off
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They give their dev studios the creative freedom to risk a new IP every generation instead of relying on a IP just because its successful.

Sucker Punch: Sly Cooper>Infamous>Ghost of Tsushima

Naughty Dog : Jak and Daxter(PS2)>Uncharted(PS3)> The Last Of Us(PS3/4)

Guerilla Games : Killzone(PS3)>Horizon(PS4)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Apparently they owned it at the start, then sold it back to kojima."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I think they are referring to nominations
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nintendo had both BotW and Mario Odyssey nominated for GOTY in 2017.

If the company delivered, they should be rewarded ;)

Beside, every year Sony had 2 games nominated, both were great games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They are referring to Nominees for The Game Awards top prize, of which there are usually 5-6 Nominated games. Of the games listed above Only God of War (2018) & The Last of Us, Part II have actually won the award (with Astro Bot as a pending given the awards this year are next week)."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"this lists nominees not winners, God of War did win that year tho"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I actually played all of my old games during the lockdown
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I saw a post earlier that said it was 5 years today they found the first case of Rona. Crazy to think half a decade passed
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Those 2 years blur together for me
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There will be but from that leak awhile back, it’s looking like R&C will have a new game every start of a new generation 

Like a launch title

Which as a big R&C fan, sucks"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There damm well better be. 

Or at least make the old games playable natively. My internet sucks and I can’t effectively stream them. And the less said about trying to emulate them on pc. The better."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,the devs put out Spiderman 2 after but i think the leak showed that the devs are basically gonna be a marvel studio for the next decade
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Well from what I heard the closest date seems to be 2029... It's a shame Insomniac turned it's back to the game that made them be what they are, but well I guess Marvel games have that much pull."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I played both so my timeline is all sorts of confused. The PS version feels more recent and the PC version feels like it's been longer.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Amen
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,But then how will I know who my mom is sleeping with? There's apparently a LOT of people...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Also, multiplayer games only have a shelf life of a few years until the player base moves on to the next Call of Duty. 

The Game of the Year award typically goes to something more timeless that can be played again in a few years. So you can actually play the GOTY 2014."

Im pretty sure people playing Multiplayer games just dont give a fuck about these awards. I mean I havent seen anything from most of the games on this list."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,People like competition and playing with friends. Idk that's how I feel these days
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"As an extrovert working from home, gaming is one of my social times. So single player games really aren't something I'm interested and they really just seem lonely.

I'm glad others find enjoyment in it though. I'm guessing it's a good recharge moment for many."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Some people find facing another human opponent mentally engaging
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"100%

I just recently started playing WoW again after almost 10 years (I know...) only because they've finally introduced actual single-player end game content. You can run regular dungeons with a team of NPC's or do ""delves"" by yourself or with a single friend. 

It's so much more enjoyable when you don't have to play with a group full of try-hards that exist purely to shit on people that don't spend every waking moment min-maxing their characters and playstyles."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Man but that is part of the fun of playing online games listening to hateful morans talk utter nonsense is always a good laugh. Don't let some 13-year-old call of duty shitter ruin games for you. That means the troll has won, well in their eyes."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And even Overwatch winning came with lots of criticism as Overwatch didn't have the most nominations that year but won anyway.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It takes two ?!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Baldur's Gate 3 has a very robust multi-player (including splitscreen) but it's not competitive multi-player if that's what you mean.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There was also it takes two, that wasn’t single player"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It Takes Two and Baldurs Gate 3
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,True
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Also most reviewers can only spend relatively little time per game, leading to easier story driven games getting higher scores."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yeah, I mean, wtf would Playstation have on there? They don't make multiplayer games often. The only ones in recent time I can think of is Concord and Helldivers."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Because some random exec once said that it's better to focus on multi-player than single-player and Reddit gamers felt so insulted they can't let it go years later
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Concord 🤓
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"In 2023 they publicly announced their focus would be live service multiplayer games:

>https://www.polygon.com/22914172/sony-playstation-bungie-acquisition-new-live-service-games

They planned to launch 12 live service in like 3 years.

>Ryan adds: ""The way people play games has changed a lot over the last few years. We have created some wonderful properties over the course of the last 25 years, with characters that people love and resonate the world over. Offering the opportunity to enjoy those experiences in a completely different way is something that we are very excited about.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> Single player exclusives move consoles.

Probably true, but consoles are usually sold at cost or even cheaper, so moving more of them isn't worth much. There's a reason Playstation titles are going cross-platform and Xbox is abandoning the idea of a distinct console."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean honestly Xbox’s first upcoming first party output looks really good imo.

I know the general consensus is that their finished and all their games are going multiplatform, but until it actually starts happening en masse; I still think it’s pretty worth it to support what they got.

I mean, other then Gears E-Day and State of Decay 3 (and even then both start out as single player games), a lot of their first party exclusives are single player.

With at least Avowed, South of Midnight, and Fable confirmed for this year, with other stuff like Perfect Dark, Clockwork Revolution, Outer Worlds 2, OD etc.

Maybe I’m just being a dumb fanboy, idk but I personally think there’s plenty to be excited for."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Agree. Look how many units Nintendo moves because of the new Zelda, Mario, Pokemon, or other mainline series release. On the other hand, Xbox has always wanted to compete in the multiplayer arena. I personally stick with PlayStation because I prefer single player, story-driven games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">Sony Pictures understands movies,

Do they? Madam Web is a flop and just 7 years ago Sony was very close to selling off their studio division after like 8 flops in a row. 

Let's not act like theyre a blue chip studio pushing out hit after hit."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I'm on my 2nd, very long, play-through of *Red Dead Redemption 2*.

The first play-through was on the PS4. I've never been able to really get into the GTA games, though I did try and totally get why people like it.

If Rockstar can make even 1 game every ~2 years on the same level as RDR2 or GTA - I feel comforted in knowing that there will be something really immersive waiting when i'm ready.

RDR2 on the PS5 looks incredible, too. As far as i'm aware there's no PS5 specific patches for it either."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's the other way around. Kadokawa (fromsoft parent) is facing a hostile takeover from a chinese company and went to Sony to get ahead of it.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,You say that but people play multiplayer games way more. People that have friends at least.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"but Nate's Story is over, I prefer a game with Chloe and Sully or a young Sully game"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"While I love the series and would love another go at it, I don’t want a 5. Nate’s story is done and they wrapped it up in such a fantastic way I hope they leave it be. They can still do more Uncharted games, but not with Nate and the rest of the crew."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,4 is close because the story and gameplay are better. BUT that Uncharted 2 pacing is just unmatched
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yeah the spectacle might have gotten a little too grand imo. But 2 was the perfect upgrade to 1, which was fine but nothing special. The set pieces, solid gameplay (and awesome mp), AND extras (like playing with 0 gravity or fat drake lol) was so fun.

Plus, the graphics looked so insane back in the ps3 days."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I’m pretty sure multiplayer is 60fps on the PS4 version, only single player is 30fps."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Classic Naughty Dog. They did the same thing with the Last of Us.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Just Sony. They're big fans of buying IPs and then sitting on them.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Nothing to do with FromSoft. Sone owns the IP

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not really. Bethesda don't actually release a game as often. And Fromsoft has only been a contender since Dark Souls era started. Like think about it. Since 2011 Bethesda itself has only released Skyrim, Fallout 4, Fallout 76 and Starfield. That's only 4 games in 13 years. And 76 wasn't even really all them. "

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I’m sorry to be a little bitch here…but God of War winning over RDR2 still boggles my mind man.  Like, GoW is objectively a great ass game sure…but winning over Red Dead?!  Just…wild."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Surprised GOW beat RDR2. But from what I recall Sony and Nintendo just time their releases to not get in each other's way. Like the year before this Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey released, and the year after was Smash Bros Ultimate."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bro I’m sorry…Deem Eternal is hilarious. I spent way too many minutes trying to figure out what that game was, then I realized and had a good laugh over it!🤣🤣"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Wow I forgot how bad of a year 2021 was.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2015 was such a good year.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"2017 was an insane year and they didn't even nominate Xenoblade Chronicles 2 which could've easily been in the list. 


2023, also an insane year. So many great games  that didn't make the list but could've."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yeah, the Horizon series has a track record of releasing extremely close to the biggest and most hyped game of the year. 

I love the Horizon series and feel fully confident that Horizon 3 will be released the same day as a surprise collaboration between FromSoftware and Nintendo for their game: Zelda: Link to the Erd Tree, written by a resurrected Tolkien."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It happening once is tragedy. It happening twice is comedy.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I was like top 150 in the world at that game but it was before the era of esports and I was never quite that good at another game again lol :(

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Even if it was a step down I would still list it as one of the best games of the year.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I quit playing it and I really wanted to get all the costumes and 100% it. It was so bad is so many different ways.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I don't think Spiderman 1 even deserves to be nominated, other than the web swinging (which isn't even new) everything about the gameplay was pretty generic."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Also a great intro to video games overall. It’s my 5year old’s first game and she loves it. Been coming home every day asking to play the “robot game”.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">  It reminds me of the old Mario Galaxy games.

I wonder why?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PS2 was the actual innovation era. 

PS3 was the beginning of the modern Triple A market. 

Further, PS3 actively inhibited developers because of its much more arcane and closed requirements. 

Hence why we have never had a port of Metal Gear Solid 4 (unlike the first three PS2 games), because it was designed to work with PS3 hardware and that made porting it a massive headache. 

Compare the ease of transition for example from PS4 to PS5 (generally smooth front-ports), compared to PS3 to PS4 (needed its own emulation service)."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I really miss MAG. Id like to see it done again in some form.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"As much as I’d like to see Microsoft step it back up to their glory days of the 360 era, I just don’t see it. They’ve had multiple chances to catch back up and reclaim a foothold by acquiring multiple studios, only to close them afterwards, and every time they try to bring a classic franchise back to prominence (Halo Infinite), or introduce a new one (Starfield), it seems like they take one confident step forward, and (if they’re lucky only one) step back."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Meh, I own all the consoles and still spend a **lot** of time on my SX. Gamepass is the best gaming deal available today.

Nintendo and Sony digital prices are ridiculous and whilst PS+ is better than it was it still lacks a lot of exclusives sadly which is all I want from it.

Plus a few decent gems over the last few years from MS backed studios too imo. Just because they aren't console exclusives people dismiss them.

People always apply the wrong metric which is sales, without realising that Microsoft still move a ton of units given they have always predominantly struggled in the East and Sony/Nintendo have heritage"

Higher quality is not really true as we have seen much better titles come out from smaller studios like baulders gate 3 from laurian studios. Sony has good games yes. 

Corporations like sony destroy the quality of games over time. The profits always need to go up. This is why we are seeing studios shut down. 

Studios need to be smaller and create good games without messing them up with corporate over sight."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Actually Sony had 100% say on both of those games and IP and still do for Bloodborne. They just this year sold the Death Stranding IP back to Kojima, and they can do whatever they want with Bloodborne with or without Fromsofts permission or input. It would be pointless and stupid but they could give any dev studio and have them release Bloodborne 2 if they wanted to"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And those are the best two on the list.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne was actually codeveloped with a Playstation Studio and they own the IP, it isnt a stretch to call the game itself a first party game"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Death Stranding was from Kojima Studios which is independent from Sony. They had a contract for DS and Kojima fully owns the rights again as of this year.

You're essentially a deliveryman who walks. If you don't press buttons to walk you trip over yourself. It's hours of just walking at times. It was talked up to be a whole new genre of videogame entertainment called a ""strand game"" by Kojima. The first question I ask when playing a game is ""is this fun?"" If it isn't, it does not matter how interesting the plot is. In my opinion this would've been better as a short series on HBO or something rather than a game.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> Also, multiplayer games only have a shelf life of a few years until the player base moves on to the next Call of Duty. 

Meanwhile, Battlefield 4 came out in 2013 and is *still* populated with [thousands of players every day](https://steamcharts.com/app/1238860).

It's not that MP games die off quickly, it's that shallow, power-fantasy driven MP games in series with annual releases die off quickly because those IPs are intentionally designed to have a shelf-life of only 1 year."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bless you for finally figuring out the real question I was asking.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The strategy shift that brought us Concord
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Nowhere did they say they would FOCUS on live service. The majority of their ongoing projects are single player games. Of those 12 included GT and MLB.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Which is fucking stupid and I think might be start of the decline of Sony. Sony’s brand is built upon high quality single player games. A lot of the people that buy Sony consoles are single player gamers that like their single player games. To completely ditch that to go to live service is basically alienating the type of people that buy your console.

I’m guessing they recognized this was an overall bad decision and that’s why factions and the Spider-Man live service was cancelled. Yes they need some live service games so they have a secure moneymaker that allows them to pump out high quality single player games, since costs of games keep rising. However to turn all their brands into live service shit was dumb from the beginning. 

Last 4 Sony games, only 1 was the usual sony good quality. Concord was the biggest flop in triple a gaming history. The until Dawn remake got questionable reviews, and same with the lego horizon game. Astro bot was the only one of the games that you would expect from Sony.

They might be fucked and there is no right answer. They clearly want to shift away from single player games because dev costs keep going up which makes them to risky to make. However out of any dev or publisher on the planet, Sony is known for its single player titles. They are literally built around that market."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PlayStation is going cross platform because they recognize they can profit from PC players who continually ask for their games to be made available to them. They have been successful in their ecosystem and recognize that they can profit even more from PC players who quite literally demand their products. 

Yes you are right, consoles are typically sold at a loss, that’s what makes exclusives so important. They are the incentive to invest in a specific console. Similar to what I said about exclusives move consoles. Xbox is abandoning distinct consoles because theirs have been underselling by comparison and need to offer up their products across the market to remain profitable after purchasing the largest casual gaming market for close to $70 billion. 

The difference is Sony has done well in their contained ecosystem and now they are pandering to PC players while Microsoft needs to offer their products everywhere to help them turn over a profit after spending way too much of the company’s Monopoly money to make overpriced purchases."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Avowed and clockwork revolution might move the needle for me. Those look good from what I saw. But will they stay exclusive? Microsoft’s strategy now is taking the “moral high road” and make their games multi platform. Nvm you that they are double dipping in profit margins because they recognize that in order for gamepass to continually release quality day one exclusives they need to sell games as well as take in subscription money. I’m worried Xbox is going to be more about profits than quality experiences like Ubisoft or EA became. The examples you provide do help dissolve those worries a bit.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"One thing I've appreciated about the games Microsoft has put out over the past generation is the fact that they seem to be taking risks with the games they put out. Yeah, they've released a lot of stinkers and haven't really managed to achieve Sony's level of quality when it comes to their games, but just look at the kind of games they put out this gen. We've gotten multiple flight simulators, multiple RTS titles, a wonderful survival crafting game (grounded), A multiplayer pirate FPS (Sea of Thieves), several smaller scale RPGs from Obsidian, as well as a game like Psychonauts 2, which in all likelihood wouldn't exist if Microsoft didn't purchase Double Fine. Meanwhile when I look over at Sony's first party titles while I see nothing but great games, I also see almost nothing but single player third person action games. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, and those titles would absolutely make me pick up a playstation over an xbox. I just appreciate that Xbox seems to be letting developers take risks rather than be stuck in the back half of the 360 era where everything was just Gears of War, Halo, and Forza."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Right? Sony has a couple exceptional movies surrounded by an ocean of garbage. The gaming division is probably the only thing keeping them afloat. Even then I'd argue it's not even thanks to a superior platform. They simply own the right devs and have THE recognizable brand
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Sony can afford to gamble on bad movies, it's part of their strategy.

But acting like they haven't delivered absolute bangers like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Venom, Bullet Train, Elysium, or even the delightful chaos of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs? That's willful ignorance.

Here’s the thing, Sharknado 7 isn’t a masterpiece that demanded sequels. It exists because studios can milk tax write-offs from movies that bomb just hard enough. It’s not about the audience, it's about the balance sheet.

When you're as rich as Sony, bad movies aren’t failures. They’re calculated losses, paving the way for even bigger wins on the projects they actually care about. It's the cinematic equivalent of throwing a pawn to protect the queen."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean... if you're a game Studio and you run to Sony to save you, than Sony it's probably the preferable game Studio you would want to work for."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> People that have friends at least.

You say this as if the modern multiplayer games *weren't* designed around matchmaking complete strangers with each other. I'm not sure there's any correlation between having friends and playing popular multiplayer games, and I'm certainly not confident which direction that correlation would point."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Playing a game more doesn’t necessarily mean you enjoy the game itself more. Personally my enjoyment in multiplayer games come largely from the social aspect, whereas I only play single player games if I really want to play that game itself. I can only speak for myself, but I’ve hopped on a game countless times for countless hours that I didn’t necessarily feel like playing at that moment, but did anyway because some buddies hopped on."

Sony at least releases games, even if they stay console exclusive forever. I can’t remember the last time I was excited for a Microsoft game release. Maybe Gears of War 3 was the last time"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Others addressed that Sony didn't ""buy the IP and sit on it"" but also sometimes things don't need 27 sequels."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You are thinking of Bethesda the studio, the stat refers to Bethesda the publisher which has way more games than Fromsoft"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I thought the story was miles (no pun intended) better. They actually did some pretty interesting things with the villains and the theme of reform was really mature for a superhero story, let alone one told as a video game."

Also, in the gameplay reveal trailer, one of Sam's first lines was ""I make deliveries, that's all'', and then we see him traveling through rugged natural landscapes, unholstering an assault rifle in front of an enemy camp, and sneaking through BT territory."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I asked you a question. Do you have an answer?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"The term ''Strand Game'' refers to the game's Social Strand System, the asynchronous multiplayer feature in which players collaborate with each other by leaving ladders or climbing anchors, building bridges, roads, safehouses, watchtowers, recharging points, ziplines, donating gear and materials, signaling dangers and points of interest, returning lost cargo, even during boss fights another player's character can emerge from the ground to give you weapons and healing items, a multiplayer element about connecting players instead of having them fight each other."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Seriously? and the vehicles? the tons of new features and devices of all kinds that you unlock throughout the entire game? building infrastructure to facilitate and optimize your deliveries? the BTs? the Mules? the terrorist faction? the travels to the world wars? planning your route? planning the gear and tools you will take with you to overcome the dangers and environmental obstacles along the way? the collaborative multiplayer features?

It's also valid not self-impose you to walk everywhere and ignore the interesting game content just because the first opinion you heard about the game was from someone lying that that walking was the only thing it had to offer. That or you only played for 1 hour and assumed you'd seen everything"

However, revenue alone doesn’t determine profitability. Operating profit, which accounts for expenses, provides a clearer picture.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ragnarok had incredible pacing and acting and writing as well. It flowed like an incredible epic action story. Elden ring is amazing in it's own ways but is best experienced in your own path carving your own way. And essentially has no writing or acting performances besides one off characters and boss intros. And deep lore for the writing.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ludicrous. It's absolutely multiplayer; it's just not _PvP_. It literally _can't_ be played single-player.

Lol, No. 

Sony makes great phones, cameras, TVs, audio and musical engineering equipment, ect. Video games aren't even their specialty and they still do it better than most.


Because they are a dominant force in the Tech industry is exactly why they have a dominant console in the first place."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> The gaming division is probably the only thing keeping them afloat.

That's not true, the music record label makes them [more profit than the gaming division](https://www.statista.com/statistics/912798/sony-operating-income-by-segment/). The gaming division is second and the camera and entertainment hardware businesses are third and fourth in terms of profit, respectively.


> They simply own the right devs and have THE recognizable brand

They have the recognizable brand because they built it from the ground up and know how to nurture new developers and build them into powerhouses. Look at Naughty Dog and Insomniac, which were both making lower budget platformers during the PS2 era and are now releasing critically-acclaimed blockbusters.

Invalidating this and acting like they got there by chance is weird considering Microsoft has significantly more resources than Sony and still can't compete with them in gaming."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This is what I have been telling people as well. Kakodawa is going to be bought no matter what, and Sony is the best way for them to go (Tencent is the next big buyer, for example)."

It's kinda dated and I'm tired of the way the characters control, where you touch a rock or a slight incline and your character flops immediately like they are a wet noodle. There's some cool ragdolling, but it ends up hurting gameplay a lot (like in another game that tries this, dragon's dogma 2.)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Red Dead's problems is that it's too bloated.

the campaign is way too long for it's own good."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"And some of the flaws are HUGE, unignorable, and completely pervasive. Down to the very basics like ""controlling your character is clunky and unfun."" And ""there needs to be a better gameplay loop than 'go to place, shoot 30 people, leave place to go to another place.'"""
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I think it's because RDR2 was a much more popular game than GoW with nearly 3x the sales. So I don't think it's so crazy for people to assume that would reflect in awards.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The length of RDR2 is one of my favorite parts tbh. It added a lot to the world and characters and made the emotional moments hit a lot harder. I would disagree with it feeling empty, maybe if you compare it to a linear game like god of war but for an open world game, the world felt very alive and there were always unique moments wherever you went. It’s not for everyone but for the right audience (me) RDR2 is basically perfect, I’ve spent hundreds of hours doing nothing but hunting, fishing, gambling, taking care of my horses, robbing, and just riding around looking at the world."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Rdr2 had better story and character writing, better world design, and more attention to detail across the board. GOW had more engaging active gameplay on average though. Still red dead was the better game by a long shot."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"GOW 2018 is a good story-based action game. 

RDR2 is a creative masterpiece."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I thought Deathloop was pretty good as well. Resident Evil Village while not the best RE game is definitely a solid addition to the series
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yep.  I'd have picked TotK myself but I can definitely see why BG3 won, it's been a gaming sensation."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Hard disagree. It would have definitely been a close contender in 2021.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"True, and the thing that made them both stand out was the characters, writing, and story. Peter and Otto, Jin and Shimura had such great chemistry, the family to adversary shift was so well done and the tragedy of both was just so well executed in spite of the relatively cookie-cutter framework they were build upon. "
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"FH5 and Flight Sim 2020 were two of the highest rated games that launched that year, but these awards always never nominate niche genres for the GotY position."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Highest rated game that year I think. Racing games never get nominated, or even looked at. TGA has a style they like, and I would be very surprised if any heavy multiplayer, live service (launch), or gameplay heavy game will get a win from it. 

Let us be real, CoD has more or less perfected the 'fps' genre, but itll never get a nod because we are used to that sort of perfection for a fps from CoD. Heck the tech from Flight Sim was incredible, but it didnt have a story so it doesnt get looked at."

I own the game


I have played it

I didn't like it

You like it

That's ok

It's too dry and too long of a start of just hours upon hours of walking. I tried to like it but can't. It's a walking sim. There's QoL stuff later on but most of the crap your thinking about is the directors cut shit to make the game more tolerable"

If you liked it before but didn't want to worry about having to play with people to experience the end game content (minus raids), then yeah, I'd recommend it. 

Thats just my personal opinion though. Your mileage may vary."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,As a longtime player I'd say it's fine you want a multi-player experience that also has a lot of single player stuff to do. If you're playing exclusively single player don't waste your time here and play a real RPG.

So if it came out 2016, I stopped playing in 2018ish which means I’ve been playing single player for 6 years and I can honestly say I’m happier because of that choice."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's still Elden Ring, even looking back on it. I've played through both multiple times, but GOWR doesn't hold a candle to the worldwide capture that ER had on the masses. It literally got casual players into the Souls series.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"True. It was one of those years where I wouldn't have begrudged a win for either game. I might prefer Ragnarok a bit more personally, but both are great."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Honestly that's my current favorite live service game. The only reason I don't think Sony has gone all in on it is because they don't own Arrowhead. They own the helldiver's IP, but the studio that made it isn't owned by Sony.

Sony struck gold with helldiver's, and I think if they owned Arrowhead they would be doing a lot more support for it and advertising it, as well as having support studios helping out with content. Iirc Arrowhead doesn't want to be bought, but I can see them being worried if Arrowhead changes their mind down the line and Microsoft offers them a fat buyout. That would completely fuck them over."

Dread was amazing, Village and Psychonaughts were both very good, and Deathloop was a great premise but I found got a touch stale after 30 hours. The only game I found to not be worth a nomination is ironically the winner It Takes Two.

The problem with that year is that, imo, any nominee from any other year would have likely won the award that year. Ff7 or Ghost of Tsushima gets delayed or Horizon or XC3 release earlier? Sure win."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I just wrote that definition 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

As I said in my first comment, it's okay for people to dislike it for legitimate reasons, but if you say that the game is exclusively about walk everywhere you clearly didn't played it for 40 hours, that's the length of the main story alone, you would have seen bosses, enemies, vehicles and everything I mentioned and more."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"If after the first few hours you are walking everywhere instead of using vehicles, raiding enemy camps to farm resources and building infrastructure to facilitate your deliveries, you are doing something deeply wrong, did you stay in the tutorial area for dozens of hours or something?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"No, but you only said that Uncharted is a 7 game that shouldnt be GOTY nominated, and DS is a dumb movie walking sim. That to me is shoving your opinion as a fact and not an opinion"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"That is interesting. Sony generates the most revenue but has the least profit between the big 3.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"yeah, that's kind of what I was getting at with Elden Ring's dominance for that year. It was kind of inescapable in terms of sheer impact."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"100%, i’m playing Dark Souls right now for the first time but never would’ve touched it if it weren’t for Elden Ring (which is now arguably my favorite game)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,i think some people just expect every main story quest in a single player game to be mission impossible the entire way. imho those are just adhd teenagers used to high octane cod campaigns or some shit. sometimes single play RPG's and action RPGs need slower pacing at times to have dialogue with new characters and build relationships. such as atreus and angrboda going around the realm on her little quest. and so forth. i am okay with all of this. its developing a well written story with fully fleshed out characters etc.

>Concord has been around for a long time but is still a favourite eating grape for so many Canadians. This purple-skinned grape has a juicy, sweet ""bubble gum"" tasting flesh and is excellent for processing into jelly, juice etc as Concord grapes do not lose their flavour when they are heated"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I agree. Plus there’s lots of years skipped around presumably so if they really wanted to, they could use the character again and again. Then there’s the multiverse…"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,FromSoftware didn't make the DS1 Remaster. Bandai owns the Dark Souls IP and hired QLOC to make it. It would be up to Bandai to remaster DS3 as well.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,PS6 will have bloodborne be a launch title just like demon souls. Surely it'll be out by then...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I’ve been playing it a lot recently since they did a Halo 2 throwback playlist (Halo 2 maps and settings adjusted to make it play more like Halo 2) and it’s super fun. Infinite had a really rough launch and while it’s not the best Halo game the current multiplayer experience is fun and active enough to be a good time. I still usually pick it over the sweatfest that MCC has become (and the more or less dead game that 5 is).

It's only recently picked up again where we're seeing good games and a lot of them. Uncharted is a popcorn game. It's not a 9 or a 10 imo. I didn't say it was bad... A 7 is good... 

A 9/10 is like Zelda level. Is this anywhere near that? Hell no.

Why don't you talk to me about the game you're mad about.


Last of Us people tend to be unhinged and have fringe opinions. It's like what's going on with that Wicked movie. You have movie watchers (last of us fans) who want to just watch a movie in a property they enjoy and a bunch of theatre kids are singing and being rude in the theatre (last of us two fans), gatekeep it, and start crying at a child's movie. If someone asks them to be quiet or stop crying about it they go on a long winded explanation on how a trope-filled story is the best thing ever written and you ""must not get it"" even though it's the most simple story concept ever.


I'm only expanding on my opinion btw because you had to ironically say I'm wrong on my opinion. I'm not shoving shit in your face that you didn't ask for."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"If your complaint is that the game supposedly exclusively offers walking bored for hours, you probably didn't play it, played 1 hour and gave up, went in circles in the tutorial area, played it blindfolded or something like that."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,No comment on the contents of the list - just wanted to say well done. Clearly lots of work was put into this.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Red dead 1 over red dead 2? And persona 4 that far ahead of persona 5? I love all those games but idk how I feel about that lol.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,What sucks balls after looking to this list is seeing Overwatch 2016 and realizing it's literally the only game on the list that is literally impossible to play anymore. It just... No longer exists... Fuck Blizzard and live service model

Edit: 176 overall. It is redeemed. Although I personally enjoyed it way more than MGSV."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Outer Wilds (#67) is my top game of all time. A little indie studio making their first game and it’s amazing to me that it’s got enough of a following to make it to the top 100.  Truly a masterpiece. 
Space exploration mystery game. Think Journey meets Myst. Go into it (and the one DLC) knowing as little as possible.  It’s an experience you can only have for the first time once."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Hold up, is fallout 3 on there and new Vegas isn’t? If so that’s crazy! Or I might be blind"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Cool!


I'm surprised BotW took the top spot... I always felt it lagged just a bit im the end-game. It's cool to see Half-Life 2 so high, that doesn't get enough love.


Ocarina is still my #1."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I didn't realize how old some of these games were. Like, people were being eaten by grues in 77? Wild."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I just don't get the appeal of Breath of the Wild.

No Balatro?"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The fact that Breath of the Wild consistently hits the #1 spot is absurd

It’s not a bad game, but strip away the Zelda branding and people would realize how empty and bland of an open world game it is"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,My fav game of all time is missing. Where is Terraria? I believe its better than overwatch like wtf

What a great list of games."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I see a lot of good games on this list but holy hell I disagree with the ordering of it. Insert unnecessary “everyone has different tastes” comment.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I installed the RPG filter and what I see is that 95% of the games are not RPG or use a couple of stats or perks in their gameplay. ""To the moon"" and stuff, seriously.."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Where is runescape classic with over a million players?
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Breath of the Wild lmao. Give it another 20 years like OoT and then let's see if it's still considered the best game of all time.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I’m genuinely confused how breath of the wild is consistently across the board the best video game in HISTORY. There are so many other titles that were earth shattering for their time when they came out compared to breath of the wild. I also feel like the talk around it died down fairly quickly , and the item damage thing seems to be a pretty big issue with A LOT of people. Not saying it doesn’t deserve a top spot but I just don’t agree with it being so concretely number 1."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Not surprised the persona franchise cracked the top 100. I am surprised that 4 is on there over 5. Both great games tho
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I just spent 15 minutes browsing your site and realized I hadn't even upvoted your post, or left a comment letting you know what an AWESOME resource this is. Bookmarked your site. Will use it frequently."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Seems like the methodology will favor newer *games* because there are more best games of the year lists in recent years. Is there a weighting to list type or some other method of correction for that? 

I'd also be curious to see how much nostalgia affects the ranking. Meaning if you adjust every list ranking by the approximate age of the author, would you see it clump together?"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I just heard about Okami (top 70) yesterday from some random youtube video the algorithm decided to play. Made me smile today that it got on this list. 
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I never played the last of us so I can hardly judge but it does feel weird to see this being second on such a list.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,All my Bioshock bros should be rejoicing at being #9!!! Feels like a huge honor to be ranked so high amongst all the others
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I was like if The Secret of Monkey Island isent on the list then something is wrong, and there it was at 73. The Secret of Monkey Island is one of the greatest games ever made and probably the greatest point and click adventure game made along side Monkey Island 2 (which is 122). Great to see Grim Fandango on there as well, would have liked Full Throttle also, but you cant get it all. But impressive work and fun to look through."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I think there is a massive issue with this being only indicitive of how the game was received on release. There is no practical way to measure how well games have aged and/or been updated. It's not like reviewers ever go back and update their reviews.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I really enjoyed The Last of Us recently which was the remastered version. Solid game all around. #2 all time though? Not a chance.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,How do I get the website to show me the whole list? It only shows the first 100 for me (Firefox on Android)
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I am incredibly unsurprised the list is heavily slanted toward games from a time when people in their late 30’s to early 40’s would be growing up. That age group is the ones often in charge of making these kind of lists, or at least publishing/editing for the publications that produce them. As such, the nostalgia bias toward that era will be incredibly strong. 

Also the heavy Nintendo bias shows the more European and especially North American bias as those consoles were the most successful over here (to the point for many people, “Nintendo” and “video game console” were synonymous in the early adoption days).

Which is exactly the kind of thing a meta analysis like this should produce. This information and data gathering is exceptional and -gorgeously- formatted. I wish I had a resource like this when I was doing research on game history in college."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Am I dumb or can you not view the full 1000 list? It only scrolls down to 100. For anything else you have to apply filters by decade or year.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Great work, OP!"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"While I'm not surprised to see Breath of the Wild hitting number 1 (Not my cup of tea, but Zelda sweep is expected in just about any list honestly, as evidenced by three titles in the top ~~ten~~ eleven), I am surprised that so many people apparently consider The Last of Us to be one of the best games ever created. I mean it's... it's a fine game, top 50 for sure, but #2 of all time?

It's probably the biggest contributor to the overly cinematic slop Sony love to throw out these days"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Am I crazy or is terraria not on the list
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,In no world are BotW and TLoU the two best games of all time
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"This is amazing, obviously.

But I'll be that guy...

I can't fully get behind any list that puts Sonic 3 & Knuckles behind Sonic 1 and 2, or even puts it as low as it is (458th).

BotW over OoT?  Ugh, ok.  But Sonic 1 over Sonic 3?  Just doesn't make sense."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"How is Journey (2012) considered better than Baldurs Gate 3?

No disrespect to Journey of course, but the two games are so far apart from each other in complexity and production quality, and Journey doesn't even have the excuse of being an early video game like Tetris or the Mario games."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,League of legends is the best and worst game
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It's wild that Minecraft, the overwhelmingly #1 selling game of all time, is #36. It should be top 10, easy."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Having three entries on the top 15 from the Zelda series is crazy cool
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Your methodology is almost certainly got some issues.

(a) it's incredibly console heavy.  
(b) the highest Civilization is Civ IV, at 94, no Quake, no Elite

That's just some games that spend at least an entire decade at #1-5 on most PC gaming lists for starters."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Wow that's actually super cool, sometimes with some friends I do the same with not only videogames, even if we don't treat so much information in such a formal way lol. 

Anyway, rating videogames is really tough tho. Final fantasy 7 or halo combat evolved are not even close to be the best entry in the series, still they got the advantage on being the first, value that in videogames tends to be REALLY blurry sometimes. I mean ff7 is not even bad, it did a magistral job creating what it did on PS1, but at the same time, ff9 is just better in everything, but in ""inventing"" the system. On the other hand, most people should agree on the fact that ff6 is somewhat better than ff7 too, even if it a really old style game even compared to PS1 games. Same goes for DOOM, sure it's a legend, but what would a logical human being play today, DOOM or DOOM eternal? It's really complicated if you ask me, even if there are exceptions, like bioshock, cause at least for now, it's not too old but it's still GOAT. Games such as TETRIS are easier to put on top, since the idea lives up to today too, making them more valuable from an artistic POV. 

I'll stop this monologue now I guess, lol."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Well.... I mean, they're great games, but like every popular favorites list, it's always gonna miss A TON of other amazing games, as well as masterpieces. It's a list with superb games, but definitely not the only ""greatest"" games."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I personally think portal 2 should be higher on the list but oh well
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,No Cyberpunk 2077??? I know it had a bit of a rought start but it's one of the best RPGs out there.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I honestly think this list is super solid. I can't really argue with much of it.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,You misspelled New Vegas.  3 is a strange typo
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Can't argue with the results, but Doom is the best game of all time."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"How can someone do all of this and still end up with a shit list? BOTW the greatest of all time??? It's great, maybe even in the top 10, but definitely not number 1. And Baldur's Gate 3, an objectively better game in many ways, is all the way down in the 40s??? Yikes."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Could you also make categorizations by Company and Country of Origin? I want to know how big the JP/US/EU dominance is.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Thank you for this. I don’t get a lot (if any) time to play games so having a list of “greatest” certainly helps me pick something I haven’t played.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Really awesome work all around, I would very much like to suggest including some sort of options to support/donate.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Awesome list.

I'm surprised that I've not only played, but finished almost all of them. Besides the games you can't actually ""finish"", it's basically the souls games I haven't completed. I have played almost all of them and I keep trying to get into them, but I can't. Even Elden Ring just seemed like banging my head against the wall and that's supposed to be ""easy""."

but now I want more...

I'm wondering if you can add things to the 'Genres' filter?

I was looking for some like: Space, Crafting, First/Third-person(falls under Shooter?), text-based, etc.
I imagine its maybe limited to what the Publications list them as but its a thought.

&nbsp;

Create a list of just ALL games?

Pulled from igdb.com and maybe other sources and then with various filters and sorting options."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,That’s fantastic.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,so hard work to end with the same game list we know for years lol
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Almost all of those games are very good; the order will likely differ person to person.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,That's pretty awesome. And I'm honestly genuinely surprised I had 3 games I liked in the Top 10 and 5 in the Top 20. I really thought I would have to dig for a bit before I found a game I enjoyed.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"There's a bunch of games off the top of my head that I see all the time in top 100 lists that are surprisingly absent.  
Hollow Knight  
Persona 5  
Return of the Obra Dinn  
Something by Remedy (control, Alan wake)

I also wonder how the ""end of the year"" lists versus the ""all time"" lists were weighted"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I'm guessing visual novels were not considered by most/all of these lists given Persona 4 is the only one with the genre tag to make it and that's more of a jrpg. If they were added to consideration I'd probably include Steins;Gate, Muv-Luv Alternative, and Fate/Stay Night in the top 100"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Nice work! If I might add some positive criticism: It would be also good to include when these lists were compiled vs how old the people compiling the list were. Additionally: I could also see the same people updating a list year after year, and as such bias the results."

Its a really powerful tool to bring back memories by seeing what popular games came out in any given year. like the years i was in highschool, showing what games i would play after school or on summer break. or the years just after highschool showing the games i played and heard about while figuring out what to do with my life. its stuff like this that really highlights how big an impact gaming has played in my life and i think that's neat."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I want to see where baldurs gate ranks 10 years from now. My opinion is that it's the best game that has ever been made.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"How is ICO at 59? That game was a glorified escort quest. Everything I've heard gamers say about escort quests suggests this cannot be correct.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"This is a really nice top 100, my ordering would be very different, but I really can’t argue against any of these being included (I’m not quite as high on the Nintendo games, blasphemous I know). Of the games that released in 2000 or later I’ve beaten or at least played the vast majority on this list, I really can’t think of many that are missing. Hellblade, Brothers, Hollow Knight, and Ori and the Blind Forest should all be here imo - Dark Souls 3 (if you include the dlc) and Sekiro are both masterpieces as well. 
  
Edit - I’m dumb, didn’t realize I was missing the full it, I was only looking at the top 100. I still believe the games I listed should make that top 100 list though :)"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,F yeah nice job. I'll be using and linking to this.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Very interesting ! 

The breakdown by decade is very relevant. A lot of games ranks higher with nostalgia factor, which removes objectivity out of the rankings concerning the intrinsic quality of the game. 

So to say, pre-2010 3D games feels very clunky in comparison to newer games. Rendering techniques also evolved since and made players used to new standards, making older 3D games visually very obsolete; whereas 2D games had more time to mature and are less reliant on rendering techniques to look appealing. 
Hence I would always advocate to judge games by today’s standards, as today’s standards is ultimately what makes them enjoyable.

Games like Silent Hill 2 and Resident Evil 4 aged quite poorly, whereas Zelda ALTTP for instance looks crispy clean to this day."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Halo 2 is not my favorite halo, but I am surprised it’s not one here at all. It catapulted online gaming and really changed the landscape for the next 10 years."

Some thoughts/feedback:

Is there enough data to support platform specific lists in the sense that it's based on reviews from sources that are focused on specific platforms?

My thinking here being, for early home computers, a lot of multi-platform games originated on the arcade platform, and could be pretty awful conversions banking on getting sold on the reputations of the original game. Which might be reflected more properly when looking at platform specific critics.

For example when looking at the all time list filtered to only show ZX Spectrum games it shows 38 games. The only game from the developer [**Ultimate Play The Game**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Play_the_Game) (before they became known as Rare and did a little game called Golden Eye) is ranked at 26. UPTG (great games, horrible name) being perhaps one of the most premiere developers for the ZX Spectrum (and me being a Commodore 64 user knowing about this says a lot for those who where around at the time of that specific platform war:) makes me think that list might have looked different when viewed through the lens of lists focused on that specific platform.

I might be wrong and/or I might not have expressed myself clearly, just a thought.

A couple of other suggestions:

It would be nice if all items in the lists where numbered after their place on that specific list (like for a search result), and not only the place on the overall list.

On the **About** page on the site, you should add a link to this post (and any future ones... or past one too for that matter). And other relevant/significant places where discussions about this work of yours (and the ones that helped you) happens:)"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It would be great to do an analysis of the authors of these lists based on which games they have not played. Like, the over-representation of Nintendo generally I feel reflects that they are a family-friendly brand with broad appeal, who have huge market share due to extremely effective branding and marketing. A lot of people might play little or nothing other than Nintendo games. Similarly, how many reviewers play entirely on consoles and have little experience of PC-only games?

Obviously the data doesn't exist and is unlikely to ever be gathered, but I think it would be very interesting."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Thank you so much for this great list! However, I think you’re missing one of the best average rated games of all time, Panzer Dragoon Saga, for the Sega Saturn. Which is no surprise, due to its lack of marketing budget, limited copies and its forgotten nature - it was right at the end of the dying Sega Saturn and even though it had high critical acclaim, almost no one got to play it. Probably the best soundtrack, too. Look up its ratings and you’ll be surprised. It’s very close to Zelda Ocarina of Time regarding those. It basically needs to be on this list. I am making this statement because I was one of the lucky 5000 individuals that got their hands on an original PAL copy and got to play it. Absolutely mesmerizing."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I cant believe the witcher 3 is almost 10 years old already. What the fuck. I played that game into the ground as well. I almost feel like when it came out was Luke 4 years ago. 

Man this list is like time warping me. I see games and I'm like that wasn't too long ago. Chrono trigger I bought from a drug dealer when for 10 bucks when I was a teenager. Probably middle school. As for the list. I was counting them off from the top, I've played about 28 of 50 of those games (stop counting at around 50) as I was growing up.  I kind of feel lucky to have been able to experience these games as they came out or were fairly recently new. 

From my experience,  I dont feel too good about games going forward. As it's probably age, but I don't feel games have excited me enough to go out and play it. I thought I was done buying consoles when the ps4 came out but them metal gear solid 5 was announced and I went to go purchase my ps4. Nothing has really called out to me with the ps5. I really wanted to play the demons souls remake, but I've played the original and I understand what it is now. But as to why I don't feel good about games, it's the microtransactions thing. Like of course I'm wrong, because great games have come out like baldurs gate 3 and elden ring. But I feel like it won't be like the frequency that this list has shown. Like this list has shown that 99 has the most top games of all time. I'd figure 98, or I think 07 was the greatest time for games. 

Just growing up during these past 3 decades for games, had truly been amazing if people who experienced it look back on it. 

I guess, it was a time where we had a game and usually we had to stick with that game and it became great. Now, there are so many options to play games and or transactions Mar a game that it's kind of easy to look past modern day games or get bored of them quickly."

I would like to point out though, for people considering this list for playing good games from older times, that these kind of lists based on reviewers tend to miss niche or games considered iconic. They also tend to favor console games, specially Nintendo.  

For example, Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun is an excellent stealth RTS, but it's too niche to appear.  
Similarly, iconic games like Thief never get mentioned.  
Even games like Fallout New Vegas, that's liked by hardcore Fallout fans doesn't even make it to the list.

There's also on occasions a disconnect between reviews and gamers. Most recent example is latest Elden Ring DLC that got great reviews but got a mild reception from the people (currently 71%, mostly positive in Steam)."

I have been wondering this because I have been thinking lately about how much marketing plays into games, music, books, etc. Look at Tetris for example, it became a mega hit purely because of its gameplay. The fact that it was so good that it managed to escape the USSR to become a global phenomenon seems to me, that in terms of pure gameplay, that it would be #1.

The other 9 on the top 10 list, and the vast majority of the games in the top 100, were all good games, but they were also games that had millions and millions of dollars in promotion. How many games, books, movies, songs, etc. are out there somewhere that would completely blow away what we think of as ""the best"" but simply did not have the right marketing behind them. Do we think the Zelda games are great because they are great, or do we think they are great because we were TOLD they were great when in fact they were just okay but we didn't want to be the ones who disagreed with what everyone else SUPPOSEDLY thinks of the games."

Considering you mention you want this website / ranking to be taken seriously, and also mention it has rigorous metholody.

Is there a source for the ranking/methodology? It's hard to take something like this at face value in any statistically relevant capacity without thorough insights into the methodology, algorithms, and scoring used. Your website doesn't seem to go into detail on this either. It would go a very long way to not have this ranking be essentially a black box that cannot be peer-verified.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Ignoring my subjective opinion that Chrono Trigger is the greatest of all, there are some objective issues with this aggregated list and the method used to construct it:

*  The people who make these individual 'greatest' lists have not played *all* the games listed here, which is the only possible way to have a completely fair evaluation.
* Recency bias is a *major* issue in subjective ordering like this, especially ones that span decades. This makes older titles rank lower down the list.
* Newer lists should NOT be favoured more. No reasoning is given for this and it incorrect to apply random favour here. The reason for this is that there is a type of reporting bias present - many modern reviews are paid/sponsored reviews which raises their scores artificially, meaning recent scores are usually higher than older scores. This means newer lists should be penalised, not favoured.
* The second reporting bias here is also accounted for incorrectly - there are simply more reporters today than in 1990 (for example). A game may get 5 reviews then and 50 now. This means frequency is not a metric to gauge success, and the fact it has been used as such means the output is distorted not minimally but significantly towards modern games.

The meta wasn't always super balanced (The Brigitte launch was really something) but I would have called it one of my top 20 or so games. But that game just doesn't exist any more. It's just gone.

It's because not many people have played really old games or really new games in comparison to games that came out several years ago. I bet if you plot the age of the gamers rating these games, it'll follow the same distribution. I'm not sure how you can account for this situation to get a more accurate list of ""best."""

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"The decade distribution is basically a normal map, or, a Gaussian distribution.

This heavily implies that the games rankings are based on the age of the list writers.

For instance, if you favor newer lists, ppl who are ~40 now (likely to have prominent writing positions), were in there early teens to late teens during the 90s and 00s.

That heavily implies this list is basically the writer's nostalgia.

If you do this again on 10yrs, I'd fully expect the 80s and 90s to drop off, and the 2010s+ to bump up. 

That's not even a guess, it's almost a certainty. Since the decade distribution is just a normal distribution."

Take a quick guess what are the top games with ""Turn-based strategy"" and then check with advanced filters. We mix descriptors for theme, setting and narrative with terms used for mechanics, structure and interface. Few of the terms are so generic they can apply to almost any game, while few are so specific its hard to find examples outside of specific series. Most games are assigned genres that they only have very minor overlap with. Some genres have significant overlap and things that separate them might be meaningless, while there are subgroups that have meaningful dividing factors."

Like Halo 2 for example despite getting CE/3 of which neither had the same impact. This is important because Halo 2 basically had a full on chokehold on xbox live until late 2007 despite not even being on the current latest generation while sitting atop the list at the end and its the reason most matchmaking/lobby/friends/dashboards lists look the way they do today on services like xbox live or just games in general. When a game that was one of the most enjoyed/played of all time on top of being something that visibly changed the gaming industry doesn't make the top 100 but the secret of monkey island does it kind of exposes how seriously anyone should ever take these things. There probably aren't 20 games all time to have that much impact. This one in particular is an indictment being delivered to gaming media/journalism

There's also games like oldschool runescape that silently prove their worth via people actually playing and enjoying them and for whatever reason they aren't on the list despite heavily outperforming almost the entire top 100 for actual decades. You can tell the lists you're pulling the information from are kind of not really plugged into what players are really doing and its just some journalist typing out their feelings. 

There's also the super questionable picks for top 100 like Outer Wilds. I got that game for free to play and its not a *bad* game but lol it is certainly not a top 100. That shit is totally gassed up by marketing worth a play though"

Additionally, there's a large number of influential and/or financially or critically successful PC, handheld, and mobile games that simply don't seem to get any visibility in favor of whatever the AAA flavor of the month game is.

For instance, if I sort your site by 4X genre, it's largely dominated by Civilization games, and not even the better ones. Civ IV is not the best game in the franchise by a long shot, certainly not better by 200 spots than Civ V and definitely not better by 400 spots than Alpha Centauri, which is an extremely influential game in the 4X space. The list doesn't even include Master of Orion 2, which has an entire cottage industry of MoO2 clones due to just how much it defined the Space 4X genre.

I am surprised Portal didn't rank higher.  It's not bad but I see it so universally liked (for good reason) I thought it would have done better.

Again, just my surprise.  I believe the OP's data and think they did a great job.  We are lucky we have people like this willing to do this work."

Yeah OP  your opinion is worthless. You should be ashamed of yourself."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Omg really? Legend of Zelda BOTW sucks in my opinion. It’s way too childish. Never understood how someone post 10 years old like it.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Not a single game on this list that I feel isnt a top game so thats good at least. 

The ordering is just chaotic and ""random"" enough that it seems fair. 

Theres the stupid part of me thats somehow disappointed I didn't find a game I didn't know on this list. But unknown gems are quite literally not what gets onto these lists.

And then theres the irrational monkey brain thats annoyed that Breath of the wild is the very top when it was missing so many things that I used to love about zelda games. Like ocarina of time, majoras mask, a link to the past and wind waker all made the list as well and breath of the wild/tears of the kingdom just feels like a their open world spinoff in a way"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"BOTW, number 1?

I am a big Zelda fan, but I personally think BOTW was one of the weakest Zelda games. It was like a proof of concept open-world game where they tacked on Zelda IP and assets, then called it good. It is one of the weakest open-world games I have played and didn't feel like a Zelda game at all. There were no dungeons, no item unlocks, no exploration opened up by said items, etc. The shrines were tech demos with a puzzle added, and nothing Zelda-like about them. I just don't understand the appeal and accolades it got. The sequel was better and had more Zelda-like qualities, but it still does feel like any of the other games in the franchise. I understand trying to break the mold and change it up, but you can't just drop all the elements that made the franchise good."

I'd find it more interesting if certain games were swapped with arguably better versions or very similar games that offer about the same experience but with a modern touch.

Like I'd say Doom Eternal 2020 should be swapped with Doom 1993 or Super Mario Kart with the 64 version or even a more recent one."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"No offence to your work, but this is probably the most generic list of ""best games"" I have ever seen. It's like a re-re-rehashed IGN ""best games of all time"" list that has been streamlined through hundreds of iterations. The resulting list is more like a ""statistically most popular games of all time"". The top of the list includes a slew of popular 7/10 games imo, but very few true masterpieces are found near the top of this list.

The historics are quite interesting, I guess.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Sorry, that's not explained very well. It means that, as you go through the list, starting from the highest rated game, what's the first year/decade to have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc. games on the list. So, ""6. 1990s"" means that the 1990s is the first decade to have six games on the list (then I have listed all of the games). It's essentially a measure of which years/decades sew the release of a lot of particularly highly acclaimed games. I hope that makes it a little clearer."

Factorio essentially kickstarted the genre of automation games off the back of mods for other games, and they have done nearly everything right. 

They had to custom build an engine because the things they wanted to do weren't generic game development principals and boy it paid off insanely well.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I think probably the merging of all time vs. end of decade vs. end of year lists is likely responsible for this. I assume there's some biasing here going on that isn't really getting well accounted for.

> In total there are 98 all time lists, 51 end of decade lists, ~570 end of year lists

The time frames of the ""all time"" ones significantly impact which of those will be available, and the volume of end of year lists has changed over time. 

Also there's some odd inclusion of ranked vs. unranked lists that probably make the data hard to calculate. Some of the ""game of the decade"" lists like the ""CoG’s Top 20 Games of the Decade"" omit RDR2 entirely, which strikes me as super odd.

Would say there's gonna be a lot of noise created by lists that weren't entirely created with this in mind. Ars Technica's GotY list sure reads a lot like an unordered list other than their winner being called out as 1st as Celeste. But they put RDR2 at 11th while still saying, ""Red Dead Redemption is one of the best games of the decade, and its sequel bests it in every way."" Yet rank it behind F1 2018. I'd imagine there's a fair bit of this type of thing going on. (And given OPs note that losing against lower ranked games is a penalty, could skew things quite a bit.)

Probably trying to make an ordered list out of this data is extremely hard and maybe even a lost cause. May have been better to try to group things into tiers based on breakpoints in the aggregate numbers rather than a pure ranked list.

Really appreciate the effort from OP but without being able to see the calculations or numbers, it's hard to figure out some of the oddities."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Why isn't my personal favorite indie title higher on the list!!

It's only in the top 150 when it should be top 5 at least (top 1 actually)"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,The love I see for this game definitely makes me think I need to play it sooner than later.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Just so you know, because of your comments I have bought this game. So excited!"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Outer Wilds is so amazing, and I think the fact that it has a relatively small following compared to almost any game on this list while still showing up this much and anecdotally getting recommended so much says enough about it

For those interested in playing it, if you have any questions before or during the game, go to r/outerwilds, not google. The people over there are good about answering questions. It's a safe, spoiler-free environment and people like answering questions over there about anything relating to the game. Easily the best place on the internet to ask about it."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"BoTW at top spot is a bit galling. Just not a game that oozes originality out of every pore. 


Even if not best overall, Outer Wilds deserves that top 2019 spot many times over. And honestly, a top 10 overall finish would be deserved IMO. "
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"New Vegas didn't do so well critically on release (mostly due to bugs). It kinda started to get a much better reputation a while after it came out, but by that point, most of the reviews had already been done."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The list is more of a popularity contest than anything and at the time the list were made fallout 3 was the golden child of Bethesda . The list is also very console centric and the impact of alot of pc exclusive games are just ignored such as fallout 1/2 , planescape torment and thief so games that have a similar audience such as new vegas are also absent."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"more people in general prefer 3, hardcore fans (ppl on sub reddit) prefer new vegas"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Fallout 3 was really mind blowing when it came out, with new Vegas people knew what they were getting. I was so giddy to get a copy for Christmas in 2008."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Fallout 3 sold more, reviewed better, had better fan reception. Fallout New Vegas was really hated when it came out because it was buggy, world design was worse, exploration was worse and it crashed. A lot."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"I tried playing it a few times and it just never really felt that good. Tetris, Skyrim, Diablo.. there are just too many other games with a lot more going on that are just as easy to pick up and play. BotW being #1 isn't uncommon but I feel like, in a decade, we'll see other games reclaim their place ahead of it once the lengthy honeymoon phase is over."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I'm a huge LoZ fan and BotW is probably the 4th best Zelda game, behind ALttP, OoT, and Windwaker. I loved the game, but I strongly disagree with it being No. 1"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Not every game is for everyone homie. I loved it.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I enjoyed it but the world was too barren, it's a game about exploring but there's nothing to find apart from seeds and another little dungeon puzzle.

The concept is amazing but it was just lacking a little atmosphere for me."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I'm the same with Elden Ring. It probably is just as good as everyone says, but it doesn't do it for me.

Some times that's just how it is. Everything isn't for everyone. It's ok."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I don't get it either. I very quickly got tired of the world being empty, full of the same enemies and having to swap broken weapons way to often"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I think its one of those games where your frame of mind makes a difference to the experience. I first picked it up on the switch, gave it a few hours then left it because it didnt seem that interesting

I didnt touch it again for 4-5 years

Then on a whim i decided to pick it up again because the wife was away on work for a couple of weeks. Loved it. 

If you go into it thinking “i need to level this skill, upgrade my gear, max out this stat” etc then it doesnt make for a great game. But if you instead take it as something to explore then its absolutely great. 100’s of mini puzzles, dozens of mini dungeons. Quests to find, secrets to discover, then its far more enjoyable. 

This ironically is why i wasnt bowled over by tears of the kingdom. Its largely the same people, same places. I already knew where i was going. The underground area was dull and the cloud areas are sparse and repetitive. 

Give it another go"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,RDR2 is #42...I humbly disagree

It felt like I'd played it multiple times before. "
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"There's always this comment lol

Not every game is for every person. One of the reasons I love BotW is how quiet and minimalist it is compared to other open world games. But that's not everyone's cup of tea, and that's okay."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"omg I didn't notice that hahaha. 

Balatro is too new to be eligible. It takes time for games to start appearing on lists, unfortunately."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I feel this whole lists shows that there's been a pretty abundance of Nintendo bias in game media basically forever. 

People who work in the industry and compile these kind of lists just seem to have an affinity for Nintendo."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Eh. I never played a Zelda game before and have no nostalgia for it, but I still loved Breath of the Wild. It didn’t feel empty or bland to me.

I think it’s a genuinely amazing game that did a lot of things very well, but I also agree that it’s very much overrated, too. It has no business being #1. Somewhere in the top 100? Definitely. Top ten? Maybe. "

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I disagree on the branding part. I hadn't played a Zelda game since NES in the mid-80s, so I have no attachment to the brand at all. I found the world to be really engaging, though it did take a few tries to get into it. With that said, it ain't no RDR2 in terms of an open world being jam packed with things to do and see. Much different objectives (specifically creativity and exploration)."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Great game, even a classic. Best game of all time? Nowhere close."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It's Ubisoft Zelda. Feels like a Far Cry game to me (a polished one to be sure, but just super repetitive). 

Enjoyable enough, but feels like a 7.5-8/10 type of game to me. Wouldn't crack my top 10 games that I've played in the last 5 years, let alone of all time."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"With the exception of a few of the gameboy games (never had a gameboy color/advance), I've played every single Zelda game, starting from the original on the NES.

Zelda Breath of the Wild is a good game, but its not really a Zelda game. Its certainly Zelda themed, and they nailed the aesthetic, but the overall game play felt generic and empty. The durability mechanic is almost universally loathed, and I feel like the dungeons (the highlight of a Zelda game) were awful and poorly put together. To make up for this, you get 100 miles of open empty fields with the same dozen enemies in different colors.

I'm not surprised its on the list, I am just disappointed its above 10th place. Maybe there's some kind of nostagia googles people have it for it, similar to OOT? Although to be fair, OOT was probably one of the greatest games ever made when it came out."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I would consider myself a hardcore gamer, playing dozens of new games per year. Mostly single player or pve types. It confuses me why every critic had this games nuts in their mouths. I tried it twice and couldn’t make it past the 2/3 mark. It’s so bland and boring. I remember when it came out, you would have thought Christ returned and made this game. It’s not bad but it’s like a 7. Have heard the masterpiece and GOAT title slapped on it too many times online."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"This is why I think it’s crazy that people say that  BotW is better than TotK. 

They’re essentially the same game, just TotK filled up BotWs empty world with a ton of *stuff*"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I mean, if it's consistently rated #1, then it can't be. Enough people love it that it reaches #1 multiple times"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It always amazes me how stacked these lists get towards Nintendo games. 


I seem to be surprisingly alone in this. Like a lot of people I've been a hardcore gamer since I was a wee child, but we were a Megadrive family, then PS1, then PC. No NES/SNES/Gamecube here. 


I've then had an undercurrent of consoles along side PC, but it's been PS2, 360, PS3/4/5. 



Literally never had a Nintendo console. Not even a gameboy. The only flirting I did with handheld gaming was a PSP."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Exactly what I think as well. If someone told me that’s their Goat game I would never listen to their gaming opinion again.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Straight up not true
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I think all modern Nintendo games are heavily overrated.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"A lot of nintendo defender in the comments, but you're right because it's just not a good game. It was just good enough at a time when the switch was coming out. I have my own personal distastes about it, but in general it's just a boring ass game in a big empty world"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It seems like a lot of the top games in this list are there because of story or theme/‘vibe’ and not really because they are doing anything super awesome from a gameplay perspective (there are some in there that do, obviously, and obviously that’s pretty subjective)"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I think a big part of it is that it isn't meant to be played to completion. It's meant to be played enough to beat. From that perspective it will appeal more to people who spend less time pouring into each game, either because they play more games, or just have less time to play. Even still it's a systems rich game that has depth if you're the type willing to speed run, or hunt for unconventional solutions.  
  
I can certainly get being disappointed in it, but not every game can be for everyone for hundreds of hours. BotW is great for a lot of people for 20-40, and good to some for hundreds."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It's the same reason that Budweiser sells exponentially more than a craft brew... at some point being the best is about some appeal to the least common denominator, having mass branding and distribution, etc.   

All of that matters just as much as being the objective #1 highest quality, best version of something.  Heck, I still meet people who think Halo invented the FPS and is the best possible version in that genre... it isn't, it never was, it just had a casual accessible appeal with the might of Microsoft backing it."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"I've enjoyed every Zelda game except for BotW, I had to force myself to finish it. It's just like with Halo Infinite, a mediocre open world that isn't as good as well designed levels. 

I hate the fact that due to it's popularity, we'll never be seeing a classic styled Zelda game again..."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Can't remember another game that I lost interest in as fast as BotW. Long time Zelda fan, remember being a kid and my mom helping me beat the NES titles and then being able to beat A Link to the Past by myself. Loved Zelda, BotW just didn't feel like Zelda to me. And didn't feel like a strong open world RPG either. Baffled how it could be in the top 10, much less #1."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Its on Switch, its Nintendo, it gets played by 20 million normies who all think its the best because they've only played Candy Crush and Lego Star Wars"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,It hits #1 because people overwhelmingly love it. It's not that hard to understand.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"No, it deviated from the idea YOU had of the ""Zelda brand"", but it's still a Zelda game.
It's clearly not perfect for sure, the formula could (and I hope it will be) improved on many points, but not seeing the quality in certain aspects, the will to innovate, to offer a game with great freedom, creativity, diversified gameplay with emerging mechanics etc, is quite incomprehensible imo.

This is the type of open world we need to go towards, more interactive and organic worlds with a lot of créative ways for the players to go through"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"You took the words right out of my mouth. It is absolutely criminal that people say BOTW is a better game than Half Life 2. I bet over 50% of the people who even voted in these aren't old enough to even appreciate just how revolutionary the Half Life series were let alone play them.

The Nintendo fanboyism has to stop. The world/story of BOTW was bland and had questionable design decisions that negatively impacted gameplay such as weapon durability. It isn't a bad game it just is nowhere near the #1 game of all time spot. It's so exhausting always seeing fanboyism taint these lists every time."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"This is why I think it’s crazy that people say that  BotW is better than TotK.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Elden Ring was a far better Zelda game than BotW
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"There's nothing special about the Zelda branding. If you take away nostalgia goggles, they're not good games. They're just simple puzzlers with negligible difficulty."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I'm surprised that it's not there as well. It gets talked about a lot, but it doesn't show up on lists for some reason. Perhaps that will change in the future, who knows."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Agreed. I think that whole era of ""games that desperately want to be movies"" has aged out poorly. Everything else in the top-10 is a game that is very much a game and I have no beef with the other selections there."

If you're feeling challenged or invalidated by this list then you're taking it the wrong way.

Your opinion is still your opinion, worth as much to you today as yesterday.

This list is something that's intriguing and fascinating to look at but it's not meant to be THE objective truth and measure of quality. That is something that isn't possible with subjective media in any circumstances."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Glad I didn't have to scroll too far to find this! My only gripe.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The rankings of recent games are bound to be unstable. Baldur's Gate 3 could move up very easily if it does well on the next few lists, whereas Journey's position should be fairly stable for now."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Was a way better game at launch. Everything being min maxed and everyone knowing all the details and macro techniques makes it a very stressful game like starcraft 2.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"And Terraria is in the top 10 selling games of all time, but doesn't even break 100 on this list. Though that's a bit different since it's been on sale for as low as $2 before. I still think it deserves to be in the top 100 though, and I do agree Minecraft should be higher as well.

Honorable mention to Wii Sports, the 4th best selling game which isn't in the top 100 on this list (but realistically most of those sales are because it was bundled with the Wii lol)"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I don't know of any publications that require a specific kind of release (physical/online) in order to be eligible, so I believe that is a minor issue. As for games that had issues upon release, but which have been improved with patches, that's another story. The short answer is that such games are probably underrated for now. That will fix itself over time as more lists come in, but to fix it in the moment would be extremely tricky. I have some ideas for how it might be possible, but it's not a priority for now."

Tactics is my second favorite ff game. I've still never gotten around to playing 4, I will sometime. Barely played 13, no 15 at all yet. Weirdly I've been getting back into 2d rpg's, but not the actual classics, I actually prefer more modern indie games made in the style of the classics."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I love RDR2, but I think its problems warrant it being lower on this list. I could see how the game's length and the repetitive shootout segments in the later acts would turn people off of it."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"One of the sources for the list seems to be ""Best of the Year"" lists, and of course CP77 launched too late in its year and in far too bad a state to make it onto such lists. And of course the game's redemption arc doesn't help much unless it was formally re-released and re-reviewed later on (maybe in ten years when it gets a remaster and comes auto-packaged with *Phantom Liberty*).

Although having said that, both *No Man's Sky*, which had some of the same problems, and *Starfield*, which hasn't even really started its redemption arc yet (but at least worked, more or less), are on the list, which feels weird if CP77 is not."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"it didn't have a ""bit of a rough"" start. it had one of the worst releases... but luckily they fixed it and now it's a 10/10 (maybe 9/10) imo. it definitely deserves to be somewhere on this list"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"> New Vegas

It's no. 153.

Which makes no sence if Fallout 3 is no. 51, since New Vegas is clearly the better game."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"A lot of it is nostalgia but a lot of it is also how good the game was at the time it was released. Sure, by today's standards you can't compare M64 with RDR2. But in the time that M64 released it was an absolutely incredible game that influenced many many games after that. RDR2 kinda just took already existing concepts and just executed them super well but M64 was a ground breaker. There were a ton of open-world shooters by the time RDR2 released, this was just the best of them. There weren't a lot, if any, 3D platformers by the time M64 released though.

Same goes for games like Half-Life 2 or the original Doom for example. Playing it today the game isn't anything amazing. But back then? It was like nothing we've ever seen before."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"You kind of had to be there.  By today's standard, SM64 is janky and weird, but it really changed what we thought games could be.  Simply being 3D and being able to go in any direction was jaw-dropping in 1996.  There was nothing else like it."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I dunno I actually think you could have an argument about this. I have seen some video essays about rdr2 and how often if you don't do exactly what the game wants you to in missions it swats your hand and says ""No! do it the way **I** want you to"" for even the smallest things. It's on the surface supposed to be this open world game where you creatively approach problems but you get told by the game no do it this way.

Compared to the design of mario 64 which is a 3D platformer you leap and jump around in. Ye it's not exactly an open world there are distinct levels but you are capable of doing what you expect to be able to. I think as far as following the apparent game design goals they outwardly present mario 64 succeeds far more than RDR2"

Gaming journalists strike me as people who see that as indicative of an amazing game. I grew up playing the major N64 games that are seen as the greatest of all time on this list. I never thought they were that amazing, even as a kid. It was strange when I went on game forums and saw them being given 10/10s and the best games of all time.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Weighting older lists doesn't make any sense, because less games were published when that list came out.

When you compare ""all time greats"" lists against each other and look at a list from 1999, then it's no surprise to see only titles from the 90's on it.

However, when you've the same list from 2024 and there are still some titles from the 90's on it, after 25 years of game development and new releases, then you can be sure that the old games that are one it must have something great to them. 

That's why giving newer lists more impact makes sense. Compiling a greatest games list from lists which featured less competition makes it inaccurate."

While the old big companies like EA and others are mtx heavy now , it's not that today's games are bad rather they're less impactful. This might be a hot take but I'd say Celeste is a better game than super Mario World , or Hollow Knight is better than Super Metroid. Yet , their impact can't be overstated. And , the first type of a game you play will be more memorable than the rest in the genre. AAA games are big budget so they tend to take less risks ."

Look at the [""all-time"" lists](https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/lists/?limit=100&offset=0&type=A) used, and you'll see why earlier decades seem over represented... there just aren't that many from the 2020s yet. Best of decade lists are also used, and we won't get one of those until 2030."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"> I find it interesting post 2020 we have a drop off of games making it into top 1000 or top 100.

That's almost certainly just because of how short the decade is. Don't forget that not only are we halfway through, but that some of these games did not launch with GOAT level scores but instead received retrospective praise (See: Earthbound, for example) which cannot happen to 2020 games yet, plus ordering of games can place more games in the later half of the decade.

For a similar example from a different medium, watch how Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time has albums from the 2000s make up a bigger bulk of the list as time goes on, and how in 2003 only 12.2% of the list was albums from the 90s while by 2023 it had gone up to 20.2%.

But I personally judge games more on overall quality and less on gameplay. the things I rate at top are stuff like Chrono Trigger, Bioshock, Fallout New Vegas, TLOU2, Witcher 3, and FF10.. All story focused. 

not everyone's thing but I just cant find a game No. 1, that is all just good gameplay and nostalgia for the feeling you had when you first played the franchise."

Of those genres I only spot The Sims, SC2K and CivIV on the list, two of which are in the bottom 20. Meanwhile very popular/well acclaimed games such as Factorio, XCOM, Rimworld, Rollercoster Tycoon, the other Civ entries,  etc. are missing."

Which honestly doesn't surprise me as it's a niche game genre whose popularity really lies in Japan.

Post DDR/Guitar Hero/Rock Band era, rhythm games in the US might see a break out niche title once in a great while.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,that is what I feel is the issue with this guys method for creating the list. Ignoring audience polls and focusing on reviewers. Reviewers notoriously glaze Nintendo titles. often 10 out of 10 always.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Seems the sentiment has changed. Most people view New Vegas as a better game than Fallout 3. Is this a list of game on release or all time?

Having said that, the impact BotW had on the gaming medium was massive: it's really impressive from a gaming design standpoint, it's literal wizardry on a technical level, and totally remarkable to be the first open world game in the series and the first from Nintendo. It's just Nintendo demonstrating that decades later they're still kings in the business. Nostalgia aside, I firmly believe it's a totally deserved #1."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I have a few friends that absolutely love it and I tried to like it but I didn't enjoy it at all. It's a shame because I love the Zelda franchise. Completely skipped over tears of the kingdom.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I like it a lot, but #1 of all time? Absolutely not lol"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I didn't enjoy Elden Ring as much as others (I still finished it but it overstayed it's welcome in the 2nd half) but I can see why some would rate it as a 10/10 game while with Breath of the Wild, I just don't get it. There are several better Zelda games even"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,The weapons is what lost it for me. Nothing feels special. I shouldn’t need to constantly worry about my steel sword shattering. Less effective sure. But completely broke and now I have to finish the fight with my remaining sticks? No thank you
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I felt the same about tears of the kingdom. I loved it at first. The beginning on the big sky island was fun. The new powers and building contraptions was fun. I liked that the world felt a little more lively. But once the novelty wore off, I felt like I was just playing BoTW again. "
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Yup, that’s why I quit, the weapon degradation. I also hated the cooking. The game just wasn’t that fun. I love almost every game on this list, except No. 1."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"it's baby's first open world game. there's some good ideas, there, but, when you're climbing towers to unlock parts of the map, you just feel like you've already done all this shit in other games over a decade ago."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,All the menus you had to dive into certainly hurt the game I think. Tears of the Kingdom was 1000 times worse with the menu hell.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,">  I never played a Zelda game before

Personally I feel like that kinda helps, it's the least 'Zelda' Zelda game there is"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Funny I always assumed my lack of nostalgia for Zelda was why I thought BOTW was so bland and boring.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,And RDR2 is 42 on the list? This is some bullshit
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Popularity does not mean it's inherently good.

Justin Bieber's ""Baby"" is an objectively shallow, uncreative song, yet it was absolutely massive and wildly popular at one point. That doesn't mean it's wrong to like it, but to pretend it was some lyrical masterpiece definitely is wrong. And if you want an extreme example, well... Hitler was pretty popular at one point, the German people loved him.

Just about anything Nintendo puts out gets a bump in popularity and praise just because it's Nintendo. They have a ton of brand loyalty among a lot of people, similar to how a lot of ""Disney Adults"" will worship anything Disney puts out."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Nintendo is just incredibly consistent with their first-party games. They're nearly always incredibly polished and heavily focused on the ""fun"" aspect of gaming over anything else. It's honestly impressive that they still manage to put out bangers to this day."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"> it always amazes me how stacked these lists get towards Nintendo games.

> Literally never had a Nintendo console."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,... maybe try owning a nintendo game then you'll understand?
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"They never take the crown for best game/studio of any era, but I can’t think of a time when they ever dropped out of the top 3."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,">I seem to be surprisingly alone in this.

There are dozens of us!

Don't get me wrong, Nintendo made some good games in the past, but a lot of the discourse surrounding them (and a lot of gaming nowadays, tbh) feels like people only ever play on Nintendo consoles."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I mean, they make a lot of genuinely great games, it's not super hard to understand lol. To me, they really hit their stride in the gamecube era, but they've been consistently making great games for like 40 years now"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"You say it yourself, it’s not perfect. If it’s the number 1 game I perfection is what I expect"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Sure. But by your own description does that sound like the greatest game of all time?
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,So you mean it was an attempt by the Zelda team to cash in on current gaming trends (like Open-World survival) badly? I agree. At least Tears had stuff that made it interesting.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"TotK added an annoying building system that, while deep, was either abused or ignored depending on your play style but made the durability mechanic *worse* by having you fix your weapons by tacking on stupid accessories to them. That and forcing the story to be told in the order you find the tears instead of sequentially was a big miss for me."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,The question is would we have Elden Ring if we didn’t have BOTW.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I think it’s a game that’s had a slow burn. It’s been around for so long and has been popular for so long, but never had one year where it really really broke out, if you will. Which is sort of what this kind of list requires."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Any time someone asks me my favorite Zelda game, I say Okami. lol

It's definitely in my top games of all time. Love it to pieces."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,I would agree with you but we are very much in the games are turning into movies and tv shows era. And I mean that literally.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Same issue on iOS. Just has the Home, FAQ, etc links at the bottom after the 100th game and the top is only the filters and the website nav bar."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Same issue on Firefox Desktop.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Ah yeah fair enough, I hadn't considered that BG3 will appear in more lists over the next few years.

Thanks for putting all this together, a very impressive project!"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"For me, it's 100% the length and pacing issues. It's an impressive game in a lot of ways, but i don't think I will ever be able to beat that game start to finish without several year long breaks in between. It's just such a fucking slog for me."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I was disappointed that they built such an incredible wilderness and nothing really challenged you at all. It never felt like you were in any danger whether out in the world or even in a shootout, with auto lock-on, etc."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"No but we're here to discuss the list, not share deepities"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Depends on what makes a game better to you. I think fallout 3 has better world design, which for some people will outweigh the better quest design of fallout New Vegas.

Fallout 3 is also significantly more stable than New Vegas."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The fact that they decided to just choose a bunch of lists by ""editorial staff"" without any other factors consider was always going to make this list a look at what was trendy in video game media at the time the list was made, not the actual quality or popularity of the games. 

I think OP put in a lot of effort, and I appreciate that, but this is more a meta analysis of games journalism than it is a list of ""the best games""."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"New vegas is the only fallout game I stopped playing. Probably pretty unpopular, but I'd take f4 over NV every day"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,It’s also comparing wildly different games. I have no desire to play RDR2 because from what I’ve seen I wouldn’t enjoy it much at all. But I could pick up Mario 64 right now and have a blast with it.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I wasn't trying to disparage your list, I was just thinking out loud mostly :)"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Yeah but Runescape and Old School Runescape is even more different than the Zelda series, hard to compare them."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Single player games don’t have another player which takes away a whole part of the experience.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Thank you I didn't notice. Hope for seven to be a banger
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Facts man

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Check out project Diablo 2.  It’s a multiplayer mod that keeps true to the original game but adds a little bit of flavor from POE.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Thanks for the intel, I’m not shocked it pops up low ranked. But the game is alive and well. At least Old School is. Are old school runescape and runescape separated?"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-16,"Agreed, HL1 is a mess, but it's a mess that formed me. Xen is not canon in my head."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It was extremely mediocre.

Deus Ex, Half Life and numerous others were far more important and definitely way better in all aspects, if not even revolutionary.

Sim City 2000, ICO, Tomb Raider… damn, so many games that brought so much into the industry. Halo just recycled and maybe refined some aspects, but definitely nothing revolutionary or great.

Sure, it was easy for casual gamers, that’s why it was popular. But popular != great.

Halo is simply overrated.

Multiplayer is a different different subject."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"popularity shouldn't have a link with the ranking for best game, Minecraft is the most popular game ever but it isn't the best because of it"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I guess I need to work on my self depracational humor.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Thanks for the explanation. I must have graced over that in your post. I understand the purpose better from a ""general media outlet tendencies"" point of view rather than as the ""de-facto best games of all time list"" (which it could be construed as in some sense)

I do think the project is interesting, and I can tell quite a bit of effort went in. I am uncertain, however, about the usefulness of the result."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It means that the 2010s is the first decade to have three games on the list, and that those games are the abovementioned games, plus the 6th game on the list, which is The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. It's an interesting metric, but it's also confusing, I know."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"2004 and 2007 are literally the Golden years, absolutely mental releases."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The majority of lists that came after it prefer to list AC2, which, to be fair, is a major improvement. Ezio became the icon of the series. Same with Uncharted 2 eclipsing Uncharted.  
  
This is an odd quirk of ""best"" lists where you're tight for space. If you can list AC2 (or well liked future games like Black Flag), would you spend an entry on the original?"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Or in any vein honestly. Those games are incredible and far too few people have played them
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"There's people who weren't able to get a Switch at launch but still wanted to play the new Zelda.

That's atleast the only people I know that played it on the Wii U."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,No….thats me 😂
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"If they used the Head to Head scheme for determining results, it wouldn’t matter because any games that didn’t exist yet wouldn’t be affected by the lack of comparisons, unless the method used determines “any games not on the list are considered joint last place” as opposed to “any games not on the list are considered unranked”."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Yeah but the 90’s, 2000’s, and 2010’s all hover around close to 30% of the list. The rate of 2020’s isn’t keeping up with how those decades did. 4.5 years in you would expect closer to 10% of the list. Not 5%. There is definitely a drop off of games making it into top 1000 or top 100 on lists, even with recency bias helping them out."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Not only that but games that rated well back in the day, then slowly dropped down the lists as newer better games were released are over represented.

Let’s not forget that this is also published lists, meaning in many cases money changed hands between game publisher and list maker. There are a lot of games in the top 100 that do not rank above games that don’t have big name publishers.

Not only that ‘Top 100’ lists have become redundant, not much attention is paid to those, reviews on platforms like Steam are as far as most people go in their research. Those types of scores need to be incorporated in this list.

A really cool concept, and a lot of work for sure, but it doesn’t tell the whole story in terms of the true best games of all time.

LoZ link to the past at 11 and Minecraft in the 30s?"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Yeah, 100%. We've had some insanely good games very recently, it's just that there is a such a bloat of good games that we remember the first ones more fondly."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Yeah that’s probably a factor too.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Skyrim is very much the people pleaser choice cause it’s really like an 8/10 but when it released people where on the Bethesda train and if this game was released today even with updated graphics and combat equivalent to star-field it would be torn apart to a similar but lesser extent than starfield as it’s very flawed particularly in combat and story .
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"To be honest for an objective list it’s impossible due to the nature of the industry however that doesn’t mean there are so massive gaps , like new vegas achieved its cult like status only in the last couple years ( for good reason games great) so that got excluded from the list . Games like planescape torment which is very niche but one of the best written games ever is always missing of these list ."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"There are actually quite a few XCOM games, two of which are just outside the top 100. Some people are experiencing a bug where the page numbers aren't appearing, but if you use the search function you should be able to find them. Rollercoaster Tycoon is also there at 548th."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"That's a heck of an endorsement, guess I'll be looking to make time for it."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I remember when Skyward Sword came out and seeing reviews like ""the Loftwing flying is clunky and annoying, and it is frustrating that the game makes you backtrack through levels, the visuals are bad which is a great aesthetic, overall we give this a 10/10"". Every time a Zelda, Mario, or Metroid game comes out then reviewers act like they reinvented the wheel by using the exact same core story and game mechanics that exists in every iteration of the franchise."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"I bought and played it on launch, I could not get out of the first town it was THAT buggy and prone to crashing. It was ridiculous. 

It's a fantastic game when it works, which took a long time before it did, long after people had stopped reviewing it."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"That is mostly online sentiment. You need to realize Fallout New Vegas has a very online player base that is very loud but is a rather small group.

If you were to ask online which game is better , 4 or New Vegas, a lot of them would say New Vegas. Than you would look at which Fallout game people are playing and realize most people play 4. In fact, if you were to ask the same about 76, same would apply. 76 has more players than New Vegas.

What people say online does not represent reality in all cases. A small rabid fanbase is going to dominate conversations online more than a large group of casual players."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It is amazing, and the only thing holding it back from being the best game is that it was rushed at the end and that triforce treasure diving shit was thrown in"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I'm in the same boat as you, the Zelda franchise has some of my personal favorite games of all time, but I could not stay interested in BOTW and also never picked up Tears."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Echoes of wisdom looks interesting
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I feel like Tears was so much worse that Breath. I loved the story, but the constant menu switching was brutal and annoying. That said, Colgera is one of my favorite Zelda boss fights ever and it requires very few trips to the menu screen."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I wasn't a fan of the lack of actual dungeons.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"And I thought the Last of of Us was a show reluctantly taped to a game, and then whaddaya know, it turns into a show that enjoyed way better pacing since it could ditch all the half-baked gameplay baggage."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"> it's baby's first open world game.

lmao no it's not. You guys are crazy"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"No, long time Zelda fan here, and I found it a slog as well."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"As far as open world games go RDR2 certainly sets a very high bar for added depth, and actually making those worlds worth exploring. It makes something like BOTW look very barren in comparison."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I hate these arguments when talking about art. Whether something is good or bad is entirely subjective. The song being shallow or and uncreative *in your opinion* doesn’t make something inherently bad.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It's not just popularity though. They're rating it #1. Like, of all the games, people are rating it the best. This isn't just ""X people like this game!"" Rotten Tomatoes style."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Why do people always bring up Justin Bieber to make this same braindead point. Not the enlightened take you think it is, even if you throw an absurd hitler comparison in as well. 

This has nothing to do with Breath of the Wild, it's quality, or it's spot on this aggregated list. It's just a vague commentary on the nature of media."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Name a perfect game
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Perfection doesn't exist, and the appreciation of a game is far too dependent on people's tastes.
It makes no sense to believe that a perfect game existsAnd again I wasn't talking about BOTW's ranking, Idk how many times I'm going to repeat it..."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I was responding to the comment that said it was bland and empty, even though the game is quite deep and has plenty of qualities, even if once again it's obviously not perfect.

I honestly don't care about the ranking, the ""best game of all time"" doesn't exist, it's far too dependent on the tastes of the players, it's something subjective"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I think you didn't understand what I said at all, or you interpreted it as it suited you."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Almost certainly lmao. What makes you think we wouldn’t?
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Not in this way , elden ring was clearly inspired by botw. I still prefer botw, but elden ring is close as great"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Yes?

They basically took Dark Souls and added an open world. Dark Souls and open worlds both exist outside of BotW"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Same reason Minecraft isn't higher up on the list even though it's the best selling game of all time. Granted, it's hard to fairly compare a game that's evolved so much since its initial release to games that pretty much never changed."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"OK cool. Thanks for letting me know. I'm not the one who does the website, but I'll pass this on and make sure it gets fixed. It might take a week or more as the guy who does the website is very busy, but I promise it will get fixed eventually."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Eek! OK, I'll try to get this fixed ASAP. Thanks for letting me know."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The easily available money seriously undercuts the story too.


I think there's a 40 hour version of RDR2 that is a lot better than what we got."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"No, they're not. They would cannibalize each other's mentions if I separated them."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-16,"I really need to write a tool that shows exactly what's making games climb and fall in the rankings. At the moment, I can only really guess based on match up data. The key thing about RDR vs RDR 2 is the original seems to have done a lot better against the strongest games on the list. Because the win%s are weighted according to how strong the games are, this is \*probably\* why it ends up ahead. 

* Breath of the Wild: RDR: 22% RDR2: 16%
* The Last of Us: RDR: 29% RDR2: 25%
* Tetris: RDR: 30% RDR2: 35%
* Half-Life 2: RDR: 40% RDR2: 25%
* Ocarina of Time: RDR: 39% RDR2: 24%
* The Witcher III: RDR: 30% RDR2: 22%

RDR2 does better against Tetris, but it still paints a pretty clear picture overall. Interestingly, RDR2 is actually winning about 60% of the time against the original, so I totally get why people think it should be ahead. The raw data is messy and contradictory though, as you can see."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It is not a different subject, it was a massive part of Halo and a massive part of online gaming being where it is today. To hand waive it entirely is looney.


You can be as butt-hurt as you want but accessibility matters. It is far easier to start the campaign in Halo and go ""got it"". Way easier to give someone the controller and have em understand ""colorful aliens bad guys, human soldier good guys"". 


Simple doesn't always mean stupid or bad or compromising. It can just be fun. It's simple fun. Pick up gun and blast away some aliens and grenade go boom. Halo was and is simply fun. The cornerstone of gaming. "
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"No but Minecraft is one of the best games of all time. 

Which is why it’s popular. 

Same w Elden ring, BOTW, last of us and Skyrim. There are great indie games but to be the best game of all time the scope of the game needs to be decently large. 

Outerwilds is great, but it’s just a story, it doesn’t have a gameplay loop, it’s art style isn’t the most unique and it’s not really replayable."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,[deleted]
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Well yeah, but we also had covid in the beginning of this decade with seriously fucked the development of many games, cancelling or delaying it altogether. I just find it hard to believe that, in a time where the developers have an unprecedented ammount of knowledge and tools that the games are just worse. But I agree that it’s a matter of opinion, you also have nostalgia and lower expectations carrying the older games imo."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Have we taken into account how many best lists are ""best of the decade"" or ""best of ps5"" that simply cannot be made yet? Early 2010s games show up all the time in lists from 2020, so there's an even stronger recency bias than what you're accounting for."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Recency would logically hurt them, not help. The data were drawn from lists of various ages. 2020 games didn't even exist when over two thirds of the lists were published."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,">Let’s not forget that this is also published lists, meaning in many cases money changed hands between game publisher and list maker

I'm guessing this would only really affect new games (at the time of each list's publication, of which there are many)?  I just can't imagine a publisher paying for someone to bump them up a top 100 list for a game that is even a few years old.  I have a hard time imagining they open up their marketing budget for it at all considering how little these lists probably have on sales."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Also it's that AAA games are just too big budget and there's no AA where you can take risks . There was hi fi rush (which I personally didn't enjoy as much as others) , Alan Wale and a few others but lately if you want something that's not mainstream you have to go to Indie only which while creative don't have the scale..

For eg I recently played Shadow of the colossus and while it's a frustrating piece of shit I was just in awe that this was made in 2005 and was one of the best things I have ever played even though it has a lot of rough edges. Idk if a game like could be made today"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"People meme about playing a stealth archer every time not realizing it's because the combat system is incredibly unbalanced, weirdly paced, and clunky as all hell."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Also, how do you weigh/account for games that set trends for the industry going forward? 

Even Twilight Princess is obviously a ""better"" game than Ocarina of Time; the graphics are better, the world is larger, the combat is more diverse, the items are more unique, the environments are way more varied, but TP would never have happened if it weren't for OoT setting the standard not just for Zelda games, but every single third person 3D action adventure that followed. 

Dark Souls 3 is objectively ""better"" than Dark Souls 1, but Dark Souls 1 spawned an entire genre of games.

Edit: Perfect example; in what world would Hades ever outrank Diablo 2? Diablo 2 was a genre-defining cultural phenomenon that people poured literally tens of thousands of hours into and spawned  and/or inspired hundreds of others games including Hades, a well reviewed indie title from the same genre."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"100% 1 or so new mechanics..99% same gameplay 10/10 seems to be reviewers for Nintendo games..

Even the only video game review podcast i listen to Besties will do this for Nintendo stuff. They are my age but go so hard for Nintendo stuff.. and minimize other types of games as ""too much story""

I mainly listen to the podcast becuase it has 2 of the McElroy Brothers which are fun to listen to."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Imo classics like ocarina manage to be awesome because of simple inventories (with like 25-30 items total you can get in the game), and utilizing that small inventory to be able to get awesome dungeons and puzzles that are fun to solve and utilize the few items to great levels. Basically every Zelda game has fit that description.

Then BotW comes out and opens things up a lot, and one thing it does really well is provide puzzles that have multiple solutions and the tools to solve them are pretty open ended - and I genuinely think that’s really cool but not necessarily “Zelda” to me. But what’s worse is the inventory system. I don’t want to have to gather a bunch of random stuff and worry about my weapon’s condition when I’m playing Zelda. That’s what makes it so incredibly unappealing for me. It loses that “simple but complex” thing that every Zelda game has.

I even enjoy the puzzle style enough that I really enjoyed Ubisoft’s rip off (immortals fenyx rising) more because it had all the fun puzzles and much less of the grinding and crafting stuff.

I think botw is clearly a good game, just not for me. It’s not what I want out of a Zelda game at all."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The show's pacing is way worse than the game. There's so many slow moments that you could only do in a game, like Ellie and Sam walking around talking about stuff they're seeing while you walk around reading diaries looking for a safe code.

I remember when the show aired and when one of the latest episodes came out people who were show only were saying they really liked it cause it finally gave Joel and Ellie's relationship some good development, which is insane, cause that relationship is so well developed at that point in the game. It's still a good show, but it left me feeling the same as most movies I've seen that are based off of books I've read.

Not to mention that the gameplay is just straight up fantastic. I played the multiplayer for TLoU so much, and I miss it constantly."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Hard disagree. I love TLOU and really enjoyed playing it. It also had one of the best multiplayer offerings in a long time.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Damn that's a crazy take to read haha. But I guess folks have different opinions. I thought breath and tears have a way way way better open world than rdr2. Rdr2 for me was more like a classic a to b open world game like cyberpunk and Ubisoft games. 

The new Zeldas are more on line with outer wilds and elden ring with real true freedom and lack of forced direction and ofc spectacular open world design"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The same way being popular doesn’t make something inherently better. 99 percent of people can like water, that doesn’t make water the best drink"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"my dude, it's not like there aren't ways to measure creativity and depth in music. Baby is objectively puddle deep but it can still be fun for people to listen to."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,That’s still popularity my dude. Nintendo games get higher praise just for being Nintendo games.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Yeah, instead of Bieber, we should use how much better Megadeth is at songwriting than Metallica, yet Metallica was more popular. You’ll even hear people say that Metallica writes better riffs LOL. It’s subjective, but at the same time, some things clearly are more complex and creative"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-17,Perfect Dark. And its not in that list...
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Tetris is the perfect game. Easily accessible, addictive, replay value is sky high, and challenging to master."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Left 4 dead 2
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I disagree. The world is bland and boring. There is a ton of running around doing nothing. The same stuff that every other RPG gets hate for is in this game but it's OK because it's Zelda.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I read your line quite thoroughly. There was no real innovation, just stuffing Link into an open-world game with little creativity or new mechanics. I don't even like Tears of the Kingdom but agree it was a better game."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Miyazaki cited BOTW as a major influence in Elden Ring…
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Last season when I got on there was 7,000 players playing and I thought that was pretty impressive.  I’d say it’s just gotten more popular.  New season will be in August I think."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"That’s interesting. They are almost as different from each other as WoW is from either RuneScape. 
I could see RuneScape 3 being hundreds and hundreds of spots below Old School RuneScape. Thank you for such a good list, as a variety gamer 2002, I really enjoyed rummaging through it, OP"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"again, popularity doesn't equal quality: roblox is pne of the most popular game but it's not on the list. outer wilds has a gameplay loop too, not sure what you are talking about. knowledge allows you to gain more knowledge, that's the gameplay loop."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-16,"Good observation. I don't think I've ever used it before, come to think about it."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"For this type of case think of it as first to have -exactly- some # of games on the list, rather than up to. A decade to be the first decade to have one is really a decade that is the first to have only one."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,Not if you're counting as you go down the list from rank 1 to 100. The first decade to have a game is the 2010s because the number 1 spot is a game from the 2010s.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I think part of it comes with the gradual increase in development cycle that, in my opinion at least, often doesn’t really yield anything. “Notable” games have started to become much more few and far between to the point where the expectation has become that it *needs* to be a 9/10 game with the fanciest graphics that promises to “revolutionize the genre” rather than just a fun game.

Take FromSoftware, this isn’t to bash them at all as I truly believe they haven’t released even a *mediocre* game since before Demon’s Souls was released, over the span of like 7 years we got like 5 Souls games from the originals DeSouls all the way through DS3, since then we’ve gotten Sekiro, Elden Ring, Armored Core 3, and some DLCs, again this isn’t to say those games aren’t great, Elden Ring truly was a massive event, but it took a looooong time to come to fruition, and now FS has to follow that up."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Playing a pure mage without cheesing a very high magica cost reduction into your armor is just awful. Beyond that spells are very uninspired in general. Most foods granting effectively infinite stamina because you only need one point to perform actions... Heavy armor having a perk to get rid of all of its weaknesses?

That's just off the top of my head after not playing the game in eight-ish years  
Also shouts totally should have had their own skill tree"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I have to disagree actually. Both are insanely good games. But Twilight Princess has some pacing issues. It has a few too many backtrack heavy lulls in pacing. 

OoT is perfectly paced. 

Yeah Twilight Princess is a little flashier. And has some cool stuff, I find myself less drawn to replay it because of those slow segments. I could pick up Oot again right now. 

Granted both are worse than the true GOAT Zelda game. Majora's Mask."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"My biggest gripe is that while there are a lot of puzzles, they're all bite sized puzzles that each take 5 minutes. You go back to any of the older games, and the puzzles span entire dungeons. It's like the tiktok of Zelda"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"That’s exactly what the person I responded to said. What you think is the best drink doesn’t instantly make it the best drink, because the reasons surrounding are subjective. That’s literally the point I am making lol."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Creativity and depth doesn’t mean something is objectively good. It’s the same argument. It’s why this sort of good vs bad debate for art is stupid.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Good lord...
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"You know, I'll give you that one."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I agree with you. BOTW didn't really do anything better than all the other open world Ubisoft style games, it just had a Zelda theming slapped on and a weapon durability mechanic that is possibly my most hated aspect of the game.

If I pick up a game to replay in that same style, I'll be going back to Horizon ZD or Shadows of Mordor/War before I go back to BOTW. And that's coming from someone who replays ALTTP, and various randomizers thereof, all the time. I should have been a prime target audience for BOTW, but it was very flat for me."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The world is bland and empty for you, but not for everyone.

It could have been more filled, but there is also a need to have ""empty"" spaces, it is part of the spirit of the game, which is called ""breath of the WILD"". This ""emptiness"" is an integral part of the game because movement and the way to manage it is a main component, it is also a field for experimentation with the tools and power that the game offers us, in addition to being necessary for the coherence of the world (a world filled with POIs everywhere is less natural and organic than a game that knows how to find a balance between content and ""emptiness"").

I think that one of the main differences between the latest Zelda and other open worlds is that it takes the effort to offer a fairly interactive world, with original gameplay possibilities, and that movement, travel, is a deliberately important component of the concept.

But it is a game that offers great freedom to the player, and which corresponds more to those who like to experiment, to be free and creative, unlike other games much more restrictive and directive, I think that not all players have this desire to try to do things by themselves without the game necessarily forcing them to, and that is why some find the game boring I think. That is why I talk about emergent mechanics, the game offers plenty of tools, it is then up to the players to do what they want with them.

But the game could have been a little smaller and more filled (I say ""a little"" smaller and ""a little"" more filled, because as I said, emptiness is also necessary).

Haha, I think my initial comment was clearly not appreciated by those nostalgic for the old Zelda games, personally I am delighted with the new formula, even if it still has a lot of room for improvement"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Do you know many games of this dimension and ambition with such an interactive world and such great freedom of gameplay and original game mechanics? I think the game must be seen as a whole. And I'm not saying that it is innovative and original in ALL aspects.

TOTK is not better for me, but to each his own. I think that the new crafting and construction mechanics are an excellent idea, but not in a Zelda game, or more precisely not in the way it was implemented (it's not very ergonomic and certain constraints sometimes make the use of these mechanics more annoying than anything else).
And imo it's the Zelda with the worst atmosphere and the worst OST"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"That doesn’t mean that Elden Ring wouldn’t exist without Botw lmao. There’s plenty of other open world games that they would’ve taken inspiration from, which I’m sure they did as well"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,Correct :)
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It’s an expectation game. You think if a game like castlevania came out today it would get the same praise. I don’t think it would, because expectations are different. Games had smaller development cycles because they were simpler, that’s it. You get amazing games with small development cycles today, but they are not good enough to make this list. Nowadays, to make a top 100 game you need a project in the scope of an Elden ring or a true masterpiece like Hades (which still has an enormous scope in terms of quantity of content). It’s like in sports. Players today are way better than any GOAT of the old days, because they have better conditions to do so, and you expect more of them."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"This could definitely be just me, but it feels almost like BotW and TotK are more like polished tech demos for the physics engine and graphic style. Nothing about them outside of the random cutscenes hidden in them feel particularly like Zelda to me. I enjoyed BotW greatly, but TotK was a massive letdown."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I know. You are literally saying the exact same thing as him, but the opposite."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Sorry, I'm specifically responding to your assertion that it's one's opinion that a song is or isn't shallow, I'm not suggesting that a deeper song is a better song."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Name a flaw
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Exactly. The game is fine. Pretty much everything in that game had already been done before in another form. I know I'm not the target demographic because I don't really like Zelda that much, but it was easily my least favorite Zelda game. To the point where I wouldn't buy another one."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,That can go both ways. The world feels exciting and live to you. I didn't find the tools to be that cool and exciting. The game was fine. I think there are way more games deserving of a number 1 spot
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Honestly, if we're not bringing the CDi into the picture, I feel BotW had the worst atmosphere and OST. 

But regardless of how I dislike the game in general, my ultimate point is that it is number one on lists not out of admiration for the game itself, but because it is a Zelda game, when honestly, it probably would have been a better game outside the franchise."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I’m not just saying that. He’s implying that things like Justin beiber are popular and objectively bad. I am saying that it’s not true because his perception of what is good or bad is entirely subjective.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"But I'm not talking about the ranking here, I was just responding to your comment.
For me a ranking like this one doesn't make any sense anyway, as I said the ""best game of all time"" doesn't exist. Each player can have his favorite games but it remains subjective

And I should point out that BOTW isn't even my favorite game."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"My comment kinda goes hand in hand with the ranking though. A game that is repetitive and boring shouldn't be in a top 10 list imo. Sure you can't have a ""best"" game but you can have a highest rated game. BotW making that consiste try is what gets me. Every person I have actually met has a similar opinion about the game. It's fun. It's not a great game. It's ok"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I don't know what to tell you. You and the people around you may not represent the majority of people, don't you think ? Just because some people find it boring doesn't mean it's an absolute truth.
Because you can find people with any opinion if you look, that's not what tells us the general appreciation of a game that, for many people, was clearly not boring.

And once again the rankings don't indicate much, well it's just a kind of statistical average, in any case people shouldn't give them too much importance.

There are plenty of very well ranked games that I don't care about at all and that don't interest me, I would even say that it's most of them. No game can be loved by everyone, and we all have our personal ranking, trying to be objective is futile

All games are repetitive after a while, I think that the latest Zelda are clearly not among the most repetitive games, on the contrary I think that it offers a lot of diversity, even if obviously like all games it has repetitive aspects that would have deserved more attention in the details and originality

You have the right to not like it too much or find it boring, but that remains a personal opinion.
Conversely, no one is going to force you to like it"

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"See this why we love PlayStation, cus they love us 😎"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Rare Sony W.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Thank God I got a disc.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Does this also come included if you own a physical ps4 copy? I bought the collectors edition when it came out :|
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"It's honestly weird that it even lets you preorder at all.

The ps store didnt even give me an option to buy the remaster until the upgrade dropped"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"That's awesome. In a similar situation, I bought a digital copy of Cyberpunk 2077 for PlayStation 4 way back when the game was originally released[*], and then for Christmas 2023 I was blessed enough that one of the gifts left underneath the Christmas tree for me turned-out to be a goddamned brand-new PlayStation 5! And after I got the machine hooked up to my 4K TV and plugged into the wall and turned it on for the very first time and did all the initial setup and h'whatnot, I came to realize that the PlayStation 5 allows you to download any and all games that you bought/downloaded digitally on your PlayStation 4, and play them on your PS5.

So naturally I started queueing-up all the digital copies of games I got via my old PS4 to download after the free digital copy of Spider-Man 2 that the PS5 came bundled with finished downloading. And so also naturally, one of the first games from my digital PS4 library that I chose was Cyberpunk 2077 cuz I'd actually never gotten around to playing it in all the years since buying it lol.

And after it finished downloading, I obviously went to go click on it and start playing....but just before I did I noticed an extra button just to the right of the ""Play Game"" button that said ""Upgrade To PS5 Version."" I assumed this would require that I pay or something but still clicked on it anyway just to see h'what h'was h'what. And to my shock & joy that button brought me to a page of The PlayStation Store that allowed me to download the new PlayStation 5 version of _Cyberpunk 2077_ **ABSOLUTELY FREE OF CHARGE** because I had already purchased a digital copy of the original PlayStation 4 version of _Cyberpunk 2077_!

Thus I wound up never even playing that PS4 copy of the game, either on my PS4 _or_ my PS5, because now I own the PlayStation 5 version of the game, which is obviously the best (console) version of the game that exists and the 2nd best version of the game that exists behind the PC version on a proper rig obviously lol.

So yeah, this seems to be something Sony has been doing with PS5 versions of games that one has previously purchased on their PS4. Very much a W on their part.

([*]and was apparently a horrifically buggy mess that was near unplayable until MUCH more recently, when the devs FINALLY managed to fix-up and patch the game to the point where all those issues are resolved and the game is actually playable and enjoyable now — in other words, the game has actually been COMPLETED now, lol!)"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"Asking for a friend bc I don’t have this game and never played it,  anyone know if the remastered version is adding any new content or is it just rebuying the game on ps5?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,If it isn’t clear this also works for the disc version too
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"This game was released in 2020, there is no ""remaster"" it's just a bump up in graphics on the ps5.... Which should be free. It would essentially be the same if a game developer on a PC game had the ultra settings of their game locked behind a $10 paywall, this is asinine and people should have to pay for this on console, almost every other game has done a PS5 version for free with better graphic Fidelity and performance.

Stop supporting this crap."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Why Sony is better than EA
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-22,60 days for a billion dollar company to refund numbers on a screen 😆😆😆😆😆😆my god these people do wtf they want to the the regs
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-22,"""We get to upgrade our game to the newer console for $10!!! Damn, such a big win!!!""

Meanwhile over on Xbox, PC and everywhere else that has a brain..."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-23,60 days for a refund to show up ???? It’s 2024 not 1932
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-02-28,"But there's no possibility of upgrading from disk version? 

I borrowed the game to a friend and haven't been able to get it back for like a year anyway but was hoping that once I got the disk back I could upgrade for 10 rather than buy for 45."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,How is this a W?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Sony is milking the two “Last of Us” games like Rockstar milking GTA5.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"""Thanks for the crumbs Sony. May I have another?"""
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Sony doing refunds without banning your account? What a novel idea!
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Not sure how a company doing what they should be doing is a big W but considering how capitalism is going I understand the sentiment
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,This is unexpected from the company that doesn't issue refunds once you've downloaded 10kb of the a 160gb game
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Why did you preorder a game you already own bro
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Woah. Unexpected to see this kind of a actions nowadays. Hats off Sony
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Free upgrade on Xbox... just saying

Edit: for xbox one games to series x games. 

Witcher 3, cyberpunk are the games I upgraded, not last of us."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Cool.

Now start a refund policy."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,1 W - 99 L
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Would be cool if we didn't have to buy the same game again
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Buing a remaster of a game relased 3 years ago? Some people like it dry.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I mean it's the same game so why upgrade
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Thats not Sony thats Naughty Dog
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"""Big W""... They are literally charging for something that should've been a free update."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,This isn't a W. This should be normal.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,They feel sad you keep buying the same game.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Probably just a class action lawsuit avoidance strategy.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Jerking of Sony of all companies is crazy to me
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Self reported as a pre-orderer. I thought were in agreement here cmon
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,it should be free
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,The biggest W is getting you dingleberries to buy this game a second time in just a few years.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,There is nothing Big win about this. The remaster was already not needed. God of war ragnarok just had free dlc. Just trying to get $10 from this will bring in profits. Both sony and naughty dog are trying to look good with the cheapest way they can afford to.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Um, why are they remastering a game that came out not that long ago?  
  
Other than it being a cash-grab, obviously."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,how is this a w? they took ur 60 for a short time and now you have to wait for the refund which they state could take up to 60 days? id be fuming just let me buy what i want to buy
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,How did you even buy the remastered at full price if you already have the PS4 version? Isn't it unavailable to you in the store?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Imagine thinking a pre-order of a digital good is a ""W"" 🤡"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Cool way to extract more money for re-releasing the same game.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,wait this 3-year-old game gets remastered?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,How is having to re-buy a game a W? Why are you even pre-ordering? xD
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"TIL people buy digital versions of games, and a preorder at that lmfao"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Why the hell do you need a remaster for a 3 year old game?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Imagine buying a remaster of a 3.5 year old game
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Lol. What are you talking about? They are greedy bastards. They raised the prices. And now they want a other 10€ for a game that probably won't change much. Reminder that we got upgrades for games like Resident Evil Village and Witcher 3 for free. That would be a W. 
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Here slave, have an apple."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,That’s pretty cool of them. I wonder if it’s worth replaying the game was just OK to me actual gameplay wise.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"They still make you pay for what CD Projekt did for free with The Witcher 3, so it's still a PlayStation L in my book."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Should be free.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"That’s really cool 

I haven’t played LOF2 yet, is it worth it? I loved the first one but I know what happens in the beginning but that’s the only spoiler I know"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"The fact you have to buy the same game twice should be a slap in your face, but you taut it as a W. Its an L for all of us"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Just buy the regular game it's cheaper and it looks the exact same as the ""remastered"" version"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Still behind Xbox if they are JUST NOW doing smart delivery
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Its a small W within a huge Ls.

1. This full price 70€ game is 3 and a half years old...that they want to charge anything for making an up to date version in the first place is ridiculous
2. They like their gamers so much, they gonna refund you your money to the PSN wallet...aaaand its gone. Your money is still their money and they only allow you to buy another digital license with it.  


No I am not cynical, I just havent lowered my standard as much as you did."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-21,I need to be filled in real quick on the sitch-
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-23,I love Japan.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-23,Would be a real W if it was free
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-25,"Imagine when you bought something it took 60 days to clear, crazy."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-27,Rare PlayStation W
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-02-28,Big win? That's just Sony doing what they're supposed to do.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-03-04,true W
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-03-07,"""We've made your steaming pile of shit cheaper for you!""

Thank you corporate overlord."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-06-02,They just want you to buy digital so that they have control over it
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Can't wait for it to release on PC. Modders will be about to fix the games story, finally."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Xbox gave you free upgrades lol
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Having to pay for a next Gen upgrade is wild to me. If you owned Skyrim when they released the remaster on steam you got the remaster free.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"This should be the norm

Remastering a game in itself is already shitty, every single original owner should get the remasters for free."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,If only TLOU Pt 2 was actually any good.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Why did you preorder a game? Especially digitally lmao. Terrible decision in every way
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Not sure I'd call it a big W but I'll take it.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Rare Playstation w
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,A big W would be if they just made the update free
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"PS getting praised by doing the bare minimum? Wow, you guys like battered wives."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Huh. People STILL preorder games. That’s wild.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,big w getting yall to buy it again yup 🤣
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Smells like an PR post lol
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Why are you buying the same game twice. A train wreck of a game even.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,People need to stop pre ordering things that have been clearly shown to be discounted for them on launch 💀
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I don't understand why this is a W?

I am pretty confident dozens of games (maybe hundreds?) have had free upgrades since 2020"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,What W? Lmao fkn boot lickers
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Why preorder a digital game? Afraid they’ll run out of bytes?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Do I don’t get the discount because I bought the game physically that sucks
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Gesture of goodwill. lol. Should be the standard for things like this.

But, how did people still not know that the upgrade would be cheap for previous owners. It's been known for a while."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Holy shit, Sony actually did a good thing for once."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,This is how you get customers for life
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I still cant believe they already made a remaster. Its only been 4 years. 
I expect either a big remake (for a game that was poorly done in everything) or at least Resident evil 4 where its been a looong time between."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"From time to time Sony can be good... It's rarely to watch it, but it happens. Now something like this would be really cool about Playstation plus, anything... even some price discount for people who is suscripted to it for years."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It would be a bigger W if they improved the UX for upgrades. Why do they prevent preorders for upgrades? Why even allow people to buy it at full price if the upgrade is available?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Never played this. Might if I can get it cheap. How do I do that without ever owning the game?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,summer wipe dull waiting steer tidy homeless elastic quiet bow
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I mean definitely a W but I'm still salty that I'm forever locked out of my ps account because it's tied to an old phone number and support can't do anything to help lol

Side note, I genuinely think this kind of approach to remasters/upgraded versions should be a set standard on every platform."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,An even better deal would be to just cancel the purchase so you don’t have to play this goddamn shitty excuse of a game.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Big L purchasing that game at all tbh 😂
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Imagine paying for a graphics update lol.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"That’s really fantastic, you love to see it."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Since when is a title update considered a W?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Imagine if when you got a new PC you had to pay a fee to ""upgrade"" your games to the new machine. Fucking insane. Console players are whipped."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Dam…my Xbox would never
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Ok, but this “remastered” version doesn’t even need to exist. It’s just a port with fluff attached they are charging $10 for"

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Weird because when games get a remastered on steam I automatically get upgraded with no cost or inconvenience.

Doesn’t really seem like a W to me."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"A big W would be, you bought the game already, so we turned the graphics settings up for free!"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Microsoft is much better than Sony - customer satisfaction within Microsoft users and gamepass subscribers is higher than the Sony's
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"Understanding that you will never own the digital version, that $10 is worthless. The digital version of anything in my opinion now is worthless"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I don’t know if it’s a “Big W”.  It should be FREE.

PC doesn’t charge you for upgrading your computer.  Xbox offers “Smart Delivery” so you play whatever version works best on your hardware.  Yet we have PlayStation over here trying to get more money from you because you had the audacity to buy another console from them."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"That’s nice, but I wish they allow you to preload the game though."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Big L,game is trash"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Why buy the same game that's only 3 years old? Slightly improved graphics with the same garbage double story?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,The update isn’t free and this is the bare minimum they could do. Really low standards.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I didn’t need a remaster anyways. It was a decent third person shooter with a horrible story twist and an utterly unlikable character.

this is the most toxic elements of the film industry leaking into our games"

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I wish they did this with Horizon Forbidden West. I bought the physical disc for PS4 then got a PS5 digital for christmas. Sadly I can only get the digital version for free if I can insert the PS4 disc into the PS5, cant do that with a digital version..."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Other than putting out terrific games, this is the first consumer friendly move I've seen from Playstation in a while. Removing movies you paid for, increasing prices, nerfing ps+ (removing Spiderman 1).

Allowing for a $10 upgrade to begin with instead of charging full price like The Last of Us 1 was also cool.

Seems like the change in leadership is having an effect already."

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,“Deeply discounted” sounds weird. Why not just say discounted or reduced? Just never heard of a discount as deep. Highly or heavily sure but not deeply.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Seriously? There's no reason those ""remasters"" shouldn't be free if you already own the original game."

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Still charged for something that could have been free to existing owners.

It's amazing what gestures like this can do for public perception.

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Op I have question. Why buy in first place? Isn’t TLOU 2 already a really high level graphics game?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,The fact that that game is getting a remaster is nothing but a scam... what's next? Metro exodus remastered?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Do they do this for good games too?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,A quick reminder for everyone: No one is going to run out of digital compies. You don't need to buy them before release day.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"They already knew that no one's gonna buy it a second time with how mid the second game was,"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,As an Australian I must admit that it brings smile in my face for a few time
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Big W or Big L - 60 days to get refund, shit Sony is the refund traveling on a horse from Japan to wherever this person lives"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Who tf is still pre ordering games?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Never preorder.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I dont understand last of us. There is part 1, part 2, part 1 remake, part 2 remake, last of us 1, last of us 2, last of last … wtf"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"“Due to the developer being bought by another company we no longer hold the distribution license for [POPULAR FRANCHISE], because of this we will remove all [PURCHASED CONTENT] from [POPULAR FRANCHISE] from all your accounts and devices.

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Another reason why we chose PlayStation over Xbox.

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Okay I might jump in to hate Abby all over again
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-21,"Who the FUCK preorders a game- better yet a game from 2020?

""Gamers"" are the MOST gullible and worst consumers with 5 minute memories. It's so frustrating. 

""Why do things never change in Gaming?""

/Runs to PlayStation to preorder a 4 year old fucking game.

Jesus Christ people."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-21,Making us pay for a game we already own. Yeah such a big W from PlayStation. Most generational upgrades are free since it’s basically an update. This is an L.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-22,People are still pre-ordering?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-23,Why would you pre-order the ability to have the taste of shit in your mouth all over again? Garbage game
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-02-05,"They need to quit fuckin downloading content to my ps4 automatically, they fuckin pushed madden 24 down my throat and literally downloaded it to my PlayStation, then when I went to play it, it said I had to buy it."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Be a lot cooler if they didn't charge you to access the games you've already paid for... (PS Plus)
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,This is bare minimum expectation for catching a mistake.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,“Deeply discounted” lol. While CDPR gave out PS5 upgrades for Cyberpunk for free and transformed the game into a genuine good time!
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Last of Us part 2 is a big L no matter what lol.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,W for them L for you
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Big L for you for buying that trash
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,So you bought an outdated version of a remaster and have to PAY to get an updated one? And that's good service? Just because theyvgave you some pocket change back? What a fucking joke you are. Do you lube your asshole for them first?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,They announced that upgrade when they announced the remaster. You should never have preordered in the first place tbh. All this was is Sony covering their ass from people complaining that they played themselves.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,A diverse game where every character you play are 100% white
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Did you really pre-ordered the same game that you already owned?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"How is this a W? Much less a ""Big W""?

You preorderd a port of a game that would have been a patch if it was any other system but because it's PlayStation it's $10."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Why the hell are they remastering a game that's like 5 years old, maybe less"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Wow that is actually insane.. Bravo Sony
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,W? you own the game already lmao
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Why did you preorder.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Lolll paying again for a game you already own is a W? You need to WAKE UP. That’s a fat L
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Are ppl really crying about a 4 year old game getting a next gen remaster…don’t buy it if you don’t want it?🤣
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"TLOU2 does not need a remaster... its way too new.

And a trash game to boot."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"""Digital Upgrade"" = same fucking game and assets but we turned up the settings for you. Such bullshit."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Man says big W for Playstation when on Xbox, we get the upgrades for free. Hahahaha."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Its things like this that make people not completely hate large corporations....
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Imagine pre-ordering and paying full price again for a trash game.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Who still plays the shit station? 
Any new exclusives? any games??? 🤣😂🤣😂"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Crap game.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,They should give refunds to anyone who bought the game in the first place.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I still think consoles should just not be a thing anymore. At this point in time, people basically require a PC for either work or school. Instead of consoles, they should be releasing mini gaming PCs or something. I don't understand the point of consoles anymore. Instead of spending money upgrading to the next gen console, you could just upgrade your PC. Or at least upgrading to the next gen mini gaming PC.

I just don't see the justification in limiting what you're able to play for no reason. Some games are on xbox, some games are on playstation. It's ridiculous. Just have everything be PC and be able to play whatever you want.

But it's your money. Just seems like a really big waste. I can't believe they still make consoles."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"But lets put 3 diferent plus pack and if you don't have it can't play online games.. what is this the 90's? 

Fun was the time when ps3 launched and people didn't need to pay to play online rofl

Consoles are weak and completly obsolete but have fun getting crumbs from PSN and Microsoft"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Thank You Sony  🙏
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Let’s go. Viva la Play Station
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Can I upgrade the disc version of TLOU2 or upgrades are only possible for the Digital owners?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I have the PS4 disk version. How can I upgrade it? I have a PS5.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,damn that’s why i never preordered. I wonder if it’s too late lol
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Such an easy win for them it should be this way with every remaster or remake of a game that isn’t decades old
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,And that is how I like my semi dystopian console services. 👍🏽👍🏽
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,That's good considered they are 95% the same game with very little graphics changes lol Just mainly the additional modes/content. The $10 is the correct price for what you already own 95% of.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Glad they have learned something after the last few times of being called out for predatory practices.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Please Sony stop remastering the last of us games like 20 times remaster like bloodborne or make it available on pc please I beg you it's like 99% of the reason I have a ps4
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,The W would be if you could just pre order the $10 upgrade…..
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Wasn’t gunna upgrade. Now I will. Cheers 🍻 Sony. 
Can you buy call of duty now?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"TBH I see this more as a CYA move then a good guy move. I absolutely appreciate the gesture, I just assume the motivation wasn't ""we gotta protect our consumers"" as much as it was probably ""we gotta protect ourselves"". Just imagine the backlash if they let all these orders go through, and then they have to deal with all the refunds/exchanges. I guess I'm just cynical."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Ubisoft punching the air rn since they'll still sell games at full price. Activision too.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"For months I had been wondering when this would be brought up. The price in the store did not reflect whether or not you purchased TLOU already, thus causing many to pre-order at full price. Glad it's been fixed"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Still doesn’t make up for having to pay for a stupid ps plus subscription
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,This is cool because I’ve been confused by the price. They have said it’ll be cheap for current owners but it doesn’t give you an option to order it on discount if you have the game. I just figured I’d buy it tomorrow and Joel the option is there by then.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I’m actually looking forward to playing this game. Only played the first and I want to give it a shot and see whether or not I like it.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"So funny to see people in comments STILL find a way to complain.

The absolute rageboner Reddit as a while seems to have for Playstation is insane."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,My questions is what's the price difference?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Meanwhile xbox: please buy skyrim:definitive remastered legendary revisited dragonborn plus ultimate mega game of the year edition!
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Why not just give you the upgrade for free? This is sort of like the same thing, just with extra steps..."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I mean this should be standard service, having to pay more to play on both or just one console is a scam,"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,[removed]
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Remember when they sold a bunch of games on the PSN store for PS3 and then PS4 came out and you had to rebuy all the same games over again?

Sony is slightly less abusive than they used to be. Not exactly ""Big W"""
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Agreed
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Some one read the coursework on customer service practices.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Sony appreciation thread! :)
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,A corporation offering back money...what kind of witchcraft is this!?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,People out here are still pre ordering games lol.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Was wondering why I randomly got a refund the other day.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I don't understand why they didn't make the $10 upgrade available for pre-order before launch day.  After I heard about the discounted upgrade for owners of the original game, I was very confused trying to find it on the PlayStation store.  All I saw was full price, and I began questioning whether I actually even owned the original or just played it through PS+."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I've reread this statement many times. Where's the W?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Holy hell i didn't expect that from sony
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,You should just have a free upgrade I’ve already purchased the game and I’ve bought a new console so I think the money balances tf out
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"So as I understood, you paid to get pre-order the game, but Sony decided that you should going fuk yourself and they gave you a freaking version of digital ps5?!"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,why... is this game getting remastered? Its a pretty recent game all things considered.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Wait, they already remastered the second game?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,So if I own a physical version of TLOU 2 can I get the PS5 version free or is it only for digital version owners?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It is a big win when you still have to pay to get a patch, basically?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,But why did you pre-order it if you knew there was going to be a small upgrade fee? Unless you didn't know. But cool on PlayStation for doing this.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Good storefronts don't let you make the purchase in the first place.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,More like a big rare Playstation W
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Nice.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I would say extremely rare big W for PlayStation, but congrats, they did a good thing!"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Yep. Thats a W. 

They were even honest with the “it may take up to 60 days, but we got you” lol"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Its funny because mine still says unavailable for purchase because i own the ps4 version

No preorder available
No upgrade option

Just straight up : NO

kinda annoyed about it tbh"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,That is a W of very small proportions. But we still take those.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Or because you don't have a PS5 they're essentially making you buy one 😐
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Where's the ""W""?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I don’t want to be THAT guy, but this doesn’t seem like a big W when other consoles allow you to upgrade for free"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,that's hot
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"PlayStation W.

User L. Don't pre-order, there's no fucking point."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Big W PlayStation

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Inconvenience?
Bro.
You save the player money and still provide him with all bonuses he would pay for. It is convenient for him."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,WOW
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,You bought a game you already had with minimal to no improvement...wow grats.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I read this as , ‘please don’t leave us for Xbox’"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Meanwhile, Nintendo.


""No"""
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,That’s great. But why not just let people preorder the $10 update ahead of release?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Feels extremely rare to happen especially given their usual refund policies and ps plus prices
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Too bad the game isn’t even remastered
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Dang, a huge corporation saying no to money? This is how you generate good will with customers.

Anyone know what the discount will be?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,60 day refund lmao
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,How the fuck are they doing a remaster of a game that's not even that old?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,You're still only buying a license to use with digital.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Now that's good business.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Why pre order a remake? Why pre order any (non indie) game? why why why
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I looked today, they wouldn't even allow me to pre order it (this is the reason why). Now it'll be a $10 upgrade."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Sony *not* doing everything they can to screw over their consumers.. did hell freeze over or something?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I don’t have the option to preorder it, is it just making me wait until tomorrow for the upgrade?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Don't preorder games at all! Don't support this behavior of the greedy companies.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Not a big win at all. It's just what should be done. Wouldn't be surprised if Sony is paying to try to make this shit to the front page.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,This apply to disc owners?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Lol a paid upgrade is a big w... This type of shit should be free
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Big L for pre-ordering...

Not only that but pre-ordering a Remaster of a 3 1/2 year old game..."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Nice
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"""60 days"" while we suck the interest off the top. Might as well deliver my refund by pony express"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Sweet of them
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,One more day!
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,60 Days what in the actual fuck
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,The same game with some improved graphics. And the game is only a few years old.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,there are certain scenes that i don't need in 4k 60fps
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Is it? Cyberpunk launched with a free upgrade for both xbox and ps. Their launch had a lot of bad news surrounding it so I think a lot of people forget that they got that part right.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Plot twist, the cheaper upgrade is *only* available on launch day."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Big W for a remaster game lmao
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Oh crap it launches tomorrow??😮
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"60 days? WTF, it should be a maximum of 2 weeks depending on your bank."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I think we should hold every company up to valve's standard which even makes things like this look pretty bad. Without considering valve, this is kinda good but should still be considered the bare minimum. While considering valve this is garbage"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I'm Australian and this confused me.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,why are they selling a current gen patch? lol
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Just got this, I'm broke so this is really convenient.
I only found out they planned to make an upgrade available after buying the preorder (it isn't there yet, easy to not know there even was one)"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Wow where was this shit for last of us part 1 ps5 remaster? I and many others bought that game for ps3 and ps4...
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"60 days to invest those funds, Big W 😎"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I swear they’re going to announce the last of us part III: remastered, before the last of us part III."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I picked the wrong day to switch phone numbers and update my 2 step verification 😭 No wonder my queue was 400+ people.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I didn't realize this was releasing already.  I don't love having to pay, but I'm cool with a $10 upgrade.

I could see Part 1 coming to Extra within the next few months after milking the extra sales. Offering a cheaper upgrade for Part 2 will make some less hesitant on purchasing Part 1."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Wait so if I have a ps4 disc do I get the discount?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Nah until we see bloodborne and ghost of tsushima on PC, PlayStation will be holding no Ws"

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I wonder why even today all online refunds still take up so much time.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Pretty sure this is normal. I got PS4 Spider-Man disc and a Remastered was available for $10.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Yea when I checked it just told me I already own a version.  I took that as a good sign.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,W sony
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Currently playing FFVII on hard mode on my ps5 bc it was free since I had the ps4 version. More companies should be like this.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I was thinking how does Big W send messages to you
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Over 10k upvote for this dumb nothingness? No wonder big corps/publishers continue to do what they what to in the game industry when people want to lick their balls over something small like this.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Why would anyone even buy the remaster
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Big L. You already know they're going to find any way they can to keep holding onto that money (so you're gonna get credit, not a refund.)

This is the same company that put rootkits on their music CDs and wrecked countless computers and optical drives with their garbage.

And you still trust them to do anything remotely close to right?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"This is most likely compliance with some the law of jurisdictions, dressed up as customer service lol  

Sony/Playstation never ever ever do this unless their legal team as advised of a real and significant liability in terms of prosecution or civil suit."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"they could be sued otherwise, so yeah"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,no its not they upped the subscription fee and all you fools forgot about it already
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Apparently i can't purchase or upgrade until release. That's what i'm reading on PS5.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Basic decency from a corporation IS a big W.

And that's pretty fucking sad."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,PlayStation w 😭😭😭
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,What if you miss the launch day? You could potentionally have to pay more. This seems poorly thought out.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,FUCKING EPIC!1!1!1!1!1!1!!1!1!1!1!1
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,A w would be a free upgrade ffs
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Except for the part where a refund could take 60 FUCKING DAYS?

This shit should be illegal, they manage to take your money instantaneously, there’s no good reason it shouldn’t come back just as fast."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,That’s a nice step in the right direction. Can’t wait to see this same kind of care when it comes to PS Plus and the amazing IP that have been dormant for too long
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Might just get a PlayStation considering they did this for them.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"It makes sense though, they would be absolutely swamped with refund requests otherwise. Honestly it's just saving their customer service from having to work overtime."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"How much is the ""deep"" discount?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Up to 60 days…? Bro what
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I am genuinely shocked that one of these big, faceless companies did something nice for a change. Way to go PlayStation and count your lucky stars OP lol"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Wow, so nice of them to only make you only pay a little for the same shit you already own."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"They’re already remastering Part II? How many different remakes, remasters are Naughty Dog gonna milk out of this franchise?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Well at least after this, there (hopefully) won't be any more TLOU remasters for a while, but I'm crossing my fingers there will be a The Last of Us Part 1 Remastered in around 3-4 years. Nice that you don't have to pay full price for an upgrade though."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,*confused in australian*
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I'm confused or read it wrong what does this mean
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,yahoo
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,ion care about sony or ps but this is indeed a big dubya
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Good job playstation, you screwed yourself over."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Okay, thank you this confirms why I couldn't preorder the PS5 version (I own the PS4 version)."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,That’s cool
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I too thought it was a purchase from the Australian department store. Thought it might have something to do with a recent promoted post on Facebook that I saw. It was a post linking to their online store and the call to action was about getting the latest technology from Big W... unfortunately, it seemed the product chosen was an automated choice because it was advertising a PS4 (of which a handful of stores have like 1 remaining that they couldn't clear before the PS5 arrived). The comments on the fb post were quite funny."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"W, but can we talk about the 60 DAYS!?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Wait if I wanted the preorder bonus but didn’t wanna pay full price would I be able to do this too and get a refund before two hours lol
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I know this is kind of off topic, but man as a Bloodborne fan, TLOU 2 getting a remaster after 3 years is a real kick in the balls. Anyways gonna go eat a bowl of copium while I wait for silksong news"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Bruh OP do you read fine print/reviews or do you just go click buy on things like an absolute bot
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,An even bigger W would have been to just refund $40 and upgrade for free
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Not sure if this is a dumb question, but here we go.  When I had a ps4 back when, I bought LoU 2 for it.  Then I got rid of my ps and went pc.  Now I’m still pc, but also just recently bought a new ps5.  I had forgotten I still had the disc version of LoU 2 with me.  Anyways I installed it on my new ps5.  Will I get the upgrade for free?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,And then there is Ubisoft....
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Seriously. I felt so fucked by Cyberpunk at launch, and Sony legit removed it from their store so that they could provide a full refund."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"What's a ""big discount?"". Like 50% of the $70 USD?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Their customer support needs to be fixed pronto
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"So they're not refunding the difference and giving us the game, they're essentially refunding everything (within 60 days) and I now need to go and pay a further $10 now to get the upgrade?

I know it's only $10 but I don't see why they can't just refund it all bar $10.

Edit - completely glossed over that the refund may end up being store credit too!"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Is it a win if they’re doing it because of backlash? A win would’ve been doing it without needing asked
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"More like fixing an error that would otherwise result in massive brand damage and or legal issues?  Pretty unspectacular if I do say so, these sorts of things should be expected."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,T-They remastered part two? Huh?! It came out like two/three years ago.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I thought this was a photo of a PlayStation from Big W
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Anyone else find it hilarious that there's more remasters of TLOU games than there are non-remasters?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Is this a big win? Theyre still ""remastering"" a game that is only a few years old. Its still just a massive cash grab"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Chad Sony moment
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Playstation at least has dignity to refund unlike some other trash companies like Nintendo
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Thanks for the heads up! I have a copy of the original in my closet somewhere. Never finished the game
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Ohhh shiiittt say less
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,The most pointless remaster ever. TLoU2 already looks next-gen...
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I don’t think this is a dub I mean imagine I have an old pc and I buy a new pc to play a game I already own the graphics update is free y’all getting milked with these money grabbing so called remasters it’s a disgusting practice in the industry. You should not be charged for better graphics after forking out for better hardware.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Considering these lot refused to refund me for the same thing when Uncharted 4 was re-released in a similar manner, this is a big win."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I don’t see this as a W, most companies wouldn’t even charge for the small upgrade they’re offering. Look at Horizon and God of War, both had ps5 upgrades that cost nothing."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Can’t wait
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"That's awesome, now. If only PS+ wasn't like 80 billion dollars a month 😂😂"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Like a W shape?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Didn’t take long for this to descend into people moaning about PS+ lol!
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,haha loser
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I still don't know why this is getting remastered.  Beat Skyrims speed run by a couple years.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Big W
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,GOLF CLUBS
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Meanwhile free Witcher 3 upgrade:
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Did you forget you owned the LOU 2 on PS4? Or did you not know about the upgrade price? Or are you that flush with cash that it is trivial?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,What does big W mean
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Is it available for a discount ‘on’ launch day, or ‘from’ launch day? I.e is it only available for one day?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Good move, however just make it playable on both generations for free like Xbox attempts to."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Oh wow they did the bare minimum and still want you to pay a few bucks for the same game
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,You bought the game twice?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,A remastered version of a game which hardly needs any remastering is hardly a W.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"wow, this certainly makes me like sony more"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Stop preordering games altogether.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Meanwhile I can’t play some of my ps5 game upgrades I paid for cause I redeemed the ps plus versions when I had it and support told me there’s nothing they could do
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"The first of Undegevinter, what a month that is going to be.

Yes i looked up the latin for 19 and was a sly dig at the US Date format 

:)"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I got the game on disc the ps4 version do I have to put the game in then I get the ps5 version
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,You’re still paying $10 for a console upgrade other games make free lol
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Meanwhile I got a combo of RE3 and RE3 Remake for 40$ on GOG for PC last year.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,This doesnt balance the content removal that i and others paid for sony. Not by a long shot
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Then they delist it 10 years from now and the physical copy skyrockets in value and you own nothing.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Is it though? Couldn’t they have let everyone know this beforehand? How long ago did you pay for your preorder? Because they would’ve been making interest on that money the whole time they had it and they sure aren’t refunding that back to you.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I didn't get this message becayse I waited until the £10 upgrade was live. I did receive the preorder stuff when I bought the upgrade though. Not sure if the preorder stuff is because it's upgrade or always offered. I only had the standard edition of TLOU2 as well that I bought in a sale between lockdowns if memory serves. I will say it's awesome they did this though and also let you know. I bought a game in the past which came to PS Plus a few days later and they refunded me for it.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,They barely added anything...
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"They couldn't have done this with Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut?

For context I absolutely ADORE Ghost of Tsushima. But Director's Cut wasn't fucking worth the initial price tag. They should have given Digital Deluxe Edition owners a cheap upgrade path."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Wait what, wasn't part 2 release just a couple years ago? There is a remaster already? They really are milking that cow dry, huh"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,That's ... actually surprising.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I wouldnt pay what they are asking for less pop in anyway.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Yet if you get gt7 you can play on both ps4&5...this is a W how? Paying more to play a game you already own? Seems scummy 🤷‍♂️
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Sony to established customers: 🥰 

Sony to not customers: 🤬"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Ay
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Fair play to them, this is a good thing!"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,What the fuck is Big W?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Lmfao
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Is the discount only on release day?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Just give it for free. He literally already have it before
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I have 2 x Collector’s editions… Where’s my discounted upgrade 🥲
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"1. That's the bare minimum, this is not a ""Big W"".

2. You pre-ordered a remaster of a game that came out only a few years ago, sounds like a big L for you.

Actually you know what, this is a big W for Sony, they suckered you into pre-ordering a remaster for a game that's only a few years old, minimum effort maximum profits, see you in a few years when you pre-order the remaster of the remaster.

Why does shit like this get upvoted, why are we praising companies that do the bare minimum?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Smaller thing happened to me but Sony never sent me my money back they sent it to a one time use PSN card so I got jiped
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,PlayStation is such a W console and company.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I just love how the words ""Big W Playstation"" baits us Aussies like mosquitos to a light"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,What a weird place to be in where a company refunding money due to their own awkward pricing is considered a W.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Love it when they do this!
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Lloooolll 60 days to send a refund gtfoh Sony
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,60 days tho lol
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,They do this even if you pre order and you had disc edition?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I like how they apologised for saving you money 😆
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Part 2 is getting remastered already? How old is it? 3 years?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Common Playstation W.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Xbox does all of their upgrades for free... wtf
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Did they do this for the first remaster too?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,They even said sorry
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Amazing. 10 pounds to upgrade. Bargain as don’t think there is anything decent coming out in all of 2024. Thanks for posting and letting me know
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,The big win would have been to never make a remaster lol
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,That’s decent
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,So because I’ve got a digital version of TLOU2 I can get the PS5 remastered for free?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I can’t wait to play this, I’m late to the party. I know a lot of you will be envious!"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Are you really praising Sony for having you pay more for a game you already own? Disgusting
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,There’s no way he got a refund I’ve tried but they have never answered me
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,With cyberpunk you get the upgrade for free on all platforms
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Same thing happened to me when I was pre ordering the spider man remaster. So a win in my opinion.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,A big W would be getting a free upgrade to a game that’s 3 years old if you already own it
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Is the $10 upgrade always going to be $10?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Should be free
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,very nice
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Or you could just not charge to change some graphics settings AGAIN.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,60 days for the refunds 🤣
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,This is a W
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"The option to upgrade wasn’t available for me on the PSN Store until the day of, which made no sense to me. They were begging for this to happen"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Why can’t we get a $10 upgrade for the first one too? I don’t want to spend full price on a game I already own over and over
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Wait so what if I have the disc version? Are we not eligible?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Upgrade for only $10? Sign me up
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Wow 😮 I should get it too??
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,I was wondering how are they remaster a game that is still fairly new??? I was like they are trying to make as much as possible...
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,PlayStation is actually being pro-consumer for once. I’m impressed.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Bro how many times do they remaster these games shit is getting out of hand. Pt2 is only 4yrs old
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Up to 60 days damn lol
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Why would he pay full price of a remastered game😭🤣 is what they thought even a ps5 upgrade fuck that im good.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,so i have to preorder just to still pay for it
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"I must’ve missed something, why does this game need a remaster already? It looks incredible still"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Nice!  I’m buying that today!  Thanks for heads up.  I usually don’t find this stuff out until later lol.

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"Sony didn't have to do this. W for gamers who are loyal to the series 😉. 

P.S I hope they do this with future remasters. A small fee or part of PlayStation plus service"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"i thought this was r/tylerthecreator for a sec and was like ""why tf does this have to do with tyler the creator"""
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Didn’t realize Woolworths was still a thing. They haven’t been in the states since the 90’s
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Why does a brand new game have a remaster? Did you guys really let them sucker you into buying a linear single player game multiple times?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,The no return mode is fun as fuck
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,I wish they would’ve done this with the first game. I had just bought the remastered version of the last of us part one and the PS5 version came out maybe two months later. And I just can’t justify spending another 60 bucks on the video game. I understand it’s a little different but still.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Do they have the same policy for part 1 if you have the remaster for PS4?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,How about 20 dollars
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,It’s not “remastered”.  It’s just the PS4 version with more skins.  There’s no upgrade in terms of the graphics and performance.  It’s a huge ripoff.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Hey good for them
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Free would've been a BIGGER W. But $10 isn't bad.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"Jesus, what the hell went wrong?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Now this is how you take care of your costumers
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,I got it for ps4 when it first came out but I don’t see the upgrade…
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Why is this happening? This is just as pointless as the PS5 Spider-man
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,How is this being remastered already i thought this came out recently lmao damn time flies it still feels like the las of us part two came out like last year or two years ago😭
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Massive PlayStation win they didn’t want the zero brains who preordered it to waste 60$
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Remastered for the ps5 only… BULLSHIT
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,I wasn’t able to even make the preorder or ten dollar purchase until the day of release. It gave me an error saying I already owned the product.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Reddit talk is so damn confusing. What are you people saying??
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,I own the disc version of Last of Us Part 2 on PS4. I wish I could upgrade to the digital version and not have to use the PS4 disc.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,I'm guessing those who are unfortunate enough to not be able to get a ps5 won't be able to get The last of Us Part 2 remastered version even though I already have the game
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,What about the physical version? Do we get a discount?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,From the little bit of the new modes I've seen it looks really good.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"Thanks for the info, downloading now!"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,I'd much rather an upgrade option instead of buying a new copy each time. GTA V there's like 5+ different versions
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,This is their way of getting rid of future free ps5 upgrades
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Good. Seemed like a scam to make people buy it full price again.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Torrenting and iso literally takes no time if you know what you want.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Fao that's what you get stop supporting crappy gaming companies
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Yes big W
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,If I buy a used copy will I still be able to purchase the remaster at a discount price?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,The new modes are surprisingly fun
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,That's crazy I didn't know they actually cared lol
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Doing something normal conglomerates never do lol
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,🤔🤔🤔
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"In some cases yes, but in most cases it’s free upgrades depending on the developer"

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I’m so Australian that I’m actually confused. What is OP saying if they *aren’t* talking about Big W?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Literally only clicked on this post to see what big W was doin
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,my dumbass was LMAOO
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"""Big W Playstation"" is how I remember where to get new DS4 controllers."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Didn't understand till I read your comment! I kept thinking it clearly shows you bought it on the PSN Store not from Big W!
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,yes I was like was this a dodgy returned playstation?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Yeah I’m going what did bigW do? This doesn’t make sense
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,As an Australian this made me smile haha.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Yeah I was a lil confused at first
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Fkn oath I was
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Most accurate post I kept reading it to work out how it related to Big W. Because it's not like i wouldn't make sense to bring up the store for game chat. They sell games for generally cheaper than most other retailers.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I'm too chronically online that now when I hear someone talking about the store ""BIG W"" I instantly think of the internet term"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Oh hey that's me!
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I was hoping for a flash sale ha haha
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"It confused the hell out of me, I read it and thought what’s this got to do with Big W? Then I reread the title and it clicked, haha."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Because a W in Australia is a M right?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I have never been called out so hard by a comment before!
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Can confirm, was very confused"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Yep. Took me a while trying to figure out how Big W was involved, only to eventually realise they mean it was a big win for playstation."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Get out of my head.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I saw this and was deeply confused by the big W part of the post
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Literally same, I was so confused for a second"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Yeh I was wondering what it had to do with a play station
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I read the whole thing and was trying to figure out what it had to do with BigW. 

Then realised Im BigStupid."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I'm so confused. Was the PlayStation bundle purchased in Big W? Sauce: Not Australian but live here.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I was one of them. In fact it didn't occur to me that OP isn't talking about Big W until I read your post. I was just very confused.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Apologies in advance!
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I am. What? lol I am lost.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Got me, lol. I read the title. Read the screenshot. Was very confused. Thought maybe he was for some reason trying to figure out how to get his refund from Big W?

Whoops."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Does Woolworths still exist in Australia?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I was so, so confused until I read the actual text."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-22,Ah we used to have our own Big W in the UK. Good times.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Yes. You can buy the $10 upgrade.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Yes, you can get the remasters for $10 upgrade fee. You’ll need to insert your ps4 disc every time you want to play it"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I rember when PS+ was just €/$50 per year and we got about 8 games monthly, 3 for PS3, 3 for PS4, and 2 for PS Vita. This was before support for PS3/Vita got “officially” dropped in 2021, i’m still suprised it’s up to this day and that some games are still getting discounts lol, they’re all either permenantly discounted now or it’s an automated system put in place."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Or refunding the game...

Ooops, you downloaded 1MB? Sorry, no refund."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Maybe one day we can back up our ps5 saves on our own usb drives like with ps4 but they are too busy nickle and dimeing us by locking save backups behind ps+ only.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Yeah one of the only time i called Sony is when they charge me full price for Ps plus (renewal) while it was on discount 20% off... they never wanted to either cancel the subscription or pay me back the 20%... stellar customer service
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Wish they were this cool with literally anything else
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I wish they were this cool in general. Xbox likes to be “for the gamers” because they have to be. Small things like this go a long way for public perception and Sony should do it more.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Their PS+ pricing is fine, it's $80 a year and gives you roughly 40 games"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Becuase its not sony, its the developer."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Those digital copies go quick, gotta act fast."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I love the studio, have had family work there, so I would gladly give more money to a game and studio that's close to my heart!"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Upgrade isn't visible on the store yet.  At least it wasn't yesterday when I checked.  I can see how people miss it.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,You preordered the remaster ~~without seeing if there was an upgrade path~~?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"We’ll, the bar in the industry is really low right now, so a step up is a step up"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Also, up to *60 goddamn days* to process a refund with a caveat of 'we might actually just give you store credit instead of your money back' is not exactly something to be applauded."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"*corporation almost fleeces all preorders*

""OH MAN GOOD GUY PLAYSTATION!"""
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Especially for a remaster of a game that isn’t even five years old…
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"If anything, it's an ""L"" that the PS Store allows a user who owns TLOU2 to pay full price for the remaster. A better service would automatically detect that the account trying to buy the game should be paying the discounted price...."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Cdpr made cyberpunk and witcher 3 upgrades from ps4 to ps5 absolutely free
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Yeah for real. Let's not touch on the fact that we bought the PS4 digital version and preordered this ""remaster"" full price. Sony just trying to make idiots feel better about themselves.

Edit: And yeah before the downvotes flood in I do think people are fucking idiots for preordering a ""remaster"" of a god damn game they bought 3 years ago."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Tbf, bare minimum ethical behavior is a LOT to ask for in this day and age..."

r/gaming are full of playstation fanboys. It's not surprising they would bootlick everything playstation and hate everything Xbox/Nintendo"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I can’t believe how long it took to find this comment
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Yeah, to show others that we care if they act so. I mean this is a first for me."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Having to buy the same game twice?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Every other studio/publisher did next-gen upgrades for free. lol
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Higher res, some new effects, ps5 controller support and apparently some new content…

Yeah… it’s not great to sell that as a remaster but there have been worse cases…"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"TLoU Remastered came out a year after TLoU. TLoU 2 remastered is coming out 4 years after TLoU 2. The main difference is the hardware upgrade from ps3 to ps4 was more significant and ps4 wasn’t backwards compatible. So this just doesn’t feel as rewarding, but I don’t think it’s that crazy"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,It released 6 months before an entirely new generation of console hardware…
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"It’s $10, calm down everyone. I’d certainly pay that if I hadn’t played it already"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Idk, taking advantage of better hardware?"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Kinda blows by mind that TLoU franchise is the one and only game franchise that gets chastised for having a “Remastered”

No one complained when Spider-man had has a remastered in 2020 that added two suits"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Jesus christ the people in here praising this company for making you pay \*AGAIN\* for content that you already fucking own.

I honestly thought OP was being sarcastic at first...

Let me rephrase this:

""Hey, you bought that hardback book at your old house.  We see you're moving, and we'd like you to know that you can buy that book \*again\* for your new house, at a DEEP discount""

That's what this fucking is.  This is a fucking scam.

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"This is still a nice gesture regardless. I know people love hating on corporations every chance they get, but they always neglect when something positive comes out of them. It's fine to like something a company does. No one wants to constantly be negative so for them to refund a purchase where they couldve netted like 50 dollars instead of 10 is still a nice gesture, a lot wouldve just taken it and not bothered refunding it."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Yeah this is literally just common sense.

Also: Holy shit these consoles are barren when it comes to video games. who tf gets excited to a remaster of a 4 year old game? lol"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,How is this the bare minimum? Jesus Christ when did gamers become so cynically entitled?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Your wish is granted. They are currently working on 2 new IPs. They cancelled the Last of Us multiplayer to keep resources on them.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,apparently they're doing one for horizon as well.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Didn't this game just come out?  lmao Why are they remastering it?  Who would buy that shit.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It’s just a poorly named DLC, it’s not really a remaster."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Apparently a triple remaster is a Big W

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,How noble of the company to allow them to purchase the same game again but for less money this time.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,One thing I liked with Xbox this gen was the whole smart delivery. So many of my old games were “enhanced” without having to shell $60-70 for the same game.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It has new modes and changes that warrant the $10 charge imo
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I sort of agree, but that remaster wasn't free to develop"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"There was already a free next gen update years ago, for PS5. 

This has very minimal performance / graphics updates. It has some minor changes and a new game mode."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Not only that, but preordered a remaster of a game that only came out a few years ago. With idiots like OP around it's no wonder pointless cash grabs are becoming more and more common."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"If you'd read anything about it it's a 10 dollar upgrade that adds a lot of the tech they used for Part 1, and also adds a new rougelike mode and extra levels that weren't part of the first game.

Totally reasonable for 10 bucks."

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I've got a couple refunds from Sony and it's never taken more than 3 days. That's just a maximum for policy purposes/investigations.

You didn't upgrade TLOU because you probably don't own a PS5 lol.."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,60 days is worst case scenario. He’ll probably have the money back by tomorrow. It also comes down to his bank too
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,The new roguelike mode is honestly worth the $10. I've put like 5 hours into it already
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,What are u talking about? Just curious
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Without getting actually into the narrative (good and bad), gameplay wise it's a bit better, offering more stuff to craft, better upgrades, and a few subtle but welcome improvements on gameplay. Not too many innovations outside the box but there's a couple of neat setpieces (there's one that involves swimming that's really neat, and another I won't spoil). 

The big thing that bugged me, and this does somewhat tie into the narrative, is the jumping around. I won't get too deep into it but there's more than a few narrative jumps that can make progress far more annoying (and may risk amplifying negative feelings towards the narrative even if you like it). If you don't care as much about linear progress that probably won't bug you."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Nobody is forcing anyone to buy this. I'm getting it for the extra content. If you have a PS4 version it runs and looks great on PS5 anyways so if someone decides the remaster isn't for them they're really not missing out on much.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It's not really smart delivery since its a $10 upgrade.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"They refunded their payment method so your point is kind of mute. Also, if you don't want to pay that price for a small upgrade then buy the original for much less, it still exists. I imagine these remasters are to keep parity with the PC version as much as anything but they should just call it directors cut or something instead."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"If you actually read the message, you'll see that it says it's refunded to your original payment method, not the PSN wallet."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,The biggest L is you openly admitting you can’t read…
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Anything worth playing though? I can say this as a PS5 and series x owner with a 'no'

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Because PS themselves saw OP owned TLOU2 digitally for the PS4, so they helped them save money by refunding their $50 pre-order and suggesting them to buy the PS5 upgrade for just $10 at launch since it would be a lot cheaper and contain the same bonuses as the pre-order he had made previously. The W was PS’s ‘gesture of good will’."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Why care how other people spend their money?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Because I like the games and I want to play it immediately when it comes out?

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Buy an used PS4 version at GameStop tomorrow and plop it in your PS5.

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Theres an entire new mode.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,That's literally not what happened.  It's a remastered game.  You don't get remastered movies or music for free do you?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Would never have a good exclusive yes
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,10 dollars for a new game mode and extra costumes and behind the scenes stuff is very decent
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,The remaster includes a DLC. It's not just graphics.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,They did! I have it downloaded and ready to go
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,New content
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I'm pretty sure you can still get the upgrade, you just need to put your disc in your PS5 to play it."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,If it was only graphical I agree but it’s not

PC gaming sucks"

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"It would’ve been poor business not to release something following the massive success of the show. Lots of new eyes and those eyes want PS5 graphics. If they spend a a couple of extra hundred mill on their new IP, everybody’s a winner."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"Tbh, would of been nice if they redid the first one again even though it got did on the ps4 wayyy back. It’s been long enough for a little updates graphics if they were gonna do either.

And honestly the second game is so mid compared to the first, in my opinion."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,This release specifically is $10.

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-21,Its literally $10. Do you people think before you post or just assume you know everything?

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-25,Does it have to be ps4 disc? Or ps5 disc?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I member when you didnt even need PS+ and multiplayer was free and worked (game dependent ofc, Gears of War host cleaned shit no matter what).

Its up,  shits garbagio beans now and the kids are too young to remember when it wasnt"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I remember when PS+ cost me nothing at all because multiplayer was free on PS3 and nobody was forced to rent games
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,And now they have the more expensive PS+ versions
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,I was getting it for like $30 a year from resellers. Those were the days. It's a borderline scam at its current price now.

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I've refunded multiple games on PS that I've downloaded and played that were shite.

GTA collection at launch, played all three titles for about half hour each got a refund.

Necromancer Hired Gun, I got refunded because I felt like shite at release. I actually left my PS5 disconnected in rest when I refunded this and could still play it (obviously) when I turned it back on even after being refunded - it was still a naff game.

There's been more but I can't remember"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It gets worse than that. I got charged full price for the most expensive tier around xmas last year cuz of auto renew. I called every day for 2 weeks after work & tried live chatting & was told to call back or try later. (Xmas apparently flooded them) Took a day off of work to call them when the call center opened, got told its been too long since the renew & if i issue a chargeback, my account would be banned & i wouldnt be able to play any digital games i purchased on the store. Completely screwed me & havent bought ps+ since. "
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I got double charged when I bought snowrunner last year and the customer service was absolutely bloody useless, despite obvious evidence that it wasn’t my fault but Sony’s."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Only in reddit you get downvoted for supporting a studio you love.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"You're paying $70 for a game you already own though, with some added bells and whistles. For a game that came out three years ago. For a studio that crunches employees and throws out millions of dollars of work. I don't want to judge, but I just don't get it lol.

Edit: It's actually $50, still wasting $40 which is how much the PS4 version goes for now."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"You know the little guys already got paid right? They aren't getting residuals, you're just giving some rich guy with 3 yachts even more money"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I mean at that point why not just buy a physical deluxe for like $10 more and get the poster
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Yikes.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Most last gen console upgrades are already free
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-22,Especially for Sony.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Idk why everyone is downvoting that guy. Banks can take as long as they like to refund you for charges that have already been processed. I work at a Burger King and even we have to tell people it may take up to a week for their refund to appear in their account. It’s not us, it’s the bank. “60 Days” is probably just to cover their asses."

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,No. Getting a refund when you accidentally pay for the same game twice instead of paying for the upgrade.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It’s only a $10 upgrade to the ps5 and it does add things that wasn’t in the original release.. so they get a pass.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Why is this ridiculous comment being upvoted? You’re not buying “the same game twice.” You bought the game once, and have the option to enhance its graphics and get bonus content for $10. Get a clue."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It is and it's not in a way. I'd bet a lot of dev work goes into making versions for different hardware so a small price is fair imo. Now I don't agree with charging 70 again for something I already paid 70 for.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"""having to"" lol ok"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,And this game isn't an exception. TLOU2 got a next gen upgrade for free a long time ago.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Even ignoring the ignorant ""every other"" here, ND did give the next gen patch for TLOU2 for free."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Yeah that’s just not true lol
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Definitely not. Plenty of other devs have charnged for next-gen upgrades. Some even more than $10. Hogwarts Legacy is a good example. The last gen version is $59.99 and only gives the last gen version. The current gen version is $69.99 and only gives the current gen version. To get both the PS4 and PS5 versions in one transaction, you must buy the digital deluxe edition for $79.99.

Plenty of other devs were charging $59.99 for last gen and $69.99 for current gen, and charging the $10 difference to upgrade. TLOU2 was a $59.99 game, they're basically just charging the same upsell everyone else does for current gen."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,It’s 10 dollars loool let’s calm down
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Yeah, so with how close it was to PS5 release it means the Devs will have had their hands on the consoles for a significant period of development, especially given theyre a first party developer.  They could have just done what a lot of Devs do and have a digital upgrade.  But they knew people would buy it again so why not?

People give Rockstar shit for doing the same thing, but apparently ND should be immune."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,And the Spiderman remaster didn't even have an upgrade path! You either had to get a deluxe edition of Spiderman MM or buy the ps5 version of SM1 full priced
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,nintendo would dropkick you in the face and laugh before they give you any sort of discount on cross gen games
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Yes, Nintendo is by far the worst double dipper of the big 3, however that doesn't make what Sony did not the bare minimum."

Being charged the advertised price is not a ""gesture of goodwill"" imo."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I mean they aren’t wrong. Most first party Xbox games get free upgrades if they own the previous gen version.

You are the best example of the ""Consumers when corps do the bare minimum"".

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Yeah same game on SNES, Playstation one, Mega-Drive, PC and so one?  
  
You had to pay full price each time. Physical copy costs money wasn't really an argument, pressing CD's cost companies pennys."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"This game came out 3 years ago. This is a money grab. So yes, this is the bare minimum"

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,is that their strategy? milk their IP by redoing it ever 2 years? yikes. this whole TLOU milking is insaneeeee. probably worst than skyrims cash grab
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It's not a remaster of a very old game. It's basically a PS4 game being released on the PS5, but if they didn't ""remaster"" it, people would complain that it was the same game and a lazy port."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Four years ago. It's a PS5 port with enhanced graphics, DualSense integration, and new content."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,It's a small DLC and not just a remaster
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-23,They went into the settings and turned the graphics up
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It didn’t “just come out”, it’s almost 4 years old. Either way it’s just a PS5 port basically. Enhanced graphics and new content and PS4 owners get a $10 upgrade path."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I’m going to assume you aren’t aware (or at least thinking) of the HBO show of the games? The upcoming second season is based on Part 2. Part 2 was released on PS4 so it makes perfect sense to have a PS5 version so show watchers/PS5 owners who never played it can play something current gen.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,That’s a very decent thing to do indeed

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I think the point is in comparison to physical pre-orders, where you got some form of tangible, limited edition item(s) that you'd only get *if* you pre-ordered.  There was also the part about not having enough copies of a game if you didn't pre-order, so it used to be quite necessary if you were interested in playing on launch day.

Pre-ordering digital games is a little unnecessary unless you care about pre-loading the game or in-game content that you might not get otherwise.  It also sets a precedent for big game companies to make a shit product that's incomplete and unpolished because ""the idiots will just buy it anyway"".

Otherwise, yeah, nobody should care how someone else spends their money.

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Tbh it was MS/XBOX who did this and normalised it. Sony saw that comfortable gamers got with it and decided to dive in too. No company is gonna leave free money out in the wild.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Gears of War and Halo 3 was on Xbox and required a paid Xbox Live account to work. PS3's free online was abysmal compared to Xbox Live. So yeah not sure what the hell you're trying to say here..
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Gears of War isn’t available on PlayStation.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Yeah! This is the thing that finally did it in for Sony for me.  
Fucking paywalling a part of a game YOU **bought** for a console YOU also **bought**.

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,The moment Ps+ was put in place as a multiplayer requirement was seriously an end to an era
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Steam is better than that, the 2 hour/2 week window is an *automatic* refund, you can still request one after that and if your reasoning is sound they mostly approve those too.

I've had a refund approved after ""10 hours"" of play.

The only thing they crack down on are serial refunders, don't abuse it."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Steam sure. Xbox policy is deliberately vague. They don't even have a set amount of time you're allowed to play, just whatever they consider to be a ""substantial amount of time"" is the limit. It's why their refunds are inconsistent. Some times you can get a refund after a few hours of playing, other times you can't get a refund before having played at all. I'd almost prefer being told straight up that I'm not eligible for a refund as soon as I download it. That way I don't buy and download it expecting to be able to get a refund only to get bit in the ass by the weird, arbitrary, and vague refund policy Xbox offers.


Steams is far better than Xbox because they tell you exactly how long you're allowed to play and their own opinions aren't relevant to the equation. Can put Xbox on the same level when they clarify the exact amount of time you're allowed to play before refunding and there's no exceptions to the rule."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Xbox does not have a better refund policy and deny people all the time if they just download a game. You can check the Xbox sub to see it happen all the time.

They were even denying people refunds for Cyberpunk when it released broken"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Lol on Xbox they also give you the series x version free. Oh you can also play on windows..
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Xbox stops you after 3 refunds. Then they threaten to ban your account if you ask support again.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I think the downvotes are coming because the way OP worded their comment, it sounds like they’re just paying extra money when they know they don’t have to. 

That’s just my view tho"
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Probably because they're massive and its lame to support big companies. Its like saying ""I waited in line to get the new Baconator from Wendy's, it was so good!

He likes this game and he wants developers to build those
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Not defending crunch but throwing away million dollars worth of work because it wasn't up to their standards is how you get high quality products.

199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Well I can only speak for myself here, but I downvoted him because he was being an asshole for no reason. Like I have no problem being corrected if I'm mistaken about something, but there's no reason to start a comment with 'you're a fucking idiot' when I've not been uncivil in any way. 

As far as the actual point goes, if saying 60 days was a CYA move than I would expect it to be more common. Every major online retailer says something to the effect of 'it may take up to (x) days for your refund to appear on your balance' and that's understandable as bank processing time, but in most cases the number they give is like 5 or 7 days. If there was actually a chance of a bank/credit card taking two full months to process a refund I'd expect Amazon/Microsoft/etc. to give similar time frames in their warnings, but they don't."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I run an online retail business and we say 3-5 business days. 60 is insane
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,What bank needs 60 days for a refund? Are you 12 and yet to open your first bank account?
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,They don’t have a very good track record with this though. The PlayStation store will easily let you buy a deluxe version or a game you already own. They gave me a hard time when I bought Nioh after I realized I had already purchased a different version of the game. They eventually gave me a refund but I had to really fight for it and they made it clear it was a one time thing they wouldn’t do again.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Seems to me they're scuffed for even allowing it in the first place.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,That's the easy way out of a potential class-action lawsuit.
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Not like this hasn't happened prior, too. Wasn't it the same with Ghost of Tsushima?

People really be acting like enhanced graphics, three additional levels, and a whole new game mode aren't part of the upgrade.

Plus, the sad truth that all/most of AAA PS5 releases are 10 bucks more expensive now. Naughty Dog could have just made a PS5 version and asked for those 10 bucks."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Probably why they've waited so long for the PC releases. Wouldn't want people changing the graphic settings *for free*.

Not inherently wrong, but the site shouldn’t allow you to order the remastered game at full price anyways if you already have the standard version."
199wn73,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"This game also got free ps5 update that enables 60fps for owners of ps4 version. This 10$ has the same graphics as the free upgrade, and bunch of new content and modes. So its more of DLC than nextgen update. Check Digital Foundry if you want confirmation.

It can still be considered a cashgrab, but you dont need to buy it for graphics at all. Just buy it if new content is interesting for you"

Should be in the top 10! :)"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Good work and an interesting list.

The big problem with it is the sourcing. 

During the period from 1989 to 2000, there were dozens of PC game magazines that comprehensively reviewed computer games. They were far more in-depth and they were contemporaneous to the games being released, not a list put together after years of hindsight.

Consequently, the modern list providers are going back thirty or more years, looking at hindsight memory and sales. 

Games that definitely SHOULD be on this list are left out largely because their genres didn't grow into industry leaders, even though sports and flight sims, and puzzle games, were much, much bigger back then.

Games I would've expected based on their rep at the time would've included Earl Weaver Baseball from circa 1986-87; Wolfenstein 3-D from 1993; The Secret of Monkey Island from 1991 (ish); Falcon 3.0 from 1990 or thereabouts; Wing Commander from 1993,  FIFA International Soccer from 1994; Descent: Freepspace from 1998-ish. 

That's just off the top of my head. But all of those were considered genre-defining at one point, and certainly were among the best reviewed games ever. Reviewing also used to be MUCH tougher. Modern games that get an ""80"" would often have been a ""50"" or a ""60"" in equivalents of the time.

So operating from hindsight sort of robs this of accuracy, to me. But it's a good list, nonetheless."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Maybe i missed it but it's weird not seeing Heroes of Might and Magic III anywhere, as this is still a cult game..."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Awesome data! 1 question:

Could you explain this part more?

>also gave a certain amount of extra points for simply being on the list--otherwise games that ranked low would get basically no advantage over games that didn't rank at all. The amount differed based on whether the list was a top 50, top 100, top 200, and so on. Making it onto more exclusive lists obviously granted more points.

1 ""maybe more of a comment than a question"" (sorry)

Did you control for date of release? As you've written it, any game released later than 2018 is disadvantaged by being excluded from evefifry previous list. What I mean is, Hades or Elden Ring are excluded from lists before 2020 or 2022, respectively. I can see the justification here being that newer games *should* be disadvantaged in a ""best games of all time"" list to counteract the cult-of-the-new aspect, but I'd be intersted in how that was actually approached / dealt with, if at all.

And finally, 2 comments:

\- It's interesting that there aren't any VR games. Beat Saber is the biggest one that comes to mind. Sports games in general are really underrepresented, I don't know if that's related.

\- Pole Position (1983) got robbed."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Is it just me or is this list just a tiny bit biased against PC games? World of Warcraft completely redefined gaming, was the most popular game in the world for years, and isn't even in the top 30. Same story for Doom. And Baldur's Gate didn't even make the top100. And I could go on for a while.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Also, I'm a little surprised Unreal Tournament 2004 didn't make it on some list. As it was a 2004 banger, making it one of the greatest games of all time, because it was one of the best games, in one of the best year in history. It has the vaulted ""universal acclaim"" from metacritic and 11 perfect reviews out of 48 reviews. In one of the best years in gaming history (2004), (Only 2007 and maybe 1998 are better)."

I think that’s partially due to being that age where I *really* grew up with consoles. I don’t care much for GTAV, but I have younger cousins and in-laws who would put it in their top 3.

reasons:

1. each list is bound to a have a 1st place, so each publication is normalized on that, as opposed to providing more points if the list is longer. For example, a t50 list has only 1/4 the number of points a t100 list has

2. with the harmonic pricing system, different positions have different differential values. E.g., the difference between a 50th position and 51st position has a smaller difference than between a 2nd vs 3rd, for example, as it should be. I can't believe the editors of a publication would put much effort into whether crash bandicoot is 30th or 31st. However, I think a lot of effort would have been put into 1st vs 2nd.

That said, I don't think that would change things up too much -- Ocarina of Time is still going to be the undisputed King of our video game history. After that, I'd be curious to see what the differences are"

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"> Number of games with female protagonist: 17

It would be interesting to see this explained/broken down more. Several games on the list have no ""protagonist"" (sports games, strategy games, etc.) a customisable protagonist which can be female or male (mostly RPGs) or a selection of player characters with no single ""primary"" protagonist (fighting games, etc.). I fear by simply including this number without further breakdown, some will read it as the other 183 games have a male protagonist, which clearly isn't the case.

EDIT: I did my own count and came up with:

Ambiguous/unidentified/no protagonist: 14

Customisable protagonist: 33

Female protagonist: 13 (so I'm clearly not counting the same way the OP did...)

Male protagonist: 115

Multiple selectable characters: 25

Note that there's a bit of subjective judgement involved in choosing ""Customisable protagonist"" vs. ""Multiple selectable characters"". In my judgement; if the character chosen/created by the player is the only one that logically ""exists"" within the game, then it's a ""customisable protagonist"", but if the non-chosen selections can appear within the game (e.g. secondary characters, opponents, etc.) it's ""multiple selectable characters""."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Nice to see hades here. My favorite game of all time
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,OP is the MVP of the month.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,wow best list I've seen
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Nice work! For anyone interested in these kind of lists, websites like PlayThatGame and AcclaimedVideoGames do this with hundreds."

DAMN I DIDN'T KNOW THE CRASH WAS THAT BAD"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Super Metroid is way too low at 37. Should be in the top 5
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,So happy Yakuza 0 made the list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Why Final Fantasy 6 and not FF7? Must have been a typo
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Wow, this seems just about perfect, well done. I was beyond ecstatic to see Viewtiful Joe, Mother 3, and Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 up there, they deserve it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Older games are on more lists so they made it higher on your list. Time bias is clear here
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Great work compiling the list even though I gotta disagree with a LOT specifically in terms of ordering. Lots of iconic genre-defining games not even close to being top 25 are wild. Diablo 2? Starcraft? Counter strike? DIABLO 2? Super Mario Bros 3/Super Mario World?   


BOTW doesn't even deserve a spot on the list and it's #2 like how egregious is that? Recency bias? BOTW is nowhere near close to Majora's Mask OR Twilight Princess those two are goated in the franchise along with OOT and Link to the Past. Anyway holy shit this is triggering"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Ocarina of Time will probably never be topped. You just had to be there…
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-28,"Gonna play every game of them i haven't played, Thank you!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-30,I think halo Combat evolved should be above cod 4. Why? Because it revolutionized FPS games. A lot of fps are built upon the halo formula. Cod 4 would not be what it is without halo combat evolved.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-30,Who else played only 5 from the Top 100? :{}
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-12-01,Fallout New Vegas being so much lower than Fallout 3 feels weird
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-12-06,"The OP is quite literally the goat. But the best game in my opinion, definitely has to be The Legend of Zelda ocarina of Time. So ahead of its time. And such a revolutionary change of pace for its time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Team Fortress 2 is on there but TFC isn't? Go fuck every list this was made from.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Sources are biased mostly by being recent. This list lacks awareness of genre creators and/or popularizers. No FPS would be on this list were not for Half-Life, and somehow the original is only 82nd? Nonsense."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It's seems like a weird mix of recency bias but still ranking the games for their time a bit. Some ratings are extremely bad if it's supposed to be how good they were when released and there's an obvious bias for newer games but not completely as plenty of them are still old enough to not be as good as modern games in direct comparisons.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"This is actually fantastic work and exactly the kind of stuff I like to see. 

I spend the last few months running a tournament with my group of friends to determine what we as a group think is the best game of all time. 

Started with 224 games grouped by genre at first then narrowed it down 150 and finally to a final bracket of 56. 

Fun fact Old School Runescape made it all the way to the finals lol. 

Here are our brackets if anyone is interested. It was a fun couple of months.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"No fallout 4. I don't expect it to be top 50, but it's definitely better than quite a few games on this list. But I'm a fallout nerd. I am surprised to see that fallout 3 is ranked higher than new vegas. I agree purely for nostalgic reasons, but it is definitely not the case in the community."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Nintendo games are hella overrated
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,*Baldur’s Gate 3* is going to be in the top 20 in future “best of all time” lists.

Noooo"

97/200 for me, surprisingly low. 

And as much as I liked both games I’m surprised to see Fire Emblem Three Houses and Ghost of Tsushima crack this list, but happy with how high Dishonored 2 charted."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Wow.  Impressive work.  I was surprised that Baldur's Gate 3 isn't on this list considering how popular it is.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Pokemon Red/Blue at 22, yep.  
Pokemon Gold/Silver at 75, makes sense...  
Pokemon Diamond/Pearl at 172, huh?

Just skipped right over Ruby/Sapphire which isn't even on the list. Didn't expect that. Were Ruby/Sapphire hated or just forgettable? I loved them growing up so maybe I just have rose tinted glasses."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Maybe recency bias of me but I think that Baldur’s Gate 3 could be competitive in the future for #1 on this list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Divinity Original Sin II sitting at 132 is a disgrace. Top 50 easily. Fortnite at 94? GTFO. Wow at 31? Nah it’s top 15. FNV at 92? Put that shit top 50.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2024-05-09,"Go play virtual reality gaming with Astro Bot Rescue Mission (psvr1), Resident Evil 8 in VR (psvr2), Bound (psvr1), The Playroom VR (psvr1 free download), and Sprint Vector. And that list of yours is going to come crashing down in a hurry. Starting VR gaming in 2019 for me was almost like a revelation. The top VR games are at another level of immersion that nothing on standard 3d can compete with. I even sold my Switch with Breath of the Wild back then in 2019 to buy more VR games. Zero regrets. (It was that good!! 😎🏆). These are VR games I recommend if you want to be impressed with the gaming hobby all over again (as if you were 15 again pretty much):

On psvr1 + ps4: Sprint Vector, The Playroom VR (it’s free!), Astro Bot Rescue Mission, Raw Data, Tumble VR, Dance Collider, Beat Saber, Iron man VR, Rigs mechanized combat league, Fujii, Electronauts, Red Matter, Batman VR, Racket Fury Table Tennis

On psvr2 + ps5: RE8, Moss 2, Red Matter 2, Hubris, Runner, Synth Riders, Pistol whip, Walkabout mini golf"

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I wish when people made new lists, they'd not include factors like influence or nostalgia.  The lists tend to be very static otherwise.

A lot of these classics are really rough to play today, and if they released this year wouldn't come close to being top of the list for recent games."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Braid being on there but not The Witness is certainly something. Both amazing games but I thought The Witness is superior in every way. Only the Portal games beat out The Witness for puzzlers imo.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Last of us part II is way too low, especially if part one is that high. Part II is better in just about every way, the only real subjective part is the story and thats been tarnished by bitter people with weird daddy/daughter/protector issues. Other than that, graphics, controls, enemy AI etc. are all objectively better."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"As always, reviews seem to be heavily console and single player focused. It might just be me, but it's comical that Ocarina of Time is #1 and yet Everquest, Ultima Online, Quake, Diablo 1, and Unreal Tournament don't even make the list. 

I was an avid gamer when OOT came out. And yeah, it was a decent game. But holy hype batman. It certainly wasn't better than any of the games I listed above."

Tetris and MineCraft and Super Mario 64 seem like absolute *nonsense* placements. The first two are entertaining and addicting, but have virtually no element of a story. Mario 64 was legitimately annoying to play, the visuals were exciting and new at the time, but holy hell you screamed at the camera controls more than trying to work out how to play the level.

Also, those two Zelda games topping the list? Really? I like Wind Waker FAR better than either."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Why are we still calling Ocarina of Time the best game of all time? It’s been 24 years. OOT isn’t even the best Zelda game.

I’ll admit, OOT paved the way for 3D game design, it walked so future games could run.

But are we seriously considering OOT better than all 24 years of games that came after it? Better than Majora’s Mask? Better than BOTW?"

No story, no depth, frustrating / meh combat, and side quests that make zero sense in the global context of the game.  Yet it’s hyped beyond belief.  It makes me believe that these best of lists are subsidized. /rant"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,No Cyberpunk on list makes me not taking it seriously though. I wonder if the bad release doomed it?

Second of all: Wtf... How is Alien Isolation best of 2014?!O_O

It competes with Destiny, Mario Kart 8, Dark Souls II, Hearthstone, Bayonetta 2, Titanfall and it wins?

With metascore average of 78-83 across all platforms?

I need to look into the data because something's off.

EDIT: ok, I am now even more interested in the raw data and calculations that were done by OP. I've done some ""at a glance"" of 2014 and there's no way that Alien Isolation is higher than Dark Souls 2. We're talking 78 on metacritic vs 92. Out of half a dozen publications that I've reviewed, DS2 is higher by 10-15% in scores. What am I missing?

EDIT2: Alien Isolation is not even listed on almost half of the lists that OP mentioned that they used. It leads me to believe that their calculation method is not weighted (i.e. being on 1 out 12 lists with high score, skewes the outcome). It would explain why it's so high.

EDIT3: Empire, Slant, Popular Mechanics, GQ, USA Today? Not sure if I'd count them as reasonable resources for best games of all time."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Imagine writing this list, getting to the point where Skyrim is 18 and Shadow of the Colossus is 16 and not stopping? Its clear this data is random as hell.

like Mario is the top franchise, not Zelda, despite Zelda being the top 2 spots haha bro this list....you wasted your time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Its crazy that Zelda games are even near the top
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Why the heck is rdr2 so low lol
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,zelda is so fucking overrated
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I will never understand peoples obsessions of rankings and reviews. like, i dont trust any review i havent done myself. and GOTY awards and stuff like that is most of the time just a ""who has the biggest fanbase"" competition"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Lol,  nah,  this ain't it.   Elden Ring at 65?

Edit: lol"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Pleasantly surprised to see inside on this list and fairly high up too
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This is great
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Correction: The most overrated list as people follow whatever marketers spew at them + peer(internet) pressure to like the game
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I've said it before, two things.... 1)The modern game industry is shit. 

&#x200B;

2) And the 90s and 2000s were the absolute peak of gaming, making up a tad bit over 60 percent of ""the greatest games off all time"" 

&#x200B;

And a lot of the 2010 games, were early 2010 games to boot lol. 

&#x200B;

Cut and dry. That is it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"As someone who grew up with Mario 64 it’s criminal that it’s as high as it is.. never mind top 10 game of all time, I don’t even think it’s a top 10 mario game!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Elden ring is much better than both Zelda. OoT was ground breaking but it's not that good. Even majors mask is much better
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"""Number of games with explicitly (stated in-game) LGBT protagonist""
What does LG BlueTooth has to do with any of this?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Breath of the wild was so shit. Why does everyone like that game so much? It’s obviously a me issue but Christ is it over rated. It’s like 40 something spots ahead of STARCRAFT?!?!? Cmon man.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Lol. Funny times im living in. Seems to be very important now to mention if theres female or lbgt protagonist, for whatever pathetic reason. Also those childish Zelda games on rank 1 and 2, just lol. I played this so called ""masterpiece"" BOTW and at best its a cute adventurous kiddo game, a child-friendly peek into the openworld genre, but there were far better openworld games. And GTA5 on rank 3, a game that encourages criminality and ruthless sociopathy. Yet i dont wonder, humanity at its best."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Unpopular opinion but Legend of Zelda is absolute weibo boring game that doesn’t deserve how “popular” it is. Additionally I do not believe Nintendo are selling that many games.. more than pc games. Same counts for Nintendo and all the Mario games…
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"So, out of the 200, I've only played 22 properly, tried a couple more for a few minutes, and 13 I've never even heard of (and that's not counting a multitude of games within franchises I know of but wouldn't have been able to identify the specific game). 

Some might say I have a lot of catching up to do, but I'm honestly fine with it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Wow. Amazing work. 
Curious as to how you chose the games that deserve a shout out but didn’t make the list?
Are these just your personal favorites?
Did you use some other metric?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I'm honestly surprised Elden Ring is only 65th considering how much praise and adoration it garnered.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Glad to see final fantasy 7 followed by 6! That feels correct. Maybe tactics higher than X, but that’s just me……."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Best Games of Recent Years.

Jeez."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Love your mention of Legend of Heroes.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,So I've only played 36 of the top 100. Looks like I've got some work to do lol
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The entire 1970s is excluded, not just Zork (1977)."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,What a list. I’ve played or watched about 33 of these games. But I’m aware of many on there that are on my games to play list but just haven’t got around to. Saving this for future reference. Nice work!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This is an amazing post. Shocked that Terraria didn’t make the list yet games like Mrs Pac Man and animal crossing new horizons did!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Genuinely happy to see metroid Prime so high up
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,My beloved Melee making it to number 55 🫡😍
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,You’re a saint for putting this list together! I enjoyed reading every bit of it!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,im joyed to see symphony of the night in the top 30 :))
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Great work, OP! Original content like this is much appreciated."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Quality post. A lot of effort put into this. Well done.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"This is insane, whish awards was still a thing"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"This is actually a pretty solid, accurate list!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Seeing shadow of the colossus up so high makes me happy it's one of my favourite games
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Is it easy to break this down by console?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"My list would have to be broken down into consoles.

I’ve enjoyed other consoles but not found games that break into this list. It’s very subjective and also very personal to every individual. So don’t moan. Post your own!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"This is extremely cool. Love it. Good work here, OP."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Cool post! As these lists are up to five years old, does it not skew towards older games as newer games will not have been released at the time a significant portion of the lists were made? If you used only lists made in 2023 for example, I wonder if something like Elden Ring would move up in the rankings"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,There’s no way Fortnite is better than oblivion
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Great work OP!!!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I'm sorry, I think there's a typo in there. You've included Fable II as #132. I think that should be Fable: The Lost Chapters.

I can understand the confusion, but it wasn't a sequel. It was a re-release including additional content. Fable II was pretty good, but the entire Fable franchise progressively got worse after TLC was released. TLC was ***peak*** Fable."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,lol bioshock infinite
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,No tecmo bowl?!?! Blasphemy!!!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26, This good list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I’ll fight you in Terraria haha. 

Awesome list"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"With how much people love Fallout NV. I am surprised to see Fallout 3 beating it by a large margin.  Finally my love of FO3 over NV feels vindicated..

I will say I hold both of them in very high esteem over any of the sequels.."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"No Into the Breach, but yes to FTL. Surprising, I think Into the Breach is the better of the two"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Uncharted 4 is 81? GTFO. Easily the best game of the last 10 years.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This is amazing. That ‘highest ranking game of each year’ list really took me back. Damn dude.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Man it’d be so cool to just work your way up this list.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Glad FINAL FANTASY VIII made the list‼️ 💕
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It’s absolutely insane to look back and realize that KOTOR and Half Life 2 were only a year apart.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Fantastic post, imo it’s surprising both Horizon: Zero Dawn and Horizon: Forbidden West weren’t amongst the top 200. I’d expect Baldurs Gate 3 to potentially make an appearance if this list were to be made again in a few years."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I always get lost trying to decide which top game to play so this will be a lot of help, thanks."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Most if these lists are usually pretty bad but I actually expected a mix to be better. I was wrong.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,FFIV should be on here
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Thank you for taking the time do this 🤝
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Splendide! Amazing. My gamer heart is almost overwhelmed!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"wow, great job completing and compiling this list."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I commend and appreciate the work you put into this. But I’m a redditor so naturally I disagree with it
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Awesome work.  Greatly appreciated.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Can you add the best game of the franchise to the franchise list?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Interesting that mgs1 is rated higher then mgs3
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,What's the Aussie game Dev game?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,didnt expect to see shadow of the colossus so high
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"This is a phenomenal list and a lot of the placements make perfect sense... however, I'm just absolutely shook that Ghost of Tsushima is as low as 140 😲"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Great post OP. While i couldnt disagree more with the list this is a solid data dump and interesting read.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I approve of this list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I'm surprised to see Red Dead 2 so low. I haven't seen an open world game with that much unnecessary detail before..
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Is grand theft auto IV not on this list or did I miss it?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,For the most part this list makes sense.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I immediately disagree with the list, but this is a pretty cool research project you did."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Makes me happy to see Resident Evil 4 all the way at #6
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This list in 5 years will have BG3 in the top 5 for sure.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Extensive and interesting, great post!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Why is Dishonored 2 ranked higher than Dishonored?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Bloodborne 20-ish places above Elden Ring is kind of surprising, but them both being in top 100 doesn’t surprise me in the least!

Popping off with Hollow Knight and Outer Wilds representation, but I’m really pretty surprised that Terraria didn’t show up (if I’m not blind)"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Great post!


But Journey is higher than Halo 3? Fuckkkkkk outta here."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Damn, not even a hint or mention of Destiny. Kinda sad seeing as how its live service has been going for almost a decade."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"For number 147 i think you mean ""Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Chaos Theory"" you forgot the word ""Chaos."""
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,List is not very useful for finding games to play is it?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Super Mario RPG is way too low on this list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Alright I’ll say it, Disco Asylum is overrated. Do with me what you will."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I'm curious why you decided to lump Europe as ""one country"" for the graph? Seems kinda arbitrary given you've included China, for example, with only 1 entry rather than ""Asia""."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I haven’t read nearly a 10th of the post and have just jumped to your listings but I’ve given you an upvote for the commendable effort and time you’ve invested in this post. 

Well done"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,wished you added year released too
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Very few sport games on the list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I love that on lists like these WoW and Dota2 are hardly ever mentioned while still being actively played for over a decade and more. Shows you lists are bullshit and just clickbait.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I’m super stoked Psychonauts made it in the list! It was such an underrated gem for so long. I’m kind of surprised the Jak and Daxter games didn’t make the cut though.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Anyone recommend more retro style games?

My top picks over the past few years have been Hollow Knight, Owl Boy, Hyper Light Drifter, and The Messenger. 

Would love to find more like those!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I have at least tried every single game on this list.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,League Of Legends higher in the ranking list than Dota2. That made me depressed.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"No Terraria on the list, time to leave."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I think I've played 152 of these 200 games.  And of the remaining 48 I've played at least a little bit of 15 more, but can't really consider myself having actually ""played"" them.  Definitely missing a few I should be ashamed of though.  Thanks for the list and OC!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It's been maybe 20 years by this point since I last played ocarina of time. I purposely tried to forget it, so I can play it again and enjoy it almost like a brand new playthrough. But just from what I remember it was a great game for its time, but do I really think it had the power to stay on top compared to other games? I'm not sure. The last of us, I could say, may be a better game. Breath of the wild, was a fantastic game, and may have been somewhat more true to the original zelda game than ocarina of time in terms of you're thrown into a world and can achieve your objective almost anyway. 

I feel Ocarina truly does live off of the fact it was one of the first games to come out as a major franchise to 3d. Because as a zelda game, I do think link to the past was one if the best zelda games. Even better than ocarina. Not trying to shit on the game, it eas great, im just saying I think, it probably would have lost the top spot by now."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Wow! Thank you for making this, a lot of effort I am sure.

Most of the list is pretty mainstream in its appeal and messaging, which makes sense for a general best of anything list."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Good list.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Amazing list. I am surprised Elite did not make it, but Amiga fans never forget. 
More concerning for me, is that by the end of the decade Quake 3 could potentially be knocked off the list."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,[deleted]
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Thats pretty cool
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I never understand why Pokémon red/blue are always so high on these lists like go play heart gold / soul silver, platinum, or black/white 2 and tell me that red/blue are better than any of them."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,List basically boils down to new game good old game bad.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Great to see Eternal Darkness getting a nod. Brilliant original game that
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,What a cracking list of games. Just reading them brings back happy memories of playing them. There's some on the list I have to try too.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Ive been looking for Suikoden II for ages... Good times
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Awesome work OP this was a fun read.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Awesome list! Thanks for putting your tome and effort into this!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Little Big Planet enjoyer.  Had to make the list long enough to fit that in.  But in all seriousness fair play for the hard work on this.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I don't know if it'll fit the criteria, but I think you should post this on r/dataisbeautiful because this is truly interesting and beautiful!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I've only played 21 of these games. Looks like I've got some catching up to do lol.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The fact Pokemon D/P is on there instead of the vastly superior and more widely recognized Platinum is shocking to me. Also that Red, Blue, Gold and Silver are still so widely beloved despite being such buggy, unbalanced experiences speaks to the power of nostalgia like nothing else"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Katamari should be #1
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"this is a very cool project. A scientific approach to games in the vein of Tim Rogers of /r/ActionButton.
     
I would have wondered if preferencing recent publications has a bias towards both the older *and* newer games with sort of a nomansland era in between, but you address it in your data!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Honestly?

Seems about as good as a list like this can be. I dont personally agree with it but I know my bias is all over the place and I can see reason for this list far more than any other Ive seen recently. I am ESPECIALLY pleased with how high Shadow of the Colossus is, considering I hold it in extremely high regard."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Doom @ 119 :/
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I cannot believe that Sekiro is not on this list, glad to see it in the honorable mentions"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,FNV at 92 is a disgrace to my entire personality.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Really great list.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Star Wars Battlefront 2 erasure

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Hey thanks for posting this, it's always great being able to appreciate someones passion project, I wouldn't be surprised if you spent more than a few nights chewing through this."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"OMG this is fantastic!   You are sending a number of us down a very entertaining rabbit hole.  Also, at first glance, this seems like a very 'correct' list.  Super cool idea and execution on your part"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Really interesting to see! I think Portal is pretty much as close to perfect of a video game as you can get so it's weird seeing it so far down. Same deal with Hades, but that's less of a surprise due to its genre not being for everyone."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,MGs beating mgs3 couldn’t make less sense
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Is TMNT 1989 the NES game that came out in 1989 or the arcade game that came out in 1989 that was later ported to the NES?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Kotor way to low and last of us way to high.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,No Fallout 4 anywhere to be seen?

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It sucks that even with all that effort and work. The fact that Resident Evil 4 is on the list higher than SM64 and Metal Gear Solid is just factually wrong. RE4 is nowhere near on the same tier but on your list it actually sits above them?

No point reading the rest of the list when the top 10 is wrong lol"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Baldurs Gate 3 will join the top 5. Breath of the wild really is not as good as the other games that high in the ranks.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,GTAV and TLoU are good games but have no right to those places
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Blood absolutely deserves to be in top of all time lists. I didn't play it when it came out but went on a binge playing old games and it was one of the clear standouts alongside Morrowind. I've played through it three times and the fan-made Death Wish campaign and it's just so damn fun.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Umm. This list is trash.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"This is the kind of high quality post that would usually belong in r/games. Good work, OP!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,what kind of asshole put league of legends in top 100
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Outer wilds being in top 100 makes me so happy, it's not as well known as most of the games on this list so it just shows how good it is

Also terraria deserves that #1 spot"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Final Fantasy VII is much too low
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"> 2008: Fallout 3

woooooooooooow"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"thank you for the list, i think i own almost all of them, most never played/beaten"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Very surprising. Not what I would have guessed at all. No Forza, no Gran Turismo, No crash bandicoot."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I’ve beaten 35 of the games on this list.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Belongs to r/dataisbeautiful too!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Its a bit crazy how many legend of Zelda titles are on this list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It's a fucking crime that banjo kazooie wasn't on the main list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I think these lists are pretty pointless usually

So much about them is based on nostalgia and the time in which the games were released

Mario64 and mario bros 3 arent even close to being the best 3d/2d mario games yet they are at the top"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I need to post for future reference. Excellent work OP
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Feel like Everquest needs a honorable mention. Changed everything. Without it, presumably, No WoW, No Tribes, No Guild Wars, No EvE, etc. Shoehorn DAoC in there too while we're at it.

UT2k4 is king. Happy to see the edit."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Glad to see Chrono Trigger on top 20, definitely a game that marked a before and after in history."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Mario covering more than 10% of the top 50 is absolutely wild for a single franchise.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I love seeing Tetris in the top 5
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Nice post homie
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Never played journey but almost every other game on that indie list is a banger. Couple I'd replace on there but can't complain too much.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,would love to see this but with critic reviews only. gamer/user reviews are a joke in 2023
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Dark Souls under Bloodborne how ?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Far cry 3???

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Good post.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Nice post! Bloodbourne beating out dark souls and elden ring is certainty a surprise result for me.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Very cool post.  

I'm honestly surprised not to see Total War in there at all, not even the heavy hitters like Rome 1, Medieval II, Shogun 2, Warhammer. In fact strategy seems to be rather under-represented generally, probably due to being largely PC only.

Some other omissions which surprise me - no Hitman, no Elite, no Homeworld, no Wolfenstein.  

Morrowind not being on there when Oblivion is is objectively mad, but makes sense given how Oblivion benefited from solid console presence.  

Tomb Raider is shockingly low on the list given how massive it was. I'm surprised that Bioshock is higher than Halo.  

One other observation - an awful lot of massive franchises are woefully represented - almost all sports and racing games, but also major series like Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Battlefield. Goes to show that people don't necessarily rate games they play the most of as being their highest quality gaming experiences."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Where’s Bully?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It warms my heart that FF8 made the list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Man, if Starfox 64ms on there Panzer Dragoon Zwei and Saga deserve to be on there."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,For me the biggest surprise is resident evil4. The game is amazing but 6th best of all time with so many games that created or defined genres bellow it? Could it be due to the context of the year it released? Or I'm just not seeing how good that game is?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"there's a bias in your data against games released after some of the polls were released, so only games 5+ years old have the highest ranking potential. There's also recency bias though which maybe cancels it out probably not though."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Japan: good cars and good videogames.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I've played 85 on the list. Not too bad.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I feel justified knowing that out of my top 10, all of

Halo 3, Breath of the Wild, Left 4 Dead 2, Dead Space, Star Fox 64, Pokémon Red/Blue, Fire Emblem Three Houses, Portal 2 and Super Mario 64 are on this list. 

Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze deserves justice, but that’s a fight for another day."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Okami fuck yeah
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Unless I missed it, command and conquer missed the list which is shocking. Wasn't expecting top 10 but not even in 200?! Also counter strike missing is crazy."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Overall a decent list. But a game like Starfox 64 being there instead of Warcraft 3 is a bit funny.

WC3 is one of the best games of all time. Amazing campaign, amazing online competetive multiplayer, amazing as an esport, amazing custom games with tower defenses, footman frenzy and of course dota. Basically contained one of the best games in the world, that spawned a genre in itself."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"LA Noire was a very good game, but systems still aren't ready for facial animation changes to be a key part in a game."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Skyrim is stinking up the top 200 games that’s for sure…

Holy shit… 18th!?!? why is it so high… it was mediocre at launch and aged like milk in the trunk of your car on during a hot fortnight.

Nothing makes me feel like a crazy person than seeing Skyrim get praise almost universally.

Thanks for the interesting post though."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I find nostalgia makes these lists useless.

Like objectively I can't really support the idea that Tetris is a ""best game of all time"", like sure I get how important and influential the game was for the industry at the time, but I don't think that makes it among the ""best"".

Something can be influential and groundbreaking, but still be replaced by objectively better games they inspired."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Glad to see your shout outs to Zork and Terraria.

Most of this seems to fit my perception of what people have enjoyed, though I'm a little surprised Hollow Knight isn't in the top 20 or so, and shocked it's as low as 101.

Seeing Shadow of the Colossus up there. Damn I wish the PS4 remaster (And the Ico remaster from the PS3, and The Last Guardian) were available on PC."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"i think what this shows is that to get a GOTY or similar has more to do with being easy for reviewers to play, aka narratively driven or relatively easy games as a whole.

the list also heavily favour RPGs and FPS games, we only have a handful of strategy games, a lot of which are civilization."

That's a travesty!

anyway, amazing work and great list, worthy of /r/dataisbeautiful."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I think it mostly works, with a few notable exceptions. StarCraft should probably be much higher, it’s a better game overall than say any GTA entry by far. Halo 2 should be way above Dishonored 2 (best MP Halo hands down). Fallout 3 is above Portal and KOTOR. BG2, perhaps the best CRPG of all time, should be smack dab next to Chrono Trigger. D:OS 2, Oblivion way above that is silly. Even DA: O righty above it is.

Deus Ex maybe should be top 20 because it transcends just about every other game story by teaching you about how the real world works (creeping centralization of power and authoritarianism).

Also no Tribes 2 😛"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,list is wrong no SSX tricky
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Gone Home higher than Spiderman and Sands of Time?  Game journalists really had a hard on for that boring piece of shit walking simulator.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I could honestly swap Breath of the Wild and Outer Wilds.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Glad to see outer wilds on the list but I’d have it ranked higher than 99. Numbers are numbers though!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Y'all need to stop trying to treat the list as a presentation of objective truth. The games are ranked as they are because the aggregated opinions of the reviewers and players work out that way. Arguing about what is ""correct"" is pointless because everyone's enjoyment of a game is massively impacted by their own experiences and when in their life they play it. Like 70% of the people you ask will tell you their favorite game was something they played as a kid. That's not because game develepment was objectively better then, they were just at a point in their life when it made a bigger impact."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Terraria should be in top 10

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Gotta love seeing FFX in the list.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This is an awesome post!!!!!!!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Nice list. But all this does is remind me of how lacking the modern gaming scene has been over recent years.

Back in 2006, I said to that this would be the last generation that I would buy all of the consoles on release. It really does seem prophetic looking back."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"So journalists prefered Journey to outer wilds or hades or other indie game ???? It's a nice experiment, but calling it the best indie game seems like a real overevaluation of it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Very nice
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I'm concerned, what happened in 1983 for there to not be a high ranking game that year?"

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Don't worry. I'll repost it tomorrow. I found my source information somewhere online but can't remember where.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,IKR?  This is awesome work by OP.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I’m so confused. Aren’t I supposed to be telling OP what his top 25 games says about him? What is this!?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Do they want us to discuss what the list says about them or something else? It's been so long I've forgotten what to do.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I really hate how badly arcade games get ignored on these lists. So many of the best and most influential games from the first half of gaming history were arcade titles. Oh well!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,it just brought a smile to my face to see it. many great memories.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It should be top 20 tbh, incredibly unique and groundbreaking game. Truly nothing else like it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Really hoping restitched does a good job of bringing that style of game to the modern era
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Yep, too bad the studio doesnt want anymore LBP anymore"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Other than Street Fighter II and COD Modern Warfare, every game above WoW on this list appears to be focused on the single player experience. They may feature multiplayer, but they have very strong single player. Maybe that's why WoW is only 31? I agree it's genre defining and has a huge player base."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"There are a lot of games that could be considered the GOAT of their genre that are way down on the list. From Blizzard alone Diablo 2 & Starcraft are both down around the 50 mark despite beng arguably the most culturally influential releases for both genres.

RTS in general is hugely snubbed with AoE2 down at like 120 and Warcraft 3 not even on the list, which is insane considering the impact it had on the whole gaming landscape (I get that custom games are hard to include on these kinds of lists, but how does Starcraft 2 make a list like this but not WC3?).

These genres just haven't been that relevant for the last 10 or more years so even the influential titles are thought of much later, especially since this is only looking at lists from the last 5 years."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"San Andreas is probably the best GTA for its time. It deserves to be up higher. I feel that GTAV is very good, but benefits from recency bias."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,">Also, World of Warcraft. Defined a genre for almost 20 years. But always seems to get shafted on lists like this.

It's the typical ""live long enough to become the villain"" type of thing, I think.

They had an extremely good track record - but they also had enough time to make a huge load of mistakes. And that obviously shifts the perspective on the game."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Thata because WoW isn't a game, it's a lifestyle"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"GTA 5 being so high in general seems really weird to me.  GTA 3 and GTA San Andreas both seem to be more cultural standouts, not sure what makes GTA 5 so worthy that its listed this high on so many rankings?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"My first thought too, obviously I'm biased but the fact that every game in the same genre for the last 2 decades has had the goal to be the ""wow killer"" and failed really says something."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"For other series differentials, I was shocked to see such a big difference between FO3 and FO:NV. I think if you flipped their relative spots no one would really bat an eye. FO3 was better received on release but NV has aged a lot better in the eyes of fans"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,In what fucking universe is earning 31 out of *200* spots getting shafted? What a daft take.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"You’re misinterpreting the data. Lists like these just take an average of how people feel about a game, and it’s usually a recent feeling shortly after these games come out. 

Stuff like WoW defining a genre for 20 years(true) wouldn’t be included in these numbers, and the numbers reflect the fact that a lot of people simply don’t enjoy that genre of games *at all*. 

If you polled 1 million gamers today asked them to select games from a list that were extremely influential, and WoW was on that list, I’m sure it would rank very high.

Basically what I’m saying is that you’re right, but the list is also right. It’s like, by definition right since it’s simply averaging out ratings. It can’t however tell you the things you’re talking about(influence)."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Man big ups on that warcraft comment fr so true and it’s still the standard pretty much
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"CSGO isn't even on the list and Starcraft II isn't in the top 100.

It's interesting to me that some of the most iconic games ever made are just completely absent, but the bias is pretty clear: competitive RTS/FPS are not what these reviewers focus on."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The fact that WoW isn't a top 5 game on *every* list is laughable. It was a cultural phenomenon. It's *still* a good game 19 years later. It *still* dominates an entire genre.

It is, in my opinion, the single greatest game ever made. It's timeless."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"The fundamental issue with lists like this (and by no means is this the fault of OP since they just aggregated other lists) is that they seem to mix up the concepts of ""best game"", and ""most influential game"" and throw them into one list. 

 If this is a list of best games, Tetris doesn't deserve to be anywhere near the top like it currently is. Tetris can be an enjoyable way to pass time, but it's hard to argue that it's better than most of the 195 other games on the list... If this was an influential game list, then it absolutely deserves to be there. 

But if this is an influential game list GTA5 as you said doesn't belong this high up when it is effectively just a derivative of all the other 3d GTA games, with the addition of some cover shooter and weapon wheel mechanics from other games that did it first. Perhaps you could argue that the multiplayer influenced a decade of horrible microtransactions and live service games... But I think usually these lists look for a positive influence..."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,The fact that GTAV is even in the top 20 is all I need to know about the quality of this ranking system.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"GTA games have always been a big deal. GTA3 changed video games, and pre-GTAV, San Andreas was nearly universally considered the best game in the franchise. Had to be there, I guess."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Interesting, what’s your personal top 10?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"12/100 and couple of those only few hours. Made me realise how I have not played that many games, I just play same games long time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,125 here. Didn't include ones I only played a few minutes. Maybe 130 if I did. Played everything in top 20 except last of us (played a few minutes only).
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Recent bias in action.  Certainly a product of reviews still being in traditional media and magazines at the time.  No one is going back on Metacritic to review games they played 20+ years ago.

Warcraft 3 spawned an entire genre of MOBAs in its wake and underpinned the most successful MMO of all time.  All while being super popular and revolutionary in its own right.  Features we take for granted today like automatic match making, ranked play, modding communities, etc. took giant leaps forward in that title. 

It is easily one of the top 10 if not top 5 most influential titles of all time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I played multiple hundreds of games in my life, Warcraft 3 is still #1.

It's just objectively such a fucking good game, from the campaign, to the sound design, music, atmosphere, story, competitive potential, responsiveness, character design, innovativity relative to its time, the custom games, replayability, the legacy it left, how well it holds up today.

I'm sorry, but if a top 200 list doesn't include it, I can't take that list seriously. In no fucking universe 200 games are better than War3."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"League of legends and dota are on the list, both were spawned off Warcraft 3. The spirit of W3 lives on."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Any guesses as to why there was no top rated game of 1983?

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I will never understand the hype around this game. The universe was great. Unique and inovative. The gameplay not so much.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Terraria, Titanfall 2 and Sekiro didn’t make it either. You"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Outer Wilds shares some of that DNA and is on here. Both excellent games
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I've never seen Guild Wars on any of these lists, which I feel should at the very least be an honorable mention. One of the better MMO experiences that didnt even require a subscription, yet still had a ton of content."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Can't think of another singleplayer game in recent memory that I enjoyed as much as Subnautica, though I do feel that going in blind is a huge prerequisite for fully enjoying the game. If all the of the wildlife and progression has been spoiled already, it'd be nowhere near as fun."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"it's honestly such a perfect game in what it tries to accomplish, one of the few games i'd rate a 10"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I remember those dungeons taking me forever when I was a kid. My roommate's girlfriend played it for the first time in college and was just blowing through it with a strategy guide.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I played it (the 3DS version) for the first time last year and it’s one of my favourite games of all time.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,The aliens continue to make progress on The Avatar Project. If we're going to slow them down we'll need to move fast.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"That, and I'm also happy they picked the right Civilization. Civilization IV has Heart"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Sort of, actually

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Blame a short little alien with a long neck... That little fucker almost caused gaming to not exist.

(Before any backlash, I'm aware that wasn't the only contributor)."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Place of power, gotta be"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"So deserved, and I think they didn't even factor in the 2 expansions that many consider even better than the main game."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It’s probably because Fallout 3 mostly worked at launch so it’s easier to review higher. Fallout New Vegas was a disaster at launch.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Everyone says NV is better, and I don't doubt that, but I could never get into it as much as 3. I tried twice, about 10 years apart, and didn't get far. Fallout 3 on the other hand, I played that so much that it largely contributed to two red ringed Xboxes. I also played it within the last few years, and got all the way through all DLCs and got most achievements again."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"New Vegas grew in popularity over time. Pretty much everyone I knew didn’t like it much when it came out, including me. But, a couple of years later I picked it up and tried again and fell in love and is now one of my favorites ever. I think Fallout 3 is very Bethesda, immediately addicting and awesome and super fun world to just be in. New Vegas is one that takes time to get into but I think is so much more rewarding once you do."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I agree with the placement but also agree that you would not have thought it would be that way round considering comments on many forums.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Fallout 3 was honestly a much more memorable experience for me. I remember most of the possible companions in FO3 and several notable NPC's, the most memorable thing I remember about FONV was the start, the ranger base I spoke to three NPC's using the same voice actor within two minutes of each other and then the ending I got.

People love New Vegas because it was obsidian returning to the franchise to fix Bethesda's ""shortcomings"". It fell flat for me."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Perfect Dark was better than Goldeneye in all areas, yet Goldeneye is top 4p and Perfect Dark isnt listed. Perfect Dark added the ability to play against bots which I thought was huge at the time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I, like most, agree NV is far superior but it’s not too difficult to see why many rank 3 higher. The bugs and lack of polish in NV made it so much harder to enjoy. Yeah 3 was still a Bethesda game with all its warts but at least it functions. Even to this day, I reinstall NV sometimes with a bunch of stability mods and it still crashes every 2 seconds."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"At the time, Fallout 3 was insane. Fallout NV came late in the console lifespan, was seen as ‘DLC’ by some, was a buggy mess at launch, and to the laymen wasn’t ‘wow’ enough after Fallout 3. It also didn’t have the same marketing and hype around it. All that said; NV is a way better game than 3 without a doubt in my mind"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"3 sold way, way more and was a flagship title for a new generation of consoles. NV is basically a great expansion for 3. It’s better for sure but was built so heavily on fo3 that it pales in comparison"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"New Vegas may be be the better game, but its still fundamentally a derivative sequel to Fallout 3, which meant that it was never in a position to be as disruptive to the industry as FO3.  Its harder to appreciate now that open world action-RPGs are so ubiquitous that the success of a traditional CRPG like Baldur's Gate III is considered newsworthy, but there was a time when the shift from traditional RPG combat (as poorly defined as that is) to action combat was deeply controversial.  Some of it comes down to timing, but between the weird-ass VATS system tricking RPG players into playing an FPS and the physics-based gore vanity cam tricking dudebros into playing an RPG, Fallout 3 is arguably the game most responsible for the industry shifting towards ARPGs and away from traditional RPGs."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Not me, I thought 3 was way better but I agree it seems to be an unpopular opinion these days. My reason is that 3 has a more emotional and cohesive story where as New Vegas has a really strong opening and then it seems like the main story quickly unravels into a bunch of side quests."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The joke was you could watch a Saturday morning cartoon in the time it took to go through most doors in New Vegas.

The joke didn't exaggerate much.

Perceptions of the game improve exponentially as the perspective person tried it later in time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,New Vegas had poorer ratings on release because of how buggy it was and the poor performance. Once the patches fixed it however it was vastly superior to fallout 3 in every way.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Played FO3 to death and loved it. NV just... wasn't it, it felt like a half baked expansion pack with an entirely different setting tone and texture, it wasn't bad at all but it wasn't what I liked or wanted so it hardly even got 10 hours of play from me compared to 100+ for FO3.

I just assume it's a different strokes thing but I can't help but roll my eyes whenever I see revisionist history posting about NV bring the best FO."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,RS never gets its due respect as far as I'm concerned. It was massive and was one of the most defining games of the 00s.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"That game thought me how to type fast, and mix in British spelling now and then so I have to self correct."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Warband might just be janky enough that it's fine not to be in a top 200, although it's a blast. Heroes 3 and Factorio missing is criminal though.

Or Paradox games like EU4, CK2/3..."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,HoM&M3 not making the list is criminal
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Haven't played Heroes of Might and Magic, but those first 4 absolutely deserve a spot on the list. 

Rimworld especially is such an awesome game"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"As a Gothic fan I'm not even surprised, I know the series is not popular / remembered enough to make it into such lists with way more popular games. Best games are subjective and sometimes not the most well known."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"HOMM still plays beautifully today which is more than I can say from almost any other game in that time period. The spritework and pixel art gives it a truly timeless look that is more colorful and vivid than most games on the market today.

Anyone who's interested in diving back in: it's still every bit as good as it was in the 90s. It's actually better, as there are some dedicated modders out there who have made HD patches, rebalanced the original, and created entire add-on campaigns and new castles. Look up HOMM HOTA if you haven't yet!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,New World Computing and 3DO being robbed here.  Might and Magic / Heroes was a staple of PC gaming in the 90's.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I put some hours into that game as well.  I realized after looking at this list that my game time must have dropped considerably after the late 90s.  I played every top game of the year on this list from 1980 to 1997.  From 1998 to 2022 I've only played 7 of them.  Clearly adulthood has ruined my gamer status.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Was also looking for Heroes 3. To me it is still one of the best turn based strategy games 24 years later. I think it is also the best selling game of all time on gog.com
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I was personally shocked command and conquer wasn't on the list at all....

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"They seriously omit the biggest developers back in the day.

Lucasarts, Sierra, Bullfrog, Westwood Studios, Interplay, Origin, and more.  

I'm pretty sure at least half of those names gave us multiple quality genre-defining releases."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Like Guitar Hero was a phenomenon.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I was thinking exactly the same.

I said it elsewhere, but there was a several-years-long period where the original Medal of Honor was the #1 rated PC game across the board, even displacing Half Life and Deus Ex. I didn't like it myself, never understood the hype.

Freespace (Conflict: Freespace as I knew it, literally learned the Descent part just now because I thought you'd got something wrong or I was remembering wrong) was absolutely amazing, as was the sequel. They do not make games like that any more."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,">Games I would've expected based on their rep at the time would've included Earl Weaver Baseball from circa 1986-87; Wolfenstein 3-D from 1993; The Secret of Monkey Island from 1991 (ish); Falcon 3.0 from 1990 or thereabouts; Wing Commander from 1993, FIFA International Soccer from 1994; Descent: Freepspace from 1998-ish.

M.U.L.E. The Ultima and Wizardry series. The Roberta Williams/Sierra adventures (Kings Quest, Space Quest, et. al), lots of formative titles missing here. 

That's kind of to be expected though. No list like this can be expected to capture historical context across a 40+ year span."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,One gaming magazine I read back in the day gave its highest score ever to total annihilation yet no mention of any rts on this list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"secret of monkey island and wolfenstein 3d not being in the top 200 is seriously fucked.

like, they're clear top 100 games too. PC got screwed."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Right? HoMM3 wasn't played by the critics when it was new it seems. That's the only explanation for why it's not on this list. It was such a great game for its time that I still play here and there over two decades later.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Half Life Alyx is VR and made the list. Newer games are naturally disadvantaged and there’s not really a good way to fix this without giving them some type of consolation points for lists they weren’t yet released for—but I also can’t just assume they would’ve been on those lists.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"PC gaming is less accessible. The reach of Nintendo consoles is insane. People who haven't played a game won't vote for it no matter how good it is.

PC-exclusives also include the more complex games that were too hard to develop for console as well as indie games that benefitted from PC being a more open platform. Having a smaller audience is inherent to both."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It's probably outshined by ce and 3 because people don't tend to choose multiple games from the same franchise when selecting the best games of all time
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Halo 2 did a lot of things great but had plenty of missteps that I think sour people on it. And I say this as someone who thinks its much better than its reputation (its my second favorite in the series).

Things Halo 2 disappointed at upon release:

1. A lot of people were very upset at what they thought were ""false promises"" about fighting on Earth. Previews promised a whole campaign when it turned out to just be two missions.

2. The fact that you don't play as Master Chief the whole game upset fans who were not expecting the Arbiter gameplay

3. Story that became a little to complex for its own good only made worse by a frustrating cliffhanger that left a lot of people confused.

4. Difficulty that was perceived as punishing at best and unfair at worst (does anyone like sniper alley?) combined with some really atrocious level design even considering this is a series that has struggled with level design in most of the titles.

5. New features that weren't very revolutionary and sometimes just bad, dual wielding, damagable vehicles, no health, etc...

Halo 2 should get praise for what it did, and xbox live was clearly a killer app. But at the time it was widely seen as a disapointment based on Halo CE's promise.

I think the bigger Halo related issue with this list isn't halo 2's position but the complete lack of Halo: Reach which is in my opinion the best game in the series."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Jackal Snipers alone knocked halo 2 down 50 spots on the list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"UT2k4 definetly one of the best arcade multiplayer shooters ever made! Strange we haven't even gotten a remaster yet. Since ow2 got ruined I have a big hole for arcade shooters, would play the hell out of it"

I wonder how many people"

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This made me look for UT99. How tf is that not on here either? Like how is there no UT game at all??
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Ocarina of Time absolutely deserves all the praise it gets though.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This list took into account user reviews
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,As do players.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,feel like I'm the only guy on earth to have never touched a Zelda game
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I mean, for good reason. Even the ""bad"" Zelda's (Skyward Sword, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks) are generally considered well above average, and not just by critics but by users as well.

I was plenty critical of Skyward Sword, with  it's repeating areas and iffy motion controls, but even then it's a solid 8.5 out of 10 for me. The dungeon and puzzle design is still better than any other single player adventure game I can think of from that generation (besides maybe Okami). If a title like that is a low point for a 30+ year old franchise, then that franchise deserves a MASSIVE amount of praise."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It's almost like they're pretty good games
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Zelda games are world renowned with critics and fans alike and have been for a very long time.

There's a reason for that. They are phenomenal games."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"They're usually genre and generation defining games that sell millions across different continents.

Even the lowest rated Zelda games are usually in the top 3rd of a console's top games."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I honestly don't get it. I never played a Zelda game and felt like I was missing out. I then finally played BotW a year ago. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't overly impressed either. The world is fairly atmospheric, but also relatively empty and at times even lifeless. The shrines are kind of fun, but get repetitive quite fast. They are mostly rather similar. The weapon degradation mechanic is incredibly overbearing. The story isn't bad, but felt rather minimal. The combat and playing around with the physics was fun though.

Still, to have BotW as top 2 best games of all-time just isn't even close to my taste. I seriously don't get it. Decent game, nothing revolutionary or extraordinary in my opinion. Same for a lot of the rest of the list to be honest, none of the games I have in my top 10 got near the top 10."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Ocarina of time is still the most perfect game I’ve ever played. At the time it came out it was miiiiiiles better than anything I’ve ever seen with the exception of maaaaybe Mario 64 which would still be a distant second.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,People are gonna rip on it but tbh imo it still holds up. At least much better than most games from that console generation. Its easy to hate on now for the same reason friends is. OoT is a game that was huge and influenced almost every game that came after it so if you’re a newer gamer its easy to compare it to things that worked off the same formula
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Be ready for 25y-old graphics, and moderately cheese writing. Beyond that, allow yourself to get swallowed up by the adventure. It's my own personal nr 1, shoulder-to-shoulder with BG2."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It’s my favorite game of all time. 

I’m sure a lot of my love is because I got it when I was 13 and it blew my mind. I remember that Christmas break I stayed inside almost the entire time playing that game. 

The time jump was something I was not expecting and the world just felt so huge to me."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"There is a PC port, better in almost everything"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It honestly hasn't aged very well in my opinion.  It's still a good game, but the problems with the game that are there really stand out today. Nintendo recognized a lot of those things quickly, and removed most of them by the time Majora's Mask came around.

OoT has a problem where there's a lot of down time that doesn't add anything to the game.  Waiting on certain enemies to let you attack them feels bad when you have limited time to play.  The long travel time between places before you get all the teleport songs. Hyrule field is just very big and empty.  Push blocks being very slow, and sometimes very long to get into place.

It also houses some of the worst dungeons in the entire franchise, in Forest Temple and Jabu Jabu's belly.  Granted, there are still a lot of positives about it.  But there's a lot of things that haven't aged well that people don't talk about when it comes to OoT."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,You think Factorio is a game? Don't be so silly.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Factorio was such an *incredible* game for the 20-30 hours I got out of it. 

But after a torturous 2 days not being able to shut my eyes without seeing conveyors I never touched it again. One of the worst night's sleep ever."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Had to scroll too far to find Factorio referenced.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"No time to write reviews, the factory must grow"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Super metroid is wayyyyyy to low. That is an almost perfect game. Just completed it last year, never gotten to play it during the snes age, so did it in switch online and loved every single minute of it. Dread gets close but is too linear."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I'm not the biggest fan of RPGs, and if I like them, it's usually the other stuff they bring to the table, like Divinity OS 2, which is my favorite game.

I finally got around to Chrono Trigger in 2020. That game is insane. It took a couple hours to get used to the older mechanics, but once I did, the game is a solid 10/10. The music, the story, the characters, the sidequests, the alternate endings. The gameplay was great too. I sat through 2 1/2 playthroughs before I touched another game, and I plan on going back eventually."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I am unhappy that Symphony of the Night is as low as it is but I honestly could only make a legitimate case for a very small number of games above it that it is better than.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Braid blew my mind. And then to add a great twist on top of that was just so darkly perfect.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,What’s Braid about?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Do it! It’s good
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It is
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"YES YES YES !!!!! 

Seriously these games are fun as hell and the Switch has a pretty good selection of games. 

You have the modern open world Zeldas in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, you have the HD version of Skyward Sword (traditional 3D Zelda) and you have the remake of Link’s Awakening (2D Zelda). You can also play Ocarina of Time, Majora’s Mask, the Oracle games and Minish Cap through the premium Nintendo Online subscription and A Link to the Past, the original Zelda and Zelda 2 with the base subscription. 

Pretty much the only noteworthy games you can’t play on the Switch are Twilight Princess and Wind Waker."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Just gonna add my 2 cents that I personally find my self motivated by narratives in video games and I’ve tried to play every Zelda and never made it more than 6 hours in (besides Ocarina as a kid).

They aren’t for everyone imo."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It wasn't out yet for 25% of the media rankings sample OP used, so it can be partially explained by that. For Elden Ring it's even more than that."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Sekiro is a must play game imo because it shows you how much you can improve. You don't need to finish it In a set time , just don't give up on it and keep trying. You will eventually beat that boss .  And when you do , and then eventually replay the game, you realize that you can now beat the boss that took you 50 tries to beat on the first time on the first try."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"If you asked me to name The Best Game, I would think of Sekiro before anything except maybe Tetris."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Sekiro is a better game than Elden Ring, there I said it"

The people who made WoW?  Yeah I remember playing with them (Legacy of Steel) on Nameless. 

I know AC was first, but EQ was the game that really launched the genre into the mainstream consciousness. The lack of respect it gets historically is kinda sad, like it’ll be forgotten completely once my generation dies out"

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It’s such a mainstream list. Everything is what was popular at the time. I get that it is popular because stuffs good but the flaw is good stuff that is not popular won’t make a list like this
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,WC3 not being listed is really absurd. But speaking of rts: Erm... Where is Dune 2?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Sorry for being pedantic, but tower defense and the precursors to mobas existed in StarCraft UMS maps before WC3 was ever released."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Bunch of highly rated PC indie games not on the list.  No Mount and Blade, Kerbal Space Program, Project Zomboid, Rimworld, ~~FTL~~ or Factorio among others I've probably missed."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,The vast majority of reviewers came nowhere close to beating it.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Binding of Isaac not being here is probably my only gripe. Especially seeing so many other indie games present. BoI is THE best roguelike, paved the way for others that are present on the list like Hades. I understand that the approach is data driven, so I think this says more about games media not including it than it does about any of OPs rationale"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I get what you're saying, but V has a lot more cultural impact and is the 2nd best selling game of all time. And even though san andreas aged really well in some ways, it aged really poorly in others."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Spyro needs to be there, although it was released the same year as Ocarina of Time"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The same can be said about Pokemon. As iconic as red and blue are, those games are broken as shit and later iterations are so much more polished. Hell even leaf green and fire red are a huge improvement on the originals. But nostalgia be a hell of a drug"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Then what about Metal Gear Solid at #7? Mario 64 at #9? Have those aged all that well?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I was looking for this. Super Mario Kart (1992) wasn't that popular at all and isn't very good. Mario Kart 64 (1996) was incredible and somehow not on the list at all? (I will also accept double dash)

I can only imagine people think Mario Kart 64 is actually Super Mario Kart since that is the first one they know in the series. Otherwise I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. 

Super Mario Kart (1992) is garbage to mediocre. No game deserves to be on a list if it's sequel made the original completely obsolete (or at least higher than the more popular sequel, like how Portal 2 is higher than portal...)"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Because games age differently than movies . Old games usually miss a lot of qol stuff we take for granted today , like fast travel , no durability/inventory limit, minimaps and many other things you just don't think about because every game usually has them 

Movies don't suffer from that . Aside from cgi and visual quality, a movie filmed and edited  on 30 year old hardware wouldn't be so different from the same movie filmed and edited on modern hardware."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,That’s a super cool website
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Having played the whole top 10, CP2077 2.0+Phantom Liberty is above Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and would be in there now. I’m entirely serious. It is brutally underrated. If it launched like this, with PL, it would have been GOTY."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Just beat Cyberpunk 2077 an hour ago, it’s a masterpiece."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I get why they're not, based on how OP collected his data. Also explains why New Vegas is 60+ spots below Fallout 3, despite NV being better in every conceivable way."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Gamer in my 40s, Cyberpunk not being on here isn't just a crime. It's a warcrime."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,BoTW at 2nd place and Outer Wilds at 99th place is shocking.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,NGB: possibly the best third person combat engine & combat design EVER.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"The Bioshock love is utterly baffling to me. I played it on release and had a good time, but forgot it very quickly. I can think of a bunch of similar first person games that were better to play and more memorable."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I think it would be nearly impossible to get an agreed upon top 10. Games never age well. Even the best ones are worse now than on release.

But, given that, BotW seems like a fairly safe pick. And I mean that literally. It's extremely polished in basically every area, from gameplay to story to visuals. It's one of the few games where it's really hard to find generally objective critiques. That's why it's here; lots of other games have flaws that will push them out of the top 10 on various lists, whereas BotW is a safe inclusion on all of them.

Also it did all that on the Wii U, so given that handicap I think #2 is justifiable."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Agreed.

Combined with FTL, they are the best example showing that you can create the feeling of ""exploration"" while being the opposite of an open world game.

On top of that, STS is mechanically distinct and fun enough that it spawned an entire ecosystem of STS-likes. And even though it was released almost 5 years ago, I still think it is the best of its kind."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"OoT is like Citizen Kane. We all just collectively agreed it's the best and we just don't question it. It's not my favorite game, but if I saw The Witcher 3 above it, I would think ""That's not right""."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,GTA 5 at 3rd is weird to me.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The weapon break feature nearly ruined the game for me. BOTW and OOT are awesome games, for sure, but the greatness of Zelda started with A Link To The Past for me. Man, what a game!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I feel like elden ring would be much higher but it released after half of these articles came out so the fact its at the 60 spot is pretty crazy
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This is the problem I have with greatest game ever lists - they're scored on how good they were for their era and also just nostalgia. Like is Zelda OOT still the best game we have in 2023? It would be interesting to see the top 100 lists of the younger generations in comparison to millennials.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Don't worry , as long as you are having fun you are doing it right"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Compared to most other games on this list it's quite obscure. The fact it's in here speaks for it's quality I think.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Same. I play Suikoden I and II every couple years. The nostalgia just hits different.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I wasn't expecting top 10, but not seeing terraria on this list at all is surprising."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"No terraria was incredibly surprising, i feel like nowadays its even more popular than a lot of games on there (or at least it has a very active and dedicated fan base)"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"For real, I'm not really a fan of the Xenoblade games, Xenogears is one of the greatest though."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It's a crime, really."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Making good games makes people believe you make good games. This and other news at 11.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Is it really that biased? Zelda has always been the benchmark for single player dungeon crawling and puzzle solving, and Mario basically invented the modern day 3D platformer. 

Skyward Sword is considered one of the worst 3D Zelda's (and I agree with that statement), yet I still can't think of a single adventure title from that console generation with better designed dungeon and puzzle mechanics than that one outside of Okami. If that title is considered a low point for a franchise, then I don't really understand how people can think that it's overhyped or biased."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"What is up with r/gaming's heavy anti-Nintendo slant? I've seen like several posts on this thread wondering why Nintendo has so many highly rated games. A lot of these games are just obviously good. I have heard people love and consider Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask their favorites for decades. Same with games like Super Mario 64, Galaxy, Odyssey. Same with Metroid and Metroid Prime.

Anyone who grew up gaming throughout the 90s, 2000s, and 2010s just... shouldn't be surprised that Nintendo dominates a large part of this list."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It's because these ""all time"" lists are heavily swayed by nostalgia and Nintendo ruled the community for a long time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"i mean, honestly, the fact that basic games like that make it so high is a testament to how important they are in the grand schemes of things. 

Is tetris a graphically impressive game? Is it the most techinically challenging game of its time? probably not in both cases, but its impact on gaming as a whole gets it so much credit.  Its a game that EVERYONE AND THEIR MOTHERS have played.  Its has world wide recognition.  It is a game that has inspired other newer puzzle games.  

In the micro is tetris the #5 game of all time. No.  In the Macro? Does it deserve top billing, HELL TO THE YES."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Tetris is amazing
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Completely agree with you. Just played through the remake actually, and while I enjoyed a lot about it, the gameplay and map design was ridiculously simple and not really worthy of top 25 *of all time* considering some of the games with both amazing gameplay and other aspects as well."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Gameplay wise, sure. But writing and design?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,There is a remaster with improved controls if that’s what’s bothering you.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,The hate around the sequel is because of the poor story direction
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Thought the same thing until I saw someone mention this takes in user reviews, Part 2 got raided with bad reviews because it was “woke”"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Masterpiece, think I've actually played it 50 times over."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Absolutely, I was just thinking the same thing! The first one has a very classic button-mashy vibe but the second is an actual game with a lot of interesting mechanisms and tons of replayability"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Same dude! And I don't say that lightly!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,">No FPS would be on this list were not for Half-Life

Uh.. DOOM existed before Half-Life did. I'm not arguing that Half-Life wasn't a revolutionary game, but even Half-Life has to give credit to games that which came before it, and inspired it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Deus Ex is 74, this list is criminal... Still interesting though."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Most games are recent but not so recent as to not have had time to be on lists, they overlook/underrate most old greats."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Ita say ""best"" game not ""most influential"" or ""most popular"" game, but it is clear that those distinctions are not well defined at all across the sources."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"> Sources are biased mostly by being recent. 

Wildly disagree. Doom, Half-Life, etc. Whenever they list ""all-time"" they are biased towards nostalgia, ie age or at least age of series (Zelda, Mario)."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Yeah hl1 being that low is really surprising. Hl2 should even be a bit higher.  There's no way biohock if better than hl2
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"not deniyng recency bias here, that certainly exists.

but a game can be a genre definer/creator or popularizer, and still NOT hold the test of time.

Whatever half life holds up(the original, not black mesa) is up to you, i personally dont think it holds up to well. and a ""game of all times"" needs to at least partially account for ""what if its played today"". You can give older games leeway in graphics and presentation, but if otheraspects that are not explained by ""its old"" are worse then contemporary today then thats that."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"BOTW = yes

Ocarina of Time = no"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Lmao said like a true Redditor.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It will be higher for sure
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"By that logic, 99% of these games will be dogshit because VG are an evolving art form. You have no understanding of how these lists are made."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,The problem with a lot of these lists is that it factors its impact by the time it was released. Was it the best game in 1998? It probably is. Is the the best game in 2023? Highly doubt it.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Ignorance.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Give it 5 years. It will be very high on these lists
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It was probably compiled from lists that don't have it yet listed as it's brand new and hasn't received GOTY yet
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Too much water bro
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I thought I was the only one. I get massively downvoted for saying this but im glad to see im not the only one with this opinion.
I dont even think its a bad game, its just mid."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Just beat this one and I was really impressed, they finally made a scary Resident Evil game!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Definitely not above DS1 in my opinion. I don't know why there is such a spread there, let alone how it got above."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Recency bias. Lmao.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Yep it's now my #1 personally.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I have it ahead of BOTW easily at 2 but not Ocarina of Time, that game deserves it's crown."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It's almost as if  
(don't hold your breath)  
a game's popularity is correlated with its quality."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,We're blood brothers.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Nah it ain’t :) 
The fact that it is basically okay for all ages, is a quintessential adventure with fully open world and exploration unseen in a game before it, (that games like Genshin Impact ripped off because it was so great and groundbreaking at the time) is what makes it such a great game.
If it’s not your particular favorite, at least get your insult right.
Zelda isn’t just for kids. And Breath of the Wild is not very overrated."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Lmao brain rot comment.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Stop being afraid of fun.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I'd go further and say it wasn't a ""good story"". It has great dialogue, and amazing performances. But the story overall isn't that good."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I hear that.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I have played a lot of Zelda and I know I am in the minority of people in the same situation as me, but BotW is just more fun to play than any of the other Zeldas. I absolutely loved the stories of like OoT and Majora's Mask, but even as a kid when they were all I had, the puzzles felt nonsensical and the back and forth felt frustrating"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Lmao its literally the best Zelds game and its not even close. You are in such a tiny minority but you think you’re loud because you’re screeching.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"By this logic, all these games will mage outdated in like 30 years. This is an evolving art form. Nostalgia is part of the bias but also these games are good in general."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I completely agree about The Talos Principle. I’m almost finished with TTP2, and it’s different but equally magnificent."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I hate Destiny. Play it every day.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Obviously

I am a PC user , I usually prefer mouse and keyboard , and I am telling you that you can just plug In a controller. It's not that bad"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The underwater location, bringing immersive sim gaming to the masses, the graphics were really impressive for their time (the way water moved and flowed looked great as well), the story was decent. The world, art, sound design and gameplay all meshed together really well."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Probably the setting and story
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"You guys are downvoting him, but he's right!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Im a huge Zelda fan and was incredibly entertained by it. Fantastic story with fun characters, simple but effective gameplay mechanics and side quests that made the world more homely.

See, I can do it too.  Now tell everybody how you really feel."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Because it’s mid as fuck, thats why."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Boo hoo.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I had fun doing it!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Wtf is starcraft? There is your answer right there.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,So brave.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Well yes, you’re free to take these rankings with a grain of salt. This is just an interesting exercise meant to show what patterns exist across these types of rankings, it’s not a definitive list nor is it meant to be viewed as objective."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Still too recent, released after many of these lists were written."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I started gaming back in the Commodore 64 days. I can’t believe how much I keep enjoying games as they get released each year. 
I personally find my gaming experience so fulfilling, especially the past couple of years. Most recently have fallen in love with Cyberpunk and Elden Ring. 
There’s no doubt that the classics were great in their day but more modern gaming absolutely rocks … to me at least."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Nostalgia plays a huge part.  Modern games have never been better, especially this year."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Man that's wild. I can still play OoT it holds up so well. Yes it's showing its age but when I played it on release it was life changing. Gaming was never the same and it shaped the genre. When I played Elden Ring I beat Godrick or w/e his name was and lost interest. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Although great, I do agree that BOTW is a bit overrated."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,(Fantastic work btw)
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Amiga games getting some love warms my heart
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Zero dawn is like 129. Bit HONESTLY surprised it's not higher.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,What are your personal top 10?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Yeah 28 is ridiculously low. I believe IGN or some other major game site had a top 100 or 200 recently and Mario World was #1. That must have not been included in this dataset for some reason.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,My 1st ever pc game that came as a bundle with a new pc
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I'll make sure to compile the top selling games from 20xx , remove the sports games / cod , / pokemon and say that 20xx was one of the best years for gaming ever"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Post it as a low quality screenshot.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Can you make it truthful too? Can't have halo 2 below any halo
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"What was a game you were disappointed by...that was on the list?

Gotcha"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Don't forget ""What was a game you liked but others didn't?"" and vice versa"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I’ve screen capped like the entire post and sent it to many of my friends this is gold
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"As far as I can tell, he has good taste and no job."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It’s not a perfect comparison at all, but it’s like silent film and movies with sound.  The arcade experience was undoubtedly hugely influential to all of gaming as we know it, but the last two cultural generations don’t really even have a reference point for it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Not super shocking. They had a huge influence, but I'd rather play just about any game on the SNES than most classic arcade games, and I love arcades.

I worked at one when I was 16-20, and a common sight was a 50 year-old getting excited to see the old games, head over, sit down for 15 minutes, then look bored, get up and leave.

Outside of Breakout, Centipede, and a few others which hold up and are still just extremely fun in 2023. Those games were always taken and had a few extra people watching."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Just out of curiosity, which games are you referring to?

Funny enough, I went the largest arcade in America last week (Galloping Ghost) and played a couple of these games. I was pretty upset I couldn't find Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Maybe it was out of service."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"We are addicted to lists for some reason, but if there's something that's really not fit to be ranked, it's video games as such. ""Which is better, Last of Us or Tetris?"" is a nonsense question to start with. It's like asking ""Which is better, Sushi, Albert Einstein, or the color green?"" Completely different categories.

Then again video games don't restrain themselves to genres, either, there's a reason the Steam catalogue is mostly tag-based nowadays and some award categories continue to be absolute jokes due to the games they mix together (looking at you, Crusader Kings not winning best strategy because of MS Flight Sim being in the category, too)."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Absolutely. Fired up my PS3 the other day to play it again. It’s still amazing. An updated version with crisp resolution and better frame rate is at the top of my wishing list…
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Unique, yes.

I wouldn't say groundbreaking.

Couch co-op just got a little funky after it came out but I always found it a bit boring. I'm glad others like it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I think most of these lists kinda ignore MMORPGs in favor of single player story based games. With special exceptions for shooters and fighting games. 

But I think the reason is because most of compelling nature of mmorpgs and the motivation to continue to play is dependent on the social circle you engage with. Someone who plays WoW or Eve: Online probably won’t play long if they don’t get involved in a solid clan or corp or group. 

MMORPGs, when you take away the MMO part don’t always hold up against the others on the list. They are a different breed."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I feel it's really hard to quantify how good a multiplayer game is, since it's so intrinsically linked to each one's own personal experience that's going to vary wildly depending on when they started to play it, how good the servers were, how toxic other players were in their servers, how many mods and customization options were available/allowed on those servers and probably other factors that haven't even crossed my mind.

WoW has an even greater variable considering how long it's running, player experiences in each time and expansion is going to be very different."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The tricky thing with live service games/MMOs/multiplayer games in general is that they tend to make decisions that result in them getting worse over time

See recently: Diablo 4, which everyone seemed to dig at first"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Definitely a hard game to compare others to
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Tetris is repping hard for the ever popular puzzle genre though
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,The real crime is that brood war isn't on the list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"GTA3 was the landmark game that changed the series and revolutionized the open world genre. It's the most significant GTA game, albeit no longer the absolute best. Kind of like debating Breath of the Wild vs. Tears of the Kingdom. TOTK is the better game, but there's no TOTK without BOTW. GTA3 is the definitive GTA game. Everything else is built on that foundation."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I feel like V has been on the radar for so long almost only because of online multiplayer. It really increases replayability. Nothing against that, but I played single player V once and never went back. And I wasn't nearly as engaged and immersed as I was in San Andreas."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"GTAs specifically seem to hit very differently for people from other times and places.

I grew up in the 80s, so the soundtrack and ambiance of Vice City made it for me the best GTA of them all. San Andreas on the other hand, since I grew up somewhere where the Rap and Hip Hop culture had zero impact, I had a really hard time identifying with it (plus the MC is a little bitch being pushed around by everybody lol)"

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"WoW was definitely the most mainstream MMO but that's a double edged sword since we're talking about a genre whose roots are quite niche. It's easy for familiarity to become contempt when quite a few of your most hardcore guildies would probably rather be playing guild wars or runescape or everquest or even their old mud but they feel ""stuck"" with WoW because that's where their buddies migrated to. Ultimately though I actually think 31st is fine and if anything Command & Conquer, Warcraft II/III & Starcraft got shafted worse."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,GTA V got nothing on GTA SA story.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,The amount of money it made 😉
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It's been relevant for over a decade at this point. That sticks in people's minds.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,GTA 3 and SA were great games but not relevant for a decade games.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,the only WOW killer was Blizzard itself.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"People really forget how absolutely dogshit New Vegas was on release for performance and bug reasons.

A door could take as long as a Saturday morning cartoon. Regularly."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"> competitive RTS/FPS are not what these reviewers focus on.

Or strategy games. The highest Civ game being at 87 is a fucking joke."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Super Mario World

Tony Hawk pro skater 2 

The Last of Us

Zelda Link's awakening

Mario Land 2 6 gold coins

Control

Dragon Warrior 3

Halo

Uncharted 2

Blue Dragon."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I speculate BG2 and Morrowind and PlaneScape Torment.

Morrowind is better than Skyrim, minus modern creature comforts.

Baldur's Gate 2 is better than most modern RPGs, but with old if brilliant game dngine.

PS:T is hardly ever outwritten, even if it has a lot of flaws."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Yeah, shit, recency. No one under 30 remembers Myst, but it was the killer app for CD gaming. A beautiful immersive 3D chess adventure game the world has never really known before. After it sold like crazy, could even get this junky parody game called Pyst *in stores*.

There's 170 other games above Myst on this list"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,100%. The world of games has changed monumentally since the likes of Warcraft 3 and many other old genre defining games. Many of which are ignored or put so low on the list to be a little insulting. BoTW is maybe a top 50 game while Half-Life somehow doesn't make Top 50.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"WC3 deserves top 10 at least for the impact it had on gaming, people still play DotA, LoL (and WoW) to this day. And also it's like a top 10 game based on its on merit."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"And the custom games scene was just so perfect. I spent way too much time playing stuff like Tree Tag, Wintermaul One, Battleships..."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Industry wide collapse caused by ET, maybe?  That or just forgot by the author."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Um, if you didn’t know, Bioshock 4 is in development. Whether it’ll be good or not with a completely new team at the helm is anyone’s guess."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Honestly as I’ve gotten older I feel like infinite shows/has way more problems than 2 whereas the only issue with 2 I have these days is that sometimes it can feel a bit too safe. Infinite tried to do too much without really achieving any of their goals aside from Elizabeth really innovating in the gaming industry and porn
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I have never in my life heard someone say that infinite is better then 2.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Its not dead: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Chamber_(company)

""Year ---Title ---------------------- Platform(s)

TBA --- **Untitled BioShock game**	 --- TBA"""
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Things that are good don't need to get milked until they lose all relevance they once had. Let bioshock be good and let it inspire new things or let the studio make a new good ip.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"2 was fine, it was an extension of one which made it tolerable. Infinite was like playing a different franchise. I was shooting rocket launchers and was recharging Halo shields before the first set piece. No tension, no drama, no mystery just explosions."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,">Infinite had problems, but was vastly better than BioShock 2

I don't think I could disagree with a gaming opinion any harder. Infinite has absolute dogshit gameplay compared to 2. Like the design decisons in Infinite just had me angry the whole time I was playing it. Maybe the worst game I have ever played to completion."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Which game, Bioshock? I mean, it depends on the time you’re viewing it from. Sure, now it’s gameplay might not be considered something special, but 2007 was a different time"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Going back now, Bioshock 2 is much more playable by modern standards as it refined on all the aspects of the original. It might not have ~[The Twist]~ of the first game but imo it's the better of the trilogy"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,The first Bioshock's gameplay was definitely innovative when it came out. No other game before it did Special Abilities + FPS as well.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Wow you're right, I'm also shocked Titanfall 2 isn't up there! One of the best FPS campaigns ever"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Sekiro not making the list surprises me most of that set. Terraria and Titanfall 2 I'm not *terribly* surprised missed the cut because they're both more grassroots ""fan favorites"" than they were super notable critical darlings, but Sekiro I feel like was both a critical darling *and* had a big community around it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Terraria is literally one of the best selling games of all time and is famous for all the free updates it's released.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Terraria not making the list is a crime. Blows my mind that it's not here.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I was so glad Outer Wilds was on here, just finished it and it’s definitely one of my favourites"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Agreed. I went in with the only thing I knew being that it took place underwater. Best single player gaming experience I think I've ever had.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Playing a puzzle game with a strategy kind is ruinous.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Sorry about being born, guys :("
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Wind's howling
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It's true.  I bought it and stopped playing right away cause I thought it was a buggy mess.  Then I came back later and it became my favorite Fallout and one of my favorite games of all time.  I'm still waiting for something similar to appear again.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I'm with you, and I love both.  But 3 was a way cooler area to explore and I had a lot more fun with it than I did NV. NV had a better story but felt like nothingness to me in between plot points. 

Can't wait to get flamed for this comment."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Exploration is much better in Fallout 3. Everyone makes a big deal about choices in NV, but they aren’t as earth shattering as everyone makes them out to be."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,fallout 3 has less RPG elements than NV
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Fallout 3 does a great job of slowly showing you how the game works and opening up at the right times and guiding you to be in the places you should be without overwhelming the player; whereas, New Vegas just kind of throws you out there and hands you a lot of different systems and elements pretty quickly, which I think makes it a little too complicated for the average gamer."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Yeah, it's funny nobody ever talks about that. I wasn't high on FO3, but immediately enjoyed NV. Some of my friends and people I know irl didn't like it though, and I saw that sentiment echoed a lot online. Flash forward to now and it's considered the definitive FO experience to the point where people are begging Obsidian or ~~Bethesda~~ somebody to make a worthy spiritual successor."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Seconded. Whenever people praise NV like it was an instant classic, I have to wonder if I slipped into bizarro world, because back when it came out, I remember both the outlets and the online discourse loathing it as a ""cheap, rushed cash-grab DLC sold at full price"". Among all my friends, both online and offline, I was pretty much the only one who liked it, warts and all, and seeing it getting unanimous praise nowadays and everyone pretending they always loved the game is just baffling."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"it still is massive.

hundreds of thousands of people have been playing it every day for more than 2 decades.

how many other games can say that?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Paradox strategy games are a very niche market. They have a very solid fanbase, but they were never truly big enough to be featured on lists like this (and I say this as a fan)."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,The RTS genre just didn't continue with the steam it had. I think only Age of Empires II is the only RTS game I recognized on the list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Right? Or Dune II!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Specifically Red Alert, right? I never played any of them but that one I would hear about all the time back then."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"This is going to be countered at least somewhat by the other flaw in the methodology. Points are given solely by ranking regardless of year. Therefore newer games are going to get fewer points because they didn't exist when several of the polls used were created. A game in 2023 could be #1 on every list created after the game was released, and still get fewer points than an older game that scores even moderately on every source used, because they get 10 extra scores to add to their total."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I would have at least accepted Tie Fighter as a consolation option, but yea Wing Commander was such an immersive pioneer in the space combat simulation genre."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Secret of Monkey Island is #110
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Reach is really underrated
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Unreal Tournament is always forgotten amongst all the other greats. Just how it be.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Hell yeah.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"It absolutely does. 
Hard to imagine Mario 64 and Quake as the first larger level fully 3D games were less than 2 years old when OoT came along…"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,As does Link.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,As do humans.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Yup
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Makes 2 of us
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I hadn't either until my friend talked me into buying a Switch, and since I've put over 700 hours in between BotW and TotK. I didn't think I was a Zelda fan until I somehow was."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Why, when emulation is so easy?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,They’re really great and also overrated. There’s a lot of games in the series so I’d check some out.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Skyward Sword and Phantom Hourglass are both absolute bangers in my opinion. Spirit Tracks though... Boy that game is rough.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"They're good games, but a more important reason is that they're *very* casual friendly while still offering an actual gameplay experience, rather than something arcadey.

Very few casual games manage to get anyone invested in them, and Zelda has built it entire legacy on it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,BOTW is very different from most Zelda games. I wouldn't write off the series as a whole just cause you didn't like BOTW
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Between Breath and Tears, I think Tears is a better game overall, although it does get a lot of criticism for being BotW 2.0. The building mechanics alone make it much more interesting and fun to experiment with, and there's a wider variety of enemies. Weapon degradation is still there, but the fusion mechanic more than makes up for it (there's also an enemy in the game that allows you to restore weapons, although I'm not sure if that was intentional on Nintendo's part). Both games are also very different in the franchise for not relying on linear story progression.

Ocarina is probably the most nostalgic out of all of them. It introduced many musical motifs that have since become a mainstay in the franchise, and it has so many memorable characters and moments. That said, the gameplay and camera do suffer from that early 3D jank like many games in that era. If you ask individual Zelda fans what there favorite game is, you're likely to get wildly different answers, but I think that's a testament to the franchise as a whole that you can have so many different experiences depending on the game."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Tears of the Kingdom isn’t up there. It’s Ocarina of Time.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Huge same. I played Zelda OoT when I was a kid and it was by far the greatest gaming experience of my life. Then Majoras mask, which was amazing but not as revolutionary. Then sort of lost interest, tried Twilight Princess and didn't like it. 

Fast forward to last year I pick up BoTW to play with my son. He loves it, similar magic to OoT I experienced, but for me...not so much. It's really just uninteresting, feels very flat and procedurally generated. Fun to see it through his eyes though, I just pretend to be having more fun than I am. 

Honestly Zelda fans will just give their games a 1-2 point bump for nostalgia, which pushes it into overrated terrority."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Try A Link to the Past. Different game from a different age, but I think it still stands strong. The world is much, much smaller than BotW but is much more dense. The dungeon design is top notch. You will get lost, you will get confused, and you will die. But that's all a part of the adventure. 

I'm curious what is in your top 10 if they didn't get near what you see in the top 10 here."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Couldn't agree more. I still play it from start to finish every few years. Playing the PC port recently was an absolute joy. Strongly recommend giving it a try if you haven't yet.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Do you have a name or someplace I could look to find it?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Most games that are (high) on this list are not great by todays standards

Just the way you have to swap items in n64 oot is a horrible experience"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Forest Temple as one of the worst? Do you mean the Deku Tree, or are you on crack?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Actual braindead opinion. Forest temple is great and most of the temples in game are some of the best crafted in the entire franchise.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,">Forest Temple and Jabu Jabu's belly

Meh, those dungeons were fine. The only real kick in the dick was the fucking **water temple**"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Fair. I knew it was a purely addictive drug before I ever tried it. I stayed away from it for years, literally knowing exactly how it would destroy my life. And yet when I did dip my toe in years later.. Hahaha, we kidding, no one dips their toe in factorio!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Consider yourself lucky that you were able to get out early. I’ve got over 1,000 hours in it and I really don’t game that much *generally*. Probably 15% of all my brain capacity is reserved for useless Factorio information"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Super Metroid is an absolute gem and what makes it is the environments paired with the music. In a game about exploring, what you explore has to be interesting/engaging - just running around the play space has to be rewarding in and of itself - and Super Metroid has that in droves."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I loved Dread, but the SM music just has that like... standard SNES-era OOMPH to it, similar to Chrono Trigger. Idk what they were doing back then to compose music like they did."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Very cool to read this. CT is arguably my favorite game of all time. But it's hard for me to separate the game from my 9-year-old kid nostalgia. Hearing this from somebody who doesn't have that nostalgia attachment helps reaffirm that is truly is a great game and stands the test of time.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"It's a puzzle platform game that has time-rewinding mechanics. It's pretty short so there's no grind or repetitiveness. I won't spoil it, but it has a great ending.

It's a great game. Everyone I know who has played it likes it.

Edit: It's currently on sale for $3.74 on Steam for the next 40 hours."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,">They aren’t for everyone imo.

You're right. They're for cool people."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Yet Elden Ring managed to appear at 65 while being only 1 year and a half old lol
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Yeah, I read the first few paragraphs and thought ""damn, Elden Ring gets utterly shafted because older games are heavily favored here.""

And then it's *still* at 65, lol."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Exactly. It was the first game that taught me to never run from the boss grind, and that served me well in games like AC6, Lies of P, etc. I’m no longer afraid of big scary bosses!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"it’s my GOAT game, Yakuza 0 is number 2. oh well"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"That's way too low. 

RTS games in general get so underrated"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Deserves *at least* top 50
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I stopped playing WoW after the free trial ended because I had been addicted to Everquest for many years before it came out. Saw the writing on the wall. Games were too good. No real pay to play back then. Old school grinding paid off. Not saying EQ was the best, but it was damn good. Povar server FTW!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Yep if success is based at all on longevity, income and modern relevance then EQ should be number 1."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,We all knew Furor was a raging asshole decades before he got fired from Blizzard.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Really sad I had to scroll down so far to see someone say this. EQ was the MMO that showed MMOs were financially viable. If it hasn't been such a massive success WoW would've either come along much later or not at all.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I agree , horizon zero dawn should not be ranked higher than warcraft 3 . It's not a bad game , but not a top 200 of all time game too"

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I get that Spelunky and FTL helped jumpstart the genre and Hades is super polished, but I feel Isaac and Gungeon are at their core the best games in the genre, and both are absent."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Playing red and blue normally, it's rare you'd find it to be ""broken as shit""

Red and blue play largely the same as the newer pokemon games. The biggest change is the graphics. The same cannot be said about mario kart."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I do think that historical importance needs to be considered in these kinds of lists, but you also have a point, especially when close to identical remakes/sequels exist that basically do literally everything better"

There are more people playing SM64 every day than there are for a lot of the other games on this list. Graphically it’s definitely aged but the gameplay is still just as enjoyable, complex, and beloved as it was in 1996."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I would actually probably put the Wii Mario Kart on the list over any of the others. I agree for its time, Mario Kart 64 was better than SNES, but I'm not sure I'd say the SNES one wasn't that popular. Honestly it was pretty groundbreaking for having any sort of auto-driven battle mode to play with friends.

But the Wii one and being able to play with friends remotely and overall play online with people around the world was pretty incredible, and it did a great job of meshing together interesting new tracks with ones from past games."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I don’t understand why people bring aging into the equation. No car collector buys a model T and is like damn… my hellcat is way faster.  They buy it for what it was… revolutionary.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"> lots of other games have flaws that will push them out of the top 10 on various lists, whereas BotW is a safe inclusion on all of them.

I think this applies to nearly everything Nintendo produces. They make games that are nearly flawless, in the literal sense of them being largely without flaw, but that doesn't inherently make them *good*. It usually means they haven't taken sufficient creative risks to truly excel.

It's like a car that performs well, is safe and comfortable to drive, is affordable with all the extra features but bores you to tears because everything is just ""OK"". Sometimes the exciting European sports car that will shit itself every 5,000km is the better pick."

Half voice acted cut scenes, a paper thin “story”, immersion breaking “side quests” (hey the world is ending and only you can save us, go get this bottle from a lake for me so I can make cheese or pickup all my stuffed animals), poor combat mechanics, really poor inventory management, poor level design (at least they tried to fix that in the sequel).

High budget games are being made for the lowest common denominator, maximizing profits over innovation, depth and fun. And it has all to do with how the industry is set up at that level, where games are made with investors putting money in with the guarantee they get more money out. Stopping devs from taking any risks.

A game like BG3 isn't perfect, but it shows what's possible if you don't have to stop development when market research tells your return on investment will only decrease by allocating more dev time. 

When was the last time a AAA studio surprised you with something new and interesting? And we're not talking here about better graphics or executing a proven genre to perfection."

I don't think so. But whatever, 2023 was just slightly less lame than 2020 or 2021 or 2022. But if you took 2023 and transplanted in back in the 2000s....

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,A pretty good comparison. I also think that a big part of it is that arcade games were much better enjoyed in the arcade environment competing with friends for high scores. I feel like most people who try an arcade game for the first time today will play maybe four or five rounds and then never touch it again.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I would say that neither Space Invaders nor Galaga not being on the list is outrageous. Frogger, Asteroids, Centipede, Missile Defense and many other arcade classics I would expect to see at least one or two of these on here."

The way enemies come at you makes it feel like the game was designed for a cover based system (also a ton of environmental cover and a mostly unused crouch ability). Your guns always feel a step behind where they should be, and how fragile Jesse is feels a little at odds with how aggressive the game wants you to play. Still love it, think it's at bare minimum an 8/10 and fun as hell, but just my own experience"

I don't know if it's really all that good. The graphics and atmosphere were what made it on release. A lot of what makes the world compelling was kinda filled in later in laer games and books.

Certainly, the industry has moved on, and I think at least Riven surpasses the original in basically every way (other Myst titles like Exile, MOUL, debatable, I think Obduction is probably their best game mechanically and in terms of really nailing integrated world building/mechanical play."

I can't put it into words very well, but I just had more fun exploring. There was something silly and quirky around every corner, like a teddy bear and a gnome playing chess on a toilet. The dumb themes that kept popping up just gave the Capital Wasteland so much more flair."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"In Fallout 3, the main plot doesn't take you to much of the map at all, when you look at it.

FNV takes you all OVER the place.  And sidequests are often triggered in places where the main plot takes you.

So Fallout 3 rewarded exploration more. All sorts of side quests hidden where you actually had to go and search them out.

Plus the encounters in the wasteland were completely different.  In FNV, you could say ""now a gecko will run in from the left"", whereas in FO3, the best you could say is ""SOMETHING will happen in this place, when I come up to it for the first time"".

Here's Jon, from Many a True Nerd, with 2 hours on why FO:3 is good.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"To be fair those are very different than previous Zelda games. The traditional Zelda formula has never really hooked me, but I loved BotW and TotK."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I haven't played the other Zelda games. So I can't comment on them. I do believe you that for example Ocarina of Time is very different though and it perhaps it was revolutionary at the time of its release. I didn't play it back then though, so it can't have an educated opinion on that game. It's difficult to revisit games that old and adequately judge them. Same with a game like Morrowind. I think that game was mind-blowing at the time of release, now it feels rather dated.

My problem is that Zelda fans absolutely **rave** about BotW and I personally found it a very middling game. So I'm just very skeptical about what those same people have to say about games in general. Simply based on how a lot of people go crazy for BotW, I've always just assumed that there are a lot of Zelda fans who are dedicated Nintendo gamers and who have not played open-world games with actual qualitative content like RDR2 or The Witcher 3.

Maybe that's an unfair assumption though."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Ironically that sounds like my experience with breath of the wild! I found it a total bore to play.

I don't think Outer Wilds is about a 'big reveal' at all. Certainly it has some, but it's more a series of smaller discoveries on the way. Anyway, as they say the less said about the game the better (as discovery is pretty much its main selling point), but if it's not doing it for you so far then too bad. It probably doesn't help that it's been hyped up beyond belief."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Yes, but collectors aren't ranking their collection based on ""best of all time"". ""Most influential"", maybe, but not ""best"". It's an entirely different metric. Because the ""best cars of all time"" list if aging is removed from the equation would be dominated by modern cars, which have infinitely better safety, faster speeds, better suspension, softer seats, etc, etc.

Video games aren't quite as bad as cars for that, but both graphics and gameplay are features that age extremely poorly. Every generation gives much better graphics, so every game aiming for top tier graphical fidelity is going to look bad in hindsight. Gameplay of popular games also gets ripped off and refined, so what was once revolutionary gameplay becomes modern day cliche gameplay.

It's impossible to separate such things when talking about best. Each person has their own metrics for determining how much gameplay and graphics aging affects them. For some people, what might matter is just how they felt when it first released; for others, it might matter how well it holds up if it were first played today.

Basically, you can't dismiss aging when talking about the quality of games; its intrinsically tied to them."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It holds up well but the problem is that Half-Life 2 exists.

I heard a comment somewhere that basically summed it up as ""If HL1 was the greatest fps ever, then HL2 is the greatest game ever""

So if your goal is to make a list of the best games ever, it would be weird to put HL1 over HL2 just because HL1 was an original when HL2 is a better game

Same reason why World of Warcraft frequently makes these sorts of lists but EverQuest doesn't. EverQuest was certainly a pioneer, but that doesn't make it better. If we gave extra weight simply for being first, these lists would just be like Pong, Breakout, Galaga"

The social element is also impossible to standardize for all player experiences."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Definitely!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Your both saying the same thing.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Blue Dragon was Final Fantasy for Xbox. The creator and composer of FF as well as the character designer of Chrono Trigger (and Dragon Ball).

Decently reviewed but surprised to see it in someone’s top 10.  But sometimes a game will just speak to someone way more than most others."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"The 2.5D remake is really good, I finished it last year, first time playing it in like 20 years, and they absolutely nailed making it come to life. The game is 100% 1:1 with the original, they just added cute colorful graphics and refined the sound track."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"After(and during) a link to the past, they wanted to take all the best elements and sort of distill it down and simplify it. I love both games but Links Awakening is special"

When I think BioShock, I definitely think of 1 and 2. Infinite was fine, but it was so different that it doesn't really feel like part of the series"

Ocarina of Time wasn't reviewed this year dummy... It was reviewed in 1998 and metacritic actually has the links of those reviews in their score. Come on now. You can't be that glib. he used read polls of this year.... So, in fact, you would think new games would actually score better... But... they didn't. Cause they're not as good. It's not hard to grasp."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Yes.

You're telling me.. Lets take.... 2007.

That those games would replace... (Get ready to get rocked)

&#x200B;

Mass Effect

Bioshock

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare

HALO 3

The Orange Box

Unreal Tournament 3

Super Mario Galaxy

Uncharted

God of War 2

Crysis 

&#x200B;

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I play old games all the time. They're better. I was playing Fallout 3 recently and it's better than any game releases in the last 5 years. sorry but it's true. I was playing UT99 yesterday for four hours, and it's better than any comp FPS released in the last 10 years. It is what it is man. I play games all the time, new games are shit. They're just simply not as good."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Agreed, even Fortnite is a bit hard to nail down because the gameplay has changed so significantly since the start. Sure, same overarching goal, battle royale, but the mechanics and features have varied pretty drastically between 2018 and 2023.

WoW has a pretty good spot, but these lists are games that you want to play, not games that had a big impact on the genre"

Yes. 

And if they don't, they are a dirty casual and shouldn't review it. 

And if they disagree with my assessment they are dumb and wrong."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"What you haven't considered is, while GTA SA and Vice City made lots of improvements, GTA 3 is what set the foundation and is therefore the most revolutionary and important game of the franchise"

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Would you rank it top ten?

I tried to play it for the first time this year too. Xbox had the bundle on sale, got a few hours into the first one and it just wasn't doing it for me. Maybe I'll try again, maybe there were just some other games I was more interested in at the time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"> He used metacritic top scoring games of all time.

He used the 2023 metacritic score as one of 14 equally weighted scores. “Dummy”."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"You literally picked one of the best years in gaming. That specific year would beat almost any other year in history. Not exactly fair since the original argument was ""the 2000s"" as a whole.

To say no game this year would be a contender in ANY year in the 2000s is genuinely a brain dead take. Baldur's Gate 3 is probably one of the best video games ever made. And that's not even a hot take. It would probably win Game of the Year IN 2007 if it came out at that time. Yes over all the games you listed.

>The 2000s has every year like this good or near this good.

I grew up in the 2000s. It absolutely does not have every year as good as 2007. 2023 beats out multiple years in the 2000s."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,... You took the best year ever in gaming. That isn't really fair
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I also played Fallout 3 recently and no, it's not even close to being better than any game release in the last 5 years. If Fallout 3 released this year it wouldn't even crack top 15 games this year. 

Let's not even count the last 5 years of games like RDR2, GoW+Ragnarok, Returnal, Elden Ring, Sekiro, Ghost of Tsushima, Zelda: BotW + TotK etc... that blow it out of the water."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Mine too! I was obsessed with that game and lost odyssey. The stories in the latter really made that game special. Goosebumps thinking about it bahah 

I need to replay both asap"

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"lol, whatever. I mean, like you can have the opinion. It's wrong. But I'm not going to convince you. 

&#x200B;

And for fucks sake, ONE GREAT GAME DOES NOT MAKE A YEAR GREAT YOU NEED AT LEAST 5 truly great games for a year to be considered great. BG3 is the only really good game this year. I don't think it's great. If it were great I wouldn't have gotten so bored with it. 

&#x200B;

Because I'm still playing UT99 or..... Fallout 3 or... Mass Effect 2.... Or counter strike, or RE4.... Years and years and decades later. 

&#x200B;

No one will be playing any of these new games in 5 years... Let alone 10, 15, 20. 

&#x200B;

I mean Half Life just had it's 25th anniversary and it's one of steams most played games lol. Because it's great. It has a legacy. These modern games do not, and will not. 

&#x200B;

But cheers man. Go play the BG3 if it's so great. Don't waste your time with me. Shit I know in 2007 I didn't have to convince anyone that CoD4 was an all timer or than UT3 waas great or that bioshock was off the hook. Everyone just kinda knew they were. We took it for granted. We didn't know how great we had it. But.... You now. Casuals and mega corps ruin everything eventually gaming is just the latest, and coolest, thing they've ruined. 

&#x200B;

And I'm not saying that BG3 isn't good. It is good. I mean, the fact that it doesn't try to game the player and has actual engaging content, for 2023... That's a BIG deal."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"""Mine too! I was obsessed with that game and lost odyssey.""

OMG, you just brought back a memory I didn't know I had when you said Lost Odyssey 😳my buddies, and I loved that game till we found Resident Evil"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Metacritic didn't even exist in 1998. Its reviews from prior to 2001 were either done retrospectively (most of them) or taken from older publications that shared their data.

>But I'm not going to convince you. 

Sounds good to me, you're the idiot getting downvoted"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I don't really care about downvotes. Reddit is a hivemind of mostly libs and zoomers. I'm not too concerned. And it's a fact that our game industry (millennials) was better than the modern one (zoomers). That's why 60 percent of the best reviewed games are form the 90s and 2000s. And overwheling majority of the great games were made for the millennial gamers. It's not nostalgia. It's just facts. 

 

I know reddit doesn't like facts. But it's just facts. I don't care about downvotes I don't care about upvotes. I say what I say and then keep it moving."

64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,I hope not because that's so cliche that I expect more from these writers. They did such a fine job before without needing any gimmicks and that would sure feel like one.

It's clichéd and gimmicky, and completely goes against the core idea found in the first game of a world you cannot survive alone in for any period of time.

It's not going to happen. Maybe in the last chapter or something.

64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"PS4 is honestly pretty worth it for exclusives alone. Persona 5, Horizon, Nioh, Bloodborne, The Last Guardian, InFamous, Uncharted, Gravity Rush, Kingdom Hearts, etc. etc."

64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,Wow they really blew that out of proportion.
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"Fingers crossed.
I'd be happy even to just get some more details on the game.

I'd say Battlefront 2 and an Episode VIII teaser/trailer are the best bets on most likely to be shown.

64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,Lol keep hoping. Exclusives breed competition which drives innovation. 
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,I'm not gonna claim that exclusives are inherently good for the industry like the other guy but they're probably not going away. Nintendo and Sony have no reason to sell games they publish/develop on anyone else's system.

64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"Lol exactly the opposite, exclusives lock you onto a single system which does the exact opposite of whatever you jut said."
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"True, which is why there needs to be an external force that forces them to release their games on multiple systems, like game neutrality."
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,Only nier is on pc. And the rest is console exclusives.

64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"Lock you in?  I guess it can be hard to have more than one gaming system, but I think it's better than the alternative of one overlord Gamebox with no reason to innovate or put out better games. 

Notice how much better the PS3 got with PS Plus and exclusive games last gen when the 360 was winning?  Now it's Xbox's turn, they got lazy and dropped the ball on features and exclusives and will need to turn it up to compete since Sony's exclusives are killing it.  I don't ascribe to the console wars and taking sides, I own any console that has stuff I want to play on it.  "
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,I'm not talking about gamers. I'm talking about console/game developers. It's true and obvious. You make minimal sense. Sony having better exclusives will drive Microsoft to make games other than Halo and Forza.
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"Ignoring that neither company would spit money into video game projects if there is no financial incentive to do so, Sony and Nintendo produces exclusives to increase incentive to buy their hardware

No exclusives no Bloodborne, etc."
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,That would destroy competition which an economy needs to flourish.
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"Oops, I misread God of War as Gears of War for some reason, my mistake. Yeah, then the list is fine."

64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,Ok i gotcha i didnt either ;)
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"That overlord gamebox is a pc, and it's a much better alternative to the point if it weren't for console exclusives consoles would be just glorified Netflix machines."
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"And who cares if Microsoft makes games to compete with Sony exclusives? Only Microsoft customers will play that, while Sony customers will play the other games. Exclusives don't compete with each other, they make the consoles compete with each other. "
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"I'd be willing to sacrifice games that wouldn't have been made if it weren't for consoles, so that games that Sony and Microsoft paid to be exclusives would come to other platforms."
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"No it wouldn't, jesus fuck, do you people understand that games beside exclusives exist and already provide competition?"
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,Exactly. Now you're getting it. If we have no exclusives then we have no need of multiple consoles. If we don't have multiple consoles then we are stuck with one company who has no need to keep pushing our hobby forward. 
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"And you're actually for that? Companies competing with their own consoles is hell for neutral gamers, it's as if different ISPs offered their own reddit/facebook/wikipedia."
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"I think you seem to miss the fact that games other than exclusives exist, and are usually better than exclusives. Those games are the ones that drive competition and innovation forward, Sony and Microsoft making their own hardware to sell their games on are cancer."
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,Then there's be a monopoly controlling pricing and the price of everything would skyrocket. You need healthy competition in a market to maintain healthy growth and innovation. You do NOT want a single company running the show. This is simple business studies.
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"> and are usually better than exclusives

I know it's all subjective but a huge portion of my favorite games ever are Sony exclusive. Persona 3 and 5, Jak 1 and 3, Sly 2, InFamous 2, KH2, FFX, We Love Katamari, Okami, The Last of Us, Uncharted 3, etc etc."
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"You're telling me if Sony and Microsoft dropped their consoles, then there'd be a monopoly on PC gaming and the prices would skyrocket? That's bullshit, on top of that, you'd need a single company to be making games for it to be a monopoly."
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,Is it because your system of choice are playstations or you have access to all the systems yet your favorite games are mainly Sony exclusives?
64l0yn,2017-04-10,2017-04-11,"Not at all! You seem to have misinterpreted the direction of the discussion. I was referring to the removal of exclusives on consoles, as per the previous discussions. If exclusives were removed and one company was to gain a monopolistic majority of consumers, they'd have free range on pricing and the ability to set the bar where they'd like. Microsoft would, almost definately, avail of this opportunity if it were presented."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,All mainly single player games. This is what Xbox doesn’t understand. You cannot force a multiplayer game to make money. Placing your bets on only having live services is a losing man’s game. Make good games. Establish franchises. Then try to make a multiplayer experience from those games that people actually want.

I actually think they add nominees some years just because Sony has too many. Some years there are 5 total nominees and sometimes there are 6. On years where Sony has 3 GOTY nominees, I think they might throw in an extra contender just because 3/5 just looks unfair."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I'm not a Playstation fan, almost none of their games have caught my interest. I've tried most of them, even have a PS5 I don't use. But I'm just not a fan of that style of game. But even as a non fan I truly respect the amount of care and polish most Sony games have. It's incredible what they've made and honestly during the 8th console generation it felt like Sony was single-handedly keeping single player story games alive. I can't thank Sony enough for not letting all AAA games devolve into samey online shooters and BRs.

Also out of all Sony games my favourite was Infamous 1 so I really wish we could get a remake of that."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I've always said the PS4 gen was the best simply for their exclusives. Glad they're hitting PC and a whole new audience can enjoy them.

* Both horizon games

I picked up the Horizon Zero Dawn PC port a few months ago and was honestly baffled. I didn't understand why this middling open world crafting go-to-minimap-dot-do--simple-task-repeat-until-done game was getting so much praise. Yes, it does look beautiful, but many games do. Yes, the robot dinosaurs are very cool, but they can't carry a game alone. Aloy is realistically written and acted, definitely, but she's also kind of boring and cliche. I just don't get it.

Am I just old? Am I missing something? Am I being unfair or making assumptions?

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bloodborne is about the only masterpiece in there imo. The rest are mostly recycled ubisoft open world knock offs and/or tlou style action adventure games or a crappy combination of both. Its pretty rare for a sony game these days not to feel like they are marketing checklists. The ps2 had more genres on its launch year than the entire life cycle of the ps4 and 5 combined and thats just sad...
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,All shitty ass games. Over hyped.

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Infamous Second Sun does not belong on that list. About as average a game as you can make.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Even Persona 5 was exclusive for a long long time. Final Fantasy 16 is coming out next month.. And at least for now PS5 is the only place to play it.

I like the approaches they’ve made with game pass, cloud gaming and this new iteration of consoles, the series s is a right nifty machine and is a good cost effective way to get into gaming.

They just keep dropping the ball on exclusives. Halo infinite plays really well and I really enjoyed the campaign,it just had 0 multiplayer content at launch.

I’m 90% a player on PlayStation with the last 5% on pc but I hope Xbox will manage to make a comeback because a ""good rivality"" is our benefit…

Take a look at the gamepass, without it, do you think Sony or even Nintendo would have questioned themselves and their services?

Now (for now at least) players who can’t afford that much can play many games across the plateforms for a good price(for now), but the big downside is that you don’t own the games and it could lead to ""zap-gaming""

Last point is that the PlayStation have many point/room for improvement especially for the premium’s offer who from my POV is lacking off…

I’m on essential and will not move at all because I don’t need it but for people who for example are coming to the PlayStation, it’s not that great compared to the gamepass, especially retro-games…🤷‍♂️"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,My favorite thing to do is criticize Sony but it's become harder to do over the years. I like the tailored experience they provide and how careful they are with your experience. Overall well done.

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Honestly I feel like Demon Souls should have been on the list, it was what got me so hyped for my PS5.

Edit: I see it on the expanded text, but I would have liked it in the image, still glad it was mentioned."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Fallout 4 Beats All These Games !!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,What a fucking line up. 😎
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"These are good games, one of them is a top five for me, but together there's a real lack of vibrance, if you were to compare it to the decade prior"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Returnal was kind of “meh” for me. I just couldn’t get into it.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Dont Forget Days Gone. The weakest compared to those in that picture.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Death stranding any good? I just bought my first PS a month ago. I played god of war 2018 and then right into ragnarok (super engaging by the way). I took advantage of some of the other plus downloads (blood borne, last of us remastered, FF15, NIOH 1 and 2, demons souls, FF remake. I have a nice backlog of games stacked up. Any other exclusives to watch out for? 

I love the dual sense controller over X box all day. I thought something was wrong on ragnarok with all the sounds it made at first. I had no idea how cool that controller was going to be.

Is the super expensive controller even worth it over the dual sense??"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Wow and I could get all of that on PC for probably way cheaper. PlayStation loses yet again.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Spider-Man was truly terrible.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Yeah it's been a rough decade. The only good one in the picture was H:ZD.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,This list is missing Nioh
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I own both PlayStation and Xbox and I like each of them for different reasons. PS exclusives are king but none of these games were actually developed by a PlayStation studio…
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It's pretty light. If I look at nintendo's bangers over the last decade
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Or alternatively: PC Ports, what's coming to STEAM next"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"The only “bad” game on here is Returnal, and it’s not even that bad- it’s just not a fun game."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I think we got spolit back in the day with games. All of them games are good but I feel like the gaming industry in last couple years have valued money over quality. Maybe just me but feels that way with alot of games atm
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"a lot of these aren'r exclusives, and the norm going foward seems to be timed exclusives, even for first party titles"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Hahaha this is so funny considering Sony's crying about games becoming exclusives with Microsoft Activision acquisition
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Fuck death stranding
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Some of the game you listed in the description are not even console exclusives, like Sifu."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Don’t Train. Due to recent developments, this context is no longer.  Opting out of training however possible.  As there was not consent."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I’m sorry but did I see Forspoken in that list (text list not image)
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I have heard mostly negative things about Death Stranding
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"14 of those games aren't even exclusive, what's this nonsense post, lmao."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Remasters of recent games has got to stop. Classics are classics because they remain untouched.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"You know... I have all these and I only remember playing Returnal. Now that I think of it. Other than bloodborne and spiderman, these are all the same game buy different and maybe that's why."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"5/10 have been on PC in the last 3 years, here's hoping that gets up to 10/10 soon as there's some bangers there.
Also having a version of Bloodborne that runs well is a dream currently"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I didn't really care for TloU and I haven't played uncharted 4 but the trilogy was just alright to me. Everything else was a banger with bloodborne being one of my all-time favourite.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Like everything, but WHY THE FUCK IS FORSPOKEN VALID? And where is bugsnax?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,RDR2 where??
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Half of them are boring soyglop tho
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Bloodborne was fine. Not even a top 5 souls game anymore, but a solid concept. God of War I’ll get to eventually I guess. The rest I have barely even heard of. I’m sure they’re fine but PlayStation isn’t king because of anything that happened in the last three generations"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Someone help me find what's interesting about Death Stranding. I played it a lot and got so bored being postman.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Ghost of tsushima was robbed for GOTY, even after winning the popular vote"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I don't see Days Gone or RDR2 up there..
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Days gone?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Cool opinion.  

Why do people look at exclusives and think they are just the best?  You are being forced to buy an expensive piece of equipment, they produce for a loss, just to be able to play a game.  

100% would prefer playing what games I want on whatever I want."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Death stranding was legit an F tier game. After the first 30 minutes of “Whoah what the heck is happening” wears off, there is nothing redeemable"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The exclusivity for consoles is so stupid.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Sick of all the lame unimaginative open world schlock
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Are these supposed to be the most memorable games on PlayStation or something? If so I would remove Returnal thats a epically lack luster game and shouldn’t be mixed with those other great games that have beautiful stories and great character progression. Also I would add days gone to that list.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,3 of those games are good
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Never really heard of Returnal other than their announcement.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Death stranding?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bloodborne only one I really care about tbh
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Definitely Forspoken or Wolverine
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I need and I mean I NEEEEEED a lollypop chainsaw remake.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,List needs Days Gone
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I don't care about exclusives. I only buy PlayStation and Nintendo consoles for my inexistent digital library.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I have not beaten a single one of those games lol.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"My favorite exclusive is going to be from the short list that I got to play on a platform good enough to give me a flat 4K60 or 4K120.  And tied to my Steam account for that matter.

The rest, I'll wait on Sony's PC-based Gamepass or emulators.  Definitely not hurting for games to play in the meantime."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Is anyone else bothered that these banners all have nearly identical designs?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Should just be gtaV over and over
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ghost of sushi ni—a was great
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Gravity Rush keeps getting robbed.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Uncharted was the best
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-06,Xbox the last 10 years: Absolute garbage
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Now do one for micro soft
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Meanwhile Xbox has Gamepass that gives INSTANT access to HUNDREDS of high quality titles, all for a very very cheap subscription price. 

Idk how you can look at PlayStation with their $70 games and somehow think that's better than getting so many Gamepass games essentially for free."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Absolute bangers
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I’ve been out for the gaming loop for awhile but star wars bought me back.

Why would anyone buy a Xbox? Is it just halo?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Meanwhile Xbox:

Look, we have Redfall."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I only see 1, maybe 2 good games here."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,This should have just had the last of us on it three times with their  reliance on it lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,ragnarok was fucking boring as shit
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Several of these are not Sony games unless you consider Dragon Quest XIs to be a Nintendo game, or even Octopath Travellers (and tons of switch games published WW except Japan by Nintendo). And then those are not exclusives.

It actually just feels like obnoxious astroturfing."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"The fact Horizon Zero Dawn is here, but not Forbidden West is absolutely perfect! (Nothing to do with the recent “controversy,” just bad game lol)

Edit: this is just a joke for my own amusement because I’m still upset with how HFW turned out. No shade intended to anyone who enjoys the game!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,XBOX WILL DO EXCLUSIVES REEEEEEEE
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Yup.

Xbox has nothing.

Edit: Xbox fan boys extra salty today"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,There really is no comparison when it comes to exclusives in terms of quality and quantity. Sure Xbox has original Halo and Nintendo has its few but Sony has so many games
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Get Death Stranding off of there and that's a solid list.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I’ve only played 2 on that list. Uncharted 4 was just way too long and ghost of Tsushima should of been game of the year!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,All bangers! Except for *that one.*
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Would be kind of interesting to compare Nintendo Sony and Microsoft big releases like this. It’s just that it seems like a lot of games but I see “10 years” and I suddenly feel like that’s not very many and not very frequently. But I’m honestly not sure.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,4 great games
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Just got a PS4 today and bought PS+ so I’ll be making my way through all the games here that are included that I’ve missed on XBOX
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I don't know why but I had almost all these games but barely touched them because they are on PlayStation. The PS5 user experience isn't very welcoming. As good as these games are, I just missed the Xbox user experience everytime I booted the console. Sold it to a coworker recently because it was mostly gathering dust for the past 2 years.

Having good games is not everything. The experience matters."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Now do XBox
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I’ve been an Xbox guy my whole life but will always say that PS5 has the better exclusives. Spider man, GOT, and GOW/GOWR are some of the best games I’ve ever played."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,GOT is the GOAT
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Microsoft crying in the corner.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,PClaystation
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Damn, it's crazy only 2 of these were good games."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Two of these are good games. The rest are not.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,And here Xbox can't put out anything even remotely on the same level. Seems like something always goes wrong. And now the CMA blocked the Activision/Blizzard acquisition. Xbox seems to be fucking cursed at this point.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Only played god of war blood born and horizon the rest not worth the time
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Sub par at best…
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I see this and I all I can think is how I got out of console land while it was good. Only downhill after PS2. PC gamer 4 rife.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Honestly only had two 10/10 games and they were both Last of Us games.

Close seconds were GoW:R, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon:FW in no particular order."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Oh good, a list of games I've never played because I didn't pay for a console I don't need! 

I assume they're all good, might emulate them on PC and play with my Bluetooth controller."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Bleh, no Deathloop ? Come on...."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Death stranding isnt a Sony game(its on game pass PC)
Returnal was mid at best and all horizon games are in weird limbo between shit and mid. The rest is actually good"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Death Stranding was soooooooooo boring
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,What a boring list for mainstream gamers 🥱
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"2 games on this pic are interesting

with exception of returnal, dont know it"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,All those games and only 4 good ones smh
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"What is ""Returnal""?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,5/10. All of them
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Only 6 of these are even any good.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,death stranding is a big laugh out loud. Other than that definitely a solid line up.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"If I had to pick one, I'd pick up Bloodborne but these games are all so damn underwhelming compared to ps1-ps2 era. 

I don't think I'd waste my free time on any of these cheesy soulless ""cinematic experiences"" falsely marketed as games even if they released for free on my console of choice."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Too bad. These a great titles but there has been a massive amount of solid indie games that has had me bury more hours than these.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"How does Death Stranding make the cut ? You missed Heavy Rain, Resistance, PAIN, Little Big Planet, GT, Forspoken, Rachet, GOT."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Lots of really mediocre overrated Games.

I played HZD, Spiderman, GoW and Days Gone on PC and all were mediocre except Days Gone.

Uncharted is literal Garbage and I have no clue how people like that trashy B-Movie Story interrupted by bad Gamplay."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Returnable doesn't belong on this list. The game doesn't have a coherent story.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Death Stranding on this list lmao!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Last of Us and GoW.  The rest I could take or leave.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,All of these games suck except bloodborne.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,What Wolverine game are you referring to?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Xbox had Scalebound... oh wait.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,If there was ever a way to transfer games I would in a heartbeat. Xbox has gotten so bad the last few years
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Why is returnal even on here it's a shitty demo of a game.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,This is really sad. The state of PlayStation in terms of games is at its lowest. There are no iconic seireses anymore. Only those nobody will remember in a couple of years and sequels of previously popular titles. And Bloodborne.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,All the same third-person “cinematic” action adventure Game with no a single multiplayer game. They’ve been basically milking the same genre for a generation 😂
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ahh so this sub is just a PlayStation circle jerk now. Nice
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,so basically mostly terrible?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"The only one I really enjoyed was bloodborne, I don't mind the others to much but they play more like set pieces or films than games."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Bloodborne. What are the rest of these games? Never heard of them.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Honestly only good one was the last of us 🤷‍♂️😂
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"And Spider Man is the only good game on this list.
10 years wasted."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,[deleted]
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,9 years of masterpieces plus Death Stranding
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Infamous was good but the rest is pretty but shallow and mediocre.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I’m gonna be real with you, I completely forgot Infamous Second Son was a thing"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Where bloodborne for pc at
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Ratchet and clank, Days Gone, Sackboy, Gran Turismo 7 just throwing those in there as well :)

Ohhh i see the whole list now 😯"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,[deleted]
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Man, I wish PS would release a PS5 version of Bloodbourne and a PC version. I'd even just settle for a 60fps version too ... but unfortunately, we are stuck with a 30fps version that is showing its age in comparison to other FromSoft games (Elden Ring, Demon Souls etc.)"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,What about DBFZ
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,What i'd do for a new Sly or Jax game
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Returnal was honestly such a surprise joy for me. The vibe the game’s marketing images presented was so interesting, but I barely knew anything about the game, and going in mostly blind, it’s stuck with me as one of the most fun and interesting games I’ve played in a long time."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Lots of good memories and games yet to play!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"十年早いんだよ！(Jūnen hayainda yo!)

Never forget Virtua Fighter"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Wasn’t Last of Us pre-2013 on the PS3? And I think Returnal came out on multiple platforms too
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Infamous second son.
I remember sneaking onto my brother's new PS4 to experience that game, it was crazy fun from what I remember atleast."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Spider-Man 2
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I can’t wait for the GOW Amazon show!  The Norse mythology storyline is pretty good and I bet live-action Kratos will be portrayed by a pretty good actor.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Exactly why I moved on to PC. I love my Xbox but I'm tired of the disappointment.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,How can my answer be anything else BUT Bloodborne? What a master piece! Really hoping they can remaster for that sweet sweet 4k 60fps. =D
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,What's Returnal like? It's the only one there I don't own.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,How is Returnal? Is it space/horror? Action and fighting?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I’ve had people tell me that consoles don’t count as “gaming.” I guess they’re wrong.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Don't ask if they got  any more good games in that 10 years what you see infront of you is it.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Killzone and resistance need to be revived
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Was Returnal good?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Ahem…Days Gone
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,You forgot to put last of us 3 times and GTA V 10 times
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Death Stranding was Ight
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Damn, seeing them all like this… well done PlayStation.  Now… bring back Infamous!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,So um... when they porting horizon forbidden west to PC?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I've waited so long for a sequel to second sons/ the infamous universe.

I've lost hope."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,When I bought my ps4 in 2015 it came with the last of us but I have yet to play it. I played Horizon dawn and got close to the ending but never finished it and I have the new one that came with the ps5 which I haven't played yet. Bloodborne was free on PS plus but i didn't like it and couldn't pass the first level and quickly uninstalled😂 haven't played any of the rest on the list
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Returnal doesn’t belong in this list IMO
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Most of the games you listed aren't exclusives.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Just bangers
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"The best of PlayStation Studios was during the PS2 and PS3 days. Jak, Sly, Ratchet, Uncharted 1-3, TLoU, inFAMOUS where all big favorites of mine. Nowadays PS Studios just doesn't pull me in with their exclusives. Exception being the Insomniac games"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Some real bangers there. And Infamous Second Son.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,They should release Bloodborne for PC
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"How was returnal, anyone recommend?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Maybe it's time to pick up a used ps4!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,New Socom when?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,and most of them have the same camera angle
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ghosts and Bloodborne are my favourite of all them.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Only good games on here are the first 4 and maybe death stranding if we're being generous
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Oh how I wish Sony will make another Infamous game for the PS5 this time.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Infamous!!!!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bring them to PC and everyone is happy
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Ive played over half but not all. Someone who has played them all - rank'em

Edit: spelling"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Haven’t played a single one
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I need to finish Ghosts of Tsushima.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Metal gear phantom pain?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I'm jealous of the people who skipped the ps4 generation and hopped back in with PS5 and have all these games back to back.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,spider-man was amazing
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Rocket league, Fall guys, Resogun, etc. weren’t necessarily first party games, but they all debuted for “free” exclusively on PS Plus. Another reason why PS dominated last gen."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Man I’ve never heard of this infamous game until this post…but seems to get a lot of love?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Gravity Rush 1 and 2, no questions asked"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I have never played uncharted, is it worth a try from the first game?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"LOL, these games are SO OLD but a lot of fun.

Bloodborne was my favorite. A hoonter must hoont."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Dino Crisis, please"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"TLOU 1+2, UNCHARTED 1-4, God Of War, and Spider-Man PS4+MM are some of the best games I’ve ever played"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,masterpieces all of them
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I would love another infamous installment but I just didn’t care about Delson as much as I did Cole
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,What no Elden Ring?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Bloodborne needs a gaddamn remaster or remake, absolute disgrace this masterpiece hasn’t received the kind of polish it deserves for the PS5"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Well they can't all be winners lol. Love bloodborne tho
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,FF7R is the only reason to have a PS tho
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bring back classics like Onimusha/Dino Crisis/Jak and Daxter via a complete overhaul.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Is returnal any good??
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Can someone convince me about if Death stranding, Horizon Zero, and infamous are good?

I saw some of death stranding, it's Hideo Kojima walking sim but with lore

For infamous, i watched a playthrough and thought it was ok

And for Horizon Zero, I have both games but only tried Forbidden west and didn't like it"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Factions 2 plz
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Where is RDR2!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Second Son is the best game on this list.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Ok but Second Son sucked compared to the first 2. 

Wouldn’t be putting that one front-and-centre tbh"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Infamous, one of the few of that list i own, and is my first ever Platinum, so yeah"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Infamous should definitely have another instalment
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Am i right in stating that Death Stranding has the most mixed reviews out of all of these? I want to play it but every review makes it seem like a walking simulator with a hard-to-follow story.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,How is Gran Turismo not on here?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Now do the same for Xbox... Lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,So glad GoT is getting love
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,You'll have to update the list and take SIFU off. It isn't a Playstation exclusive and you're missing some of the bangers others have stated.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Anything like this for xbox?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05, I want more infamous
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I just got a playstation 4 like, 5 months ago and im JUST starting to play some of these games.


I may have started late but that just means the fun is JUST beginning!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,console exclusives
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,why did you replace it with ghost
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,RIP Gravity Rush and Team Ico
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bro I really want FromSoftware to port Bloodborne to the other platforms as that'll be an amazing day.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Where is Demon’s Souls?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I wonder what one for Xbox would look like. It would need to have Halo and Gears.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The first strand-type game 😍
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"There are 2 good games in that image...

Edit: and 4 in the list..."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Play-stay-shone
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Haven’t played 7, 8, 9 or 10. Which one should I start with?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Infamous and Death Stranding are really not that good (especially Death Stranding, goddamn this game can be horrendous sometimes), but everything else is pretty good. Sony yet again with the best new IP from the generation, Horizon for the PS4, Last of Us for the PS3, etc.. Sony, similar to Nintendo, have that ""pedigree"". Xbox desperately needs to reach that level, the really popular triple A. Halo and Gears of War became zombies, Forza is niched... I think Psychonauts is at this level, sadly the game is not really popular"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Feels good to be a PC user.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,😭 bloodborne. Pls give us bloodborne 2
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Honestly I think at this point I might just try to get a PC at some point, I think the only reason I stick to Xbox is because all my games i play and replay are on there but damn I've wanted to play all the PS exclusives because I play only single player games except Halo and Mario Kart"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"But Xbox got MORBIN TIME the game:

Redfall"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,All amazing games
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,2 are good
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bloodborne and its not even close
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,How are these exclusives when I can play 90% of them on PC?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"IDC what people say, I would take Death Stranding out for TLOU2. Death Stranding is a very niche kinda game, the only reason people didn’t like TLOU2 is cuz of the story."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I would do ANYTHING for a Bloodborne PC port/remake/remaster/SOMETHING!!!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Only one on here I haven't played is Returnal.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I was expecting to see TLOU 4 times
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Holy crap, I love inFamous! I played inFamous 2 on the PS3 and then inFamous: Second Son on PS4, really great games in my opinion."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"What’s an honest ranking for some one who’s never played any of these (but know about most gameplays/story etc)… or where to begin?

Too much repetitiveness bores me tho.."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ummm… where’s Ratchet and Clank? Or Gran Turismo? Sack boy? Astrobot? Until Dawn? Days Gone? The Last Guardian? Soooo many games and series not present here…
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Tough pick between Horizon Zero Dawn / Forbidden West and God of War 2018 / Ragnarok.

We've truly been blessed this past 10 years with exclusives and I couldn't be happier to be a PlayStation owner.

I also own a Switch and a XSX and the people over at r/XSX are screaming out for just any decent exclusives"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Being team Xbox this makes depressed
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Meanwhile over at Xbox Anthem and Redfall
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"And you left out tlou 2, well done. 👍"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,These aren't all exclusive though?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Xbox: rEdFaLL
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Why list 1 game for each year when you could just list all their amazing games from the past 10 years.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Man I finally got around to playing uncharted 4 and lost legacy and damn I had a good time from beginning to end in both
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Days gone is missing
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I hope Sony puts InFAMOUS, Ratchet & Clank, Bloodborne and Shadow of the Colossus on PC someday. I really want to play them on Steam man"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"This is just disgusting. Super fuckin flex, and I fuckin love it"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,This is depressing as an Xbox fan lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Where TF are God of War (2018), Gravity Rush, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart… there are a lot of missing greats here."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I'm hoping for an Ape Escape Remake/Remastered trilogy
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Where is Knack??
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I think Days gone deserve to be here too.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Now do xbox.... oh wait
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ratchet and Clank rift apart. I'm ßorry I just lived the series
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Meh...
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The only game i play on PS5 now is Bloodborne... I really need some new exciting games!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Show xbox in the same time 💀💀 The medium? Halo 5? 💀💀 Battletoads?? 💀
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Are there no good games coming out anytime soon? I keep seeing posts about how great the games were in previous gens. What about how great the games are expected to be that will be coming out.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"This is the thing that I like about PS titles, they always look so vibrant, hopeful, and interesting, while Xbox's titles look so grey, hopeless, and bleak..."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Does this mean nobody would care if cod was Xbox exclusive?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bloodborne and Ragnarok need to hurry the hell up on pc.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The last of us part 2 deserves its own banner!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I don't own a Playstation so I could be wrong with this observation, but are all of those 3rd person, single player, action/adventure games?

Sony sure has a lock on that market."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I really hope we get another inFamous game at some point
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Gravity rush clears most of these, personally, Id say it clears all of them, but that's a personal opinion."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Definitely The Last of Us and God of War Ragnarök
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I was hoping to see Xbox’s version lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Xbox: Anyways here’s Redfall
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Death stranding huh? Ok yeah that game is trash
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,GOT and Returnal the only missteps with Sony.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ghost Of Tsushima is the only one I actually finished and that’s more of my interest in the time period then actual gameplay. The interactive movie experience of these Sony exclusives just kills my enthusiasm. Glad they did well but gameplay is not up my alley with the lack of variety and control.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I regret buying an Xbox
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Regret like a mf letting go of my PS during a long period of nit gaming... missing out on amazing PS exclusives kills my soul 😭
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,bloodborne best
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Returnal is the only miss lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Where is my Days Gone? Its a great story
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Still wait for bloodborne, ghost of tsushima, god of war ragnarök and uncharted for the pc.."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,God I want infamous back. And a bloodbourne pc port. The day infamous comes back is the day I buy a ps5
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I miss infamous and I want PC ports
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,2019... Days Gone is better than Death Stranding. Change my mind.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Final Fantasy VII: Remake is my personal fav cant wait for Rebirth or a new Rebirth teaser. But yeah this list is impressive, Sony has built up quite the catalog."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,WHERE IS RATCHET AND CLANK?!?!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Haven't had an infamous title in a while dang
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Nothing but fucking bangers.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,10/10s
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I played non of them, cause adult live is hard and can’t afford any"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,No Gravity Rush...
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Oml I forgot about Bloodbourne. Legendary game
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ratchet and clank rift apart was a blast and a half
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"And Resistance! A Resistance 1 and 2 remake along the lines of the Demon’s Souls remake would be amazing. I’d accept 3, too."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I don't want a remaster; I want a new game in the series.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Suckerpunch has killed Infamous remaster/continuation IIRC
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I'd love to see a remake and port of the Infamous trilogy (why not all three games, come on Sony!)  

Also Wouldn't mind getting the first three Uncharted games on PC, The 4th is good, but... well where's the rest of the story?

Bloodborne as a port would be obvious, but Sony hates money.. 

And I say this as someone who owns all those games on their platforms, but getting them on Steam would be huge for both preservation and enjoyment."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I would settle for a 60fps mode
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Hell I'd like them to remaster all three Infamous games. I played second son again for the first time in a while and it DEFINITELY is showing its age gameplay wise
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I found Second Son on the PlayStation hits section of the PS Plus stuff and I decided to pick it up. I fucking love that game. I really wanna know what happened in the previous games, so yes please make that remake."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I'm just hoping for a Dino crisis remake
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,No.... We need a legend of dragoon remake first bro.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I absolutely LOVED the first 2 infamous games. I haven't bought a new game in a couple years cause they're so expensive now but I would buy a remaster at full price day one of Infamous
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I'm waiting for a legacy of kain amd a darkwatch remaster.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,You'll get a remake of The Last of Us Part 2... AND YOU WILL LIKE IT!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"As somebody who absolutely loves Bloodborne I don't understand why people want a remaster at all. The graphics of Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 hold up just fine to where I don't think a remaster would be that noticeably different, and I never had technical issues with frames or anything.

If they were going to do a total graphical update Demon Souls style I'd much rather Dark Souls 1 (I know it got a ""remaster"" but the graphics are still pretty ass) to get the update, hell as much as people shit on the game Dark Souls 2 has some of the most stunning scenery which would be absolutely glorious if it had the kind of treatment Demon Souls got."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,No joke. One of the most satisfying combat systems in gaming if you can master it.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It's one of those strange games where like 70% of people who played it are like ""this is one of the most incredible games I've ever played"" and then the other 30% are like ""this game is so over hyped Idk what everyone else is talking about it was mid""


I think it just does 3-4 things incredibly well, so if those things are thing you happen to really value in video games, it's amazing, but if not you just don't see the appeal. 


Personally, I have almost 300 hours in it and it's genuinely my favorite single player game in the last decade at least."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Beautiful game, super satisfying combat. Which ending?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Man with Sony releasing so many games on PC that's the one I'm most anticipating coming to PC hopefully soon.  

I really hope the disaster of the Last of Us launched didn't ruin the chance of that."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I really hope they release it on PC soon. I can't justify the money for a new console when I hardly play games anymore.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,1/2 way through. Finally bought a ps5.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I really wanted to check it out but various reviews criticized it for repetitiveness. Go here, liberate a village, go there, do something else, etc. Repetitive in the same way as recent Far Cry games. Did you feel that way at all or was it a pretty good experience the whole way?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Now try Legends. I put like 70% of my whole GoT time in Legends and I platinumed the campaign.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I do too, but that isn't a PlayStation exclusive series"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Activision has the ip hostage. For Prototype 3 to happen Microsoft would need to complete the acquisition
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I felt this.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"You know, I haven't seen people talk about Second Son. I've heard talk about the others, but for some reason SS just didn't have the same impact"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Same. Word through the grapevine is we may be in luck.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Me too. Loved all those games.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,KNACK BAYBEEEEEEE
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Here comes the money
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Gex is also underrated
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Knack 2 is actually a great game lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,A knackstapiece!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,At least people like you who know about the games other than me exist so there is still hope ;(
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Do you need to play gravity rush 1 to follow 2?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"What I'd give for a third on PS5...

GR, GR:R, and GR2 were all just an amazing time flying around, exploring, listening to the music. Man I love those games."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I honestly feel like the games have a lot of weaknesses but I love them anyway
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Yeah. I played through GR1 and GR2 right before the latter had its servers axed. One of the few times I used the PS4's community thingy (to help people with dusty tokens).  Both were flawed but really charming and fun games. I've been holding off on a PS5 but if GR3 was somehow announced and a thing I'd go buy one today.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"The only game in this list that I actually want and hasn't come to PC, yet..."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,the only word that needs to be said here
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,On PC already pls
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,They’re concentrating on killing Halo
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Redfall is just such an anemic game. Sony’s latest is God of War and Nintendo is set to release tears of the kingdom. Redfall does not look good with that competition.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Xbox has been fumbling the bag HARD. Halo Infinite was super promising, but it didn't launch with enough and couldn't get the content flow needed to let it be a truly great."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Xbox isn't really about exclusives anymore, it's now a Xbox *and* pc thing"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,[deleted]
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I’d actually argue that Nintendo makes better exclusives all together
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Although not a complete exclusive I’ve Comtemplated buying an Xbox just to play hifi rush and high on life
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I really wish microsoft would make it harder for me to choose a console.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The largest multiplayer games probably makes more money than all these combined though.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Microsoft understands it. They’re not dumb. They just don’t care enough to adapt to it. Instead, they are focusing efforts on expansion and acquisition  rather than invest in their own brand to increase the quality of Xbox titles. I’ve been an XB owner since the original and long for the days of an exciting console launch with a sizable library of new (completely working) games to push the hardware to its limit."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I mean technically Death Stranding in an online game..
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Isn't Sony working on multiple online games?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Seems like Playstation is playing all their bets on live service going forward. They’re touting what? 12 live service games in development already?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"You mean like Fallout 76 and Metal Gear Survive? 

Maybe they should just make good games, whether they're multiplayer or not."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"With GoWR there and Spider-Man in the same year, it makes sense that SM got the nod."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Fucking died so many times, but couldn’t stop playing it."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Returnal has some of the tightest most frustrating gameplay I’ve ever experienced. The game rocks though.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I legit can't stop playing it. its so addicting.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I'm playing it now and was going to comment that I was glad it was on this list. 
It's so much better than the attention it got. 

I'm getting my ass handed to me, but it's good at not feeling repetitive. 

Every run is different."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"best example of a game starting you as low as dirt then by the mid to end game you are a freaking pro gamer with twitch skills and get MAD at yourself for being hit ONCE lol

I love this game"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"The roguelike aspects of it probably make it a niche game. I love the story, but with how punishing it is to fail, I finally gave up after reaching the last area of second chapter and dying to the boss. It took me a solid 3 days to beat the first chapter."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"If it wasn't a Roguelike I think it would be incredible. Having to replay a bunch of shit for hours to get back to where you died is just too much, especially with how little progression is made each run."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It is yes… very much so.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I did too though Second Son was on the short side and didn't offer much on the campaign side of things from what I remembered.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Sucker Punch has created a pattern of creating iconic Playstation franchises, taking them to a point of where they've done what they think is interesting or exciting with it, and then switching gears to something drastically new. First Sly Cooper, then Infamous, and now Ghost of Tsushima which I feel is incredibly likely to have a sequel announced within the next year. And after one or two more games following the world of Jin Sakai, I wouldn't be surprised to see them move onto something completely different."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Rift apart was a fantastic game!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It really doesn't need a remake, we need a sequel"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,0% complete
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I found that funny too. Here's a post about discussing PlayStation exclusives and a lot of the comments are just ""Here's why Xbox is bad..."""
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Only one game a year
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Our friend Aloy is still on the list! 😎
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"No need to cry, friend.  It's a phenomenal game."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It’s on the written list in the description. I could never miss it!😎😍
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It had a good concept.  It just the heart wasn't there.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Sad Aloy noises
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"There was a leak about two years ago where many stuff leaked turned out to be correct, Ghost of Tsushima on PC was part of the leak, so I guess it’s a matter of time before they confirm it, likely around the movie’s release"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I've recently tried the PS Cloud Streaming that has Ghost of Tsushima on it (including many other games) and it runs very well on PC with an Internet connection of at least 25 Mbps.

If you want to play the game now and don't want to wait for the PC port, I can recommend getting the PS Cloud Streaming for a month or so. It's about $18"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Nah, just a 'content creator', probably trying to get some people to follow him or something. Whether that's better, I'll leave it up to you."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It’s one of my most favorite games of all time. I gotta tell you it’s different, it may not be for everyone, but if you’re willing to try it and be open to it, you’re gonna love it. It does so many things right"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Xbox and PC player here, we've barely got any good games that are Xbox Exclusive. Sucks!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"The first two Infamous games were great and I would give anything for a remake of them finally. Second son wasn't bad, but it wasn't as memorable for me. Never played the fourth one they dropped, and if they dropped any more I haven't heard of them."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Yes, I just finished the game and it was such a great experience, the plot, the combat, all great.. The game is a bit difficult tho"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"IMO Its story and atmosphere are great but if you've ever played an actually good rogue like with loads of builds and variety in the combat and enemies then it will disappoint you. Starting new runs should be exciting, an opportunity to try new things but it quickly becomes dull as theres little new to try or see."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"It's hard, so it doesn't have as broad of an appeal as some of the others.  But it's definitely a great console exclusive."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Returnal is burned into my brain. Amazing gameplay and amazing story.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Absolutely. It's really hard to put down.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It’s fucking fantastic. One of my favorite games ever. Extremely difficult but so tight gameplay wise and so well done that you power through and get better.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Yes. It’s an exceptionally great game
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Yeah, I wish BB is in PC right now."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,That's because it literally is a mail delivery simulator
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"It's a AAA mail delivery simulator + management game with an amazing story and setting. If you are into those type of games it's the best thing since sliced bread, if you are not it's just boring as fuck. Depends on the person, there are loads of people that love playing job simulators, I'm just not one of them."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I actually love it, literally currently playing it. But I can also 100% understand that this isn’t for everyone lol."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"It really hit a it’s stride a few hours in(wanna say5-6), but it definitely wasn’t for everyone"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,[deleted]
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"For me, Death Stranding was a fantastic exploration game. I’m always excited about what might be over the next hill.

And then building the highway system and zip line system so backtracking is a breeze was uber satisfying."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,It was hands down Game of its Year.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I loved Death Stranding, it’s basically an interactive movie."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,My most hyped game alongside Pragmata and Final Fantasy XVI! Can’t wait 🥂🙌🏼
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It was literally GOTY and they made a movie about it, it was hardly unappreciated lol

Edit: it also had a 93 metacritic score 

Edit2: apologies Overwatch won, which is bs but UC4 was nominated and amazing"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I mean the Gamepass is great, I play a lot of games I normally would never risk paying full price for. But we do miss out on absolute gold when you see these lists. Xbox exclusives pale in comparison. I sometimes borrow my brothers playstation just to play some of these they are that good."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Im. One of these ps3 mgs ppl
With my first salary as an adult"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It’s a story-driven action adventure rogue-like game with cosmic horror and psychological horror vibes.

The gameplay is challenging with no saving/checkpoints except for one mid game, so you die you repeat and the areas shuffle, so yeah it’s challenging and not for everyone. I had it on launch, played it for a while, hated it, left it for a month or so then came back and I grew to love it, finished it and platinumed it😝

So for me, I recommend it, but it depends on how much you’re familiar with the genre (I wasn’t. I didn’t even know rogue-like was a thing and went completely blind in the game, save for the announcement trailer) and how much you’re willing to tolerate/master it."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Preach! 🤘✊
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Even better
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I do, thanks!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I do, they're the best type"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Beacuse it pretty darn good I should think.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I would have thought Gran Turismo would be in here.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"The common thread between most shit ports is that they are current gen only, considering GOT is on last gen it should be fine"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Horizon's story and Aloy aren't really what interested me about the game. I really enjoyed the worldbuilding and I thought the combat was pretty fun, even if the crafting system it was built off of was pretty mid.

The Robo-Dinos definetly helped though"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"If that's what u got out of the game, then by all means, drop it. The story, concept and characters don't interest u- prob already a turn off. It would be to most thinking all that was boring.

Was great imo, has typical Ubisoft-like formula but the characters and robot apocalypse stuff got me excited. Unique compared to other post-apocalyptic or Ai robot genre things, lol. Plenty of games have crafting which is sometimes shoehorned into a game. Makes sense in this. The open world RPG repetitive back and forth has likely existed in most/all games like this since the 1st ever, typical, tbh

To be clear, some trends u see aren't nearly as bad as what we see right now (ahem; live service, battle pass, unfinished releases, post launch major patches..) 😔"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"How far did you get into the game? Because the farther you go, the more challenging the enemies get and the more specified and intentional your combat builds need to become. The game has some of the most unique weapons and combat of any game I’ve ever played and it becomes so rewarding when you take down these massive leviathan robots through your cunning and strategizing. 

Also the plot starts off pretty barebones at the beginning but it eventually becomes mind blowing, with some truly insane revelations about the world you’re in that make this product quite impressive."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Same conclusion when I tried Horizon, a terribly boring game that reminded me of the worst that Ubisoft can produce"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,More of a fan of pixel art farming simulators?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Have you considered not unplugging your console while it's in sleep mode...?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Bro you literally proved why console exclusives work, you bought a system for three games, you did what they wanted you to do"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,As a PC using console-hater I've seen Playstation fanboys shit on Xbox fanboys for like a decade and completely defend console exclusives.  So when Microsoft bought Bethesda it was so humorous to see all the PS kids start whining about it.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"They clowned on Xbox for bringing their games to PC, but when PlayStation does it they praise them.

They clown on Xbox for paid multiplayer access, when PlayStation does it it's praise-worthy even when they get hacked.

They clown on Xbox for supporting last gen hardware into this gen, but when PlayStation does it they don't say a word.

They clown on Xbox for the ""marketing term"" smart delivery, when Sony charges $10 for the same nobody cares.

It's honestly an integral part of that community to be a hypocrite at this point."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Exclusives really do suck. Now I just don't play the games that don't come onto the PC. Sucks for me, sucks for the studio trying to get their craft out there to gamers. At least there's more than enough to play. I got tired of buying consoles solely for a handful of games, only to let them collect dust afterwards, until a new generation comes out, so I can repeat the cycle again. I figured it was time to stop once the PS5 and X1X's came out. But funnily enough, I might actually have to thank scalpers for helping me out of this cycle, heh.

Though I think the exclusivity thing is slowly winding down a bit. Even Sony is putting more titles onto the PC, which I greatly appreciate."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Agree to some extent. When it's your own studio, fine, it makes sense that you don't want to spend resources developing for another platform.

When it's a third party studio and you pay them specifically to not go to other consoles, that's shitty as fuck. Like it was recently revealed Sony did with FFXVI

Wish it was more widely frowned upon."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ragnarok? It’s there. Or are you talking about Forbidden West? I prefer the original game tbh
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Yeah, the problem with Xbox is that their game are on PC too and run better on PS5 when multi platform. They really need Starfield to be incredible, but knowing Bethesda I don’t think it will save this generation for Xbox, especially with it beeing on PC too."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,🙌🏼🫡
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Grab one, my friend. There’s already a huge catalogue that you’re going to enjoy, many of which is on PlayStation Plus, if you don’t wanna get them all full priced, there’s also game trials and quite the amazing offers every now and then, and of course, a huge lineup ahead."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Honestly, I’m a PlayStation player since day one and I wanted to get an Xbox Series X to play Fable, Project Mara, Hellblade, Starfield and The Elder Scrolls VI, but I thought I’d wait because back in the day, I got an Xbox One to play Quantum Break and Ryse, and ended up not playing much on it after that, everything was on PS4 for me.

So in this generation, I’m just really hoping that they get it together and deliver superb experiences with those title. I can’t wait for Kojima’s Xbox project as much as I’m hyped for DS2😎"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Did you ...play Bloodborne???
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,There are some good ones on the list but I kinda feel you. A lot of the 'big hitters' back on PS4 that garnered praise from critics and friends didn't click with me.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Opinions is a crazy concept
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"PlayStation has had much more input in AAA gaming than any other platform out there, and claiming that they’re all the same shows how little you’ve seen of those games to make such judgement. I’m curious to know based on what metric are God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, The Last of Us, Returnal, Nioh or Final Fantasy VII are in any way the same or similar to your average Ubisoft game.

Is it the mere camera perspective? The fact that it’s action and adventure? Both of those are quite broad umbrella descriptions for games with a wide variety of genre.

If anything, it’s Bloodborne that looks two generations behind and recycled gameplay from every Souls game.

Also game development cycles take far more time and money than they did during the PS2 era and same for the price of each game, so don’t be surprised if there aren’t as many games, as there used to be, but even then, no other publisher is putting out as much original game that are both successful critically and commercially like PS Studios and the third party studios they collaborate with."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"THIS SO MUCH THIS. 

Idk how anyone enjoys PlayStation because they regurgitate the same game over and over again. Sure go ahead buy a ps5 if you enjoy playing different skins of Uncharted forever. 

Xbox has a ton of variety. Forza, flight sim, HiFi Rush, AOE, Halo, all different genres and wildly different experiences. 

I'll take Xbox over generic Sony any day."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"It definitely needed a little more depth, but I loved every bit of it still."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Bloodborne is surprising considering the FromSoft fanbase has been foaming at the mouth for a remake for years. I just wish we got a PC port for the base game.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"The thing is this formula works in terms of selling 10-20m copies for their big titles and it brings in people into the platform. Besides, with Gamepass on Xbox, most Xbox players feel far less incentivized to buy when they know a game is gonna end up on Gamepass, eventually.

That model doesn’t work for Sony given how much having the game on PlayStation benefits both hardware and software sales, not to mention pure full priced sales are needed to cover for the massive budget allocated for each game.

Nintendo for example relies on exclusives to sell their consoles, because there’s literally nothing motivating people to buy their consoles beside their exclusives.

Microsoft has Gamepass as a selling point, not much new AAA games but Gamepass itself is a selling point and it’s shared with PC/Cloud.

PlayStation has their exclusives and their performance and SSD instant loading times to sell.

You might see more PlayStation games going to PC, as they are now, especially the upcoming live service games, but to see them become multiplatform titles, I don’t think so, since that would not defeat the purpose of their existence, but also affects development to focus on more than one platform to optimize for, which requires extra time and budget."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Lets be real here sony dont get nintendo and xbox games too(dont start with games like minecraft that was acquired way later)

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,😅😅😅😅😅
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Absolutely ✊🏽
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,You can if you don’t ignore details that don’t meet your narrative.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I prefer Sony but Gamepass is such a good value if you have varied tastes in video games. There have been a handful of games released day 1 that are super fun that I wished I still had a Gamepass subscription.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,What’s considered trash games is totally subjective. I have friends who think bloodborne sucks. They wrong as hell but that’s opinions for ya lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Gamepass literally has exponentially more quality titles FOR NO EXTRA CHARGE than Sony has for their entire ps5 lineup. PLUS ps5 games cost $70. 

Idk how anyone considers PlayStation a good deal."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Yeah, The Last of Us is exactly like Death Stranding and Bloodborne and those are exact clones of Nioh, Horizon and Returnal, oh and Ratchet and Clank? Thats literally a reskin or Gran Turismo which in itself could very well be a clone of God of War.

They literally reskinned the same game over and over and ironically, many of them sold 10-20 million copies, and some 33 million.

Sounds like so many people couldn’t tell them apart and confused them enough to buy them over and over😅😅😅"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,“No multiplayer games cause I love them = pointless console” - 🤓
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Lol 😂
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"This wasn’t a competition. These games were made by PlayStation Studios or original IPs funded by Sony and made by third party devs that launched first and foremost on PS, and them going to PC doesn’t really take away anything from them. On the contrary, they help bring more people into the PlayStation universe."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,What do you mean “that’s it”?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It’s still better than the endless Halo, Forza and Gears game from Microsoft, I hope they really wake up next generation, or they will fall even more behind."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"The post says “PlayStation: The Last 10 Years”. It doesn’t say “The Eternal Exclusives of PlayStation”. These games are either developed by PlayStation Studios or in collaboration with third party studios where Sony paid for and published them, and there by owns the IP. 

Some of the games had permanent exclusivity and others have timed exclusivity. In either case, they remain a Sony IP released for PlayStation first and foremost."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It’s a Sony IP and it sold 10 million copies and got 119 game of the year awards, along with hundreds of others in many categories, and a sequel is coming exclusively to PS5. Of course I gotta include it😏"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,That why xbox is pushing gamepass they win by been your second choice with gamepass. Not everyone want 4 consoles to play games so they pick two or even just one MS will win long term.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"its okay, we have Bloodborne Kart"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Death Stranding is amazing. It’s not for everyone but it’s quite unique in terms of focusing on terrain and traversal being the main challenge.

As for other games, it depends on what genre you like: God of War 2018 and Ragnarök are amazing, Returnal is challenging, in a similar way to Demon’s Souls, Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West are fun open world games with a post apocalyptic sci-fi storyline.

There’s FFXVI coming in June, there’s also Uncharted, all of them are playable on PS4 and 5 so you can get Uncharted Nathan Drake Collection and Legacy of Thieves Collection and you got the whole series so far"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,These are only exclusives for playstation
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It’s an amazing game that I couldn’t in good conscience recommend to anybody.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Then you are in for an amazing journey! Haha
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Its there, 2nd image"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Someone has never heard of PS+
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Eh, I wouldn't say hundreds of high quality games, barley a hundred imo. Playstation also has ps plus, it's top tier being just $2 more than gamepass so not much more than gamepass. Also Xbox is starting to charge $70 for their games too."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Thankfully there are two different options for people to choose what suits them best. For me, I prefer those titles even though they’re expensive. I feel I get my money’s worth from them, and I’m happy that others have an option that suits them better."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"They’re all either first or third party exclusives. Either Sony owns the studio and developed the games in-house or XDev, the Sony studio that is responsible for collaborations with third party studios commissioned them and Sony paid and published them and thereby owning the IP."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"The fact that Horizon Zero Dawn is here and not Forbidden West and God of War Ragnarök is here and not God of War 2018 and The Last of Us is here and not Part II or Part I (the remake) is because I included each IP once and the rest is written beneath the post.

Maybe try to see people outside of the scope of the accusatory lenses."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Sony didnt buy these IPs to make them exclusive like MS is trying to do to
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Lol PSimps downvoting me.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,If UC4 is too long what games do you even play?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"That’s… well , if you get consoles for the UI, you do you."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,So what's a non mainstream console exclusive for an adventurous non boring gamer?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Only 4, please tell"

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Because Death Stranding is the best strand type game
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"How does the 2019 game of the year make the cut, did you really just ask that?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Apart from the fact that most of those games are too old Forspoken is both a bad game and not a Sony game.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Test for Covid because I think you might have lost your taste
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Lol what a terrible take.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"The game that won, 119 game of the year awards, yes. It is there on the list of IPs produced by Sony. What a shocker!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Not allowed to say you don’t like something huh?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"That what some of us want and enjoy, I avoid multiplayer games like the pluage."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Bro said ""Spider-who?"""
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Did you just pull a “Lady who???” On God of War?😝
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Nothing’s stopping them from investing in all the talented studios they bought
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,SkillUp gives a solid review of what Returnal is and what to expect.  It’s a good game.  It’s personally in park for what i I thought Control was in terms of quality of game.  I thought control was a very solid game and just behind Sekiro in GOTY
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I feel like Reddit tends to really sugar coat this game, actually. The gameplay is pretty smooth and fun, but the story is weak and the level and enemy designs aren’t that interesting in my opinion. I’d say it’s a solid 8/10 but I didn’t really think anything about it was mind blowing like a lot of other people seem to."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"It’s a rogue-like, so basically you start the game, you explore and fight, you die and repeat from the beginning and the areas get shuffled, you don’t keep anything but a few upgrades for the randomized weapons you get.

It has amazing action and challenge, beautiful world design and story-wise, it’s ambiguous and mentally twisted, almost like a hybrid between silent hill and Lovecraftian horror in terms of psychological horror"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,It's a third-person action-roguelite
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It’s not a first or third party PlayStation exclusive
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I have put many hours in death stranding, the whole good aspect for f it really depends on the person playing. I found it to tickle my fancy as far as how the traversal is done. Many will say it's bad but haven't got past the 2 hr mark. It doesn't really pick up until a little later and even then it can feel more tedious than it's worth to some people. I enjoy it for the satisfaction and I thought the story was interesting even though it's confusing as hell."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I wish they give us a new one, yes. Perhaps after Ghost of Tsushima 2. I just hope they find a unique way to execute it, because as good as the three games were, there was something missing, not sure what it was, but sometimes it felt repetitive and thematically, it felt like it couldn’t tell whether it wants to be dark and brutal or fun and lighthearted, especially the third game."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It’s an amazing game if you’re willing to try a new type of gameplay. I loved the fact that it made traversal as the main challenge, instead of combat or bosses. It was a different genre of open world.

I guess it depends on what you’re into"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,How can we not love it? It’s amazing!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Replace what?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The only games worth a damn on this list are Bloodborne and Death Stranding. The Nioh games are good too if you're into that sort of thing. Pretty much everything else is bog-standard open world action game or third person shooter
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I’d kill for resistance 1 & 2 remaster
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"R:FOM was lost as a launch title for a console that no one had at the time (PS3). It’s sad, because the multiplayer gunplay was some of the best in the last 20 years imo. Fast paced, moderate TTK, kind of the gap between Apex and COD today. I would kill for an R:FOM remake."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I’d play the shit out of a Resistance remake.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Resistance was fantastic. I don’t understand why they killed that series.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I want a reboot of the Resistance series. Start out as your typical WWII game fighting Nazis, then just alien invasion out of nowhere."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Resistance 2 is in my top 5 favorite games all time. God I miss that game.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,First ever game I played on PS3… brings back some memories
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"DUDE! I have been saying this for years Resistance needs to come back in a big way, the multi player was fun as hell but the Co-op was even better !"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I loved those games so much!!!!!!!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I got my PS3 ata  late time so I never got to play the resistance games, I played a bit of one by a friends house and I enjoyed it. So I would like to get those three games remastered."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Is it too much to ask for both?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,A new bloodborne/remaster would be enough for me to buy a PS5. Bloodborne and demons souls are the only two “souls” games I haven’t played because they’re locked to Sony
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Not my first reaction, but the more I think about it the more I agree. I’d love to see a new game in this series."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Man I would do anything for an infamous 1/2 remaster
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"All we know is that Suckerpunch is not working on an Infamous or Sly title but Sony owns Suckerpunch so they could for example but Bluepoint on that project if they wanted. 

Still as much as I want it I can't deny the prospects don't look great."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"How? I've never heard about that, I wanna read on it."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I wouldn't hate that either but I'm mostly excited on getting a library that moves forward. PS6 will almost certainly have BC for 5 and 4 and BC for 1-3 just seems to not be on the table so remasters for the best titles at high quality is a nice alternative. Infamous 2nd Sun can still be played on the modern gen but I have to dig out my PS3 if I want Infamous 1-2.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Infamous 2 is generally considered the best of the 3 titles too. And Infamous 1 blindsides almost everyone with its superbly excellent ending. They really do deserve an update.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Bloodborne is a masterpiece but that doesn't mean its without flaw. Its glaring especially after Elden Ring. 

The artistic style is fantastic but the actual modeling and resolution are pretty dated and neither is its frame rate good. Even creating a 1-1 replication that simply has higher quality textures, higher resolution, and 60FPS would be an enormous improvement that the title 100% deserves. However I'd argue they should go farther. 

The character creator is genuinely awful. Taking the system used in Demon Souls and implementing it here would massively improve the creation experience for people who want to make good looking characters without taking anything away from anyone. 

Bloodborne lamps act as a 1 way travel point that only goes to the Hunters dream this mechanic could be updated to reflect how the system works in later releases allowing for point to point travel and greatly simplify the tombstone system. 

They could even go so far as to add unique visceral animations for each weapon like they did in Demon Souls and improve the existing animations and effects (like blood splattering) to better reflect modern capabilities while remaining completely faithful to the original. 

There are many of these tiny Quality of Life changes they could make that would make the title really spectacular and they could port it to PC as well though ideally without all the performance and breaking issues recent ports have had. 

The reason why the other titles are off the table is because they aren't owned by Sony. They would require other companies to get involved for a remake/remaster. Not impossible but I think its less likely. Sony seems to be pretty big on remakes."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,i just want it in 60fps on pc
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I’m sorry but as someone who just went thru the souls games it’s very jarring trying to play blood borne at 30fps. 60fps version is the least I want. Yeah ds3 holds beautifully.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"By the end you have all these awesome ghost moves, but I was having way too much fun just walking into an enemy area playing my storm flute and then fighting everyone head on while the storm rages. The combat is perfect. Just a beautifully atmospheric, amazing, fun game."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,If you play on Lethal+ it gets even more intense. Perfect parry or dodge followed by a one hit kill. On the flipside Jin is dead after 3 hits. It's a ride on the razor blade.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Gotta play Sekiro. After Sekiro even hard on Tsushima was just too easy for me
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,They must have upgraded GOT. I quit playing halfway through and went back to Nioh because the combat system there was sooooooooo much more satisfying to me.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Seriously, pretty much every melee combat system I’ve played since GoT has felt clunky as hell in comparison. I could see how Sekiro might be better but it just never fully clicked for me, probably about time to try again lol."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I still don't even fully know why I loved the game so much, I'm generally bored with open world games with tons of repetetive side quests etc. Tsushima still has that pretty generic structure, but still I was compelled to platinum it, which I almost never want to do with a game."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I love the game because it delivered as stated and shown from day 1...
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I hate to be one of those 30% but I found the open world so incredibly boring. It’s stunning once you first see it, but that’s it. Give me Witcher any day over this"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"   
SPOILERS:





>!i killed shimura!<"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"To be fair they don’t care how well it was received by the player base, just how much it was consumed. and it sold like hotcakes. there’s hope!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Honestly I'd buy it again to play on my deck.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"As a very very picky gamer: you're missing out. I sunk well over 100 hours into that game and then they dropped this additional game type which was ACTUALLY A WHOLE NEW GAME! As in, it was a completely additional game type totally unlike the main game. It was legitimately like being gifted a totally free game on top of the game you already purchased. AND IT'S A BLAST. 

The reviews who poo pooed this game should really really be ignored."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I kinda wish I had just concentrated on the main quest instead of going after every little side quest, I quit the game half way due to the repetition. Beautiful game though and the fighting system feels good."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05," I did every village and did every side quest and while the story was good, I got super burnt out right before the end of the game because every village was the same after awhile. IMO it was a great game but I wish I didn’t want to leave no stone unturned. If I were to do it again, I would just do villages that are on the way to my destination instead of all of them"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It very much fits the ubisoft collectable grind set of having 29 different collectibles in addition to ""base"" clearing, etc. The presentation is phenomenal, but there is no denying that the gameplay does get stale after a while. Luckily, the game tries a lot to keep you engaged by giving you so many different ninja tools that you can play 5 different bases with a different playstyle if you wanted."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I felt it was good the whole way. I think people who criticized it for repetitiveness didn’t delve enough into side quests, explore technique points and the combat system, etc. It’s certainly a full game, with a massive map and lots to do. If you’re finding yourself repeating a lot of the same steps in the main story, my advice is to step back and go do something else in the game, as there’s really a lot of opportunities for what to do on your path."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"On the surface, it is a open-world crafting stealty sandboxy game like a lot of others, but it's polished to such a mirror shine you almost don't notice. It's an incredibly beautiful and engaging game, with more heart and soul than most than I've seen in the previous decade. While it *can* get a little repetitive if you play it for long stretches at a time, but Naughty Dog made a very strong effort to make each location feel at least somewhat unique, with little stories peppered here and there to give you ""episodes"" to focus on while you progress through the main story. There's enough to do to keep you interested without feeling overwhelmed. The way I've always described it is Breath of the Wild meets Red Dead Redemption, with a side of Assassin's Creed, and directed by Akira Kurosawa. If you think you'd like that kind of game ***AT ALL***, you owe it to yourself to at least try. Maybe see if a friend has a copy you can borrow so you can try it out?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I say its like a really good burger. Its not really that unique and you can find others doing the same thing everywhere, but what it does do, it does better than most.

I thought it was a good game. Fun, but not the masterpiece I see people touting it as."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Because It has a lighter vibe which kinda kills One of the best points of infamous.

It's mad fun to play and it's still so fucking stunning to look at, but people associate infamous with darker themes i think which made the game feel a bit too lighthearted.

Plus, i think the whole ""different Powers"" is really cool visually but feels a bit flat when you realise that there is Little difference (still mad you don't have a concrete ultimate btw)."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I liked the Infamous series, but I always preferred Prototype over it.

From what I recall, the first game was fun but a lot of stuff was copy/pasted and enemies could hit you off-map - not to mention there were like 500 collectable and if you didn't follow a guide you'd be pinging constantly and it was a real bitch to find. I remember really hating that.

the second game, you lose your powers to the big bad and the story is 'gaining new power to defeat him' but at the end of the game, you...had the same powers? or something lol

Second son I remember less of, so I guess it didn't leave as much of an impact. I cannot remember the story at all but it was fun (and wasn't there a DLC with a purple chick or something?)"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Found Dunkey's reddit account.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Loved gravity rush. Was the main reason I got a Vita.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Still playing on the vita. Love it.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,You definitely should. 2 tries to quickly introduce you but without knowledge of first game it fails. Those are story driven games and second one directly builds on what first did. And they were suppose to be one game in begining but in developement they were split into 2
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Same, except I'm also a little bit interested in TLoU, and I'm not sure we can really say that came to PC."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,If you said to me during the 360 era that this is the best halo will ever be again I’d have probably argued the fact. I’d say the same for gears of war
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,And releasing whatever the fuck redfall is

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I'm playing through infinite right now and really enjoying it, but comparing it to Halo 3 is just... sad. I miss classic halo. At least playing Halo 3 online in the master chief collection is still a blast!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,You would think it has to be on purpose at this point. All they had to do was not change anything and it would have remained popular. Publishers and developers for some reason think that change is always good. Why is Counter-Strike the largest eSport title in the world despite not changing 1999?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Everyone's been looking for a ""Halo killer"" for the last 20 years but it turns out the Halo killer was Halo"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Halo's available on pc now too, so arguably their best exclusive isn't exclusive anymore 😅"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"While Halo infinite wasn’t as good as it should be, it was still decent overall. It’s difficult to make a good fps these days.

There’s a reason Sony hasn’t had a single fps exclusive since Killzone Shadow Fall a decade ago (which sucked)"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I think we watched the same youtube video
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"And Sony is about to get Final Fantasy XVI as well. Sony has bangers almost every couple of months.


Edit: lot of people in the responses seem to think that I think SE and Final Fantasy are Playstation or Sony properties so let me be clear; 

I know they're not. SE is not owned by Sony, Sony doesn't own Final Fantasy. XVI however is still an exclusive coming to PS5 in about a month from now. It's a game that Sony is also putting a lot of effort, hell they released a 45 minute State of Play dedicated to this game. If it's not one of their heavy hitters from their own studios they also have massive 3rd party games that are exclusive to their own console and that's a win for them."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Xbox is set to release Starfield this year but I have my skepticism. If it turns out good, it could be one of the biggest games this decade, not even just this year."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Tbh I loved gow 2018 but I was very underwhelmed by ragnarok. I don’t like the direction they’re going with the tone of the series
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I liked Infinite well enough, my gripe is Xbox has all that money and doesn’t use it to create a new original IP that doesn’t flop on release. The cycle right now for Xbox is Old IP for money -> new idea that flops -> old IP for money."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"It depends on what you look for in a game.  Fun gameplay mechanics, Nintendo has that easily, but I would say Sony has the better Stories."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Nintendo makes fun games

Sony makes interactive movies"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,There's a few points where High on Life is legitimately funny but I think I was entertained most by the fact that the developers and Red Letter Media put an entire movie and commentary track in the game that you can sit in a theater and watch with them as they do the commentary Mystery Science Theater 3000 style
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,With all the money and talent they got you’d think there would be some temptation right? All I’m seeing is old IPs and scuffed releases. I have a PC and I’m still more excited for PS drops.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"But multiplayer games don't sell consoles as much. These exclusives aren't trying to just sell themselves  they're trying to sell consoles too. And judging by how many PS5s are being sold, I'd say they're doing a good job at it."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,[deleted]
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,">That people actually want

No one wanted them to parade around metal gears corpse after they kicked out Kojima"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Fair argument, fair argument. counterpoint.  10 years later and people are still talking about Mass Effect 3's multiplayer.  16 years in people still play Halo 3 over later Halos, despite its broken net code.  

You make a good game and a good multiplayer and people will still love it even a decade later."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Just bugs me that the second GOW is on there but then the first The Last of Us. Kinda inconsistent.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Same! I hated the game because it was so hard that I ended up enjoying how hard and challenging it was lol. The combat is addicting and I eventually beat it lol
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Once you start unlocking weapon attributes and more consumables, and most importantly game knowledge, it becomes pretty easy. Pylon Driver with Web is basically cheating."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Completely agree. I made it to the first boss, died. Then took another hour to even find the fucking boss again, died. I haven’t played it since. I don’t think roguelike games are for me."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I mean I wouldn't pass out on a story remake for Second Son. It was great and all but it wasn't memorable as the first two, ngl."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Have you been to the Xbox subreddit lately? Nobody hates Xbox more than them lol.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Grounded is a phenomenal game and, I think, was overlooked in the awards run. But it wasn’t a hit, despite being maybe the best survival game I’ve ever played. Hi-Fi Rush is a solid game too. All eyes were on Redfall though and it definitely failed so yeah, they’ve gotta nail Starfield or they’re in big trouble."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I'm curious why you would have both. Old physical xbox library, maybe? I've not touched my Xbox since I got PC."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I like my backwards capabilities.

I can play all my old games.  :]"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"you mean... after you BEAT the whole game?  Or you just got tired of dying in early levels?

How far did you get in the game?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,And it's still somehow amazing.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Just the fact that it can take a game that long to be engaging can really kill a title for some people. I need at least a good piece of cheese by 2 hours in or I'll go find another mousetrap.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Me too, I should probably get one of these PlayStation things."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I replayed it multiple times. Loved the good/bad, different options, endings/cutscenes. It deserves a proper PC release"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,hell yeah brotha
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Also don't forget, Microsoft can't buy Activision because exclusivity is bad, according to Sony."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"If Starfield isn't a well made game, I will for sure be buying a PlayStation."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"PS5 has everything you just mentioned...lol.

Even Microsoft has said they can't compete with Sony and Nintendo."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,At least they're in a playable state on launch day.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Exactly, this echo chamber is getting tiresome."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Ps+ is insane value too. Ps+ premium even more so.

It’s like people forget ps+ exists. I recently cancelled gamepass because i feel like ps+ is enough and i never use my xbox anyways"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,XBL has always been better than PSN.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Go play your redfall and halo infinite on gamepass
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Ps+ exists dude. It’s basically gamepass. It has an insanely good catalogue too

Literally every game listed here besides Ragnarok is free with a ps+ subscription right now"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Redfall is 70 😂😂😂

I used t defend gamepass but lack of exclusives is ridiculous. Might as well junp to the fanstastic PS plus extra and buy the occasional PS exclusive."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Playstation fans when sony releases another character action game with over the shoulder camera and rpg tree levelling system with tall grass stealth and puzzles that wouldn't even exist if the games had a decent jump buttkn 🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,that's for sure but licensing your first party ip to a different platform isn't ideal for your image... could you imagine Nintendo doing the same with Mario?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It's one of my all-time favorite games, thank you for including it.

Looking forward for the sequel and I'm also curious what is Hideo Kojima next game."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Even then, with so many PS exclusives being ported to PC, all you really need is a PC and a switch. That's me for the most part. If only bloodborne would be ported..."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Whoops! Got it, Mate."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The only one I'll be beating is the new god of war tbh. I'm just waiting until it comes to PC. I gave my PS4 away to family because I do not use it.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,PS+ only offers old dated games. Nothing new releases day 1 on it.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Ps plus is good except for the streaming only games, cause the streaming is awful."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,You are the reason we keep getting low effort broken $70 games.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Nioh is a Koei Tecmo game distributed outside Japan for PlayStation by Sony. They don't own the IP. It's exactly like saying Octopath Travelers is a Nintendo game.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I’m sorry, I wasn’t actually trying to accuse. I just noticed that and got a kick because I loved HZD, and was painfully disappointed by HFW. Wasn’t actually trying to cause any drama. If you’d like, I’ll gladly delete my original comment. 

Apologies again!"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,They’ve literally signed 10 year contracts saying they wouldn’t and Sony executives have been caught on hot mic saying they don’t really care about exclusive they just don’t want MS to get it
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"All kinda games, what games do you even play?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Return to the Obra Dinn
Outer Wilds
Subnautica"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Infamous Second Son, Bloodborne, Spider-Man, and Death Stranding. ISS and Spider-Man are on thin ice also."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Since when Deathstranding is 2019 game of the year????
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,God damn!
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Proof those awards mean absolute nothing.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,This and killzone
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I want more of the zombie town level from Resistance 2. Just more mobs. I went back and played it and definitely remember it being more intense than it was
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I had a PS3 at launch and my roommate and I played so much of that Co-op campaign. Man... now I want to play that again.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"R:FOM is still one of the best shooters I’ve ever played, and had one of the most interesting stories ever in a shooter. Never seen a series drop off so hard. Hell, imo even Resistance 2 was a big step down, and that one is still pretty universally liked."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The PvE Coop multiplayer was amazing Resistance 2
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Based on the responses here, the multiplayer would be packed and AMAZING."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Insomniac got to make Spider-Man. That’s probably what’s stoping anything now.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I'd argue yes. Development teams have finite resources, so it seems to me that to target a release date as soon as possible, it's best to focus on one or the other. Given that choice, I'd prefer something new."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I'd take quick and dirty ports at this point.

Infamous 1 & 2 at 60 fps 1080p for 20 smackers each on ps4/pc and BOOM! Wallets 40$ lighter."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,As much as I absolutely love the Infamous series what they did with Ghost of Tsushima was incredible and if Suckerpunch wants to leave Infamous behind to continue putting out new and interesting bangers I’m all for it. I love the remake era we are living in but I’d hate to see gaming get reduced to just tons of remakes a year with little to no new IPs or even sequels.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Suckerpunch tweeted something a few months ago saying they weren't working on it but weren't closed off to it or a sequel, just not in current works as they were focused on 2 unnamed other projects. No idea how to pull it up but I remember reading it."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Well said friend! BB is hands down my favorite game, but everything you mentioned would be a welcome improvement in my opinion. I personally think 60fps should be priority #1."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"FromSoft made the bonfires in DS2 go from point to point. In DS1, they were more limited with only select bonfires beign available, but its more flexible than BB. 

All lamps going just to The Hunter's dream was a stylistic choice. That's not a mistake. Maybe you don't like it, that's fine, but you're talking as though it was a mistake or that they didn't know better"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,It’s crazy you went on this tangent about it’s negatives but don’t bring up the most unanimous problems the game has which is the blood vial farming and the inability to respec. They don’t hurt the game overall but they are very annoying to deal with. I disagree with pretty much everything you said outside of the fps. The game is for sure a masterpiece and still the best game from software has made
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I’m playing it now and this comment hits so hard haha that’s basically how I play
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Yeah, I refused to use the dishonorable stealth tactics or cheap tricks. Just straight sword fighting. Always felt awesome to dispatch a huge group solely through regular combat. Felt like a Kurosawa flick."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,There you get the charm that has a chance to strike lightning… incredible
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-06,"As someone who knows nothing whatsoever about Ghost of Tsushima, that first sentence is about the best recommendation for a game that I've ever read. Sounds insane. If they port it to PC, I'll buy immediately. Currently only have a Switch and a Steam Deck."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,[deleted]
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Cannot recommend Sekiro enough, you should absolutely give it another try. My god, when it does click for you, it is absolutely unreal

I think I’m pretty good at games in general, but I have never gone from being _so bad_ at the beginning of a game to being so good by the end as I have in Sekiro. You can’t really grind your stats to make it easier, you just have to learn the system(s) and it is so rewarding when you start mastering everything

Hope you give it another shot someday 👍🏼"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Because the core gameplay is so damn satisfying - you really feel like the Ghost of Tsushima. I was excited about every Mongo encounter until the end. The fighting mechanics, animations, special skills, enemy telegraphing, etc are all spot on. When you die, you always know what you could’ve done better."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Yeah that's kinda my point haha. It just depends your priorities. I agree that the Witcher has a much more in depth open world, but it doesn't really matter to me because I just don't particularly enjoy the combat and core gameplay loop, and I'm not gonna sink that many hours in to a combat game where I don't enjoy the combat. 

GoT on the other hand has in my opinion the most fun melee combat I've ever played, so I don't mind some boring repetitive stuff in the open world because I literally have fun even just fighting some random patrol of enemies for the seven hundredth time. If that's not really a priority for you though I can totally understand being much less impressed."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,">!Personally I think sparing him is the most in character choice. You’re no longer playing by the samurai rules so letting him live makes sense and is a big fuck you to the samurai. And hopefully some day he comes around to your thinking!<

>!Killing him makes sense out of a mercy type deal since the whole honor and code thing means a lot to him. So there’s really not a wrong choice here.!<"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I also >!killed Shimura and I felt it was the kindest choice for him. At the end of the day he was still Jin's uncle and father figure and he loved him. To Shimura the samurai code was his entire life and he had grown too set in his ways. Killing him in battle kept his honour he so desperately needed. It was a harder choice for Jin personally, but it was a sacrifice I thought was appropriate. Plus also if you don't kill him he just commits seppuku anyway.!<"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"For real, there were so many possibilities for different powers to distinguish themselves, but they just didn't. I was really salty when the game launched but I've kinda come around on it since. It fell short, but Suckerpunch was going through a lot of growing pains as a company, and was expected to put out a launch title for the PS4. inFamous 2 was their first game with a focus on highly cinematic cutscenes, which they got help with from Naughty Dog. Then Second Son comes out and has incredible mocap in both cutscenes and gameplay, two of the biggest voice actors in the industry in leading roles, and a very well realized Seattle to explore. The gameplay suffered a bit, but I think they accomplished what they wanted to as a company, and the results show in Ghost of Tsushima, where the gameplay and presentation are both on point."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,What is it with this year and bad PC ports?  Seems like every major game coming out in the past year has had a terrible PC release.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Hasn't been the same since Gears 3.

Also the sweat really got to people."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Halo and GoW were the only Xbox exclusives I’ve ever really had an overt desire for. I thoroughly enjoyed them in my 360 days and never needed anything else
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,[deleted]
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"You mean deadfall, the game was DoA (that's dead on announcement for me)."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Almost every Playstation “exclusive” in this list is available on PC now.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Lmao. Yes, it was a solid point that was made"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"FF XVI isn't actually a Sony game though, they don't own Square."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Being a Bethesda game Starfield is likely to get a lot of free passes from critics and players alike even if it's bad.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I play games to play. Both have great exclusives, but Nintendo's focus and general vibe are much closer to what I want out of the hobby. Obviously that's just my opinion."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I gotta be honest I think Nintendo has it all. You look at Mario or Kirby or Splatoon for a fun gameplay mechanics without much story. Then at Fire Emblem or Xenoblade for huge stories, and really complex gameplay mechanics. Then maybe at Zelda as a middle ground with straightforward gameplay in it’s puzzles and combat and a lot of lore. 

I would say that Sony is like…min/maxing it. It’s why they have a companion tell you the answer to the puzzles and the story is roughly a dozen hours. I think they are trying to hit that Goldilocks zone with every game rather than specializing specific games for specific things."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I’m pretty sure even Jim Ryan said he wanted Sony exclusives to be this cinematic blockbuster experience
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"That is why TLOU worked so well as a show, the game was a somewhat interactive movie already so if you just remove what little control the player has you are left with a show."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I feel that MS (or at least this regime of stooges) has adopted the business philosophy of trying to control the market and trends rather than adapt to it. No one wanted online only games….not back in 2013 and not now in 2023. 

It’s like EA telling the community that we no longer wanted single player games. Then they release Fallen Order and it’s a hit. EA wanted to push live service and tell us what we wanted rather than listen to the community and deliver solid games."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"That xbone always online thing was the reason I switched back to playstation after the original xbox and the 360. Haven't owned an xbox in 10 years. I have two ps3s, four ps4s (they are excellent media stations for non-smart TVs) and one ps5 though."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,[deleted]
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I appreciate that when Xbox does something good, they praise it, when they fuck up, they call it out big time.

Definitely prefer that to the echo chamber seen elsewhere"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"There are literally no xbox fans left in those subs.

It's mostly the the same people that are in this thread.

I go to trueachievments to get xbox news and help with games."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I've considered getting an xbox for MLB the Show. Playing on the cloud on PC is tough with the lag.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"A console is just nice to turn on and go, and it’s hooked to a big screen tv."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Correct I have a big library of old 360 games as well as One and Series X games, plus I like to collect games too. I game on my console mainly and only really have a couple of sim racing games (with mods) on my PC.

Sometimes I can't be bothered to game on PC as strange as that sounds and just game on my console."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Plus, on my PC I can play games that aren't Xbox Exclusive for example Stray, Uncharted, God of War, etc. To me, it completely makes sense to have a PC as well as another console if you can afford it. I also have a Switch but in honesty it only really gets used when I'm travelling which is a rarity."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I have both as well and I think the Xbox ecosystem works great with both! I’m signed in no matter which platform I play on and love to play games on both. PC I can play some of my Xbox games on and gamepass games as well and I can play most of the PS games I want on Steam.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,100% agree with this. I came close to giving up on it and the only reason I didn’t was because it was a Kojima game and thought it’d get better eventually. I’m glad I stuck it out and love the game but understand it’s a big ask and it’s not for everyone.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I think it's relative to the total game length. 

A game like COD is only 6 hours and has maybe 10 mins of intro. 

A game like Death Stranding or MGSV is like 60-100 hours long and can have an 'intro' of 6-10 hours. Death Stranding specifically dedicates it's entire first area to teaching the player everything, and doesn't really even open up until a good 10 hours in for most people. 

Depends on the genre as well. There's a lot of interconnected systems in Kojima games, and they take their time to properly teach them to the player. Also, Japanese games just tend to have very long introductory sequences. Whereas western developers are much more likely to do the whole 'in media res' intro in an attempt to grab the players attention so they don't leave the game they just paid 90$ for in the first 5 mins."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"It’s a Bethesda game, it will be extremely buggy and  badly optimized at launch, and become a great game once PC modders get to grip with it, like Skyrim. Personally I’ll buy it on PC, since it will get mods to patch the bugs quicker."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Big fan of extra but premium is not worth it
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Playstation plus sucks. It's not even competing against gamepass value.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I'm surprised you're being downvoted. There's only so many games anyone can play and there's a ton of stuff on + that's awesome. Gamepass is better but + premium also has a lot of value in my opinion.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Yeah but you can use gamepass on PC too, which is actually incredible"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"There was a point when it was free to play PS3 online and Xbox you had to pay to even use Netflix, I'd argue it was tied even then because though Xbox's infrastructure was always better, you had to pay for it."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"Exactly, you cannot play anything new with your paid PS+ subscription."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Crazy how it’s still better than 99% of AAA projects nowadays, makes you think"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,That sounds more like Ubisoft games and less like Sony games.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"They didn’t license their IP to others. They collaborated with other studios to create a new IP owned by Sony, such as Death Stranding. It is a Hideo Kojima game paid for and published by Sony, and therefore Sony owns the IP but not the studio.

Now if they hire Ubisoft for example to do another The Last of Us game, that would be a different story, which is the scenario you mentioned."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Literally bought RDR2 yesterday for PC and that shits amazing.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Rich coming from the moron in full defence mode of MS & Redfall. Get outta here clown.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Low effort broken games? Lol. We’re not the ones getting iPad games on “the most powerful console in the world” and trying to buy others’ success to claim it to be our own. Stop projecting.

No dev worth a dime wants to make a AAA game for $1 a month service that barely makes its money back."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,Thanks for understanding🙏🏼 No hard feelings
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,That was only for COD. Activision make a lot more than COD. Microsoft have already started making all Zenimax games exclusive and other studios they acquired that had IPs that were on Playstation like Hellblade and The Outer Worlds
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Those are not console exclusives. Every one of those games are available on switch and Xbox.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"So ghosts, horizon, uncharted and God of war aren't good?"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"“Because somebody on the internet didn’t like the game, it means anyone who likes it and any institution that honors it is invalid”

Nice logic"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Oh my god yes. That honestly probably has a wider appeal than resistance. The killzone 3 multiplayer was elite
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Honestly I played the entire killzone franchise and I just don’t quite get the draw. 

I’d like to sit down and play it again as I’m approaching my 30’s and see if it hits differently. 
The last time I played it would be killzone 4 back in ‘13 and I just remember it being pseudo crisis/cod/blade runner."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Def Resistance and Killzone. Especially now when they need more mp games. Am I the only one who wishes for Warhawk to return though?
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,I think the Mass Effect approach is better. Release a remaster/remake to draw in those who missed the original and generate excitement for the new title released a few years later. Its hard to get excited for a title when its a sequel to a game that can't be played unless you have 17 year old hardware.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"They could do the remake to gauge interest in the project/ future projects, if ti does well release a new game using the same engine/ assets to reduce time cut corners for both the remake (i.e. script and story) and a new game."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Sony's been doing a good job at hitting that mark so far, most titles at least have a performance 60 FPS mode."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"So I genuinely forgot about the lack of respec since its not a feature I use anyways. I always plan my character to be perfect before I touch the controller so I never need to respec. But I do agree it would be a good addition to my list as a feature for people who don't want to replay the whole game to make tweaks. 

I disagree about vial farming though. Its part of the games identity the same way grass was to Demon Souls. Its only actually a nuisance if you are playing very poorly consistently and have absolutely zero motivation to look into any method at all of dealing with it."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Inability to respec can easily be addressed, but blood vial farming is just integral to the identity of the game, as annoying as it is. It’s the cost of making a healing item that you can have maxed out inventory from the beginning of the game and can be acquired while exploring, while every Dark Souls and Sekiro have the limited healing between check points."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"I must be a fucking weirdo but I kind of like blood vial farming.  I have diagnosed, legit OCD and something about trying to figure out the best places to farm vials, then optimizing a route/method to kill everything along the way.  It’s very satisfying to my weird compulsive lizard brain."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,That seems unlikely to change in a remaster
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"> unanimous problems

You are not using that word correctly."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I think blood vial and qs bullet farming does hurt the game. First thing I do is rush through blood starved beast to do the infinite blood echoes trick and just buy max vials/bullets. Really makes the game so much more enjoyable.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Farming is fine. Lots of games have it. The respec thing seems odd to worry about, the game is short and leveling happens quickly especially with echo farming so making a different character for each build isn’t as big a deal. 

Respeccing would be a cool option to have, but I disagree that it was any sort of major oversight."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Ngl nothing beats the satisfaction of an ideal bow shot to the head. Ghosts of Tsushima gave me so much dopamine
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Walk right in for a stand off every time.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Walk into camp wearing ronin armor dyed bright white. A basket on my head. Wait until the enemy attacks before you even draw your sword. Never offensive, always just using counters. 

That shit was so fucking satisfying."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"On top of the core gameplay being fun, which it is though felt like a slightly jankier sekiro, is the immersion. I was very rarely opening the menu, you can just sorta walk around and find everything. Birds leading you somewhere, the wind guiding you on your actual objective, smoke rising in the distance, a mass of fireflies, the arch ways to shrines, everything you found you could do so with the environment. 

Plus the little touches made the game for me, after a mission Jin is catching a quick nap on his horse. The haiku and hot springs were also neat and immersive ways to add exposition, bamboo strike was just good fun."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Fair comment! I completed it, but I was totally confused by people saying it was the best game ever and the open world was fantastic. The combat was definitely fun"
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,">!I agree completely, and I knew killing him kind of went against what Jin was doing, but at that point i was so fucking done with Shimura because he was willing and ready to kill his nephew because another dude told him to. I know their code is sacred, but the fact that he stayed so loyal to it was just maddening to me, and I was anticipating killing him ever since he imprisoned Jin.!<"

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I had a 360 then got the one x now the series x. I’m a casual gamer but honestly I have ended up buying a old PS4 as the games are just so much better on PS. I’m sure Gears have got a new company right? Post GoW3 it’s a bit meh. Xbox really need to do something as they’ve lost/losing casual gamers like me and honestly my series x is just a glorified blu ray player
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Exactly, never got into forza personally and let’s be Honest halo infinite and gears 5 weren’t even worth the gamepass subscription fee I paid to play them"

Both of those are narratives told in a very Eastern/anime style, which isn't appealing to everyone.

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"God no. Uncharted might be one of the worst game series around, Horizon feels like a game that was generated using a ""make a AAA video game"" template while filling in the blanks, Ghost is a game where the gameplay does nothing special and the story is at war with it, and GoW is the most tryhard ""we want to impress the cinema snobs but also fill our game with half-baked RPG mechanics"" shit I've ever seen."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,Resistance 2 multiplayer was amazing.  My friend and I use to play online split screen with up to 64 players I believe it was.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Killzone gets looked at through the strongest rose colored lenses of all time. It was a good FPS that lived smack dab in the era of peak FPSs.  It was a good game. We need to appreciate that some games can just be good and still have value. Not every game needs to be the best of all time to be memorable, or needs to be remade. Should call a spade a spade, but it tends to be over glorified."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Killzone 2's multiplayer was FPS sex incarnate. It was perfectly balanced, as all things should be. Plus the weapons felt and sounded amazing, the atmosphere was stunning and bleak, and the visuals were super advanced. 

If Killzone 3 hadn't gone more arcade with the gameplay and instead doubled down and said more of everything, it would have been my favorite game of all time no doubt, and i've always been an RPG's first kind of guy."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Holy shit nostalgia bomb at 2am Warhawk was dope, while I think resistance could be a rebooted IP I’d love another Warhawk game, thanks for the memories"

Both Metroid titles released on Switch are really, really good looking games. Obviously they don’t compare to recent AAA PlayStation releases. But what they accomplish on such gimped hardware is incredibly impressive. Metroid Prime Remaster in particular looks like way more than the Siwtch should be capable of and runs at a perfect 60 fps."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-04,"I'd agree, if not for the Draupnir Spear. That extra moveset pushes it ahead for me, possibly the sickest weapon I've used in any game."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Totally agree, would get a PC but I may be naive about it but they seem expensive ? I play very casually and the PS4 seems to be doing to job so far. Yup Xbox’s release have been shite, never particularly liked Halo either, last purchase was F1 but again that’s not an exclusive either. Only stuck with Xbox as I’ve purchased games digitally in the past"

They'll just never look as good as games on modern hardware."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"Really unique as well. I had a feeling they’d add a new weapon, but I didn’t know how they’d differentiate from the blades and axe. I was thinking Kratos would get Mjolnir but that would be too similar to the leviathan axe, the only difference being it’d be lightning instead of frost as the elemental damage. The spear is its own thing, the fact it infinitely copies itself is genius and gives the player way more choice."
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I feel this deeply. I was hesitant to use it at first because I love the BoC and Leviathan Axe so much. I'm glad I leaned into it after a but. So much fun to use.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,I love the gameplay of Rag but the story of the 2018 GoW is so much more enjoyable for me. The sequel feels like it was too long and yet too short at the same time. Not sure how to explain it properly but that’s how I feel.
137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,"The villain in Ragnarok puts it over the top for me. Until this thread I thought most people liked Ragnarok more. It's interesting to see. To each their own, both games rule."

137xz9b,2023-05-04,2023-05-05,The enemy launching mechanic the spear has is both super awesome and hilarious. I genuinely use all 3 weapons almost equally. That's not a small feat for a game to accomplish.

The expansion was mostly marketed as this wild west revenge story where a bunch of Fallen escaped from the prison of elders and killed Cayde 6, a fan favorite character. You do get that wild west scenario, get your revenge on Uldren Sov, the man who killed Cayde and after the credits roll, the game keeps going on with a second half. 

Turns out Uldren was manipulated by a magical wish Dragon that gave him visions that would tell him how to rescue his long lost sister. The dragon is locked away in a place called the Dreaming City which looks like a beautiful high fantasy place you would expect from a fantasy RPG. We're send to kill the dragon, do kill that dragon and upon its defeat a curse is unleashed that left the city in a 3 weeks long repeating time loop. Everyone is aware of the loop but can't get out of it.

You think you're going to die, but the energy of the missile mixed with the energy of the Alien technology around you combined to form a perfectly placed one-in-a-million wormhole that sucked you in and propels you 20 years into the future. 

Only it turns out you've actually been in the future the entire game and you were placed in a machine that was designed to repair your broken body and mind by having you relive events up to that point and the hallucinations were the machines attempts to fill in memory gaps that were too damaged to recover.

In hindsight, you see that there was foreshadowing, in fact in changes all of the previous scenes with ""Tyr."" Brok's death is also foreshadowed in hindsight with the reveal Sindri previously brought him back to life. However, we are told if Brok dies again, then he's dead for good. That is a huge red flag.

For something less mainstream, the big twist in Tale of the Abyss. Our main character Luke fon Fabre has no memories of his life before his kidnapped as a child and is set as being connected to some big destiny. Since only has seven years worth of memories, all of which are spent living as a shelter aristocrat, Luke has a lot of friction with the other main characters.

There has been a conflict with a group called the Six God Generals who are supposedly under the authority of Luke's mentor Van Grants, though Van says he has no real authority over them. >!During a fight with the God Generals, one of their ranks, a masked man Asch, Asch loses his mask and underneath it, he looks exactly like Luke.!<

>!The trust issues between Luke and the other main characters reach a boiling point with the mining town of Akzeriuth. It's clear that Van is up to something shady. Unfortunately, the other protagonists' trust issues with Luke keep them from coming forward with their concerns, resulting in Van tricking Luke. This causes the destruction of Akzeriuth.!<

>!After this, we learn that Luke is a replica of Asch, the original Luke fon Fabre. In this universe, there is a process of creating replicas called Fomicry. If you use it on a person, you get a physical replica, but none of their memories. The reason Luke did not have memories before he was kidnapped was because the memories didn't exist.!<"

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Gonna be controversial… Spoilers should be a given.

Out of my 200 hours that I dumped into Starfield… the ending, and slow realization that I was becoming basically the Hunter, was pretty fucking well done. That and the feeling of being able to start new after entering the unity and getting better and better armor (or power like the Hunter wanted) started off as me just wanting the best gear. And then about 6 speed runs through the unity later, I kinda was just like “What’s the point? All I’m doing is starting new for some more powerful armo- ohhhhhhhhh shit. I’m the hunter now.” Some people it probably clicked quicker. But I went through that initial playthrough, getting real cool with Barrett, and watching the Hunter kill him honestly gave me the most emotion out of a Bethesda game ever. And I was dead set on FUCK this Hunter dude. So then his slow reveal, and the pilgrim, and finding everything out was all pretty fucking cool, and then realizing that I kinda fell into the same pattern without the game explicitly saying it to me was also rad.

Starfield in my opinion gets a lot of hate for no reason. I think it was vastly misunderstood as Bethesda fans were expecting another standard BGS RPG, and space sim fans wanted a space sim and its neither of those things, landing somewhat in a awkward middle ground. But if you really invest into your playthrough, I found it to be the best story BGS has put out. I didn’t care for Skyrim, Fallout 3 had a okay story but good side quests, Fallout 4 story and side quests were shit. New Vegas was Obsidian. Oblivion and Morrowind I never played. Starfield easily takes the best story."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,Yeah TLoU2 would be my answer as well. The sheer balls it took to make that massive narrative turn and then to actually pull it off is just absolutely astounding.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,"For me, it has to be Pokemon Gold. Beat all the Johto region gym leaders, the Elite Four, et cetera - believed the game to be over - only to discover that the Kanto region was still awaiting me. 

That blew my mind back in the day."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I dont get the love for part 2. It was the most obvious thing they could have done. Played right in to just about every trope in the book. Very mid game thats been elevated because of the culture wars.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Last of us 2 “plot twist” didn’t surprise me at all. Maybe it’s because I played the games back to back and didn’t have a long wait to cloud my view. I knew that death was going to happen because what other option was there to happen narratively? After the big death that harkened at the end of 1, I figured there was no way something like that could just …pass over. Was a beautiful game"

The you're your own grandpa evil villain twist thing is never taken seriously. 

Youre the villain the whole time. So you have to die to end all the suffering in every loop.

To me, that says they wrote themselves into a corner and had to rip off Looper. 

Never before was I happy to receive 1/24th it's price a week later at gamestop.

God I love this game I have like 500 hours and I still haven’t bothered to platinum it."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I agree with the last of Us part 2. I started off hating the people that killed Joel, but by the end of the game I found myself completely siding with their group"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,None.  I have yet to see a video game with a well enough written story to give a shocking twist.

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,The Cloud and Zack twist in the ff7 mostly for the hints like Tifa letting Cloud tell the backstories and trying to draw his attention away from whatever topic that has his head hurt and Shinra employees not recognizing Cloud despite him being an ex first class soldier

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Agree with The Last Of Us Part II. Almost every cutscene had some jaw dropping event or death or revelation. Absolutely loved that game. 

My answer is the twist near the end of God Of War Ragnorok. I didn’t see it coming and was shook."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,TLOU2 definitely. The whole game is a emotional rollercoaster. In the end you feel sad for everyone.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,The ending was shocking but somehow what happens with Agro right before the final boss was even more so.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I played half the game and never finished. Can you spoil it for me ?
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I thought that was the least surprising. It was obvious something was off after getting consumed by the darkness after defeating the 1st colossus.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,This fucked me up so hard. Never saw it coming.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Yeah 100%, the whole story isnt the most complex thing,  but the whole idea of that story is cool but also scary at the same time lol"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Personally the nuke going off in 4 was my wtf moment. Like my whole character, just wiped out. Crawling nowhere in particular and just rolling over and dying. Wut. GG I GUESS!"

 ..Sucked at MP though, played it on PS3."

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,My dumb ass misread MW2 has ME2 and was wondering who the hell the ghost that Shepard yapped was.

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Still my favorite twist in gaming.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Absolutely the best imo. Even if you see it coming, it’s done so well that it’s hard not to argue for it."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Yea I know in retrospect there were hints but at the time I was not expecting a plot twist like that, even after playing their previous game Neverwinter Nights (which had a betrayal then redemption that was very well done whether you go good or evil)"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"This. I didn't put it together untill that recap video where they reveal it. Near the end I was like ""nooooo fucking way""

Mind blown"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I almost felt embarassed that I didn't see it coming. Its so obvious in hidsight. But I guess thats good writing if you can disguise so much foreshadowing so well.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"And Bioshock Infinite, while we’re on the subject."

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Such a fucking good twist.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Had this spoiled for me a week after the game came out and I was so pissed I didn’t play it for 15 years
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I was having a hard time with Bioshock up to this point - I knew the story was supposed to be good, but couldn't wrap my head around why the character would be blindly doing literally everything they're told. Twist was great."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Surprised this isn’t the top reply.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,This was “spoiled” for me by the time I got far enough in the game. I still think the scene and reveal was done excellently well

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Scrolling to far for this
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I still don't really understand why this is considered such a profound twist.

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,It was like something out of a movie.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"One of my all-time favorite trailers is LEGO Luke and Vader fighting and Vader chops off Luke's hand. Luke plugs it back in.

""Nobody ever does, Walker. >!*Three*...!<"

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"There’s no way to play this now, right?"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"What bothered me about this game was that it literally *forces* you to make a specific choice (you know the one) and then spends the rest of the game berating you for making it. 

All men are monsters, etc.. No MF you made me do this or I couldn't continue the game. There was no ""choice""."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"The Mass Effect Trilogy was amazing

First game had clunky gameplay, seeing as it was an old game, but it was An amazing intro into the Mass Effect universe

Second game, as a lot of other people say, is by far the best game for story and gameplay, and it definitely fleshed out some missing links in the first game

The third game, while it got some shit for doing some things different, I quite enjoyed it. Sure, it wasn't a satisfying ending to the trilogy, depending on what you chose, but it was quite fun to play."

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,Inside’s ending is fantastic!! I never expected the whole game to just be about trying to spend a nice day at the lake with your closest friends.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"As somebody who has had a troubled relationship with his brother post adolescence, I played through most of the game stoically, then absolutely fucking **burst** into tears at *that* part"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Fuck yes. I was wildly unprepared.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,I even said out loud: 'don't make me do this'... That ending sure came from an unexpected angle
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Absolutely. So fucking good. My friend and I just sat in silence and shock for that very last part of the game. Very few words were exchanged, what an unforgettable experience."

I snagged this game and shot him the buddy code for co op the Thursday night right after it came out and we stayed up all night playing. Neither of us had done that in years, we’re both in our 30s and have families and had to work early the next morning, we were up until like 4am playing.

He ended up becoming closer to me than family and this was a great way to kick things off. We still to this day have a rivalry from the ending of this game (I won, barely)"

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Then you realise during the boss fight that there's no health bar...

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Agreed. Watching those scenes play out and discovering the true fate of humanity was a truly unique experience for me. I was on the edge of my seat every time you learned more about the past. Fantastic game.

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"This ending was wild.

The game literally tells you, like, 4 separate times how the process of snapshots works. It explicitly *tells* you what is going to happen, you just don’t know how, and the juxtaposition of expectations makes you think “naw, ain’t no way.”

Then it actually happens, and you’re just like “what the *actual* fuck?”

The writing in this game blows my mind. I’ve always wanted to write a story with such powerful meaning, but this one is so intelligently constructed it actually intimidates me to write my own stories. It doesn’t hide anything from you, nor does it offend you.

It tells you what is going to happen, your natural existential denial basically opposes what reality is, *just* like the protagonist.

It’s honestly genius."

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"The ending was so harrowing, and that's on top of the many other twists throughout the game"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,What is soma?
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,"I can’t bring myself to play this game, existential horror terrifies the fuck outta me lol"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"If you haven’t played the sequel, Virtue’s Last Reward, the twist in that game that is much different but similarly earth shattering"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,the way it utilized the dual screen mechanic on the ds to deliver the twiat was so good. i love the zero escape games.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I gently opened the door…
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,After I >!deleted Monika from the game files!<I just sat staring at my computer screen genuinely just stunned at everything that happened. One of my favorite games of all time for me
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,aloof hat grab cagey punch waiting marry airport entertain fuel
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"The part where Arthur has a >!full on coughing fit, coughs up blood and has to be carried to the doctor!< was terrifying, a sense of nihilism and an immediate knowledge that Arthur isn't going to get a happy ending, even if everything went to plan."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"One of the worse things you can do is go into RDR2 expecting it to just be GTA but with cowboys, it’s something far richer than that."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"If you've played RDR1 though, you know it's not going to end well."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"That and what you discover on >!The Interloper!< were the two biggest moments where all of the puzzle pieces I had placed in my mind suddenly found a new arrangement.  Plus when you finally meet >!that one guy, you know who I'm talking about.!<"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Same for me. Its been a while since I played it but I think the thing that made my jaw drop was when i read that >!The Nonai couldn't actually make the sun go supernova by themselves. So I was left to figure out ""OK well then what the hell has been happening this whole game?""!<"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,This has gotta be everyone’s biggest theory while playing and hearing these reactions is always great
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I remember [Outer Wilds] >!expecting to find a Nomai when I saw that three masks were activated, I don't think I realized it was for the space station looking for the Eye until after I'd already found it.!<"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"You know what, Im gonna buy it rn. Everyone always says is so good, and your comment was the final straw."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I keep on repeating myself, but *damn* that game is an absolute gem, right along with its dlc"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,And it’s worth the wait.  Amazing goddamn game
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I was hoping to see this here. I played it last year and absolutely loved the ending. What a game.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Everything about Outer Wilds, really. For anyone reading, I know a lot of people like to treat their favorite game as some sort of sacred experience and tell you to go in completely blind or youll ruin it and theyre usually being a little dramatic. This is NOT one of those times. This game is an otherworldly, beautiful experience that only works at its fullest without spoilers or knowledge going in."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,It's really incredible how just a small moment reshapes so much of your understanding
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I hadn’t thought about it, but I guess that is what the notes you find about it are implying. You just don’t find out that it didn’t work until you’re there."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"It honestly blows my mind that a game as aggressively non-linear as Outer Wilds even *has* a plot twist, but yeah, that moment is devastating and completely recontextualizes everything else in the game."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Man by the time I got to that fight I was so over it and just wanted the game to end already. So when the camera turned on all I saw was a pissed off cubby women in the clouds. Never love hated a game more in my life.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I think it was kinda cool that the way to progress that game near the end was to NOT recharge the crystals. This is just moments before your character learns that the fey is evil, but there’s a lot of suspicious evidence that makes you wonder certain things.

I just remember sitting there thinking “what if I don’t do this what happens?” And was impressed when the story continued."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"The subtitle of the game even ""spoils"" the twist, but you'd only realize that after the fact.

>! ~~F~~Airy ~~F~~Lies!<"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I played that big battle in bed at night, so the ""camera turn"" was just a bunch of blackness.  Good times."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,"It's a great meta-joke, too. Bravely Default feels like an FF game just without the branding.  
What do you get if you remove 'FF' from the subtitle, ""Flying Fairy?"""
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Desmond? Who is Desmond?
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Aerith? Or the Lifestream?
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Surprised I had to scroll this far down to see it.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"As not only a RPG junkie but also gaming magazine addict when the game was new it was pretty much spoiled during the 2 or 3 month span between release and me getting the game for Christmas.   Still didn't feel like it ruined anything, just made me crave context."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I knew beforehand, because someone spoiled it, but the whole time I was watching for a tell that didn’t happen. I was a little disappointed by that."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"""Wtf?....wait....OH SHIT!!!!""

That was my exact reaction"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"The first half of the flood reveal mission was fantastic. The only enemies in the first half are terrified and cowering covenant and one marine driven mad with fear, then the trap is sprung, the last huddled covenant survivors are drawn out and slaughtered and master chief barely gets out."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,That Jenkins cutscene is such a core video game memory for me
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Also the fact the devs managed to keep the Flood a secret. No mention prior to release of the game, nothing in trailers, not even in the materials that came with the game. It must have been great moment for gamers to experience that."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Now you got a horror shooter oh yeah
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Yeah buddy!
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"It’s an absolute crime that this IP was abandoned. 

With how far modern melee combat systems have evolved in the last 19-20 years, BioWare could have all of my money for another game set in the JE universe."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I’m so glad you said it, Jade Empire was so good already and that twist made it better! I wish there had been more games."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I have never wanted to beat the shit out of a game character with a crowbar more than I do Ted Faro, even several years later"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I can't wait for the new one to come out.

I'm looking forward to seeing Max a bit more grown up."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"When you play a a game for 100+ hours to be hit with a customisation screen, don't know any other game to do this. Lots of the Warframe quests were amazing."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Was this newly added? I played Warframe around 10 years ago for like 80 hours until I got bored of it because the missions were repetitive and had no real plot/story that was being unlocked by the missons.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Ughhh my jaw dropped when that happened. I have yet to beat it since childhood but I finally picked it back up on an emulator. The furthest I’d been so far was the Kalas boss fight
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,"Man, that got me so hard. It was done so well, and I definitely never saw it coming. It was super clever, since you would never suspect him because you essentially play as him. No one would suspect their literal main character."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Wish 3 had continued that plotline. And been better in general.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,That's pretty much all kirby games tbh
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,First Kirby game?
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Before that was like, oh look, *another* Evangelion boss."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I thought it was a pretty elegant solution so they wouldn't have to marry themselves to an ending made by a different team like 15 years ago
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Such an underappreciated gem.  Probably the best narrative of any game I've played.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Kefka is my favorite. Textbook villain. Betrays his master, nut kicks the world, and acquires the power of a god just because he wanted to. And the best part is that when I first played it, I had no clue that twist was coming."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,You mean *Invisible War? Deus Ex* proper had a PS2 and Mac Port not one for OG XBOX
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Your daddy finally comes back from getting milk too
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Absolutely fantastic game. It was my first Tales game and still the best one I've played.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"it's crazy trying to explain ddlc to someone who wasn't there at the time.

Now this kind of thing is super common, but back then? It was truly shocking."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"This!

Kalas being the main character definitely help, but definitely didn't saw it coming."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"When I was in 9th grade, I told the kids at my lunch table that I was playing it. The game had just come out. 

One kid sitting by himself turned to me and said “>!Aeris dies!<” then turned back around and just kept eating."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I know it’s a seriously divisive game but I really appreciate the story they were trying to tell with that game: >!In the apocalypse there are no heroes or villains, just survivors.!<"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"In my top 5 games of all time but let's be real, the graphics didn't age well."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,The part where the radios start to jitter is the closest thing to an acid trip I’d experienced at the time. In a good way ofc
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,"""I'm scared, Sister..."" 

Let's all cry together."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I was gonna say this too! Also, not as much of a plot twist, but that characters death"

-points and laughs-"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Did you play it?

I mean, I get that everything's not for everyone, but it definitely wasn't ""the most obvious thing they could have done"".

>Very mid game thats been elevated because of the culture wars.

Lol"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Part 2 was a step down from part 1, but acting like it didn't have unexpected surprises is silly. The fact that the game ends up being almost twice as long because you switch main characters to the antagonist half way through was absolutely unexpected and it's silly to act otherwise. Up to that point, the game had already been pretty long and had a pretty ""complete"" story arc. Typical revenge plot, Ellie had worked her way through almost everybody who had wronged her, and there was only one person remaining.

I'm not going to say it was the greatest twist in gaming history, but Abby showing up at your safe house and shooting two main characters in the head, only for you to literally take control of Abby was definitely surprising to anybody who didn't pay attention to the leaks."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,That's how I felt about Part 1. Part 2 I liked a great deal more.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I'm with you. I saw the leak, instantly knew what Druckmann was going for, and checked out right then and there. I don't like that kind of manipulation in storytelling.

Specifically, introducing a new character, making their establishing moment an unexplained act of horrible violence against a protagonist, and then over the next several hours, basically scolding the player for having the reaction they were clearly trying to elicit."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,How the fuck was it mid? It's the same game as the first but with more stuff.

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,That shit was so sad. The end of The Last Guardian made me sad too.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Aaahh! Gave me flashbacks to artax and the swamp of sadness
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Agro survives, though :)"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,You find out that you're the baddie
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Child me cried when Ghost and Roach died 😭

Didn't see it coming and it fucked me up, still can't believe I cried to a CoD campaign"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Is a Michael Bay movie... in videogame format... about the invasion of America by Russian forces... Yeah that history is cool as f. Still between my fav games.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,That scene was even more terrifying in the remaster.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"RAMIREZ, GET TO THE TOP OF BURGER TOWN"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I sucked at MP but my friend was an absolute GOD. 

I ran what I called a ""support build"" with a Javelin and One Man Army so I could shoot down enemy air support, and a UAV and Counter UAV to help him as much as possible. 

I fully claim the assist on a large number of nukes."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,It still has my favorite kill animations in the series. So brutal and efficient.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,6It still a fun game you know.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"He made kind of a good point about Washington. He didn't have a very good track record at the time, and him being in charge of the army probably would have been a little worrisome if I didn't already know how things would turn out."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I was really dissapointed that we didnt continue playing as that guy.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,He also had one of the best voice actors in the franchise
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Ill stand on my opinion that Connor is one of the best AC protagonists, but all his best characterization is locked behind the homestead missions and side content whicu admittedly were kind of lacking in AC 3."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Jade Empire is criminally forgotten about. It's really good and a fun setting. Wish they would return to it.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Honestly, this one actually surprised me more than KOTOR. I had started to suspect something was up just before the twist in KOTOR, but the twist in Jade Empire just completely shocked me."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"BioWare used to be the M. Night Shayamalan of video games. Every game of theirs for a while had some jaw-dropping twist. Kotor, Jade Empire, Mass Effect…"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Omg I already posted but I scrolled to see if anyone else thought this. I loved Jade Empire and I agree with Runaway. Sadly forgotten
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,"Yeah what happened afterwards was an eye opener to me. Closed Fist playthrough was great though, no evil was too petty."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I was an adult in 2004 and while you definitely got the hints and it wasn't a shock to me ... it was still for me the best plot twist in gaming.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"My wife first played as an adult. I spent the entire time expecting her to figure it out. I kept thinking ""damn, this is way too obvious. How did I miss it?""

She was still floored. The hindsight makes a huge difference."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"It's because it plays with the meta elements of gaming. You are used to the idea that there are certain objectives that need to be completed before a game can progress. It's part of the structure of a game.

The twist is that you, as the player, are having to perform the commands from a *character* rather than the game medium. The game manipulates you into thinking that it is a design constraint rather than part of the story that you ust* perform the actions.

That's what makes it so phenomenally mind blowing."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"The voice acting is *extremely* instrumental in making the entire setup work, imo. Karl Hanover absolutely nails weaving the phrase into the character's dialect, so it sounds completely natural and you truly don't suspect a thing."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,It starts with the opening sequence - check out the Xmas gift
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I definitely expected a twist in Infinite, but I did not expect three of them. (And I also expect most people can only recall two of them...)"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Bioshook?
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Yeah apparently, it's supposed to take place in Antarctica. I'm.... cautious to get excited for it as Ken isn't involved, so I am more excited for Judas!"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,But without Bioshock creator Ken Levine who is developing the game Judas. That's what I'm really excited about.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Damn! Missed out on one of the greatest games ever!!!! (In my opinion)
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I think it's because the game hasn't aged *too* well. I played it for the first time a couple of years ago and I could see why it was pretty monumental when it came out, but at this point it's kind of just a half-decent shooter. 

Good game and probably deserves the love it receives from fans, but at this point I just don't think it has anything truly unique enough to warrant new fans getting totally hooked outside of the twist right at the end."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Oh noooo!!!! That's the worst!!!! :( I'm sorrry
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I actually just finished the game last night for the first time. I think it's an excellent twist within the context of a video game, it's a meta commentary on the mechanics of most games and the player's own expectations and sense of power. I don't think it's as strong if you only look at it from a narrative perspective, but as a video game plot twist, it's delightful. Very few pieces of media have been able to effectively destroy the 4th wall so violently yet subtly at the same time."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,them not having dialogue and using a photo to point at each other was peak cinema

Edit: spelling"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Playing it a second time is interesting and you feel a bit sheepish for not picking up on it sooner. 
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"The first firefight was out of their control. They were fired upon out of paranoia, and defended themselves. 


But that was their cue to about face, march past the storm wall and call in the cavalry. Everything after that never had to happen. "
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I mean.. Why would I think about a good ol' American cover-shooter like that? 
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"It's been delisted, so unless you already own it somehow then it's going to take some specific knowledge of where to look."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Aside from the white phosphorous scene, I thought the game was really well done.

It's a linear game, so you obviously don't have a choice. You either play the game or stop. But many times it's presented like you do have a choice. Simple things like shooting the crowd of civilians, or shooting in the air etc.

Which go along way to making it feel like you're doing things because you chose to.

But then nope! Use the white phosphorous. It's obvious they're civilians grouped up at the end but you're stuck here until you kill them.

I kept trying to go around and skip using it, but as soon as I realised I had to it killed any effect the scene was supposed to have and completely ruined my immersion."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I think the 3rd game was best for gameplay, so many quality of life improvements on 2, feels much better all round. Otherwise I'd agree with what you said."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"The first one was really good RTWP. Go back and play it as such, assigning your moves and your teammates moves while in the pause and you'll see what I mean. 

People never understood that your bullet randomly went somewhere in the reticle randomly, and that was why your gun stats made the reticle smaller, and they couldn't figure out why they weren't a shooter god. Exactly how Alpha Protocol did it which people also never figured out how it worked. 

There's nothing wrong with where the series went, except that it started very unique and it sucks to see anything unique change to be the same as everything else."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,IMO the story was way better in the first game. The second was good out of context but I didn’t really like where it continued with the reaper story
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"They did, can't remember name but I wasn't a fan of it.  Tho it got decent positive reviews."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"You’re my kind of gamer. 

Might I also recommend Pony Island and Inscryption?"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Wow, I just realized what the mermaids in that game symbolize."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Wait….no wait….what the fuck…WAIT A MINUTE
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"cancer? that's not how cancer works... you don't contract it from an invader, it's not the flu."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,So glad someone commented this. Me and my buddy had the same reaction. Completely unexpected and was an amazing way to end the play through
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I'm glad the composers got their props in the form of a Grammy for Survivor, both games have incredible music."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Such an incredible scene. I wasn't shocked by it but the acting and music, and scene were just mind blowing. The way they handled Fortress Inquisitorious in the Obi-Wan show was such a disaster and only made even worse by these scenes in JFO."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Then he just starts tearing the base apart while you run away 
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,"After the hallway scene in Rogue One, this is the absolute best moment that shows how ridiculously powerful Vader is. He completely overwhelms you, and there's nothing you can do about it."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I think I also had the same vocabulary range during that moment lol
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Aw man that sucks cuz it really was a successfully done moment. Its annoying how sometimes it feels like you either have to completely disconnect from the internet to avoid spoilers or have to rush through a game as soon as it's out.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Can you spoil me more? I played it years ago, but had not the chance to finish it :("
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I’m pretty sure they can see, although it’s never explicitly explained how. I’m sure the answer is nanomachines. 

Characters constantly reference what you’re looking at, holding, exact location, etc."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Well, they can see what your wearing in ""MGS 3, Snake Eater"" with humorist response from the team like with the tuxedo."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,One of the biggest dick moves in gaming history. I yelled at my TV when he did the *thing* with the archives.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Louder for the people in the back.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"For me, the massive twist was finding out why machines were everywhere in the first place, and that they weren’t related to the ones that wiped out humanity"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"My current theory is that while ZD was allocating resources, there was still another team, substantially smaller, team working on a weapon, and were gonna learn of it and finish it in 3."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Agreed. The voice log in that one base where you first hear how confident they are reviewing their strategy in fighting one of those big machines. Only to hear the next one where you hear their last stand. And you pick up that final voice log near their bodies. Nobody made it out alive. And in fact, nobody will be making out of this alive.

That haunted me. I had to pause playing for a bit.

Still there is some phenomenal story telling in Zero Dawn."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,"I just remember being pissed, then realizing how meta on-brand it was that off all the data pads that survived, like 2/3rds of them were useless advertisements."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"The worst thing for me is that we're supposed to empathize with Elizabeth. Like, Faro is universally hated for good reasons, so why would gaslighting the whole humanity be a good thing?"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Even though 2 was the best, 3 was the best ending to the franchise."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I felt the same too. Though, sometimes I feel there really isn't  anything that could be worse than what happened to him. It was just desserts."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"There is a lot of 4th wall breakdown stuff and it comes out of nowhere. It was some great timing on my mum's part and the fact she played along when they returned home really muddied the water.

Also my step dad is/was a genius with computers. Even now 20 years later if I can't solve a problem I go to him. I just assumed at the time he swapped some audio files and that was it. But yeah it was part of the game
 
I mean [listen for yourself ](https://youtu.be/M0fsYzQrymY?feature=shared) it certainly got me for a good minute"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"It's a weird thing to wrap your head around and given we follow the copy's perspective until the final transfer, it's understandable that he didn't fully realize  how it worked until that moment"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Simon is pretty dumb but in his defense, he literally has a brain injury, it's why he was scanned in the first place. That's the headcanon I use to justify his stupidity."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I gotta give some props to the writers and producers here. SOMA does a really good job with Catherine's dialogue. She technically tells you the truth throughout the game regarding the transfer process, but lies by omission, which is why Simon, and many players, were still surprised by the ending despite already knowing how that process works. The game also misdirects both Simon and the player when upgrading the suit. You play as the ""new"" Simon after upgrading because the ""old"" Simon is in stasis; however, It feels as though you never missed a beat during the suit upgrade transfer."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"The game definitely makes you think long afterward and I agree that this is what makes for powerful writing.

Don’t be shy to flex some of your skills and to practice your writing over at r/WritingPrompts! There are weekly events as well where you can get live feedback."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I want someone to make a movie out of it. If it could be done well.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"""don't leave me..."""
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,"It's cheap now, buy it and go in blind.

Its narrative driven, and has the most poignant ending I've experienced in a game."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Indeed, I played all three of them and they all feature the most creative plot twists I've ever seen. But it was the 999 that hit me the hardest, because you know why."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Yeah, you can't really recreate it on any other console. DS is just perfect for it."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I mean to be fair we knew there wasn’t going to be a happy ending before the game released.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Maybe that's one of the best, because then it can catch you offguard :)"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Man, the two locations you and OP mentioned (dunno how to spoiler tag on mobile) hit me really hard. Such an amazing game."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,The Interloper twist was a rough one.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I think the DLC was my favorite part of the entire game because as much as I adore the base game and the slowly piecing together the mystery across the universe, I think them using just a couple locations for the DLC let them make a much tighter story that felt truly amazing to piece together."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Of course, >!you find a Nomai anyway!<."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"YES.

You won't regret it.

Still my favourite game of all time, years after playing it.

I wish I could blank my mind and play it all over again."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"It should've been disguised as a NG+ system. Every time you NG+, the world is a little different and the number ticks down by 1.

Instead, you're just forced to play through the same boring everything several times. The game was amazing on the first loop, and I didn't hate the second, but my enjoyment had long since died by the fourth."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Especially when the good ending is unlocked by playing dumb and following Airy to the end.

If you see through her plan and break the crystal, you get the bad ending.

It should be the other way around."

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I was young enough that I went over to a friend's house and had him play it for me while I watched cause I was too scared to play it myself! Core memory indeed. 
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I hope you've played Forbidden West. Forbidden West adds worse shit on top of what's already done in the first game
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,"Yeah, I think it looks great!"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Not at all, that reveal was 9, nearly 10 years ago. Wholeheartedly recommend picking the game up again just to experience the narrative, it is excellent."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,Sounds like you left shortly before it was released.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Yea like he's one of the greatest villains ever he actually wins and he does it in a way you never expect also but completely in character for him and the celes twist right before that in the factory 

Such a wonderful game another great twist was with golbez in ff4 and his declaration to Cecil after the battle of the 4 feinds"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-12,"Ver true. I forgot to mention, but I played this game in *4th frickin’ grade too*, so it was a real heavy-hitter for me (one of the few times I cried over something in a video game lol)."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,What a little shit!
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,I learned that revenge isn't worth it. Except it is. But not before it's not. However it is. But not really.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,It’s very old now.
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Of course I played it. I loved the first game. 

Its contrived as fuck, with characters that are just CW levels of cringe. 

Like I said, if not the for leaks, the bigoted assholes, and the death threats to Laura Bailey, people would be a lot more honest about their views on the game. Its mid as fuck, from a narrative and character stand point. 

Character motivations in this world dont make sense. No one is going to travel 800+ miles on a chance that you might find a guy who might lead you to another guy. Not in that world, with all sorts of shit between A and B. 

The retconning of the fireflies was another big issue. They were a terror group that was all but wiped out. They operating in some backwater hellhole, because FEDRA had all but wiped them out. Then all of sudden they are well stocked, in brightly lit rooms and the place is home to families and whatnot. Theres no way, Joel would have walked through part 2s firefly base. Yet, here we are. 

Going back to Abby. She makes that 800+ journey with her pals, and only once they arrive is Owen asking about ""how"" they are going to get the info out of Tommy. Seems like that would have been part of the conversation before they set out across a hell hole full of monsters, rapists, murderers etc. Then she fucks off in a mood, runs into a snow storm, then into infected, and then right into not only the man that shes looking for but the man that shes was wanting him to lead her to... Theres good luck, and then theres contrivance. 

And then, Joel hardened by 20 years of the wasteland sees the mood in the room swing wildly to the right when his name is mentioned and he... cracks a joke... 

Everything about that opening segment was about killing Joel as quickly as possible without earning it. It doesnt have to be some mad heroes death, but you have to get him into that room in a believable way. And nothing that happened was believable. You could see the writer the whole time. 

And then right after that Ellie tells Tommy that she'll go without him if he doesnt take her, so he then leaves without her so that she wont come... Shit writing. 

There was a story in there that had nothing to do with Joel and Ellie and it was a banger. But we got almost nothing of it. Part 2 should have left Joel and Ellie in part 1 and just focused on Abby, Owen, Lev and Yara. By FAR a more interesting story to be told there. But no, revenge bad with extra steps."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Yeah I don't get how anyone who has actually played it could consider it to be mid. I thought that the story was weaker than the first game and it went on a little too long, but everything else was fantastic. 

Even if it's not your kind of game, you can't deny the high level of polish that has sadly become far too uncommon in AAA games these days.

All of that said, I will never play it again because the story was incredibly depressing."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Sorry, but that wasnt a surprise. Killing Joel was the most obvious thing they could have done. Not killing him in the first game, was a surprise. Killing in the second, was just two tropes wrapped in one. 

Hell, everyone guessed Joel was getting killed or already dead 4 years before. Thats how obvious it was. 

Trope 1: Killing off a mentor figure to start the hero on their journey.

Trope 2: Killing off a formally bad character to redeem them for their bad acts in the past."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"It wasn't ever really a leak, it was pretty well known there was more than one character afaik.

With that being said Part 2s story was so force fed and hamfisted that I really did not enjoy it. There was a good story in there somewhere, but had the nuance of a piece of cardboard."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Noticing a trend when it comes to discussion of this game. Do any of these people downvoting posts critical of this series have a counter point they'd like to share? Considering how fast they strike and flee, I'm starting to assume that they don't.

This isn't troll bait. I love the first game and I'm not saying anyone should dislike the sequel. I like reading opinions different from my own and otherwise thought that was what forums were for. 🫤"

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"What’s interesting about the KOTOR twist is that it’s easy to dismiss the hints about the twist as just video game logic. Seeming Amnesia, force visions of the plot, a connection to Bastilla, the Jedi’s willingness to train you, all of these things can be hand-waved as stuff that happens because you’re the protagonist. The game gives you hints, but it also gives you reason to ignore them, or not consider them as hints. It uses your knowledge of typical video game storytelling tropes against you. That’s what makes it so brilliant as a twist."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"The really cool part is that it makes you question gaming in general. The crucial difference between the experience of gaming and other media, is that you are in control. You have the agency to make important choices. You're forced to look at the choices the game gave you, and realise that you largely had the illusion of control, your path was scripted  A to B. All of the choices about upgrades and so on were just the ones the bad guy didn't care enough to direct you on. 


 Once you take a step back, it makes you question how on rails are most games? Join the vampires or the vampire slayers? Almost all of the quests are identical on the two paths. Often it feels like you're free, but you're just making small ad libs to someone else's script. "

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"That's actually hilarious cause I ran a TTRPG heavily inspired by Bioshock set in Antarctica. 1960s, players on a cruise ship going around the bottom of South America, storm gets them off course and a bit closer to Antarctica then originally planned, when they see a light house through the storm, but the light house is a laser kind of weapon that cuts the ship in half, and the party washes up...on a tropical beach. From there it's get a bit Island of Dr. Moreau-ish, with plasmids mixed in as scientist doing genetic experiments, usually on local wildlife. I think I even connected (in concept) with System Shock where the scientist was receiving assistance from some space communication. Last game session ended with me playing a recording of the last communique but I had used Audacity to make it sound like Shodan. Good times."
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Yeah. I showed my now wife the game when we met. She made multiple comments to the effect of ""why should we listen to this guy? I mean, I know you have to to advance the story, but if it were me I'd be suspicious."""

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"If the game gave the player any options, then I could see your point. But you could put that “twist” on any game on the rails and it would have the same impact as a video game plot twist.

Now if you had options and you choose to listen that would be a meta commentary. A great example of something like that would be the “No Russian” level."

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I think the ""you can stop playing the game"" argument is valid. It's parallel to the narrative of the characters in that they didn't need to be there and could/should have left, but didn't. By continuing to play it's the fourth-wall-breaking equivalent."

>!everyone tries to flee in the airship, it blows up and the screen fades to black. You wake up on a beach only with Ceres, then the old man there tells her about basically the apocalypse, you take care of him for a while (that is actually a whole ass year) and after he dies you find a letter telling about a raft, you left the island on it and now there is a whole ass new post apocalyptic world map, and you have to find everyone who survived to fight magic god kefka who now rules the world on a tower!<"
1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"The point where this twist happens is when the player reaches the floating continent where the presumed BBEG Gestahl was going to use the power of the sealed gods to take over the world. He tells Celes (a party member who used to serve him) to rejoin his empire, then Kefka gives her a sword with which to kill the party. Celes stabs Kefka instead, who is infuriated by this and takes the power of the sealed gods and uses it to kill Gestahl and reshape the entire world. The twist hits hard for me because it also uses the dramatic change in Kefka's status (previously a comic relief villain, now a lunatic god causing suffering for his own amusement) to drive home the change in the world - your party is split, the world itself is broken and most of the people you've met before are dead."

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"I didn't get any of that when I played it. I also played when it first came out and (like with most things) avoided as much news media about it as possible, so I didn't find out about the ""hurr durr Abby is a dude"" crap until afterwards.

That being said, I thought it did a good job of getting me to care about the characters and what they were going through more than most games have (part 1 excluded).

Maybe I'm just shallow, but I thought the gameplay was great, and the story was really well done. I actually didn't like the time jump towards the end at first, but after finishing it and thinking on it for a while, I think it had more impact that way. Also, I gotta commend them for making me really think about both sides (Ellie and Abby) and how there's not really a ""right way"" to solve their issues other than just letting things go. Similar to Spec Ops: The Line.

And even though I don't want to go through it again, I believe that says something about how well it was done. I was *mad* during parts of it and didn't want to have to control a character doing things that I wouldn't agree with in real life. But that's what makes it way above ""mid"" for me."

Joel was killed because of his bad acts, but he was also killed specifically because of his good acts. He died because he saved Abby, something he wouldn't have done if he didn't change as a person. That was the surprise. 

Yes, killing off a mentor isn't exactly world changing, but that doesn't mean the way it happens can't be a surprise. Joel was killed by a person who would have died if Joel hadn't grown as a person between the two games. He was killed by his sins AND killed from changing. It was a super fucked situation. Something can be a trope and still surprising. Nearly every great twist in the history of media relies on tropes, a twist that comes out of complete nowhere is just bad writing done for shock value. I'm not saying Joel dying was some kind of high fiction, but clearly it was pretty surprising based on how many youtube compilations you can find of streamers playing the game and getting pissed about it happening. 

Also...Joel being killed wasn't the big shock of the game. Abby killing a main character, shooting another main character in the head, then becoming the protagonist for the second half of the game was the big twist, and if you go into the game blind and try to claim you predicted that would happen you are lying lmao. Expecting to play Abby is one thing, that is telegraphed, but the way it happens (once again) was absolutely out of nowhere. You didn't have any reason to believe Abby knew where they were, or that Abby was even tracking her."

1e0om2g,2024-07-11,2024-07-11,"Specifically to your last point, the game doesn’t scold the player for having that reaction. It’s a tragedy, and it doesn’t blame the player any more than a horror game does for the player getting the protagonist hurt."

There have been many games that did it properly, even before Bioshock. For example, Pathologic (2005) would have you question why you do what you do, especially since it's not real, but more importantly it would give you *the option to do something else*.

Then you have General Herres. Who had the misfortune of being the man in charge of sending countless humans to their certain death under the veil of stalling until a superweapon was built, when in reality it was to delay the extinction of humanity just that much longer. And after all of that he made it a point to ensure his name, and more precisely his role in Enduring Victory, was forever tied to him and him alone.

1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,"Oh c'mon, Skyrim has 16 ~~times the detail~~ releases and TLOU2 has 2."
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,"Or the Rockstar Logo during the PS5 reveal.

""Why did I move here?"""
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,waiting to release it along side season 2
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,Pc port. Honestly I'm very happy with it because I don't own a Playstation but idk if it needed a trailer at the game awards lol
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,It’s already remastered. This was the PC port announcement.
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,"Because that's the version of the game they are porting to PC. They are not porting the PS4 game TLOU2, from 2020. They are porting the PS5 game TLOU2 Remastered, from 2024."
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,"Yup, i really hope that X-Box pulls itself out of this funk and smashes some stuff out of the park, we need healthy competition again, otherwise Sony is going to keep pulling shit like this."
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,Praying that Steam enters the console market soon
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,"This current weird trend of Playstation Games getting ""Remaster"" when they really weren't that old yet and / or still look good enough to not really need one to begin with. Just as an example, Last of Us 1 got a ""Remaster"" literally *a Year* after its original release when they made the PS4 Port.

Sony for some reason has this strange fascination with treating Ports of recent-ish games as full-on re-releases instead of *just* a Port, and people rather understandably think that's silly."
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,It’s called remaster. As far as I know God of War or Ghost of Tsushima or Horizon FW went with the same title. This probably means they will release remaster on PS5 as well
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,It was more an ad than a trailer. Like they didn’t hype it up that much.
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,"Thanks, I had thought it was already and that they were going full Todd Howard. Good for PC players I guess, but I’d have much rather seen a Last of Us 3."
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,I agree with all of that but the OP seemed to imply that this is a new re-remastered when it's not. Part 2 Remastered was released on PS5 this January and this is just a PC version of that.
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,They already did. It was a $10 upgrade and came with a roguelike mode
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,It's because of the story. Most people wanted The Last Of Us 1 all over again but with better graphics. Instead we got a huge story twist. Which is very good in my opinion. This is a revenge story that ends badly for both sides.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I think a lot of people had a picture in their head of what the game would be. And then when it was radically different, and went in a darker direction, that really upset them.

There are problems with pacing, and the order of playing some sections. I think they could have benefited with introducing a load of a new character's storyline earlier (if it could be done without spoiling the surprise too much) - I think a lot of people had problems empathising with the character after playing 10+ hours of the game. I also think the last ~20% of the game could have been carved off as a separate DLC, giving a happy(ish) ending for those who wanted it, but then continuing the story for those who needed closure.

IMHO it's a very good game. It's not groundbreaking, like the first was, but then it was never going to be. It has flaws (limited character models, pacing issues, some aspects of the story), but ultimately I think a lot of hate comes from people who didn't feel they got enough fan service."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Playing TLOU1 made me feel powerful and the end felt like righteous justice. Ellie and Joel’s moralities were really painted in a positive light that was not completely accurate. TLOU2 made me feel uncomfortable, drained and that every decision Ellie went through was a path further into darkness. The ending felt like resolution to all that darkness with a small semblance of hope. I think I know why people didn’t like the game because I personally felt fatigued playing it. With that being said, it has a great emotional impact that the creators clearly set out to do. It’s not a feel-good experience and wasn’t meant to be. 

Character development was excellent including for secondary characters. I was thrown for a loop on the change in the playable character but I ended up liking the experience.

Gameplay was very similar to previous game with a few innovations. I was a bit disappointed by the weapons system being largely the same. The stealth element was improved in diversity and felt much more challenging. Overall gameplay was fun but left a little to be desired.

Game was 8/10 for me"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Abby as a character was very controversial for some reason, but I never minded her. I guess a lot of these incels felt their masculinity was in danger by seeing a women stronger than them, and hated her after that. I felt her story was well thought out and important to the story, and everyone that dislikes her didn't play the game."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,I think it was because of the story.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,Had no problems with the game. To me the story was amazing if they had been able to add the parts they had to delete would've loved it more
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"People missing the point of the story and the narrative they were trying to drive home. Revenge isn't black and white. Ellie and Joel are not the heroes of the story necessarily. Most games paint the protganists as righteous, mowing through hordes of nameless NPCs. TLOU2 gives those NPCs a name and a story - and makes you think twice about killing them. Abby's motivation for revenge is just as compelling a story as Ellie's. The point of the game wasn't to make you feel guilty about the choices Ellie makes throughout the game, but to show you the two sides to every story. I personally enjoyed the twist and Abby as a playable character. To someone else's point, the ending is a suitable way for Ellie to break the cycle and try to find some semblance of peace in her life. The game does have some questionable choices though - forcing us to repeat the first half of the game, but as Abby was weird. I would've much preferred a back and forth until the climactic confrontation at the theater. I could also do without the violence against dogs. I genuinely thought about putting the game down after encountering that. Overall, I'd give the game an 8/10."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,The Last of Us Part II is magnificent. Easily one of the best games of the entire console generation
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I always loved ND games because they add lots of details and small events that keep the gameplay fresh and sometimes give it a new twist.

I find the story ok so I don't get why people hate it either"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I know the haters are sick of hearing they “just don’t get it” but I’ve been reading through reddit for a few days now since finishing it and... That’s how it is, by and large. I don’t think they’re stupid or anything, I think they just got too caught up in their own emotions to see the bigger picture. That, combined with people who just want to shit on things for fun. If the haters want the lovers to stop calling them stupid, they should probably stop falling for the “Ellie is the first female protagonist” meme/joke EVERY SINGLE TIME. There are legit, intelligent critiques out there, but nobody sees that due to the constant stupidity of loud mouthed fools."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"People didn't understood the final, the biggest Ellie's fear was to be alone, and in the end, she saw that she was alone."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"People wanted a Happy Story, that's why the hate. 

The Game keeps getting depressing the more you play. I liked the game, not same level as part 1 but its no way an absolute garbage like how some of the people are claiming it to be."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I didn't like the game personally bc of the story, narrative, storytelling, the setting of promises and payoffs, and the fact that they use Joel just as a plot device and emotion device.  I don't think it's the worst game ever tho, it's a solid 7/10 at least."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"So I just beat the story. Pretty good. About on par with TLOU1 (minus 1's great ending).

I have a few lingering questions, though, probably because I wasn't paying enough attention:

>!So...that lady that had her mural painted all over the city? ""She will protect you""? The leader of the Scars? Who was she? Did she ever show up? Was she that chick that god smacked in the head with a hammer durring the Abby section? (If so, what a fuckin' waste, I didn't even know it was the same woman)!<

Second question:

>!There's notes all around the city that you find several times. They just have a person's name on it (can't remember the name). What's the deal with those>?!<"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-07-19,"Hi OP, late to the party but I just finished. I found it a brutal game and loved every second

I didn't hate the ending but it would have been nice to know if Ellie even realises how broken she is and how her actions ruined her life and those around her even more."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Oh I don’t know, maybe because they killed off Joel in the worst possible fashion and force you to play as his murderer for the second half of the game while you hunt down Ellie and try to kill her? It’s bullshit. 

I’ve read people say “Did you really expect Joel to live through the sequel??? Lolz”

So ignorant. The first game builds up so much emotional attachment to these two and the second game just says “fuck you and what you feel or want for these characters”. Not to mention Joel, who is the most careful person in this post apocalyptic world, who NEVER gives up his identity, just gives out his info and is immediately murdered for it. 

Completely fucking ridiculous."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,People are just mad because they didnt get the fan service they wanted. Probably deprived of fatherly love like ellie.

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"(SPOILER)

I was disappointed with the Ending, she didnt get her revenge she didint get a famaly this complete Game builds to something. You kill everyone with Friends and Family and the everything was for nothing. This is stupid. Its like learning for an really important exam. letting Friends and Family down, dont have Hobbys for Months and then on the day of the Exam you dont go to School because you think: Nah i dont feel like it"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"I mean, I think MGS3 Subsistence is a better game, but that's an opinion. Enjoy playing TLOU2, I probably won't be, not my kind of game"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,Imagine if right before the end of John Wick there was 2 hour flashback with the guy that killed his dog.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"It was because of the story. The graphics, gameplay, acting, setting are all fantastic.

Then the story steers you in the direction of hating a sympathetic character who does bad things but feels remorse, then loses everything in the end

While at the same time trying to make you sympathize with a bad person who has done unforgiveable things and seems to feel no remorse then gets away with it in the end"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,I played it without ever playing the original. Gameplay is boring.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I would say that a big problem with the game is its pacing and story structure, since it is honestly shite. Flashbacks inside flashbacks, either because the tone in the real game is getting too dark, and they need something people wanted when going into the game, or just building up context, that we need to know to understand the story. This is a story that i think would have been much better if it was told chronologically, since it would have given a much better first impression of >!Abby too. Her campaign would probably also have been much better first too. And then the ending really messes and fucks up the overall theme, and gives players a lot of dissatisfaction. !< I would also say the representation feels really weird and forced, but worst of all is how many plot holes and stupid decisions that have to be made for the story to actually carry out, and these you might not realize, since they are gonna take a while to settle in."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,The story is garbage. Its like GoT Season 6-8!
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,">Gameplay is just about what you expect from NaughtyDog

I expect an orange mentally challenged furry creature spinning through boxes and occasionally riding baby polar bears or running away from dinosaurs. Best not let me down."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Yup. Its fantastic, just like the first. I left feeling just as morally conflicted as I did with the first. I never in a million years thought the second would be able to recreate that feeling.

I love and hate everyone in these games lol"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,[deleted]
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,Would you care to explain who the characters were developed? I really found that basically none of them had any at all.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Controversial is good in my book. As a man I’m kinda tired of your typical strong skinny girl that can do everything, it’s just not realistic. So seeing Abby -the absolute unit- was very refreshing. Also, I think the game did a good job making me like her even tho she did something really horrible!"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,Exactly. And without her you don't walk away with questioning morality the way you do with the first. They managed to recreate that feeling by including her and i think they nailed it.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,Without spoilers for anyone but was it specifically the ending?
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"I've avoided all LoU2 news, so I'm out of the loop. What was deleted?"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"The moral dilemma is what made the 1st one of the most talked about games ever. The second, surprisingly, managed to repeat that success. 

Everyone in these games are terrible and amazing at the same time. I love them and hate them at the same time. I'm seriously amazed ND was able to leave me, once again, with that feeling of ""fuck... who is in the right here? What would i really have done?""

So great."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Revenge cycle ending would make sense unless all the people that got caught in the revenge path, the cycle never ends as it always begins a new in the least place you expect.

It's hard to end revenge cycle when you need to make the decision as a player since you need to feel something for the other character and for the most people it failed miserably.  
Most people wanted Abby dead and felt betrayed for the ending, but that is one part of many with what's wrong with the writing but at least you liked something that I couldn't.

I had higher expectations for writing and got disappointed."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,Because people think its cool to jump on a bandwagon.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"“Revenge is bad.” 

Wow so profound. Thanks for destroying two great characters for such a shallow message."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"You can make many games with a sad ending/ bad ending and still be a good story game.

But it failed on mutable levels for many people, it's great that you loved it but many were disappointed ."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"For one, it's mentioned that >!she died a while ago and that her teachings are being misinterpreted because they never contained violence. !<

For two, just like in the first game there's characters who have bits of their story told in the collectibles like Ish."

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"When did it become so unacceptable to kill off major characters? That has been a device in storytelling since the beginning of storytelling. But all of a sudden, everyone's bitching and whining about it now, and calling the writing ""trash"" just because it made you sad? Making you feel emotions is literally exactly what good writers are supposed to do."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"You're missing the point by a mile. Its about morality. ""What is the right thing to do?"" LoU1 left us with a big moral dilemma to consider. And thats what LoU2 is doing. 

Just because we love these characters doesn't mean they're good people. I mean shit, Abby killed one person to avenge her father. Ellie killed dozens and dozens *just to get to* Abby.   It's that fact couple with the fact we lkve Ellie that makes it so hard to decide if she's doing the right thing. These games are all about moral dilemmas."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,Did you play the game?
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,Your not helping anyone here mate.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"A hasty decision that lasted a long way trip to Seattle, 3 days there, all the way back, then all they way back again to Seattle.

Doesn't make sense in the bigger scheme of things, they could done something good but the passing of it and the structure makes it really inconsistent and stupid."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,">!I saw that as sort of the point. Ellie had the chance to move on, but her focus on revenge ended up wrecking her life; she can't even play guitar any more. Abby opted to move on, and was good until the obvious. !<

Personally I think that last quarter >!(from Tommy visiting Ellie+Dina onwards)!< would have been better as a (possibly free) DLC.

But I'm not disappointed. It's certainly not an 'up' game or ending, and does hammer you over the head with 'revenge is bad', and does have pacing issues in the last third, but overall I liked it."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,The journey in the first game was all for nothing as well.  They went all that way to find the Fireflies and it ended with Joel wiping them out and crushing any hope of a cure. Did you just forget about that?
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,Imagine if not every story with a dog was the same as John Wick.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,It doesn’t try to get you to hate Ellie any more than it tries to get you to love Abby.  Also Abby casually mentions feeling guilty multiple times in gameplay.  Both are flawed individuals who are doing what they believe is right.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"And what would be ""the best way""? He makes some cliche sacrifice or something so that other's could live?

Gee, haven't seen that a million times.

At least Joel's death serves a huge purpose to the story. His death has a motivated reason behind it that properly works off of his actions in the first game.

You all just had over-hyped expectations on what the story was going to be, and when you were wrong, you all freaked the fuck out."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,That was the point. Their world is nothing like ours.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"They live in a cruel world. What exactly is ""the best"" way lol? It was harsh and brutal just like the world they live in."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,Doesn't mean I don't like the game
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,Yep
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I don’t think it was specifically the ending, the ending was just the nail in the coffin. No closure and felt kind of incomplete."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Pretty much after our beloved X character got killed by A and youre forced to play as A afterward. With your mind still filled with anger and frustration, the game told you to play character A to ""understand"" her..ehem, its backstory. At that point, probably most of us already dont give a fck. Literally speedrun until the end no joke. The story is predictable passed that point because you kinda get the theme of the game already, which is ""revenge""."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"The ending was spectacular. Game kept me on edge the entire time, it has to be one of if not the most compelling game story I have ever experienced. To say my expectations were exceeded is an understatement.

Then again, many people seemed bothered by Far Cry 5's ending and I thought that was actually really well done also, though that wasn't quite near this level.

If game writing in general continues to be absolute rubbish, it's because when something actually thoughtful and well executed comes around a bunch of people throw tantrums."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"For me it was the theme. The game seems like it wants to pretend the overall theme and message is unique or deep in any fashion? But... its not and the hammering of the message throughout the story feels grating because of its lack of originality.

Don't get me wrong the graphics, sound, and even gameplay to some extent are spectacular. The story just tries to play like its deep when its true depth never goes beyond a teaspoon of water."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"And pretty much everything in between, yeah.

Halfway through I was wondering when the story was going to actually start, unfortunately it never really got that point."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Ending, the sheer nonsense it made and the first two hours of the game. Besides, Abby. No one likes Abby"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,A few extra scenes that were meant to introduce Joel's gf
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"I agree. One of the few games in recent memory where I actually had to pause and think about who is the right and who is in the wrong. In the theater scene I found myself rooting for Ellie, but at the beach I was wholeheartedly on team Abby."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-29,"The game is not asking you to like her. Killing her off only leaves one more innocent person without a loved one. Abby didn't get her fulfillment when she completed her revenge on Joel. She got it when she found new friends in Yara and Lev.

Killing off Abby would not satisfy anyone. That's the whole moral of the story.

The game is not asking you to make the decision for Ellie either. She, not you, chose her path. This is not a roleplaying game so you're only supposed to be the passive observer. You don't have to agree with it but that doesn't make it a bad game."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Any criticism=bandwagon.

Any praise=the ""right"" opinion.

I mean honestly, do you guys think before you say stuff or just repeat what you've heard? Everything points towards the latter."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"It’s not a band wagon. 

Something similar happened with TellTales TWD a New Frontier. You’re forced to play as some random ass character that you don’t care about at all, while the game also forces situations on you that put a beloved character is a negative light which further makes your dislike the character you’re forced to play. Eventually it gets better, but the fact that you’re put into those situations to begin with is just stupid. 

It makes sense why people dislike the game. Add in extremely shit writing, and character traits being tossed in the trash for the sake of plot, and you’ve got a lot of angry people. Just like TellTales TWD a New Frontier. The only difference is in a New Frontier the ending makes up for the shit beginning. TLOU2 doesn’t."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"The ""bandwagon"" exists because many people don't like the game, and they actually have an argument to justify it. You don't have to agree with the arguments, but stop assuming it's because of some mindless herd mentality that the game is receiving harsh criticism. That's just silly."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Oh okay, thank you. I assumed it was something I probably missed."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-07-19,I am amazed I got to the end without seeing a single spoiler lol
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-07-20,Maybe
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"Regardless, it was incredibly rushed and contrived. 

“Okay, I’ve travelled hundreds of miles to find this guy and...oh there he is!”

Could they not have written a better sequence than one so coincidental for the death of this character? Especially since on top of that, he acts rather uncharacteristically to get there.

Game of Thrones SPOILERS:

It’s like in GoT S8 when Melisandre finds Arya and says “Hey remember when I said you need to shut blue eyes? Get to work!” and Arya just immediately kills the Night King. It’s way too fucking convenient. The fact that they are both based on retcons of previous material makes the comparison especially apt, I think."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Possibly, yes. But the player’s attachment to him isn’t diminished because of that, he did what he felt was right because of his love for Ellie."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Joel did what any good father would do. He'd already lost his daughter, and there was zero chance he was losing another. If you think Joel saving Ellie was a choice, it wasn't. Its what I hope any father would do."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"...but none of that matters, people liked Joel's character and that's that. It really doesn't matter what he's done, he was a likable character."

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"That has nothing to do with how he did his death though. He was very careful in the first game and in the second game, he’s a fucking moron or you know completely out of character. He would never trust random strangers that he just met with his real name, especially when he should know that they likely people after him and this is what kills him. Then he gets brutally murdered and tortured by Abby. It was more to do with her father dying than Joel supposedly screwing the chance to save humanity. People are also still attached to Joel. So to play as his killer for the big part of the game, of course nobody is going to like that and if they were going to do that, they need to do it right but they didn’t. Then Ellie doesn’t choose to kill the one person responsible for why Ellie wants and actually does murder so many people along the way which is stupid. 

Both RDR games actually did the revenge story and how certain characters died, a lot better."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Abby was no hero either.

The line between good and evil got smudged into survival, if you are weak strong will rule over you and you need to do anything to live.  
And there are to many problems with firefly's and the doctors desire to dissect Ellie before even do any test shows their incompetents."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,Killing off Joel wasn’t he problem. It was forcing us into playing as Abby afterwards that was the problem. It was a huge disservice to our connection to Joel.

And then it just devolves into whining because the story didn't go the way they personally wanted so therefore it's bad. Time to go review bomb the game and throw a tantrum."

When you mentioned killing Abby would not satisfy anyone that is not true, many people wanted her dead and story took our expectations and drove it of a cliff in not a good way.
If that was the whole moral of the story I better read twilight.
No one said it's a bad game, it's a great game with a crap of a story.

The other point you making about it's not a roleplaying game, the game is trying to make your feel guilty for the decisions it forces on you, you can't claim you supposed to be a passive observer when it's ridicules you for your actions that you were force to make."

joel did what he did bc of his love for Ellie

and Abby did what she did bc of her love for her dad.

She'd gotten her revenge, and didn't need any more. Also maybe she realised that Joel would be disappointed in what she had become. Finally, maybe she'd though on what those lyrics meant, and how they could have also applied to her and Dina.!<"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"And TLOU2 uses that bond and that love for Joel to fuel the character and the player's motivation.

You should be pissed off at what happened to Joel. You should want to go hunt down Abby. You should be feeling exactly what Ellie feels.

And then you play Ellie, and do a bunch of terrible shit to a bunch of people, all in the name of ""vengeance"". And as a player, you feel just in your actions because of what happened to Joel.

But then the game shows you why Ellie is such a terrible person for doing so. Because it shows the people Ellie has been hunting down as what they are: people. People with their own lives and their own loves and their own motivations.

That's the moral of the game: it tricks you as a player into participating in the endless cycle of hate and revenge."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Allow me to treat this game as a story, which it heavily relies most than any other game.

This is an amazing scape routine for a bad review. If it fills us with bitterness that's exactly the point of the storyteller and if it doesn't it is also an accomplishment of the writer again. It surpasses the death of X character which was pretty much comprehensible for a TLOU fan coming in to this sequel.

The success of a story is to convince you of its message, not only to explain you. You can drive a cliched or an exceptional message and land it amazingly IF you lay down the foundations for it."

Don't mind me killing everything beloved to you and then forgive you.

I can see why you see the theme as forgiveness but it falls so flat on it's face that you can easily miss it, they didn't do anything new to a theme that has been done a million times that it just comes out as bland and uninteresting."

The questions of morality is just as strong with LoU2 as it is with LoU1. Thats what makes these stories so special."

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,To be fair. When you play as Abbie you kill plenty of people with sons and daughters. So what's the difference? We only have to wait for Naughty Dog to make TLOU3 about WLF soldier number 342 to then humanise him and demonise Abbie?
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,And I don't think anyone has a problem with that. People just hate how he died
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Well if we're talking realistically, no. Since a vaccine for a fungal infection wouldn't be possible. And yes I knew this before matpats video"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"Well the game both literally figuratively spits on his corpse, so he clearly isn’t beloved to the people behind the game."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"Well, we’ve heard nothing of those other supposed innocents, and they certainly never sough revenge, so it doesn’t have a lot of bearing here.

Sure, they argued with each other. But they still came to decision to kill a girl without asking her if it was okay. Therefore they are not innocent, and their supposed heroism some serious stains on it. If they can decide that Ellie could die, Joel can decide the same for them. They just lost."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"Did you see how much of a stickler he was for patrols to be safe, particularly the ones with Ellie? Also, why are Ellie and Dina and such all tough and hardened after years of comfort, but Joel got soft? Doesn’t add up to me."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"That isn’t a good excuse though. He’s been surviving for 20+ years and there’s no way he’d lose basic survival instincts where one of the biggest ones being, dont trust anybody unless you know for sure you could trust them. He’d have to be an idiot to do that which is what they made him. Also, he could’ve just used a fake name anyway. There’s no reason he should be using his real name. 

If they were going to give Joel a heroic death, that’s fine too. If they were going to make him die a horrible death, that’s fine as well but they shouldn’t somehow make him a huge dumbass for him to die. There is no excuse at all for how they made him die. Most people aren’t even mad that he died. Hell they are fine with it but how he died, how they did his death, was absolutely terrible. Another thing is how they misled people into thinking he had a bigger role in the trailers. I get the idea of misleading people to avoid spoilers but what they did was straight up lie about what the story was about."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Is it? So if someone dislikes it or has a different opinion than you, then “you just don’t get it?” Fuck all that. I got it, it’s trash."

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I don't see in that way at all, it feels like she lost all connection to Joel while caring form him.  
No one would like to forget about someone you care about and how Ellie was crying fro him shows that she cares deeply about him.

But no at the end she leaves everything that remind her of Joel and I feel that she lost something so deep that she can't get back anymore."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,">!I think you nailed the point with some critics I have with the game. You, as a player, are making your own assumptions about the ending and how the characters feels, it's ambiguous bc that's what they wanted you to feel, that's why the promise of Ellie's character arc it's at the end, it's for subvert your expectations and give you a lot of questions for you to answer. There's no real answer bc they don't explore the answers within the characters. They give you the answer for the argument ""what is the prize of revenge?"" and ultimetly ""revenge is bad, it costs everything"", a story told over and over again. Imo, TLoU it's not about the plot, it's a about the characters, but tone, argument and themes are the protagonist of this game by a lot. You can say ""Abby's story it's like the first TLoU"", yes, but she's being use as a mirror of what Ellie and Joel went through in the first game, she's (as well as Joel) a device to make you feel things wich also the game does a lot. Even Dina is used, she's only there for Ellie to go back and later, to show that Ellie lost everything, she's nothing of a character beside that.!<"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"considering that the seraphites were built up for like 10 hours of gameplay, and this new faction had like...2 hours maximum, it felt rushed as hell to me. felt very much like the  creators were writing themselves out of a hole in order to make sure abby and ellie would run into eachother."

I thought the lesson was the pursuing revenge was a bad thing? It really only seemed to serve to clear Abby’s mind and direct her toward her life’s old purpose: the Fireflies. Ultimately Abby is rewarded by this narrative and Ellie is just punished endlessly.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,I don’t think Ellie actually ever forgave Abby. I think she saw Joel in her since she was only focused on saving Lev. Ellie didn’t forgive her she just didn’t kill her

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-29,"I definitely think that the game wanted to make a point about tribalism and that expands to the players themselves. In-game the survivors have all formed tribes that see themselves as in the right and others as wrong. Because of the time we've spent with Joel and Ellie and our attachment to them we're basically part of their tribe. We excuse or justify actions of theirs that we condemn other characters for. Once we got the reveal of who Abby's dad is everything clicked for me. Ellie wants the exact same thing that Abby wanted. How can we root for Ellie and at the same time condemn Abby.

I don't think the game wants us to hate Joel and Ellie for what they've done. We understand and empathize with them. It wants us to understand and empathize with what Abby went through. I think Ellie's decision at the end was meant to honor Joel's decision in the first game. Ellie wanted to forgive Joel for what he did. Joel risked everything and put a giant target on his back so that Ellie could live and have a good life. He knew that there would be people like Abby that would want to come after him. I honestly think that if Joel knew who Abby was and why she wanted him dead he would have respected it. He wouldn't have wanted to die but he would understand. He wouldn't have wanted Ellie to sacrifice her humanity to avenge him."

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"What do you mean they were different? Doesn’t that prove my point about retconning?

They changed the scene when Joel approaches the surgeon, who never delivered a diatribe about all the people a cure would save, he just draws a scalpel. That’s a literal retcon, and they did it to make Joel appear more villainous.

The Fireflies were clearly portrayed in a very grey light in the first game, sure they were some people’s “light in the darkness,” but to many others, they were terrorists. However, in this game there is no implication that the Fireflies were anything but humanities last hope, which Joel squandered. The game never depicted the cure as a surefire thing, in fact the Fireflies pretty much failed at everything they tried to do. No we’re just supposed to accept that they had their shit together?

The guitar isn't just a memory of Joel, it's a memory of the good life that Joel risked everything to make for her. The good life that she threw away. I think I'm that moment Ellie accepted that she wasn't cut out to live a normal, quiet, peaceful life. If they ever make a part 3 I fully expect it to be about Ellie searching for someone that can finally use her to make a vaccine so she can sacrifice herself like she's always wanted."

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Yes, Joel killed Marlene because Marlene could come after them. Abbey let Ellie and Tommy live. That alone shows Abbey is a more  (relatively) moral person than Joel. Then when Ellie and Tommy come back proving her fears correct and try to kill her and all her friends she lets them go again.

In the world of the last of us, with people raping, eating and killing each other to survive Abbey is in fact a very moral person. Of all the factions and main characters in the game who in Abbey or Ellie's position would let the focus of their pain and vengeance live?  

Abbey had one her friends who was pregnant killed by Ellie so obvious the cycle of violence and eye for an eye would want her to even the score, whats more Ellie threatened to kill Liv unless Abbey fought her. Everyone in this world is damaged and angry, Abbey and Ellie are the playable protagonists because they break the cycle of violence. This is what all of the incels, and angry internet people dont realize instead they have the mob mentality of hating on the game without looking and critically thinking about it"

Giving them his name was out of character for Joel pre-Jackson, post-Jackson it makes sense."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-29,"Dude.. MEMORIES. The doctor death scene is fucking ptsd MEMORIES. Lol how hard is that to understand? Its how Abby and Ellie view the incident through the lens of their trama. The fact the death scene changes everytime we watch ot should have made it clear it was tramatic MEMORY. 

And no, you don't know what retcon means. Adding more scenes about what the fireflies were doing is not retcon! Haha wtf. It doesn't change ANYTHING, it adds more context. We know, from the first game, that the woman the surgeon is talking to, was close to Ellie... you think they never had a conversation about what they were going to do to Ellie? Lol. Of course they're going to discuss the procedure. Of course they're going to have pause, its a human being they're going to kill and there is no guarentee it could work in the first place. (Although, both #1 and #2 implied it actually was guaranteed to work.)

Okay, reading more of your comment... you really didn't get the first game.  The fireflies were not just terrorists. They were trying to save humanity. But like all the other factions in this game-world, did some fucked up shit to survive. No group has their shit together. None. The world these characters live in is brutal and unforgiving. 

I mean come on. That moral dilemma of saving humanity vs saving Ellie WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE ENDING OF THE FIRST GAME. That moral conflict is why people still talk about #1 to this day.  That ""what if"" is what makes the ending of #1 embedded into so many people's minds. 

You're arguments are ridiculous and show both games have clearly went over your head. Not liking it is fine, but dude you dont even understand whats happening in them."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"The game at that point isn't really about the faction you're fighting. Ellie is there for one person, the Rattlers are merely obstacles and her dialogue in this section pretty clearly indicates that."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Haha, well it's no big deal. It is a weird place though. Take it easy, amigo."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,No that was an inaccuracy that's been played out. Ellie was different from other infected.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Abby showed to little to none emotions of killing key characters while Ellie is clearly distraught in every aspect.

Everyone keeps saying that Ellie killed a pregnant woman but think about it, where did she come from?  
She came all the way from Seattle to find Joel, why? Shes pregnant for Christ's sake.  
And then we see her in Abby side of the story walking about like a bloated balloon, impinging, claiming and  engage  in dangerous combat while pregnant.  
How should we thing about her getting killed?

it makes no sense while Dina who is also pregnant is so weak after a while and barely can fight back.  


Mostly she never left them alive as other person in the group didn't want them to kill him, she just supported him.  
That can make her more moral but in this world where survival is top priority  so morality is the most less important thing."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Which is bullshit. There is no reason at all to keep using their real names. Still, Joel didn’t have to use his real name. 

The gameplay itself and the graphics in the game are amazing but the story and writing is absolute trash. It’s inexcusable."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"None of that changes why he couldnt have used a fake name. Joel has killed so many people that he should’ve known by now that it would be too dangerous to use his real name anyway. Again, especially after the incident at the hospital, he should’ve started to use fakes names way before that. He could’ve done all of those things under a fake name."

https://youtu.be/A9at4zEWhCQ

Considering how Joel almost got killed in this encounter and had his name slip I'm guessing you'd have an issue with this. Of course not bc you're looking at the first game with rose tinted glasses.

The game world is completely built. You didn't pay attention to the first game. His whole redemption ark changes him.

Would old Joel have a home? Have a library in a home? Have a city to live in where you don't have military scanning you to be infected and shoot you on sight? Have a workshop dedicated to playing guitar and fixing them up? Go searching for a museum to make a kids birthday special? Think about his daughter? Find a tape of the Apollo mission to play? Take people/strangers in to their community?

You completely turned your head away conveniently to all these changes. Changes that occurred for 4 years. It's not bad writing, it's bad comprehension on your part."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"It does change why:

1) The hospital was 4+ years ago  

2) He gave him name to Sam and Henry who said they were part of a larger group, Joel continued to work with them too. Also keep in mind they first attacked Joel and Ellie too. So even in Part 1 Joel would work with and trust strangers part of a larger group.

3) Abbys group saved them from infected, any reasonable person would assume this group of people were not hostile. Leaving Joel and Tommy to die by the infected is a pretty easy opportunity to off them. 

4) And again Joel post Jackson is much more trusting he traded coffee with strangers, they go out of there way to help Abbey, Jackson even has a ""identify yourself before entering"" not a ""will shoot on sight"" sign.  

Part 1 and 2 show Joel and Tommy trusting Abby is consistent with them as characters based on how they met and their past actions and where they were at that point in their lives."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"No community should know his name at all if he knows that he’s going to be wanted after what he did getting Ellie back. 

I still think the story and writing was terrible. I don’t have a problem with anybody liking it but people have good reasons to hate the game."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Yes, let’s insult and personally try to attack me for my opinion on a video game. Another person tries attack me for disliking a game they liked or an opinion they disagree with. You lose credibility there."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I disagree with some of those and I again, I can say but you’re the exact type of “fan” that’s defending the game, that people dislike. When people dislike or say anything awful about the game, you’ll use the “oh they just don’t understand it or haven’t played it”. No, I understand. I think the writing and story is awful."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,And nothing of substance to rebuttal the evidence of how the game gives you all this information. It's not an opinion when it's laid out in the game.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"You can dislike the writing or the story, but saying it dosent make sense is not a valid point. Saying ""Oh Joel would never trust a random group of people"" when he did it in part 1 does not make sense. 

You can dislike Abbey, the way they killed off Joel or whatever you like. But the story makes sense and has themes to it, if you want a story you have control over pick one where the player has different branches they get to choose. But most people who are going into Part 2 know the story is written in stone. 

Boycott the game and leave 500 negative reviews, but its already outsold God of War and Spiderman and has one of the highest ratings of this gen of all time. Again you are allowed to say this game is bad, just like any of the people who shit on the new God of War for having a different style of game and story."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I can say more but considering the fact that you’re trying to personally attack me for an OPINION on a video game, I’d rather not waste time with you."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"A lot of what you said was absolute BS like using high ratings. The fact that you think that’s credible shows how little you understand or can’t accept why people don’t like the game. That includes you using the “Joel trusted people in part 1” argument. Outselling the other games doesn’t make the game any better at all and a lot of people who did buy it hated it too. Even apart from you calling someone an idiot for disliking a game or having a different opinion from it, the arguments you’re trying to make aren’t even good either. 

I could on about how very wrong the first sentence you said is."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,I can see you've folded in your argument and claiming a victim complex. The points still stand.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"I am not hearing any actual counter arguments from you or examples... 

You are right sales and reviews dont necessarily make a game good. But you cant say there is no relationship between the game outselling every other exclusive game on the PS4 and getting higher ratting makes it bad. Short of Cyberpunk this is the game to beat for game of the year.  

My arguments are plenty good, you say Joel would never trust with a group of strangers he just met, I point out a time he did exactly that. And you reply with.....""No thats BS"". 

Its like Dunkys review of the game says you hate the plot but cant give a reason for it. You just say the story makes no sense but cant give me any examples of what does not make sense for you. 

Go play a game where you can make up your own story instead of trying to justify why Part 2 is bad on a thread about how the game has a interesting story."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"No, I just rather not argue with someone that’s offended over my opinion."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"I said I could say more, as in actual counter arguments but as I’ve said multiple times, I’m not wasting any more time with you used the “oh you just don’t understand or didn’t play the game” argument. What I’ve seen from you is all I needed to see. The exact arguments people use and how they attack anyone who don’t like the game. If you like the game, fine. I was never trying to force anybody to hate the game despite how it seems like you’re trying to force my opinion to change. It’s not going to happen.  I could tell you’re going to say more “counter arguments” or other things but I’m not going to say anymore things."

Also interesting tidbit, Black Myth: Wukong is not counted here because the publisher doesn’t participate in the data collection that is used in here (and in which I think all other German publishers participate), so that skews the numbers as well.

But I am happy to see that both Space Marine 2 and Lost Crown do well here, I really enjoyed Lost Crown and am bummed that it was not more successful overall.

Finally, we Germans sure love our Farming simulations! Farming simulator 25 (which is here listed under its German name „Landwirtschafts-Simulator 25“) is already number four on the year-end charts for 2024 and it was relased in mid-november, so it had maybe a month of sales to get that high up.

I even get a bad star wars game being on the list because it is still starwars.

The same goes for the 'german work simulator' because...come on the entire genre is named that for a reason

  
but skull and bones? The notorious ripoff that is universally hated both because it is expensive but because it is a terrible shallow game. Now that is where I have to ask - Germany are you ok?"

1hwk2zb,2025-01-08,2025-01-08,"Palworld is pretty certainly missing, Black Myth Wukong is actually mentioned in the fine print of the chart as missing because the publisher did not provide market data.

Baldurs Gate 3 would technically also be missing from this chart as Larian doesn’t seem to report German market data separately either.

However it was a 2023 release for all platforms, so if it would have shown up, it would have shown in the 2023 list anyway, especially since the PC and PS5 versions (which are the most interesting ones for the German market, unit-wise) released fairly early in 2023.

I looked it up though and Baldurs Gate 3 doesn’t show in the 2023 publisher charts, so it was EA FC at the top again, followed by Hogwarts Legacy and Diablo 4"

1hwk2zb,2025-01-08,2025-01-08,"I mean, isn't that what they are doing? Copy paste the same game, change the lineup to the new players - make some menu colour changes and don't forget! Change 25 to 26!

It is just the rest off the world where it is just translated into farming."
1hwk2zb,2025-01-08,2025-01-08,I feel like the game was made primarily for the German market in collaboration with the original German Publisher [Astragon](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astragon). Look at the German wiki page and count the games named simulator.

Whole reporting is just a mess, especially since no-one is reporting outside of big publishers. And even if they are reporting, there are caveats (like Nintendo not reporting digital sales). From Steam Best Sellers there is also Manor Lords which could have ended up charting. Same for Stalker 2, Hades 2 or Gray Zone Warfare."
1hwk2zb,2025-01-08,2025-01-08,"Palworld would have not been included even if it was full release, because devs are not reporting numbers.

1hwk2zb,2025-01-08,2025-01-09,"he probably still enjoys the game a lot, obviously. You usually complain about stuff you care about and want to be as good as possible. 

and while spending 70€ on a very similar game every year might seems insane for us ""hardcore"" gamers in the end they probably got 400 hours of fun out of the new game every year so realistically a way better deal then we get out of a lot of games. 

Assuming they don't burn hundreds of euros on FUT at that point, is turns into a really bad deal realy quickly. 

what's the solution to this though, competition is impossible without licences. PES had to be way way way better than Fifa to have any shot, as soon as quality is similar to one with more licences will be the one everyone will play. And as far as gameplay on the pitch is concerned, i dont think there is room for a lot of meaningful improvement."

I am a little surprised that apparently Echoes of Wisdom seemed to do better in Germany than Astro Bot, even though Astro Bot was the much more acclaimed game, both were platform-exclusive and kind of a bit a flagship release for their respective platform.

Nintendo only reporting physical sales means that Mario Party Jamboree is probably underreported here, how much higher would it have climbed if digital sales were included as well?

Would they have duked it out with Farming Simulator 25, which is once again the hidden juggernaut in German sales charts, every time they release nobody except the hardcore fan base seems to care and every time they sell Call of Duty-level numbers in Germany which is just crazy lol.

And I have no idea who were all those people buying Skull and Bones, especially as I do not even remember seeing it on retail shelves anywhere.

In regards to games like Manor Lords or Hades 2 not reporting, I can kinda understand those, though. Early Access is tricky in regards to accounting for sales, because when exactly do you account them for in regards to unit sales? I mean revenue accounting I can kinda get doing this year-by-year during early access, but when do you account the game unit to be ""sold""? 

Maybe that was also the issue with Baldurs Gate 3, because while it was hugely successful, it was also in Early Access for like three years, do you account the units for the year the player got early access? Or when the game officially releases? And would we even be able to get the early access numbers for reporting?"

1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,"What I did like is the way the world was built to show how people survived going on. The small western style town where Ellie lives, the stadium that has become a fortress for humans to survive, the cult on the island building up. Though, I admit, the cult on the island didn't feel explored enough. It just felt weird to bringing them into the story to me. What I loved too is just the way the world is built to show how things have decayed, the buildings laying over, collapsed. And adding in all the things you can find to add extra story. I also enjoying the combat. The whole effort into building a game that has a real feeling world, one that you can totally be involved in is something I always love in games. I do like that the game builds on the first, making it even bigger. 

What I didn't care much for was the story in a lot of ways. I get it is a revenge story to start and ends showing that revenge is an empty journey, or that is how i saw it. But I thought it odd that Abby goes to track down the man who killed her father, dragging her friends along, out into the world and out into unknown danger. Or that she manages to find him what seems too easily. I get wanting revenge but at the same time...in a world like that, it seems like a fools errand. At the same time, the whole revenge tour of Ellie just ruined her for me. She throws away everything and anything and becomes a serial killer? Another thing that was lost to me was the sense of tension and survival from the first. It just seemed less about trying to live and more about trying to kill, often violently and excessively for revenge rather then survival.

Would I like to see a third part, continuing Ellie's story? I think so. I think that they way the game ended, it seems like there needs to be a circle of that comes around to redemption, a point where Ellie becomes the Joel character. Honestly, having built such a vast in game world, it seems like there are other places to explore, other things to see. That could be fun with Ellie. But at the same time, I wonder how the rest of the world might fair. Does it look the same everywhere? Are other places more stable? Less stable? Does the country as a whole start to rebuild, come back together? And do they ever find that cure/treatment they were trying to get in the first one? I have this weird feeling that one part of the story would be someone slowly discovering that they did find a cure at the cost of killing untold numbers of people to their horror."

It's better to make my opinion based on my own playthrough. I enjoy the game a lot now, but I'm glad I waited for it. I guess this experience has taught me to be a little more open minded in hindsight, which I guess is why I have a certain bond with this game"
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,"Yeah I played games that are tragedies as well, I just don't think this is a good one that's all."
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,"While i think the game is very good, i think it's so smug to always think games are power fantasies and TLOU2 made some genius move by killing a main character. Sure it's surprising, but i don't think it's that special tbh."
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-13,"I fully agree! I kinda wish it wasn't 3 days as Ellie, then 3 days as Abby, but apart from that, I adore the game so much. I also really enjoy playing as both Ellie and Abby"
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,"These people with such flimsy arguments for why they hate the game are just arguing in bad faith.  They're influenced by all the other brainwashed people who got mad there were lesbians and trans characters.  Don't waste your time refuting their points, they will always have a braindead reason that logic doesn't apply to this case."
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,"How did no one tell you yet that you’re just blatantly false on that last statement 😂😂😂😂😂. Its astonishing that you can say THAT about its gameplay when part 2s gameplay was a fantastic overhaul of the previous basic ass mechanics of the first one. Story issues aside, I think you’re genuinely dogshit at the combat in game bro cause no way you saying that shit when I feel this game is one notch under mgs v in gameplay."
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,Taking 3 playthroughs to platinum a game that only takes one tells me everything I need to know.
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-13,Yall just downvote anything 😭 I swear people on Reddit are so lackluster in braincells
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,Nerd alert
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,"Well, that would put you in the minority on this one, and that's okay too."
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-13,Same!
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-13,"Well i am bothered by political agendas too tbh. Tho, Joel's death has nothing to do with it. You just don't have to ""go soft"" to just lack once and die"
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,"What an insane reply, you alright mate?"

1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,nah bro you just ass at a singleplayer game. cheers mate 🍻
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,The platinum takes 1.5 playthroughs. You took double that. 👍
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,[deleted]
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,"A. Not required for the platinum. 
B. Sounds like you really hated the game."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"It has about the same amount of action as the first one, if not more."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"You're in the most ""open world"" portion of that game which does not last long."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,Oh it gets more intense very soon
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"The pace definitely picks up, especially after you shelter in the theater and start going through the different days."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"Depends.

Did you think Last of Us Part 1 was exciting?

No? Then it probably won't.

Yes? Then it absolutely is.

There is nothing less exciting about 2 than 1.

So it all depends on how you liked 1."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,I played these games back to back finally last year.. highly recommend to continue on and the game definitely picks up.
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,finished Part 2. DIdnt like it. I prefer first part overall.
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"Not really, and it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on...and on."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"Kinda. But there's a lot more boring stuff. But there are some sections that are fucking amazing. But again, then more boring shit."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"Yes, the action picks up"
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,Once you start crawling with bow in your hands things will be much more exciting
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"The story takes time to get going, but once you reach the midpoint, you will be able to appreciate the gameplay more. The open world sections are more about relaxing and finding things, but they won't last long."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-04,Ye
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-07,"It does pick up, bu then you basically restart the game as you switch to another character. It's really tough to keep going when you are back at square one, so you might want to drop it before you get there."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"Depends on how you view ""exciting"". If you're expecting guns blazing super fast paced action then no. But there are some really amazing stealth sections with humans and infected. And the story picks up as well."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,All the excitement is gone after the first hour.
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,That part felt uninteresting to me and it’s my all time favorite game.
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,It has tons of great segments
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"no

its a playable movie void of gameplay, watch a playthorugh and you experienced everything there is to it"
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"Yeah I wasn't too big a fan of the open world sections in terms of pure gameplay, but I did enjoy the little story beats that it showcased. Later on it gets WAY more intense, its not even comparable."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"Yes it does. The initial Seattle parts don't have much going on. Then you go to a theater and that's sort of your base area and you go out to different missions/areas of the city after that. 

It's not always guns blazing, Last of Us should be played quietly and stealthily when possible to conserve your resources. So slow down and take it all in"
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"If you're excited by extreme boredom, then it's super exciting"
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"Not much happening? In the TLoU Part 2? When are you ""just riding around"" and ""needs me to press a few buttons now and again""? Care to point out the specific section?  Sounds like bullshit to me."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,The only good thing is the combat sequences.
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,What games do you like?
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,Did you play part 1???
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,Why are 95% of the comments here downvoted?
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,10/10 boring - game reviews
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,Tried to play it on the hardest difficulty… highly do not recommend. Every bad guy becomes an expert marksman and all you have is one bullet and your left shoe to defend yourself.
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"Having played the first one and getting the “I’m just playing a movie” vibe is a little weird to me.  The two games are very much structured the same way.

That said, it’s just time for you to put Part 2 down."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,Do people really have this small an attention span that you put the game down 1 hour after the intro to ask reddit what the game is like? For real now?
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"Yeah, whether or not part 2 was better than part 1 overall remains polarising. But there are a few moments in 2, at least from a gameplay perspective that absolutely top part 1. Two sections involving boss battles (won't go into more detail to avoid spoilers even if it is a 4 year old game) were extremely intense. And there were a couple of jump scares that were extremely memorable.

Was the game possibly too long - I'd say yes. But the gameplay absolutely had some massive peaks"
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,It's one of those nono games you're not allowed to talk about.
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-04,On maximum diffixulty you cant really fight enemies like a shooter. You have to use stealth whenever you can.
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"Dude, my schedule allows me like 1-2 hours per week, if I'm lucky, to game. Small attention span? Get out of here with your judgmental BS."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"This game will take you literally a year to beat, if you can't hang for anything short of 1 hour of nonstop action, then this game isn't for you."
1ci52wk,2024-05-02,2024-05-02,"What? It takes 20 hours to beat, by most estimates I found. That would take me a few months. Fine."
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"I just finished this a couple of days ago. It's a ride. I went in thinking it would be just another sequel.

It was the first time I finished a game and had to take a minute, blank screen, glaze-eyed, to just process the experience.

Enjoy."
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Looks like the first one?
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Hope you fans get HBO just to watch the series.... If you don't already have it wait till more episodes come out so you'd only pay for a month
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,This game is why I want a ps5 ( I am a die hard Microsoft person).  Hope you have tons of fun
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-19,I'm so jealous. I just finished it last week and I'd love to go back and experience it fresh again.
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,prepare for an emotional journey. the story will stay in your mind for loooong time
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"Please help me understand. Never once have I started a new game and thought, ""I should snap a photo and post this to Reddit. People will want to know."" What's your thinking behind this post?"
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Nice I just started the first game and am dealing with the Hunters now.
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"Have fun, the gameplay is amazing."
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,just started on „grounded“. after the first 2 hours i realised this is going to be a trip trough hell and back. wish me luck.
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,I loved it so much
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Amazing game. Word of advice...think both sides of the coin. Enjoy your time!
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"The only advice I give is don't listen to a lot of comments good or bad, and experience this for yourself, A lot of people hate this game. Not sure why, personally this is in my top 5 gaming experiences of all time, and I'm an Xbox guy"
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Enjoy it!
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,You’re in for a treat
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"first time? I hope no one spoils it for you, you're in for a treat"
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"This game was and still is more next gen than most next gen games. Someone described its gameplay as dynamic set pieces and I think that's really apt. Even the most basic encounters feel impressive and tense as a set piece only its unscripted, normal gameplay. And the actual set pieces are on another level. I think it'll be a while before we see something similar"
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Good luck! I started too
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,have fun on this rollercoaster!
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Absolute masterpiece
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"Hope you have fun! Enjoy the game and tell us what you think, your likes and dislikes. It was a very polarizing game but go into it with your own opinion"
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,My condolences
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,You are in for a treat 💜 i wish i could wipe my memory so i can play this game all over again 😞
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Great game.  Still don't understand all the hate around it.
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"Game play in part 2=phenomenal,  the story kinda sucked tho..."
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Congrats
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,alright
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"Yaaay, depression."
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"Remember everything great about the story in 1? Now take a big shit on it and light it on fire, 2 is nowhere near that level. Combat, visuals etc are all great, but the story is the biggest pile of steaming garbage since I can remember. So long as you accept that you'll have a good time"
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"bruh who cares, who even are u?"
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,dont play part 2. it will only sully your memories from part 1. Plus its a shit game  :-P
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,When pc
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"Super gameplay and immersion, shitty story. Still is a good game to have as experience"
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-19,oh no
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"Carefull, golfclubs are instakills for some characters."
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,It forces you to play the „evil“ character… that sucks
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Try not to be too disappointed
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-19,For the love of all that is holy put it down and forget it exists it will completely shit on everything the last of us 1 built on
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-19,play persona and youll get a real experince lmao
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Game starts with a flashback to the first.
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Recap
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"Happy cake day! Also yes the series so far is pretty good, few nitpicks but overall I’m dying for episode 2"
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,[removed]
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-19,I can watch the series on my Xbox but can’t play the games Sony might as well let us play the games on Xbox
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-19,"Haven't played the games, but yea the series is looking pretty good."
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"Please help me understand. Never once have I seen someone's post and thought ""I don't get why they're happy or excited, I'd better demand an explanation."""
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,To share the excitement and start a nice conversation with fellow gamers i guess. Seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to do.
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"Yea, I don't get it either. Probably just hoping yo get some karma from a popular game. Either that or OP thinks everything he does is newsworthy."
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Happens with Skyrim regularly
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,My god rollercoaster might be an understatement
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,I would say 1 was a masterpiece. Found 2 a little bit of mess. Felt like the game could have ended after the Theatre part.
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,I liked it when Abby took it from behind.
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Why do you think it sucks? I thought it was one of the most compelling and emotional storylines of any game that I've played.
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-19,"It's just a non-sensical revenge plot.  Both characters are absolute mass murderers and everyone is shitty in it.  I kind of liked it while playing it (even though it was way too long, should have ended on the first day 3) then thinking through it the character development and plot was just not good"
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,People dislike truth.
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Maybe never
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,You understand all the characters are morally grey right?
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"There really are no good or evil protagonists in both games. Spoilers ahead...


Joel was literally a smuggler/drug dealer for 20 years before his journey with Ellie which ended in him massacring a building full of scientists and doctors preventing them from making a vaccine for the infection which leads to Part 2... 

One of those scientists/doctors was Abby's dad the only person with the knowledge to create a vaccine she got her vengeance by murdering Joel which in turn made Ellie go on a killing spree murdering all of Abby's friends including a pregnant woman. So all that being said none of the playable characters are inherently good or evil they've all done some pretty messed up shit."
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"You play an ""evil"" character the whole time, in both games 👍"
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,why do so many people don‘t understand what this brilliant game is going to teach us?
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Me 2!
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"Wanting to be paid for the consumption of a good or service that was produced at great expense is a ploy?

10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,Omg why would someone use social media for social media purposes!!! I thought this was a strict no memes no fun sub. I can't believe someone would want to post about a game they are playing in a gaming sub. What has the world come to
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"They force you to try and emotionally invest in a character that noone cares about or knows. Even after completing the game I still don't give a fuck about muscle girl or her sidekick. I felt as though the lesbian romance was a contrived attempt at woke bullshit noone needed or wanted. Shit felt forced to me. The ending offers no kind of resolution or closure, just a bleak and depressing finish to a story that could have been better told. I'm glad you enjoyed the game, I did as well. Just my opinion though."
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,She’s got a pretty good handicap
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"So what did it teach you?? Honest question no hate here friend. I'm simply curious, after completion I was kinda depressed for a while."

Damn. That's actually kinda reasonable to isn't it?"
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-19,"Right, everyone should use reddit as if it were Twitter."
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"Huh. I didn't feel any of it was contrived or forced. Ellie was shown to be a lesbian in *Left Behind,* 6 years before the release of Part 2. I thought the Abby's story was incredible and was totally drawn in and sympathetic to her perspective. So much so that at the end of the game,>! I dodged and dodged Abby's attacks, hoping  they would stop fighting. !<"
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-19,"> woke bullshit 

There it is!"
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"here a few points from what i was thinking about this game. just my opinion.

- always take care about your friends, u never know what could happen (joels death).

- honesty is important. 

- life is not (always) easy.

- ellie wasn‘t able to forgive joel, she wanted but suddenly it was to late.

- when it comes to survival, people do bad things.

- who is bad is in the eye of the beholder. for abby joel was the bad guy, for ellie abby was.

- no matter how bad somwthing is, people can change or at least try to.

- no matter what happens, keep moving forward.

btw: just the museum part is an emotional blast."
10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-19,"why have u been depressed? i mean yes, the ending was hitting hard. but for me it was cause this story was over."

10ez9eu,2023-01-18,2023-01-18,"Fair I'm definitely not knocking anyone that enjoyed it, hell I enjoyed the game just not certain parts of the story. Perhaps my perspective will change on a second play thru."

i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-08-01,So entire buildings collapsed but a fucking PS3 survives?
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-08-01,How fuckin loud were they?
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-08-01,What did you do to pass time while in search of these?
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,Not ONE switch or Xbox? Must be a parallel-universe...where Sony is the one and the only.
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,I also found the [script](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B5n_K2Co3Jw/maxresdefault.jpg) for the story of TLOU2 in the game
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,Yea but did you manage to find a good story anywhere?
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,Yeahhhhh... Kinda shows you how up their own ass Sony is.
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,"Whitney, I think her name was"
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,She was just tryin to play some hotline miami
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,"Fuck her, she shouldn't have made a move."
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,And the one room in that same apartment has some warhammer figures and a little paint desk!
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,Hopefully whenever they do they'll put highend PC with burnt out RGB cases in place of those PS3s ;-)
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-08-01,That's because when the building was collapsing they only had time for the important stuff...... So they grabbed their Xbox consoles and GTFO
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-08-01,I did not search for them I just came across them while looking around
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,It is a first-party Sony title... putting competing systems in the game would not be smart.
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,All companies do this. The early Pokemon games had an N64/GameCube/Wii in the player's room at home
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,Is this your first time hearing about an Easter egg?..

17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,Who needs new games when you can just spit & polish the 'old' ones and people will gobble it up?
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,"Genuine question, didn’t the original game come out only three years ago? How much has changed for it to be considered a “remastered” edition?

The game looked incredible to begin with. Or is this just hype for the Season 2 of the HBO show and the eventual release of the PC port?"
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,Great! Any word on the remaster for the remake from last year?  I’m concerned that Part 2 will look slightly better now and the transition will be too jarring.
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,I honestly cant go through it again. Ellie's arc is so dumb. I was rooting for the antagonist to win the whole time.
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,"Then the combo 1&2 pack soon to follow, “both remastered for PS5!”"
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,They can just polish it up on ps5 with an update? Gotta charge for it?
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,"Considering that you're gonna pay only $10 for a Remaster + New Content Expansion + Lost Levels + No Return + New Outfits ( *and more* ) it's a pretty fair price. But I won't pay for it, cuz I'm playing the game right know ( *just got the play as Abby* ) and I'm not interested to start all over again, so maybe in the future 🙃"

17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,I feel like this just came out last year
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,"The TLOU1 was an unnecessary remastering, and this is just pathetically unwanted. Ellie is one of the most unlikable characters in gaming and doesn't even have an interesting game play to make it worth putting up with her.

If you can't be someone worth rooting for, at least be someone interesting to watch. Ellie alternates between making the worst decisions it is possible to make and hurting everyone around her, and being just boring as hell.

I'm not trying to be contrarian when I say TLOU2 was the most miserable gaming experience of it's era, and polishing the turd a little more won't make it not a turd."

17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,"It came out only 3 years ago. 

And yet nobody was crying about Spider-Man remastered which came out 2 years after its initial release. Or about ghost of Tsushima directors cut which came out 1 year after its initial release.

Would you have been complaining about it if they named it “directors cut” instead of “remastered”?"
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,"Its just a cash grab, I really doubt they can visually improve a game from that little ago.. nor did I notice anything different from part 1 remaster port."
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,well part one remastered looks much better than part 2
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,"They did a free PS5 patch, this one is adding a bunch of new things and upgrades"
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,Apparently your save carries over

17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,no
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,"Yep. The only caveat being that you need to have the PS4 disc in your console, so if you have the digital only PS5 you may be out of luck."
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,"Oh wow, indev levels sound cool as hell. I’ve watched some behind the scenes on the uncharted games so I’m really curious about what stage of development those stages will be presented in. More than enough value for the extra $10 in my eyes."
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,"It's only $10 and they added a bunch of improvements and new modes and features

Edit: clown above/below blocked me, not sure why people expect developers to work for free"
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,part one remaster looks a lot better than part 2 regular

17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,"You probably think David Cage games are masterpieces of drama.

Getting hurt a lot, being sad, doing morally questionable things, and/or being a member of a minority don't make a character deep or compelling.

They devote long cutscenes and excessive dialogue just to confirm how awful Ellie is, even switching to the antagonist's perspective to drive it home.

This game is just unnecessarily long, and most of that length is either miserable or boring. You could cut out seven straight hours of ""gameplay"" and lose nothing of importance.

These glorified movies really need to die off already."

And you're lapping it up. 🤦"
17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,Why would they add a bunch of new content for free?

vkct7o,2022-06-25,2022-06-25,Wow! It’s pretty great. I’m not sure I get the choice to draw a tiny hand with a toothpick though.

vkct7o,2022-06-25,2022-06-25,Thank you. It’s my hand in the picture. A lot of people are confused. I thought it would help show the scale of the drawing ✍️ 🙃

Incredible portrait!"
vkct7o,2022-06-25,2022-06-25,Thank you so much! 😁😊
vkct7o,2022-06-25,2022-06-25,"Personally, I believe it demonstrates the artist's dedication to the craft. It also helps one to determine the size of the drawing. But by no means does it suggest it's a better or worse piece of artwork. Documenting my hours helps me see my improvement. For example, my first time drawing a new texture might take a long time as I'm working out what tools to apply first, but as I practise my skills, it may take less time for a new drawing as I know the process of creating a certain texture. I hope that makes sense :)🤞"
vkct7o,2022-06-25,2022-06-26,"Haha 😂 a lot of people said that, I should have left the image in colour. Maybe that would have helped and caused less confusion 🙃"
vkct7o,2022-06-25,2022-06-25,Lip textures and creases are one of the best spots in this thing. It’s wonderful.

vkct7o,2022-06-25,2022-11-03,"It’s like the equivalent of how long someone dedicated their life to playing an instrument.  I know there are prodigies that require less time to master an instrument, but a simple detail that, IMHO should not be so annoying, is just another metric to describe the high level of craft a person puts into the work."

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Weird times we live in..

Kingdom come Deliverance has taken crap for not having any black people/gay people in their game.. a game set in 1400 Bohemia, Czech republic area. When a Czech gaming developer made the game, and brought on a crap ton of historians to make it accurate.

No matter what, people who think politics need to be in every aspect of life are going to have people on both political sides bitching about something. "
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Fact: People are fucking morons. 
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,People will always complain about things they find challenges their view of the world. On the other hand twitch chat went wild it seemed like they were all on board with it. So there will always be people who agree and people who disagree. Such is human nature. 
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I really feel bad for anyone that would have an issue with it. It’s part of her chatacter & development.

Besides, most people don't care at all. That means the majority of people, at least in gaming, don't care and that you really don't have to fight with the few remaining bigots. Let them die out. There's always going to be one asshole, try to enjoy your life anyways. "
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,If you're offended by such an inconsequential plot point. You got problems.
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"They complain because they are not used to it. Less than 4% of the population identify as LGBTQ. Thus, people don’t grow up having that mindset prevalent. That should not be that hard to understand. A lot is if it pure instinct. 

The important bit is that in the West, it stops there. Nobody gets hurt. They just complain. The solution is to let them. People need to get to the point of acceptance organically.

It’s a process. Humanity isn’t naturally benevolent. Pretending we are and passing judgment on those that are “intolerant” is the rock you put in your own path. 
The bear would eventually go to sleep, less you keep poking him with sticks. "
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I honestly don't know how some of these gamers manage to survive in the real world where real women and lesbians actually exist.
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-13,They’re jealous because both women in the trailer got a hotter woman than they’ll ever get.
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The only people I have seen upset was the disney channel, this sounds like you are just creating an evil entity to fight"

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,People will always have something to complain about I personally think the male white military ultra alpha main character profiles are incredibly boring.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Some people are hell bent on being the last of us 2 accept that gay is normal enough to be in a triple-a gaming title
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Nah there isn’t. They would just find reasons to throw a shit fest over that too. 
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Honestly the only people I've seen complaining about this are Facebook users, some Twitter posts, and Youtube

The 3 sites where people complain about pretty much *everything*. They could be referencing some company giving out $4 million to some charity and people on those sites would be furiously typing away on these sites complaining how the money is going to the ""wrong"" charity or how it ""wasn't enough"".


"
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The intended sentiment means nothing when you have a small portion of the audience who can't accept two women kissing.

In the age of the internet a relatively small focused group of whingers can sound much louder than they would if they had to put any actual effort into whinging via public outlets.

It's also safe to assume that those who don't really care are just getting on with their lives and aren't legitimising the naysayers by arguing what is essentially a petty prejudice.

"
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It wasent upsetting that she kissed a girl, it was uncomfortable how they focused on it so much.  Like if it was with a guy it would have felt just as weird to me. "
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Doesn't bother me at all but it does seem like people make choices to just seem progressive now and that's not a good reason to do it.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I thought Elie could do better. 

That girl seemed like a bitch and was doing it for attention/to get that guy jelly and possibly drive a wedge between the two.(Elie and Asian dude are probably bros) 

Elie being a horny kid, who hasnt been with anyone b4 because all she ever does is kill people or has had people try to kill her, doesnt know how to act. 

This girl seems to be using her and Elie is just happy someone is finally looking at only her.(in Elies mind) Dont get me wrong, Elie probably does like her but is too inexperienced to pick this up.

Also i dont like the girls nose!!!

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I agree it's no surprise with that franchise, the era and setting of it allows for that kind of character development. 

However I get why people are pissed off with the ""strong wamyn"" theme that's been going on with so many other franchises. I also get why others are pissed off at Devs appropriating European history and culture and then warping it to suit their own agenda. 

The vast majority of consumers of this genre of video games are still males of European descent. Yet videogame Devs are creating content and characters that don't represent them. 

And before anyone says I'm crying about it, I'm not, I'm just responding to OP. I literally don't care, I just don't buy games that don't interest me.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I mean if it makes you feel better I haven't seen anybody complain about that
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Very true. No I don’t expect (and wouldn’t make any sense) to see people in a region where none such people existed if the game is going for historical accuracy, which I know that game is."

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This is indisputable.
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,True dat. Don’t get me wrong. The majority I’ve seen speak positively. I just saw some comments made on Neil Druckmann’s Twitter and on YouTube 
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I felt like it was hinted at in The Last Of Us when she speaks about how she was infected and the reaction to it that her and her friend had, which suggested to me that there was some form of romantic connection between them. However, in Left Behind this was confirmed as definitely being a romantic connection. "

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I know. I’m just venting a bit I guess. It just angers me is all
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Especially when they showed THAT fucking sick gameplay? Who tf focused on the kiss when the gameplay looked that awesome? Welcome to 2018 though. If a gay character is going to make people miss out on whats for sure going to be a gaming masterpiece thats on them.  
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Probably because those gamers only exist in your head

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Exactly. If a game allows me to create my character, I usually try to make it look like me. But if the game forces me to play as a woman, another race, or a gay person, I be like “Alright, proceed.”"
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Well, if this is, what it takes to move on, then be it. Stupid humans can't accept what is just a fact of life.
Nobody is writing articles about ""blacks are allowed to sit in the front of the bus nowadays"" or ""women are allowed to vote"" anymore. The same will be true of the fact, that there is and will be diversity in games."
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-16,"It's not going to be just that. Mild bigots and their sympathizers (people like you) will hyper-focus on that one aspect to complain about, whilst accusing everyone else of making a big deal about it. 

And for the record, the existence of people who constantly complain about the inclusion of LGBT people are exactly why gaming journalist will welcome this aspect of the game. Clearly, we still have a long way to go towards the acceptance of gay people in society, and  no, that's not a weird thing to desire.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The Last Lesbian is the best gayme showcased in 20gayteen so far. EllieGBT looks like a different person though. Dunno wtf they did to her face but she looks totally different from the first trailer they showed.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,True. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised. I just thought that her sexuality was already a done deal

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"What games are you referring to that appropriate European history? Honestly curious, not being flippant. As to your point about strong women, is it any different than games featuring strong men? If the character is to be strong, and happens to be a woman, I honestly don’t think that matters.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Well, I guess we might see it as them being assholes, but from their point of view, the problem may be that devs are letting politics enter the gaming sphere and dictate how to set up their games and characters. Which, although that claim doesn't have any ground, hasn't been disproved. And we probably don't think it needs to be disproved so it never will be. "
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It might make people uncomfortable who were invested in the character. It's a character decision that they don't agree with like if a tv show kills off someone they like.

Why do you feel that everyone should follow your train of thought?.

I don't care either way, it's a game!, but irl, other people's sexual practices don't affect me and as long as I'm not involved, why should I care?

When people tell me I have to support their world view, that is where I draw the line. You do you and I will do me. I don't ask for support in what I think or do, don't try and force me to agree with what you think.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah, the numerous posts I've seen on here and other sites of gamers complaining about females in video games must have been hallucinations you silly plank."

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Excellent point. I guess my distaste for it isn't that it's not reflective of my life but more so that it's the cookie cutter safe default for the majority of games. Video and cinema are easily considered art but if 95% of the art at the louve was all Jackson pollack style paintings people would think art is stale. 

I like variety personally and in the art of gaming it seems like too many are willing to go with the status quo because they don't want backlash but that's not what art is about you know? "
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Thats not much.. I wonder how polygon will make an article out of 2 tweets
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,And The Last of Us has very good writing imo
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I haven't watched all of the E3 content to be able to comment fully on this year's offerings. However off the top of my head we have DICE with Battlefield 1 and their vast vast over representation of minorities for European factions. The Ottoman Empire had the palest troops on offer which is ridiculous. The same scenario is developing with Battlefield V but in an even more farcical fashion.

The I recall the Witcher 3 developer being taken to task at the lack of minority representation in his game, to which he responded that the lore and inspiration for his game comes from a European standpoint. 

Then we have the Gear of War franchise which no one ever cares about being multi racial because it's set in a future universe. But they've added this pointless strong woman trope character out of nowhere.

Then we have the new Assassin's Creed franchise where we have African Spartans in the trailer. Historically something that would never ever existed because of how staunchly focused on blood purity the Spartans were. 

Its just a current theme in all entertainment platforms of late. I've seen the BBC produce TV shows that are appropriating my ethnic culture and having black characters within the  stories of my heritage. Around the time Dunkirk was released i remember the onslaught of articles calling Christopher Nolan a racist for having a predominantly white production because he was maintaining historical accuracy. 

To be honest I fucking hate talking about race, sexuality, religion etc but it's pushed so much nowadays in everything that I'm left with no choice. I just don't buy things that are actively against what I was born as but some people seem to have an issue with that. I don't care what other people buy but a lot of people seem to care about what I don't want to buy and why.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I've yet to see any evidence that ""diversity"" is a good thing. All jokes aside the ""diversity is our strength"" meme often stinks of desperation at the futility of a nations demographic situation. In fact all evidence points towards ""diversity"" being a negative in terms of social cohesion and integration.

Artists, authors and other creatives have been selling their products and creations in regions other than their own for centuries. You don't need a ""diverse team"" to sell that. There is no need to promote diversity within existing companies, if you want a real diversity of choice then publishers would concentrate on acquire new Devs in developing markets. That's how you get a true experience, not this artificial ""multicultural"" insult that seeks to pander to the perceptions of the white, middle class leftists that often get to set the agenda in these companies.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-17,"Was outstanding. But, people see what they want. If they wanna focus on a kiss from a developed and established character, instead of how outstanding that gameplay preview was, thats on them. "
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,you mean sites that turn 12 tweets into an article? or other posters that make up large reactions to things that never happened? or posts taken out of context like the strawman articles about BFV where they lied about what people were upset about?
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Violence is fine, lesbian kiss is not. "
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Hard to say, the whole ""art needs to be about backlash"" kinda scream marxist vibe, its not something I generally agree with as that view tends to ignore the heart of a work for the sake of it being controversial, which when the inclusion of LGBT seems to be the hot topic of the year wouldn't doing something against LGBT be the controversial statement?

When you look at Uncharted series on the surface its very cookie cutter even parts below the surface are but the heart put into the work makes it shine more than trying to make it buck the trend

I have nothing against variety and for a large portion we are lacking it, one if my favorite games is Journey, I just find variety for the sake of variety ends up being poorly written or ends up just a cookie cutter on being different a lot of the time

Sadly this years line up still comes out rather unoriginal with many of the companies doing sequels or following trends or appealing to money"

Are you one of those liberals in training? You know the type, they're the ones that hate anyone that has a differing view to the one that they hold and would actually go out from their college campuses etc to do harm to people that don't think like they do.

Seems that you're the one taking issue with what people think about what people think, what may not be an issue for you, is for other people.

If this was a real life scenario rather than a game that people play I could partially understand your soap boxing.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I totally see what your saying and my point wasn't that art needs to be risqué for the sake of being risqué I also feel that takes away from the artists intent. I just feel like we've gotten so used to the same thing over and over and it's boring. Not to say uncharted isn't good. It's great but that game series also has a very solid story and tells it well. Uncharted is a bit of an outlier but a great counter argument. How do you feel about this lesbian kiss is it shoving propaganda down people's throats? Does it not bother you at all? Or are you somewhere in the middle?

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Honestly I never got that far in the original so I don't know her full story or character development, is this out of left field? I cant really say for sure, since I am a lesbian I know what opinion people tell me I am supposed to have whenever this topic comes up, but its all about writing for me really if it comes across hamfisted or tacked on for the sake of it I will have issues, take mass effect andromeda for example, the engineer just blurts out they are trans for no reason with no real context or forethought put into it.

With Ellie it doesn't appear that being a lesbian is the be all end all of the character or completely come out of nowhere like if they randomly made Joel gay despite there being no inclination, history or signs and him having had a wife in the past"

Hell if they made a story compelling enough and relevant throw in someone who is a furry I don't care. It's the tacked on stuff with no compelling reason that grates me.

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"After Microsoft's presentation I just can't see how people think Sony nailed this presentation. Largely trailers for games with already seen, little gameplay of the games we HAVEN'T seen, bad pacing (music solos? Really?) and not many titles shown, lots of technical problems...

This was on the same level as Square Enix and Ubisoft to me."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I am probably in the minority, but I thought that conference was pretty meh bordering on bad"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Spider man is gonna be awesome, thanks alot for this dude"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ghosts looks like shadow of mordor in Japan, so that looks fun. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Less than 20 minutes of games once you put in all the music solos; unexplained music bits; how could anyone think this won? It had some quality in it but overall? Lukewarm
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Honestly, I think Sony losing to Xbox at this years E3 is a good thing for us gamers. It gives Xbox a better ""push"" forward in the race so Sony isn't dominating, and if a company dominates, they stop trying (...like here, i guess). Of course, Sony won this gen 100%, but competition is good for the industry. Sony might be in the position where they *have* to make a new LBP game or a Jak game, and who doesn't want that?

With that said though, wow. No MediEvil, only 3 new games, probably not all exclusive to Sony, and Sony's Twitch crashed. 

Bethesda (TES fan here) > Xbox > Sony > Ubisoft > Square > EA

Here's hoping Nintendo can redeem this E3. Personally hoping for a new F-Zero."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Want to give you a big thanks! Really love all of these you've done! One more conference to go!
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Great looking games, but terrible conference IMO. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Your bias definitely shows.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Man that was quick. Thanks!
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ghost of Tsushima, Nioh 2, Spiderman all looked sick. Control is interesting looking as well. Solid overall."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Game reveal wise Microsoft killed it this year.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Look, admittedly the conference definitely picked up in pace after they moved rooms.

But seriously? *That* much time on TLOU? A fifteen minute intermission with Sony's own fake ""press roundtable""? Musical concerts are nice but only when you have momentum. No release dates except for RE2? Just four showcase titles that felt super scripted? No developers talking about their games? No other announcements?

This year was Sony's conference to lose--they had so much momentum and such strong drive behind them. And then they blew it.

Nintendo not factored in, my current ranking is definitely as follows:

1. Ubisoft - Killed it in every sense, except I wish more new game announcements happened.
2. Microsoft - Tons of focus on the games, the console's ability to make playing games easier, and acquisitions that will make the next generation WAY easier on them. I preferred Ubisoft, but Microsoft was damn close.
3. Bethesda - Pretty good. Some high moments, some low moments, some great reveals, and some points where we were left with two many worrying questions that shouldn't have been there.
4. Sony - Good games content, but a clusterfuck of a show.
5. Square Enix - Basically nothing new, just trailers, and almost all repeats. Why did they even have a conference?
6. EA - Lolwut?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I was pretty underwhelmed.  The last of us and spider man looked good, none of the other games piqued my interest, really.  Hoping Nintendo has some surprises tomorrow."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Where the fuck was Red Dead
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Definitely a little bit biased with your overall review there. Games were good  of course but the random intermission and overly long instrumentals kind of killed the momentum.

A lot of the gameplay show also looks scripted with characters slowly walking into perfect set ups. Spiderman looked the best from a gameplay point of view I would say."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Spiderman: Arkham City﻿
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I'm sad
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Still no idea what the fuck is Death Stranding. No FFVII at all which is weird and a little concerning now. I suppose after KH3 they will talk about it more.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"To anybody complaining about no Red Dead Redemption 2:

There were no indications RDR2 would be shown. Rockstar doesn't do E3. They don't really like to share the spotlight with anybody else. I can understand you wanting to see something (because I do too), but it was never going to be there so you were setting yourself up for disappointment. I mean, maybe they'll show up in the next few days, but I wouldn't count on it."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Pretty boring considering how many of them we've known about and seen over and over. Last of Us still has no release date. What killed me the most was the lack of variety, other than KH3 and Trover, it felt like I was watching a bunch of really long movie trailers. They all are hyper realistic, story driven, third person and more zombies than I'd like to have in a single conference.

Don't get me wrong, they are astoundingly beautiful and will probably have great story and gameplay. It just felt a bit empty."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That was bad
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm actually playing Spiderman at Sony this week, it's ridiculously fun. Reminds me a lot of Prototype 2. Unlock new Spiderman skins as you level up. Really fun, coming from an Xbox gamer too."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That wasn't good.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Didnt expect Nioh 2. 1 was incredible, the combat was better than Souls/borne games, but the enemy variety could use some work. Hopefully they'll fix that up."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"As a fan of Eastern aesthetics and culture, I love how many games this year are going the feudal Japan route."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The games shown are looking great, and I'm sure they could have pulled together another dozen games that are 4-5 years away from completion and shocked the audience.

But honestly the structure and presentation of this show was awful. When they are sinking millions into putting this show on for the world why does it come off feeling like a rushed high school presentation? "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,RIP FF7 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I was disappointed by this one . It was the worst one for them in years . no real future games except control . I want to see future games too . Days Gone was a no show and RDR2 was a no show !!! 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"To be honest, I love showcase of gameplays than multiple trailers or teasers. At least I know what I'm getting with my money. Too many people are hyped up with a 3 mins scripted trailer but ended up getting a game that is no way comparable to the hype it garnered.  "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Thanks again u/Loffeno! 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I get what they were trying to do with the start but that intermission dragged and took away from the rest of the content even though the integration of the church setting into TLOU was sublime.

IMO, they should've started with Spider-Man and ended with TLOU. Spider-man is 3 months away and is prime for the start of your showcase and then you end with the long term AAA release. Nonetheless, the footage for both looked great

As for the rest, that Samurai Game looked amazing as did Control. Still not sure what Death Stranding is but it should be cool and atmospheric. KH3 adding pirates is terrific as well. 

The only game I didn't really care for was the Roiland game and I'm too young to have much hype for RE2.


I was hoping we would get information on 1 other superhero project; either Rocksteady's alleged Superman Game or Square's Avengers Project but that proved to be too high a hope. 

ALL in all, great footage but poor organisation and structure of a presentation. Bring on Nintendo!"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,After The Last of Us Part II showing it didn't matter what came next. I was happy.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Am I the only one who just doesn't get how TLOU is people's favorite game of all time? I think it was just so hyped and by the time I played it, it felt like a bit if a let down. I'll still play the sequel just can't get as hyped about it as others."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"If you missed it,  do yourself a favor and check out the gameplay demo from after the presentation. Can't find it on YouTube yet but it is beautiful. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You the real MVP for this break down. I totally forgot Sony's breifing was tonight
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Something to add is they said there will be New Game + in God of War during that intermission 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Here I am, just wishing Rocksteady would announce what they’re doing, ever, at all..."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The good... the games.  A couple of game I already knew I wanted, a couple that I might be interested in.  A couple meh games that looked pretty.

The bad... the over 2 hours it took them to show 10 games.  Could have done a lot better with the pacing getting to the meat of the presentation."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Based on this conference, is the next PlayStation going to be at the next E3?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Looking forward to Sony's new exclusive game: ""The Adventures of Flute-Man & Banjo-Boi"""
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Meh. Not a great conference, some good games but no surprises really. At the minute Xbox have still had the best conference, but of course Nintendo will probably steal the show yet again, can't wait til tonight!"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Why the fuck did they do that long intermission, I thought Sony knew how to layout things by now "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"After reading this chat, I genuinely don't understand the fighting over console exclusives and their value. I suppose I come from a weird place in the fight since I own both consoles anyway, but I still find the fighting over which console has better exclusives and wanting a ""winner"" between Xbox One and PS4 to be stupid. Do you need validation for your purchase decision?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Why is no one talking about re2?? They're remaking a classic from the ps1 era and it's freaking amazing! 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Ghost of Tsushima reminded me a lot of Assassin's Creed. I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Dying at all these people complaining about not being blown away by some big announcement when they literally said they weren't doing that. 

Edit: And what the fuck is with this whole obsession with you all and ""winning"" E3? Who the hell cares? Is it just something meaningless you can all beat your dicks about? "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,More spidey fuck yeah!
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Death Stranding stole the show. Looks amazing. My frustration on Silent Hills being cancelled has subsided.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You honest to goodness think Sony is winning E3?? I honestly wouldn't rate their show much above EA's to be totally honest. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Hearing that the inFamous guys are behind Ghost of Tsushima is very hype inducing. inFamous 1 and 2 were amazing games and i can't wait to see where they take this new IP.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm pretty suprised they didn't show more. Maybe they're being stretched thin for content inbetween E3, they're own show and Gamescom?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What’s “New Game+” when talking about a game? I’ve seen this a couple times this E3 and I’m not sure what that even means. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Only excited for Spider-Man 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,During the fake roundtable thing they straight up said not to expect any big announcements or surprises. They didn't lie about that at least.

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What the heck happened to Days Gone ? They showed the Game for the last 2 years and now they just throw some random frames of it into the VR Part ?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"These breakdowns should be pinned at the top instead the “official” mega thread where there’s no information and people just comment silly quotes that make no sense if you didn’t watch. Seriously though, thank you so much for making these breakdown posts."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"During ""twice stream crashed"" they showed Destiny 2 forsaken. Showing Cayde 6 being killed by the prince."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The first building people were sitting in was designed to look like the building from TLOU trailer, which made for a cool transition to the trailer.

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Resident Evil 2 blew everything from every conference out of the fucking water for me.

My favourite game of all time being completely remade, I can't fucking wait baby!!!!!!

"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"As someone without a leg in the race between Xbox and Sony neither really blew me away, Sony's conference however had too much cringe compared to Microsoft... the intermissions were beyond annoying the first time I just wanted to click away so I did and I came back after like 10 minutes and they were STILL on the fucking intermission! Over all so far my favorite conferences were Bethesda and Ubisoft just eaking out over Xbox sony wasn't nearly as bad as EA or Square enix tho."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Sure, if we ignore several 10 minute intermissions, and three concerts, it was ""non\-stop games""....

It took like 30\+ minutes to get to the first reveal. The format was ass. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I’m surprised no one is talking about the Resident Evil 2 remake! I’ve wanted this for so long. That game was one of the first games I played as a kid, and was by far my favorite Resident Evil game. 

Looks like the release date is fairly close too. Sooo excited. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,">Kingdom Hearts 3

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That last of us 2 gameplay was so Clean. I'm having a hard time believing that's actually gameplay.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I was very let down by Sony. Everything we see we already knew was coming. What is there to get excited about it?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This felt a lot like last years conference to me. A lot of games that look absolutely incredible but seem highly scripted and will most certainly receive a graphical downgrade prior to launch. Especially considering there weren’t even release dates. I want games that are coming this year, not a reason to look forward to next E3.

And where was Days Gone?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,More like the E3 Press Let Down
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Pretty lame

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,">Sony killed it as usual

I'm not a ""fanboy"" of any one platform as I'm happy to play on them all... but this was the worst presentation of this E3.

The games they showed were fine, but the presentation itself was just so bland.  A friend of mine pretty much nailed it \- ""this is like watching CNN's Election coverage"".

>Definitely winning E3 for me right now

I've got to strongly disagree.  There were no new big game reveals, no surprises, very little momentum, and minimal excitement.

Sony absolutely has some amazing games coming out in the next year, but I felt that they totally dropped the ball on firing up their fans with this presentation."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Every single game in that conference looked great. That was fantastic.

The pacing was awful though, that huge gap between TLOU and the rest of it was unacceptable.

The big highlights are:
E3's best KH3 trailer

Spider Man

Ghost of Tsushima was a very pleasant surprise, will definitely be following it

REmake 2"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,">Sony killed it as usual. 

Hahaha, are you kiddding. That was an insanely weak conference. You disgust me OP. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Saw that Fromsoftware logo then fuck up.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"""the rest of the show, it was non-stop games, literally no one talking on stage. ""

It was literally half the show at least it seemed of intermissions with them talking with people from the studios.  I personally didn't feel like they showed that much. Most of it was stuff we already knew about. It felt as if they didn't have a lot to show, so they used tons of filler content like the interviews, music, instruments, etc."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I didn't much care for it. That intermission really killed the pacing, and made me not even care about Ghost. Control looked alright. Resident Evil 2 made me most excited. The Rick & Morty-esque game didn't look good. Nioh 2 was such a cocktease. Death Stranding looked really good. And Spider-Man as the closer pissed me off."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,For a person who doesn't own a ps4 it was fairly poo :/
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It was terrible; the intermission was ridiculous, it dragged on way longer than any conference showing so little has any right to, and we didn't even learn much. The Last of Us II will be great, but the trailer looked pretty scripted and didn't tell us *that* much. Ghosts of Tsushima is probably gonna be good, but nothing in that showcase made it look fresh or unique at all compared to all the other open world games everyone is making nowadays. Death Stranding still feels like we know just as little about it as in 2016, so it feels a bit odd we spent so damn long on it. Lastly, Spiderman was the best they did actually showing something off, but most it didn't seem that new compared to what we knew from last year. Everything else was glossed over extremely quickly."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Terrible conference. I am a sony fanboy all day long and i was SO HYPED for this one. Felt like a big let down. They just threw some trailers on a screen. Didn't even talk about thr new titles at all and kept subjecting us to that horrible fucking intermission panel. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I think if Square combined with Sony, it would turn out much better. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Holy hell this was a bad conference. Glad they at least had Ghost of Tsushima because all the rest is anywhere from mediocre to downright abysmal.

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Bethesda won E3 this year for me. Their trailers and announcements were far more exciting than than anything Sony showed.

(Besides Bethesda, but 76 doesn't look like my thing and ES6 and Starfield are too far out to get hyped about). Really don't care about AssAss Creed, The Divison, Halo, or Gears of war. Just my preference, but TLOU 2, Spiderman, and Ghosts of Tshusima were the games that had actual gameplay footage that I am most excited for. Death Stranding may be sweet too, but really, it's all just confusing intrigue at this point."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Stayed up for the Xbox conference and was disappointed. Didn't stay up for the other ones and don't regret it. Maybe I'm getting old but these conferences just aren't exciting anymore. I don't even think it's because of the leaks. I miss the hiccups and fuckups. Now you just have one guy on stage and a load of pre-recorded videos. Hardly any live gameplay stuff. May as well just be a Nintendo Direct if they pull this shit.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Nothing about Destiny 2, I’m surprised"

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Ghost of Tsushima just made me cry a little. It is just beautiful beyond words. Death Stranding is just fascinating. It's just peak Kojima. Déraciné looks like the kind of game I could absolutely love and it's made by the great gaming melancholic Miyazaki himself! I'll watch that very closely. Didn't really care for the rest.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,TLOU also has pistol silencers.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"So, no ff7 remake ?

also this all package games in ps4, is this part of the limited edition kingdom hearts 3 or something separate entirely ?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,">Some gameplay sections of characters walking, but they showed different characters (so there may be multiple playable characters)

For me it looked like, its still Reedus but with short hair. if you notice the scene where he pulls out his toe nail you can see its Reedus, but got shorter hair. A few scenes later, shortly before he pulls out his ""gun"" from the ""suitcase"" you can see he got a little pony tail. so i assume you have a growing hair mechanic like in witcher 3."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"holy shit, don't read the comments on the YT video for the trailer for Control (remedy). Sony fanboys claiming it's an exclusive and xbox fanboys claiming sony is out of ideas so they are ripping off quantum break.

even though it's not an exclusive..."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I was including some of the smaller ones like Tunic and Ori as well. I only do that because No Man’s Sky was considered an exclusive even though it eventually came to Xbox. A lot of the smaller games they showed that were launch exclusives. If you go by major releases, then yes, I agree with you. Otherwise if you go by timed exclusives along with major releases, I’d say the point still stands. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Now that we’re getting KH3, I have a feeling Death Stranding won’t come out for another 5 years..."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Hmm that open world japanese game sounds good but thats really all that peaks my interest. Too many artsy-movie style games. At least there will be non exclusives to play.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"All this thread needs is links to the trailers in your description, or even time stamps, but I’m guessing with how quick you put these up that would be difficult/impossible. Thanks for the work dude! "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I didnt watch the show but caught the videos on Death Stranding, Last of Us, Spiderman, Tsushima on youtube this morning. Then I went onto twitter to see comments.. I must have been on an odd Xbox fan boy time, coz everyone was saying Sony conference sucked. Someone please enlighten why most people were saying the conference was shit."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ghost of Tsushima reminded me a lot of Assassin's Creed. I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing.

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Quick note on the intermission after TLOU, the Destiny trailer was a new one that revealed a monumental story hook for the next expansion coming in September that had the whole subreddit collectively say holy shit. RIP Cayde-6"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"There was also a never before seen advertisement, which I'm positive was intentional, for Destiny 2's DLC ""Forsaken"" to drop in September."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Nintendo to win! 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"A lot of good games being shown, unfortunately still no release dates. The pacing of the show was a bit of a buzzkill. Overall a lot of cool shit in the works for them. "

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,what is this about black ops 3 content free on ps+? I havent logged on my ps in weeks.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"During the last of us trailer, did anyone else notice the wristband Nina is wearing in the beginning is the same one Ellie was wearing during the gameplay scene? "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"On another Last of Us 2 thing I noticed, I briefly saw the ability to craft a pistol silencer when she crafted the explosive arrows. Looks like it'll be going a little more crafting heavy. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Microsoft definitely still the leader this year
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Fucking terrible
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I really hope grounded difficulty is available at the start. Grounded tlou is one of my favorite video game moments 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I didn't get a chance to watch the Microsoft E3 Conference but I watched the Sony conference in hopes of seeing Spyro. After watching this conference I am even more tempted to get a PS4 over an Xbox One. Were the Xbox One games just as good or was Sony the clear winner on games?

It should be noted that I have never watched E3 before and haven't followed the gaming scene for about 6 years so I have no idea if these games look amazing or if they are just the norm now."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"So is Death Stranding a PS4 exclusive?  Also, I need Ghosts and Last of Us 2 now, so time to upgrade my PS3 to a PS4"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'd say Sony tries to keep things different every year and hats off to that. I guess the transition from the church to the main stage was a bit slow for the viewers at home but from the looks of it was an awesome experience for the people present at the showcase. 
The games as usual were awesome and love that Sony first party deals primarily with single player games. I would say the show was awesome and this year both Sony and Microsoft had a good show at E3"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,No Ace Combat 7? :(
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,the one thing i really want to know is if they are going to bring back the multiplayer in the last of us part 2. i thought it was a good little addition to the game.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So no on the Avengers Project?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So this Spiderman is a facsimile of Arkham Asylum?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I’m fairly certain Kojima said Norman’s character was the only playable one, but there would be other characters in the game."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What is this New Game+ for God of War? 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Dumpster fire of a show. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Pretty sure the character in Death Stranding is only Norman Reese’s, but occasionally with his hair pulled back in a manbun."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Where the fuck is my Syphon Filter remake/reboot/whatever?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-13,i was expsecting some good games only thing on there that was good was the last of us part two and  resident evil 2 and thats it
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Loved the conference overall. I was expecting to see a little Shenmue though
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So is RE2 a complete remake? Or is it just graphically enhanced
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Good showing but looks like they couldn't get it right AGAIN. MICROSOFT GOT IT DONE.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"If you haven’t upvotes all of this guy’s E3 break downs, go do it now. You’re insane OP."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Honestly i found their conference extremely boring and underwhelming. I dont really care for the artsy titles or spiderman, and the last of us... i need to see someone with a controller playing a  actual level that isn't scripted beyond  belief. Didnt show anything about days gone really. RE2 was the only reveal announcement i think. Death stranding is looking... weird, but not singing I'm sure I'd pay to play. I think my only excitement was for Nioh 2. Cause i loved the first one. Abd Shadow of... whatever looked cool, like a real samurai rpg almost. 

But yeah over all it was... meh. Was hoping for some spyro or Medi-Evil news. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"“Trailers for games that have already been seen”

Not entirely true. The Destiny 2: Forsaken Story Reveal was new. It depicted Cayde-6, a fan-favorite character, kneeling, battered, worn, and alone. He is slowly surrounded by the Scorn, who are seemingly being led by Prince Uldren. One of the Scorn snipes Cayde’s ghost, and then Uldren proceeds to kill Cayde using Cayde’s own weapon, the Ace of Spades."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,C'MON GUYS THEY ARE REMAKING RE2 WTF HOW IS NO ONE HYPED FOR THAT?!
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Was really disappointed by Sony this year. Not very many surprises or new games we didn't already know about were announced or shown.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"You know what I dont like about Sony conferences? They dont talk about the games between trailers, its just trailers one after another. I guess the majority of people dont like the talking and just want to see games, but I really miss it when its not there."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I have to be honest, this was underwhelming. I'd say it was only slightly better than EA's, and on par with ubisoft. It makes me feel like they are planning on dumping the PS4 next year and they didn't want to push out a ton of new games. 

The stage switch was totally unnecessary too. Just show us some fucking games."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The last of us 2 looks amazing obviously. And ghosts of tsushima is something I’ve wanted ever since way of the samurai, I was erect for the whole trailer. But sadly, as big of a kingdom hearts fan as I am, KH3 just doesn’t do anything for me. Maybe it was what they showed but something just seemed off. I’m not a fan of frozen and tangled so maybe that’s what’s putting me off. I’ve waited half of my life for KH3, I just want it to be good and right now I’m a little nervous "

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Pretty disappointing. Cant see how people can be that hyped about this show. Even when someone is biased
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Breakdown..... No FF7. How in the fuck is there no FF7?!

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Basically LGBT and femminism propaganda
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,At this point I'm just over Death Stranding. Either show us it or don't. I'm actually tired of being baited along with little to no idea what's happening for the third year in a row. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Sony did great but I am obligated to say the conference was shit bc no FFvii announcement. I seriously hyped myself way too much and that pretty much ruined the whole conference for me.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I think Sony are being very clever here, it's obvious they have a ton of new games in the pipeline but they're holding anouncements back until the games are closer to completion.

The situation with few exclusives at Microsoft makes this doable in my opinion.

I've a feeling that they may be holding a few back for next gen also. I can see a ps5 announcement next year."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Seems they ran out of ideas for RE  , you guys think there will be a new Onimusha anytime soon? "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Only thing I got excited for was Nioh 2... Oh well there is always next year.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I know KH series waz a Sony exclusive but I am pretty salty that they aren't bringing the previous games to Xbox. I mean why the hell not? If they're gonna bring KH3 to Xbox why not let Xbox players have the previous games? So tHt fans who maybe dont have a PS4 relive the series as well. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You mean *Spider-Man.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"i think M$ was very impressive too

the way the just said that they bought 5 game studios casually

and the hilarious Gears of War Troll they pulled off.

but men am i hyped for Cyberpunk.. they really kept the best for last... i just hope there is no exclusivity with that one since Pc is bae"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Sony had a lot of variety. Xbox with the same old brainless fps titles. Pass. We'll see what Nintendo has coming up. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Ellie kissed a girl and liked it.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Thankfully they didn't have any awkward people on stage and it was all about the games. That alone made it the best conference so far for me. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"As a TLoU specialist, Ellie cannot craft Bombs (but she can Smoke Bombs), and they've changed the ingredients for crafting: Sugar is gone, Binding is gone (so no more melee upgrades or they only take Blade), Scrap is added. It looks like Rag is also gone replaced by Gasoline.

Overall, this should make the crafting a bit better in the story, although I wonder what Med Kits will take to make, given the legit choice in the first game to make Molotovs or Med Kits on the harder difficulties."

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I’ve realized their audio and/or stream sucks every year. I love Sony, but somehow, somewhere, there is one random fuckwit that screws everything up.. every year"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Didn't seem to really be the audio ops fault though. Looks like someone tuned into the frequencies they were using for the hosts mics, hence the hissing noise/interference before you hear the talking. Can't do much but swap em out and go find the dude that rekt it and slap him haha"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,is there a video for spiderman?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Happy cake day!!!
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm primarily a Sony fan but, good lord.. the stream is just an absolute shit show.  People going through one room to another? What's up with that? The presentors are doing some cringy impromptu talk. A guy picking up the signal and talking while one of the presentors is playing the Spider-Man demo. A weird cut between the trailers and the musical thing. 

Solid games though, especially with Ghost of Tsushima. The whole Sony E3 presentation is an accurate depiction of “Good idea, terrible execution.”"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Its funny because I was watching the stream with little to no audio at work and i thought the conference was amazing. Came to the stream just for the Last of Us, but watched the whole thing cause I was basically hooked with just seeing the trailers lol."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"In the trailer they said that the monsters ""fastforward"" you. I think they carry cloned fetus of themselves so when the monsters attack, he ages rapidly and gets eaten while the fetus also ages to become an adult him and carries over the memories somehow"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Pretty sure Kojima and Norman just did a bunch of acid and fucked around in a CGI studio 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"new world is fucked. Beings cause time to slip forward. Infrastructure all shit cause gets fast forwarded and crumbles. Humanity relies on special couriers to transport stuff. Couriers have ""extinction"" markers, either DNA or some innate shit that allows them to sense these beings that fast forward time. Couriers carry their baby clones with them hooked to their consciousness via a cord. If they get caught by the beings and go forward in time their body will whither and die, the baby will fast forward and become an adult while the consciousness is uploaded from old body to new (quote in trailer about Norman Reedus surviving if caught but the area around him will become a withered crater.)

Famous people each different courier companies. Maybe combat, lot's of hiking"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's a multiplayer Battle Royale game.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's a survival game where you deliver boxes.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The madness of Kojima and Del Toro. I can't wait
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I have no idea what I watched or any idea what the game was about or what you do.

Yeah confused as ever.
"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Classic Kojima. 

Game feels like one whole movie trailer. 

Hope to see more details soon. Saw one guy packing a gun in the trailer. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Srsly, it looks awesome but when are we going to get a solid gameplay video?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[removed]
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,For me I want to have NO idea what I’m getting into when I pick up the game (whenever that will be). It’s so mysterious I’m excited. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Human mule simulator 2020
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Every time I see more of it, a few things make more sense and basically everything else makes less sense, every time I think I've pieced together a plausible theory the next trailer fucks it all up.

What kind of a fucked up drug you need to take to think of those kinds of things"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I love how Kojima mooned everyone, and no one remembers and everyone confused as fuck."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"A clusterfuck, the proper term is a clusterfuck.

"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You walk around with babies n sh*t
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,A studio let Kojima do whatever he wanted.  Kojima's a crazy talented but I think he's nuts.  I'm fearful that the game is going to be a big mess because noone is there to tell him 'No'.  That being said I think there are going to be some elements that are going to be sensational because of that.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Given how close KH3 is, it's no surprise that they want to keep the focus on it. I imagine we'll see a lot more of FFVII next year"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It will be coming to PS5 now
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's probably put aside for PS5 now. There's just no way it's ever coming to this system.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"They pretty much fired everyone working on it and started from scratch, so we won’t see much for a while and when we do it will probably look completely different from what we have seen. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It killed the conference for me. I really don't know why they did it. They had the formula for these things figured out.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"There was no surprise, no real excitement. You could hear it in the audience. Red Dead would've saved it, because Death Stranding and KH3 were just utterly confusing.  At the end I kept exclaiming to myself that people actually paid for the privilege to see it in person. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Irked is the word. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm going to predict that's like the first fight, you have all the dope ass powers, slaying dudes left and right, get to the big fight, knocked out, hurt, someone miraculously saves you, you've lost a lot of your strength and training, then it's on to grinding to get to that dope ass Spidey again. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Spiderman looks sick with the fluid web slinging mechanic. I pity Vulture because he got webbed/kicked/dropped in every scene he appeared in with Spidey. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's insane that we're getting so many villains in one game. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"\+100 upvote points for mentioning the PS2 spiderman 2. Was the best Spiderman game out there. And a completely different game than it's PC release, somehow.  


Last Of Us was always like that, smoothly and seamlessly connecting the gameplay with cinematics, to the point where you're sure you're making all the decisions and yet it's all scripted to give you the best story possible. Seems even better here, with some amazing AI behavior, hope it won't change too much on that front."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I'm let down tbh
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I honestly was waiting for the main show, and just now noticed the stream said post-game show. Thought it was looking hella hype if this is what they started with. Still want most of them, but certainly super whelmed as well."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,how? they had amazing games. i guess only a few though
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Microsoft came in strong and set the bar high. I have been disappointed by everything after. Nintendo should be a treat though 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yeah I have still have some grudges against Microsoft but they hands down had the best conference.  Just game after game with a couple minute talks for their major releases.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I totally agree with you even when I don't have a Xbox and will probably get all the games Sony showed, I think Microsoft's was  indeed better, presentation and content wise."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,They also showed mostly multi platform games that are also coming to the ps4 though. So half their conference may as well have been part of Sony’s anyway. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Microsoft had the better conference but you can still play all of their games on pc and most of the ones they showed also on PlayStation so Sony will continue to dominate them. Mostly every game PlayStation showed is only on PlayStation (maybe nioh goes to Xbox also?) . Also Sony literally said they were changing it up this year and instead of announcing tons of games they were going to deep dive on 4 big games which they did, long gameplay sequences of tlou2 and Ghost of tsushima and Spider-Man and pretty long trailer/gameplay(?) of death stranding. I would prefer a mix of both maybe like deep dive on games soon to come out like Spider-Man while also revealing more new games but I absolutely loved the big gameplay sections from tlou2 and ghost so I can’t really complain. I think they will see how this did and change it up again for next year."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Quantity doesn't beat quality, at least for me. I was only interested in a few of the 50 games they showed, as I assume most is the case for most people. Not to mention only 18 of those games are exclusive and a majority of those are platformers or other small indies. I still think Sony's exclusives are stronger, but I'll be picking up Halo and a few others."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This surprises me. I really didn't care much for Microsoft's presentation. It felt like a shotgun blast where they just hoped they showed enough things that something would stick while Sony had a much more curated presentation.

All personal preference of course, but when Sony gets me excited about the same number of games as Microsoft did while showing off a fifth as many, that's impressive to me."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,There were game trailers?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Also despite being a short list, everything looked extremely polished and unique and almost entirely gameplay trailers."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,why stop to talk to developers about games we've known about for over a year?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yeah all four of them
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You're definitely not the only one.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I think that's the general consensus, but fanboys seem to be arguing with anyone who has that opinion "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Conference wasn't as good as MS - agreed. Microsoft caught some steam coming out first. Even with a lot of multiplatform titles, it still won due to a good pacing, structure and just the fact that it showed those games first. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yeah what happened to the massive release trailer rapid fire? They're 3/4 filler time like all the other shitter companies now.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yes and i own a playstee. Sonys focusing too much on weird eccentric movie style games. Every game is some attempt at an edgy philisophical drama and after working all day, thats the last thing i want to focus on."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I agree with you. Structurally, it was horrible. Revealing only one new game in the first 30 minutes of a show is a bad call, no matter what the game is. Then to have an intermission afterwards because they had to shuffle everyone from one hall to another? Terrible idea. It's like they tried to come up with a cute gimmick but they could've had a bunch of reveals in that time instead and had a better show."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"If microsoft just showed **their** games, would you be saying the same thing?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"i feel like something went wrong with their original plan.  The extra long break after showing TLoU2 was weird and felt improv.    And then they revealed a new game by From Software after the conference appeared to be done, that a bunch of people missed.  ~~Apparently they didnt even show the trailer on the playstation stream, it was only shown on the Twitch stream lol~~  *edit: guess not.  my friend said it wasn't on the PS stream, but he must've just missed it*.  And God of War is getting a new game+ mode, but it wasn't mentioned in the conference.     
  
the game trailers were awesome, but the conference format was really awkward. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"With only 1 of the 4 tent-pole games having a release date in 2018. We’ll be lucky if TLOU2 is 2019, but death stranding and ghost are most likely 2020. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Because Microsoft was showing third party games that are most of a greatest hits of E3 2018, and less showing you reasons to buy their system.

Openingly admiring they're just now buying studios to make games for them, not even actually telling you any names, screams that they don't give a shit about Xb1 at this point."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You're probably in the majority then
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"After the first 35 minutes or so, I was ready to say it flat-out sucked.

It picked it up later, but damn that was a lot of painful waiting."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Same, other than TLOU everything was meh. Death stranding just looks meh, think Kojima isn't half as good at making games as people say he is. Spider man looks pretty generic for a super hero game. The samurai game looked okay but didn't look like anything that hasn't been done before. Conference and its games were lackluster. Nothing really that pushes or makes me hyped."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Honestly that’s the game I’m most excited for from PlayStation. I don’t get the hype for last of us. It looks the same. I’m sure I’m gonna play it anyways 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,if this game has a nemesis esq system i’ll venmo you 100$
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"That Last Of Us gameplay felt 20 minutes long by itself, so awesome"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Dude Nintendo won this E3 before it even started. Everyone knows that.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Less than 20 mins? Besides the gap feom Last of Us to the rest and the 2 music solos, it went from trailer to trailer with no cuts. Other conferences waste as much time with developer interviews or more. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"They didn't show 20 games that were multiplatform, not sure how that even matters.

You can tack on a vast majority of what Microsoft showed, being ps4/xb1 releases, to what Sony had tonight."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The Banjo music was essetially the theme for TLOU. The random fruit was from the game Dreams that was explained. The music before Ghosts of Tshusima may have been unexplained but fit with the theme. Didn't really watch the other conferences so not  making a statement there either way, but I enjoyed the music and didn't find it unexplained."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Each to their own but I thought the Bethesda conference was bad. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Give this man more upvotes, he knows what's up. More competition is good for the industry. Let them fight each other - we'll be the ones to profit. I also hope Nintendo steps up with more games from their ignored franchises. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"How did they lose?

Because Microsoft will release a Forza game in 2018?

They showcased a bunch of third party games that you can keep buying on your PS4.  They didn't show anything that would make someone buy an Xbox 1 at this point in time, if they haven't already."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,If you are a tes fan I don’t see how you can put Bethesda first after seeing that blades bullshit. I have never seen something more cash grabby and terrible in my entire life. I thought it was another joke like the Alexa thing for the entire time Todd was talking about it. I honestly still can’t believe it’s real. And a 34 second clip saying tes6(which Todd already said last year they were making) in no way makes them the best conference. For me Bethesda was 3rd last (ea and squenix were worse) and I am a fucking massive tes fan.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Shoudn't it be Microsoft and not Xbox? I own both PC and PS4 and I have no desire to buy an Xbox because I know I can play all the games on my PC. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This does not change the race at all. I have both consoles. Play my PS4 a lot more, but not solely. Sony has sold twice as many units and will continue to do so. XBOX is not gonna reframe the race this late.

Sony has not stopped trying. That’s ridiculous. They tried something different and it failed. Their messaging has been consistent. Deeper around our core exclusive titles this year. They have worked to cultivate the best and deepest talent filled studios, and it worked. They focused on those stories. 
"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Is that samurai game a PlayStation exclusive?  
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Hell yeah that 6 second clip of Nioh 2 was sick it got me *s^o^o^o^o^o^o* hyped.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I thought Control was going to be a psi-ops sequel watching the trailer. I’m really interested in where they go with that game
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The Microsoft one felt a lot like, ""Look we are getting all these previous PS4 exclusives too"". While Sony's was like ""Here you go a lot of gameplay and story on our new exclusives"". Felt like Microsoft was playing catch up (obviously not for all the games).

Ubisoft did a good job indeed, and I'm not hype on Bethesda's games so for me Sony did a great job, perhaps second best to Ubisoft (first place for me at least as I am more interested in the titles Sony showed).
"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Rockstar never attends E3
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The point of last of us is how scripted the game flows. It's a movie, it needs it's script. Spiderman looks really fun, but the last of us will be fantastic. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The arkham games are just Spider-Man: Splinter Cell
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,People are just surprised because sony has marketing rights
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"That's great to here. That and Horizon 4 are my hype games this winter


Maybe RDR2 but I still have the first one in its plastic "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Holy crap, Prototype is one of my favourite open world games, and I don't usually enjoy openworld gameplay. But that game did traversal and fighting very satisfying. Got more hype from this comment alone.

"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I agree 100%
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Agreed, enemy, environment and weapon variety (different stats and colours for a weapon class is not variety) was seriously lacking. Also maybe have some static loot this time so that there is a reason to actually explore the levels?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I can't believe they didn't show days gone. That game is releasing near kh3, Crackdown 3, Anthem, and the division. It needs all the promotion it can get"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,you can have gameplay in a trailer
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I laughed when I saw the Division trailer started playing . They try to hype it so hard with these beautiful trailers but the graphics aren't going to look half that good . Just like when they showed it the first time . 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Fans apparently only want an hour and half of teaser after teaser of games that won't come out for 3 plus years on consoles they don't own yet. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,No same here. Most overrated game ever for me.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Hype does nothing but ruin experiences for people. You want hype to garner interest, but when expectations are built to such insanely high levels, it gets to a point where there is no way the game can actually live up to them."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Am I the only one who just doesn't get how BOTW is people's favorite game of all time? I think it was just so hyped and by the time I played it, it felt like a bit of a letdown. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I kinda in the same boat as you but I can see why people love it, from a storytelling perspective is a video game masterpiece, if it wasn't just because I don't think the gameplay holds as equally I'd be praising it too.  "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"TBH I think the majority of sony exclusives are let downs they all get 10's then you play them and you sit there wondering why it got a 10 when most of their exclusives have become CRYTEK games (Look pretty but have terrible gameplay). But then again when you compare it to xbox that just seem to release terrible games, i think the whole standard of what is a good game now has lowered massively. The Witcher 3 is the only game worthy of 10/10 this gen."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"You may not like it, which is fine. But you can't deny that there is no game like it. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Same. Just feels like the same adventure type game that Sony keeps pumping out over and over. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Most of the people arguing over a console winner are children who don’t have bigger problems in their life to worry about. Those of us who are a bit older tend to let people enjoy the platform they prefer and don’t feel the need to cheerlead a mega corporation.  
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Mongol Witcher for me
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's going to be open world - so for me personally that doesn't sound too exciting. But a samurai open world game does sound intriguing.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Doesn't change the fact that it was a clusterfuck of a conference.

Just because they set the bar low doesn't mean hitting that bar is any better.

And you can focus on only a few games, but damn, keep the momentum going all the way through. A 15 minute intermission? 2 musical sections? No release dates for anything except a remake? Very little active gameplay in 3 of the 4 main games?

It's not about being blown away by some big announcement. It's big underwhelmed by the fact that even with the bar they set, they executed terribly."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's ok that their conference sucked because they said it was gonna be weak beforehand. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Honestly the fact that all that was shown was loosely scripted gameplay with ZERO release dates is an absolute fuck up, I mean these are games that have been announced for over two years (mostly), they should at least have a year or something."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The gameplay looked like long boring walks from cutscene to cutscene, did we see the same thing?  "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"IDK, Death Stranding didn't have nearly as much actual gameplay or interaction to steal the show in any way.

It lost in pretty much every regard to TLOU2."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"You start the game over, but keep all the gear and levels from your first playthrough. The game is also made more difficult."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"He meant new villains announced, Mr Negative and Kingpin (Wilson Fisk) have already been confirmed before."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Nioh 2
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"They showed it a few days ago. Figure they didn't want to show Days Gone and TLOU2 too close together, get people confused. They announced the release date and showed a good trailer. Freaker animals all over that shit. ""The VR part"" was actually a recap of the games they had shown in the days leading up to the conference."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Last news on FF7 was ""it will release by 2023"". Not surprised it was a no show "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,They talked about it last week? It's out in february...
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Exactly, E3 needs to have a new game announced. I mean for me Microsoft is winning this year (even though I am a huge Bethesda fan) because they had a lot of new announcements and the stream was not a mess."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"If you were hyped you have only yourself to blame, since Sony had already made it very clear there wasn't going to be much (new) to be hyped about.

As a ""fanboy"" you should have known this."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It was a bunch of Black Ops 1-2 maps, some 'classics', that I vaguely remember playing way back then, but they were good... I think? Ha."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,*Yes*
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The author missed it; there’s a video up on the destinygame youtube channel of what was briefly shown.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"FF7 and TES6 are tied for the ""Duke Nukem Forever"" award, to be awarded sometime in the PS5 generation in 2022"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The little we've seen of shenmue thus far makes it look unpolished as hell. That game is a long without and likely not ready to be shown.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"...

Considering it's a ps1 game, gonna say that you can just 'enhance' it."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I agree, I really like the longer gameplay segments however, especially that it helps see more of the game. I prefer a lot of what other conferences do with talking but I dislike half cutscene half gameplay mashup compilations, much prefer the gameplay reveal their games have."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Microsoft had no reasons to buy an Xbox 1 though, with Gears/Halo/Forza already having iterations on the Xbox 1. 

If that didn't sell you by now, chances are these new versions won't either.

Everything else was multiplatform."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"If you played the first one, that was a part of Ellie’s character that was fleshed out in the DLC and at least in this trailer, it juxtaposed how different her life inside her enclave is a complete opposite of the vicious and visceral nature of hers that was on display during gameplay. It wasn’t shoehorned, it fit already established character lore so I don’t get the idea this is propaganda at this point. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Like gay people and women exist? 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What aren't you getting?  You play a guy making deliveries across a world that's undergone some kind of cataclysm.  You avoid the monsters and shoot guys. They strongly hinted at some kind of time warp mechanic where the monsters send you back in time.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Both Sony and MS have a shit-ton of ""Splinter Cell Re-Skin"" games where you watch a characters ass for 30 hours while taking cover and button mashing during cutscenes.  I applaud Splinter Cell and Resident Evil 4 for changing every single single player game into a clone of them.   And now I can add Breath of the Wild to the list.  For instance, Death Stranding is BotW but carrying large backpacks, TLOU2 is Splinter Cell/RE4 but with Lara Croft as the main character, Halo Infinite is BOTW but its first person.  Every single game is just ""Cover+Zombies"" or ""cover+lara croft again"""
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Did you just not watch the Microsoft conference or something? There was more pissing about in Sony's and a fraction of new games shown with gameplay in comparison.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,/r/AsATlouSpecialist
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What about the droid attack on the Wookies?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Lol that was so weird 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Wait, when did it happen?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That was so weird!
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Apart from the services made under Gaikai (Vue, TV, etc) Sony cannot be called good at online services \*cough\* PSN \*cough\*."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The original room they were in was built to be like the beginning of TLOU2 trailer. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah. Where did that ghost game come from? Just visually stunning. Heard and saw nothing about it and suddenly they're showing off gameplay of it out of nowhere. Whole thing looked really sleek. But yeah, by the second musical number I was like...okay let's move it along already..."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Wtf did I just read? I need to watch the teaser.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"And they don""t just eat the new grown up version of you? "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Did i hear incorrectly?  I thought they said the rain fast forwards you, the monsters eat you."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That is a good theory. If that is the case i am liking the sound of it. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Literally?

Edit: literally(.)"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Isn't Mads Mikkelsen on that project too?

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Last time that happened he named the game after the experience and Ac!d is by far one of my favorite handheld games of all time.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"ooh that's why plants grow around them, it's starting to actually make sense"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12," This feels like an entirely different thing from the Del Toro trailer though.  This is ghosts that eat you and cthulhu monsters, as opposed to zombie Nazi's.  Jar baby being the only really connection.  Are the zombies immune to the rain?  in league with Cthulhu? etc."

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Those boxes were actually disguises. He was transporting people who turned into boxes. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Del Toro is not really involved. Just a cameo. Del Toro swore he wouldn’t work on a video game ever again after what happened with Silent Hills
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Maybe that's all you do. You just walk through the country side carry a big backpack for 50 hours.

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Next year??? For fucks sake. I literally only bought my PS4 for FF7. I have a feeling I wont even get to play the fucking game until PS5 is out at this point.

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This reminds me of FFXIII Versus and waiting for years. God please no. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,My thoughts as well.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ahh, that looks a lot better"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I hate that kind of thing, I don't want to be powerful then have it all taken away, like metroid or castlevania or darksiders or god of war. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I wonder if they’re taking a page from the Arkham games and having a Spider-Man rogues gallery where lots of villains are involved somehow.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"No WiLD, Dreams or Medievil? what the heck Sony?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Microsoft definitely set the bar high, but I thought Ubisoft passed it. They had a great conference and had a really great balance of all the things I like to see in an E3 showcase. But then again, so did Microsoft.

Sony though was a mess.

EDIT: Not sure why the downvotes. Right now, Ubisoft and Microsoft are very widely seen as having the two best conferences thus far. Despite preferring Ubisoft's conference, they're both still pretty neck-and-neck for me."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-13,"I wanted to disagree until I saw what was in their conference. Holy shit.

Sekiro, Fallout, Kingdom Hearts, Tales of Vesperia might be interesting (haven't played that one yet), **Devil May Cry 5**, Cyberpunk...

Though seeing how none of those games are Xbox exclusives, I can see why some people didn't remember them as being in the Microsoft part of E3."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That’s fine. Microsoft is trying to build Xbox into a brand and not a console. Exclusives are anti-consumer and eventually people will think back on game consoles like we do on DVDs. Microsoft is building towards the future after the the Xbox one launch flop while Sony rides the popularity wave for as long as it can. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,MS has the best console for multi-plats though so it's not too surprising to see them show those off
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Microsoft is pushin the play anywhere feature. Of course you can play them on pc too. That’s the point. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Quality over quantity.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"What do we actually know about TLOU? Death Stranding? Ghosts? RE2? Nioh 2? Control?

They could of talked about any of those games if they wanted to. I'd listen, but I also appreciate leaving that to the rest of the e3 days."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Every developer that talked at E3 was probably for a game we have known about for over a year. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"*10 

And how many of those can you play on Xbox? "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"And dropping Halo, Forza *and* Gears in the same conference? I don’t think that’s ever happened before!"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Sony fired most of there shots with the really good 2018 releases and is now left with a handful of games  not coming in the near future. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I believe so yes. If both companies only showed their games, Microsoft still would have shown more as they have 2 platforms essentially. No matter if you buy it on PC or Xbox, that’s a sale for MS and they just showed more by volume and possibly in quality depending upon your perspective. 

I love Sony and have owned my PS4 for twice as long as my Xbox, but as a matter of fact, Xbox just had more and stuff I liked and more in general. I liked the PS4 stuff, but if I’m buying or stuck with one right now, I’d go with Xbox due to the studio acquisitions and the sheer volume of games that are coming and will look good on it. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It looked like they went to a different building/tent or whatever it was just so a guy could play a banjo and watch TLoS 2 and then a 20 min break so he could change to play a flute in an entirely different building
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I was watching the Playstation stream on YouTube on PS4. No issues with my feed, saw the extra trailer."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I saw the trailer on the PlayStation stream. I really wanted it to be bloodborne 2 when they said From Software. I was bitterly disappointed.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,">Because Microsoft was showing third party games that are most of a greatest hits of E3 2018, and less showing you reasons to buy their system.

They showed ~~18~~ 15 exclusives, which is more than what Sony even showed in their entire conference. All to be released in the next 12 months.

>Openingly admiring they're just now buying studios to make games for them, not even actually telling you any names, screams that they don't give a shit about Xb1 at this point.

You are hugely mistaken, and it's a shame you'll be missing out on the benefits of their ecosystem because of it."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I don't think that's a good thing...usually a good thing is, ""That was so amazing it felt like it went by so fast!"""

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I thought Sony had it in the bag and that it was their conference to lose, and that Nintendo could steal it.

Now Microsoft is on top, Sony dropped the ball, and Nintendo is still a major unknown except for what is basically guaranteed Game of the Show (Smash Bros)."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I thought Xbox showed a lot of content after content without interrupting to much imo.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You need you watch the Xbox conference before saying that.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It clearly wasn't less than 20 minuites. LOU2 was 11+ minutes of footage alone.

It was prob 35-40 mins of stuff, not sure why OP said that number"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So basically everyone wants what nintendo is doing and do a 20-25 minute reveal/trailer after reveal/trailer 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Not a lot of content aside from Fallout 76, but they did announce some pretty exciting new stuff. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Bethesda was really bad, they spent 20 minutes on a garbage mobile skyrim game (PORTRAIT MODE OMG!!!) Instead they show us one pictures of skyrim and starfield."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I believe he speaks only in terms of E3 conference. He doesn't disagree that this gen was won by Sony. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Why are you on every damn comment shit talking MS? It's okay that you're too poor to afford both consoles. But give it a damn rest.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Xbox is a Windows 10 Platform. That's what makes Microsoft's side of things so unique.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yes. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ghost of Tsushima is yes, Nioh 2 (Also Samurai) will be on PC (well the first one is anyways.)"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It is indeed a PS4 exclusive.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Half expected it to be Onimusha at first.

But, this is just as sexy."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I was gonna say lmao. Did my stream cut or something? 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ironic that you say that. I could not disagree more and think it's the exact opposite.

Not only did Microsoft show off way more exclusives (**fifteen**) with a ton of gameplay for almost every one, but Sony's gameplay couldn't have looked more scripted and tightly choreographed than it was.

Not only did Microsoft premiere a ridiculously high number of games, but Sony premiered **two** games, both with no gameplay, both multiplat.

I *still* don't know how much of Spiderman is QTEs and scripted sections because all the gameplay demos we get is so heavy in them. And Death Stranding still has nothing except walking around.

There were literally only two games where your description applied--Nier Automata and Kingdom Hearts III.

Sony showed one game for **fifteen minutes**, then had a **fifteen minute intermission**. Then it started to pick up. But all the while, all the bullet points I mentioned. And in the whole conference **one game got a release date**."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I mean, MS *are* playing catch-up. And judging by their conference, they're making the right moves. We'll have to see what comes from these 5 new studios, but Ninja Theory was a great call, along with finally bringing Playground games into the fold. All the rumours have been that the latter are working on a new Fable game, but I have a feeling that might be coming from the newly created Santa Monica instead. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,My problem is that Sony showed only 4 games and I would bet a hefty amount of cash that those same games will be shown at e3 again next year. (Excluding Spider-Man)
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,They show trailers occasionally at one of the major conferences
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,A 30 sec rushed gameplay in a 3 mins trailer doesn't tell me much of the game. I prefer they give us a dedicated 5-10mins of gameplay like Spiderman or God of War. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Same with Watch Dogs. I was immensely disappointed. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ubisoft are a bunch of liars in my eyes at this point. I don't care what they announce or release any more, I know I won't be buying their games. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Make that 10 seconds...
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Am I the only one who just doesn't get how Katamari Damacy is people's favorite game of all time?  I think it was just so hyped and by the time I played it, it felt like a bit of a letdown."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Thrms fightin words
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Very little gameplay in 3 of the 4?

I'm trying to figure out which you thought had action then..."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,But they didn't show zero release dates. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah, how dare they take their time to actually make good games. I like it better when they rush it to make quick bucks."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I hope to god it's not some sort of a walking simulator. But I do believe we'll have to deliver scavenged things, make money, and upgrade ourselves to be able to face tougher areas. I hope there'll be some sort of combat - but it's all guesswork at this point."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Oh that’s pretty cool, thanks for the explanation and breakdowns! "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I feel like Pirates of the Caribbean was a way for Square to test Unreal on making more realistic graphics in real time...
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I dont have a ton of time, i have trouble keeping up with all the news.   I was excited because Sony has not let me down yet!   And no, I dont have to blame myself at all.  An an international entertainment  company telling you are are going to deliver a poor product doesn't mean it isn't a poor product. Nor does it excuse them from it.  I'm not dealing in absolutes. Sony is still the shit and I love what they do! But a poor conference is a poor conference. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I looked it up and it said it was slums, jungle, firing range and summit."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Thank
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Definitely. While Xbox’s presentation of games was great, the actual content was lacking. I was looking for exciting new IP and I didn’t get that. Multi-platforms is nice, but with Microsoft’s drought of “not on PlayStation” content majority multi platform is not going to cut it. People are acting like Fallout 76 is an Xbox game because Xbox presented it. No. 

I can’t get excited for Halo because I played Halo 4 and 5. Why would I be excited for Halo after that? I’m cautiously optimistic. This really is the make or break moment with me when it comes to Halo. If the campaign is more garbage I don’t have to go back ever again. 

Not excited for Forza because driving games are just not me thing. I’ve played a bunch and I just don’t get the appeal. 

I never played gears. The concept and design just didn’t appeal to me. 

Crackdown is cool, but it should have come out 2 years ago. Based on what they did show nothing says it was worth 2 years of extra development time

I’ll get Ori 2 because it’s Ori and I’m a sucker for that crap. 

When it comes to Xbox, I was looking for a hook and I didn’t get one. It was a cool 2018/2019 showcase, but not a worthwhile Xbox showcase. 

Sony seems to have the opposite problem. They showed a few games, majority exclusive, but took a few too many steps into, “get on with it.” Funny, I said that Sony could be a few steps ahead of Xbox if Sony showed some gameplay. They did, but it was still lacking. They needed less gameplay and discussion and more games. They wanted to avoid the “oh, we’ll play this in 3 years” joke that has plagued them in past E3s. Double-edged sword I guess. 

Neither of them really hit what I needed them too. Both were close, and both were kinda meh. 

I don’t know. 6/10 for both. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I get where you're coming from, MS clearly need new IP's, and I doubt you'll find anybody  but the most fervent fan boys who'd disagree with that. But ""Gears/Halo/Forza already having iterations on the Xbox 1"" is such a weak argument. They're huge franchises that have massive followings. By that logic, why should anyone be getting hyped about TLOU2, we've already got one on PS4 (albeit a remaster)? Would people not be losing their collective shit if Sony had announced Uncharted 5?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"<0.01% of actual combatants yet somehow they somehow manage to show up in every single cobat game now.

Very equality such progressive wow. Stronk and independant."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I agree. Enough suspense and setting for me to buy. Don’t need the whole game spelled out for me before I play it.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It literally looks like a walking sim with added traversal design very similar to BotW. I was looking forward to it the first 2 years, but the ambiguity of it is just boring at this point. "

The black sludge advances on del toro so he immediately hooks in his baby. The planes and tanks have some weird black effect trailing from them indicating that they are not from current time and maybe brought back or forwards through timefall.

It's all very unexplained. Mad's has old skeleton soldiers that he drenched up from the dead. Idk if Mads has a strong extinction factor allowing him to not only see these time effects but also change them.

Ubi let down a lot of people with no Splinter Cell despite all the hype, Assassin's Creed was already leaked and people aren't as excited as usual because Origins is still new so they're starting to saturate like they did in the Rogue/Unity/Syndicate years, Siege took up a very long segment with no announcements except eSports BS.

I know it's all subjective, so in your opinion, why is Ubisoft up there with Xbox? I thought Xbox and Bethesda both killed it and Sony and Ubi are the next best as both had mediocre conferences with one or two great trailers (and both suffered from multiple A/V fuckups)."

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Microsoft and specifically Phil Spencer stated that they'll focus on exclusives more since it is what's missing from Xbox. Without exclusives a console is dead since there is no reason to buy one otherwise.

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"sure it is a wondertale playing games on whatever you like. However, exclusivity still makes PS seem vastly more special, even just timed ones.  just TLOU2 is solely making the PS a strong brand in my oppinion, whereas the xbox feels forgotten, and i just know microsoft launched a lot of things that i might consider for pc.   so it might build microsoft as a brand, but it imo it makes the Sony and PS stronger brandwise, as a console choice.   Games i wish i had on PC it makes me feel like, so that is doing it well imo (even if i surely wish it was avaible here). 
  Microsoft had a solid good presentation surely! "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Even then it looks like a slow year for Sony. Don't get me wrong, most everything shown looks spectacular, but it doesn't seem like enough right now. Hopefully next e3 is better :/"

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Actually at least half of them.

And Microsoft showed off 15 exclusives. Many of them world premieres.

If you want to turn this into a quantity contest, Microsoft *easily* beat Sony this year."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Not being a fanboy but can you expand on this when saying - if both companies would only showed their games Microsoft would still win?   

If talking about major releases (or triple A as everyone addresses them nowadays):  

Microsoft has: Halo, Gears, Forza, Crackdown which are good franchises in their own right but it's nothing new.   

Sony has: Death Stranding, The Last of Us: Part II, Ghost of Tsushima, and Spider-Man with only TLOU2 being a sequel.  

So I would say they are kinda equal. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I think that is why it wasn't part of the ""main"" stream and was shown afterwards. It definitely didn't look like something that people would expect out of a From Software title. Not saying it will be bad, but I can see why people would be disappointed."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"\>They showed 18 exclusives

They really [didn't](https://ca.ign.com/wikis/e3/Games_at_E3_2018). The exclusives they did have were mostly small indie games/dlc. Both studios really only showed 2 or 3 big exclusives worth talking about. Spiderman, TLOU, Ghost of Tsushima, Death Stranding vs Forza, crackdown, gears, halo.

Big corps buying small studios shouldn't be a positive, it usually means tighter restraints on the studio which makes worse games, which results in the studio being shutdown and then you get C&C on mobile.

All in all no one really won E3, anything worth talking about won't be here for years."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Out of all the ""exclusives"" they showed only small Indies and Crackdown (which looks quite meh to be honest), Forza and gears are Xbox exclusives for real. The rest are coming to other platforms too.
Microsoft just basically stole all the big e3 announcements and made it seem as if they we're their own.

What has Xbox got so far? Sea of thieves, state of decay, Forza and halo?
Compare that to Horizon, Persona, Uncharted, GoW, TLoU, Nioh... Should I even keep going.

Microsoft is trying to sell a console at a higher price that the competition's with objectively worse games, and that's that."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"You do realize that Sony has far more exclusives than Microsoft, right?

Really, this dick-waving about exclusives honestly shows that you understand the One is fragile.

I loved my 360, and was rooting for the One, but they made some very severe mistakes and sank their own battleship.  Sony has outsold them and had vastly more exclusives over the life of this generation that are 1) high sellers, and 2) highly regarded by critics and gamers alike.

There's nothing to Microsoft's Xbox 'ecosystem' that isn't already available on the PS4.  Fucking Origin offers a lot of the services that Xbox One does.  ORIGIN.

Stop being juvenile.  It's okay to like the Xbox One, but give it a rest.  Microsoft's dick was massive last gen compared to Sony, and they went all flaccid this generation while Sony's knocking shit off tables just by turning around.  Here's to hoping Microsoft will do better next gen."

This makes their E3 presentation a lot more lackluster because they actually save new games for PSX now. "

Every game Sony showed except nioh and kh3 i believe (and I guess maybe re7 remake) are only on PlayStation. Also I vastly prefer these deep dives on games with actual gameplay instead of a random 1 minute cgi trailer. Like the Ubisoft beyond good and evil thing, yeah it’s pretty cool but we have no clue if it will look anything like that in game how it plays or anything. So maybe for people who only watch e3 Microsoft “won” but as a gamer Sony was vastly superior, and while Microsoft still insists on putting all of their games on pc as well as Xbox they will never outsell a Sony console, it’s just a fact of life."

- A healthy amount of developers talking passionately about their games without going for too long.
- Extended, unscripted gameplay for their previously announced games.
- Tons of release dates, many in the near future (late 2018, early 2019)
- A live concert at the height of their momentum for Donkey Kong, followed by a release date
- The Star Fox crossover reveal
- Further post launch support for games that have *really* picked up since launch (For Honor, Rainbow Six Siege)

This purchase from Microsoft shows that it's a different Microsoft in control here. A post I saw the other day explains this perfectly;

https://www.reddit.com/r/microsoft/comments/8q82g2/microsoft_adds_five_big_gaming_studios_to_its/e0h8ts5

> The more I think about it, the more it seems like a choice that only a new Microsoft would make.
>

> The old Microsoft would have made massive, high-profile acquisitions with tons of money put into them. Instead, it's a new studio in SoCal headed by a reputable veteran and aimed at grabbing possible talent leaks from Hangar 13 and Infinity Ward, two studios that they have funded since their inceptions, and two studios that match the company's vision. The vision here goes along with Xbox Game Pass which aims to populate lots of small and mid-sized games and have a steady stream of them. The acquisition of Ninja Theory, in particular, is very highly applauded in this regard. It's not to turn the studio into AAA machine, but to support the ""Independent AAA"" methodology the company established with the last year's Hellblade.

> All of this feels very natural, with seemingly no clash of culture.

E3 became the dick-length contest we now know, pushing each dev to announce their games as soon as possible. I like that Sony is now willing to talk only about upcoming games and major hits they cannot afford not to (à la TLOU 2). They could have shown more, they are currently working on many games. Heck, they have FF7. They could have gone the easy way though they chose not to showcase it. I like that they stick to fewer games, already well developped.

God of War getting a New Game Plus mode is more exciting than either of those announcements to me. I didn't even remember the other games on your list after Xbox slammed 40 more cross\-platform trailers at me and I probably won't be buying them."

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I didn’t say Sony’s Conference was better. But are you really counting DLC as a game presentation? Let’s erase the DLCs so 3 out of 8 are indies. Isn’t PUBG already released? So 3 out of 7.  Tunic is only timed exclusive but let’s count that. 

Xboxs Conference was the one I most liked but not because of Xbox but because of the games I can play on my PS4 or PC. Xbox is not trying to get buyers to buy a Xbox. Sony is delivering awesome exclusive titles so gamers will buy the PS4 while Microsoft is delaying or cancelling game after game. 

This is just a speculation but if the new PS and Xbox are coming in 2020 then Gears and Halo most likely won’t be on Xbox one "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-21,One gameplay sequence that plays exactly like kingdom hearts isn't enough to convince me they had built anything for FFVII at the time.

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,">Microsoft is delaying or cancelling game after game

Only recent delay that comes to mind is Crackdown, and only cancellation is Scalebound (RIP). That's hardly ""game after game.""

And Sony might be in the same boat, but we'll never know because they don't seem to be too keen on announcing release dates. Things seem to have gone very quiet on Shunmue 3 and the FFVII remaster, for example. "

z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,I stopped halfway through and never touched it again. Wipes ALL of your progression and forces you to play as the shittiest character in the series the rest of the game.
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"It’s great, yes."
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"Personally i don't like it for 2 reasons. The gameplay, while exzellent is very long and repetetive tbh. After 20 hours it's kinda dragging.
The Story wants to make you feel a certain way, and does so brilliantly, i just don't like what it makes me feel about The characters it Revolves around.
Hope that helps."

z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"No, it's not worth playing for free. All the characters are unlikeable, none of their motivations make any sense, it's miserable, repetitive, goes on for way too long and the story relies on cheap tricks in an attempt to make you feel any empathy for the characters. Absolutely nothing to see here. Play something else."
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,Played both games -  I feel they form a compelling and challenging narrative with excellent gameplay to boot.  Definitely worth the money.

It’s awesome."
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"Yes absolutely, one of if not the best story driven games of all time, it was worth the full price at launch and is worth every penny on a discount.

Don't mind the people who didn't enjoy it, play it for yourself and enjoy it for what it is."
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"Its fantastic, although it is very bleak and sometimes a slog to get through because of it.  Defonitely worth playong and at that price you cant go wrong."
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"1 million percent worth it.  I'd pay full price for it again.  Part II is even better then the first one, a masterpiece of a game IMO"
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"its a wonderful game that does something unique with its characters that alot of other story games fail to realize. and that is the fact that humans are irrational, when they lose someone they love they can lose their humanity, sembelence of safety, and ruin their judgement. they can lose control and make choices that dont make sense because were human. people shit on the story because ellie makes choices that they dont like, that they feel adds shit and unrealistic details to a story bevause the choices made make no sense. but most people for some reason expect humans to make 100% efficient choices that are best for everybody regardless of how their judgement is affected or the mindset they have"

z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"It’s one of the finest games I’ve ever played. I understand people don’t like a particularly dark story but if you can handle it, it’s an absolutely unforgettable experience."
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,It's worth full price
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,Hell yes! It's worth full price imo.
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"Part 2 is fantastic. Definitely play the first if you haven’t already, it’s a direct continuation of that one. The story is dark and raw, super emotional, and I think it does a great job representing how a world like that would operate. It takes you on a roller coaster, some people don’t like that, but it’s definitely worth it."
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"Definitely, I put off playing it for a long time because of certain story bits I'd heard about that put me off. I finally played it and can honestly say its up there as one of the best single player experiences I've played."
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"Yes. I believe the first game did a lot more with a lot less, but the sequel is still excellent. Bold narrative choices I don't think work in a game format, but I respect naughty dog for taking the risk."

z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"I'm not anymore, but sure I'll admit I was salty about that game. The first was one of my all time favorites. What they did in 2 kind of ruined the series and characters for me."
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"Thanks, the friend that I’m staying at only has pt. 2 and I don’t have a ps myself, but just might pick it up for him then!"

z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"The second game was a better game all round if you ask me, plays better and has more impactful moments, story stays with you if you where invested in it....like I was.
What they did in the second game may have hurt a good few fans but I myself never have a expectation going into any game no matter how much I love the last game, yes it drags along in parts and yes some story points could have been left on the cutting room floor but by the time the end credits rolled it was definitely in my top 10 favorite games of all time.

It's not for everyone that's for sure but if it clicked with you no pun intended it definitely leaves a lasting mark"
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,Not sure what you mean. I gave six reasons in my original comment.
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"I couldn't disagree more but you're entitled to your opinion. I'll agree with that the gameplay itself was a slight improvement but it didn't have the depth or challenge to keep me entertained for 20-25 hours, it gets repetitive fast.  Everyone I know in the real world hated it, Ive only ever seen people say good things about it online."
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"ur not giving anything that i can point to and say ""ah okay i can see the thinking"", jus kina giving these blanket statements that could be said about really any game. it just doesnt give any ideas of ur thinking is all"
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"Funny on the flip side I have never meet anyone in real life who hated it other then people online, it has the same repetitive gameplay as the first game so I can't understand that point at all in anyway, but like you said everyone has there own opinion on the game."
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"One example: 

Cheap tropes like killing the dog, the pregnant woman or sparing Abbey at the end of the game. She probably killed hundreds of people in that game without any remorse, many women, likely some of them were pregnant, but then this particular pregnant woman who was a story character we're supposed to feel bad about? And then to suddenly get a conscience at the very end of the game when it comes to killing the person who murdered Joel. It was all just really lame, badly written and made no sense."
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"Well, repetitive gameplay gets more repetitive after 40 hours (original + sequel) than it does after 15 hours (just original), especially when there's no longer an engaging story with likeable characters to carry it.

Hope that makes it more understandable."
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"the whole point of the game is to show that humans can make irrational decisions especially when under pressure, when fueled with anger and the need for vengeance. multiple times in the game ellie is given a choice between the 'good' choice and the 'selfish' or 'vengeful type' or rather impulsive decisions that would probably be made by a person whos possibly in the lowest headspace theyve been in in their life. these decisions are the whole point of the story, to show that at the end of the first with joel killing abbys father was one of those decisions. an example of this outside of tlou could be in god of war 2018 when atreus impuslively did a ***thing*** people in bad headspaces often times dont make good decisions and its pretty ignorant to think otherwise. the choices made by a character in a story dont dictate every other quality of the story

also killing the dog, not a trope, she killed the dog because itd realistically be there and lets be honest itd probably be pretty weird if the dog just happened to be gone

and like i said, people make irrational decisions the lower they go. the whole theme of the game is 'humanity', not 'perfect choices'"
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"From your standpoint yeah it makes sense, from mine still makes no sense"
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-24,"Honestly mate, I'm not getting into a debate about the game. All I will say is that the weight of her decision to spare anyone made no sense because the entire game I was unashamedly murdering people one after the other in brutal ways. Then conveniently, when we come into contact with story characters (the ones who were actually responsible for murdering Joe btw), suddenly the decision to spare them or not is tough choice? This type of game is not a suitable vessel to make a commentary on moral choices such as sparing people because the structure requires you to indiscriminately murder hundreds of people for 25 hours. Cheap badly written frustrating nonsense. 

OP asked people's opinions and I gave mine. If you think the narrative is some thought provoking contemporary masterpiece then great. I thought it was cheap, lacked tact, miserable, absent of a single likeable character and unengaging."
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,"I just mean the logic of the argument. 40 hours of doing something monotonous  is more repetitive than 15 hours, right?"
z2lm34,2022-11-23,2022-11-24,"homie idk wat to tell u. that was the whole point, people make choices that dont make sense. its what makes us human, that is quite literally what the message of the game was. if u dont like that, sure. but homie, you have absolutely no clue what you are talking about ""this type of game is not a suitable vessel to make a commentary"" my brother in christ it is not that deep, its a game about humanity and choices in general. its not as black and white as u seem to want it to be"

Imo Chief's story ended with 3. Reach was a good prequel. 4 and beyond should have never been created. 4 should have been the start of a new story, the start of a new franchise essentially to mark the shift from Bungie.

Turn a few reapers to our side with the help of Legion sacrificing himself to control the reaper's body at the end of Tali's quest. Him giving individuality to Geth by his upgraded code and reapers seeing organics can actually make peace with synthetics. At the end go into an all out war. The ending will depend on if the Quarians and the Geth made peace or not, if Legion could persuade half of the reapers or not etc. You will win the fight, lose it or win by sacrificing too much based on your galactic readiness and the choices you made."

I'm fine with the fact that Cole Phelps dies at the end, but the way that he died (by being drowned in a literal torrent of shit) and not really getting to have any level of closure or at least reflection on his attempt at redemption was super lame for how much we see the character change and develop. Even having the corruption of the LAPD continue on without a prime whistleblower is great storytelling and a good ending to a noir game, I just wish he'd died in literally any other way - getting burnt by his ex-colleague with the flamethrower at the end of the game and living just long enough to take him out before succumbing to his wounds and coming full-circle in redeeming himself for his war crimes would have been much more poetic than choking to death on poop.

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Mass Effect 3. I'd cut the entire Starchild out, replace it by having someone techy go with Shepard to initialize the Crucible and explain options (also option to take TIM prisoner). Multiple endings, accessible with roughly ascending levels of cooperation score from the previous 3 games:


- Failure. You die before activating it because you didn't get enough support from other races. You lose. Everyone dies. Yes, those choices mattered. You get a cutscene of the Liara's message to the next cycle helping them break it as a comiseration prize.


- Kamikazee boom. If your assets aren't enough for the better options, you can cycle the Crucible faster. Downside: it blows the Earth relay, wiping out the entire solar system. So Earth? Gone. Quarian fleet? Gone. Should have actually built alliances. Have someone throw in Shepards face that they committed genocide once to stop the Reapers.


The following actions would require enough fleet ships, mostly boiling down to making peace between the Quarians and the Geth


- Control. Attempt to rewire it to control the reapers. Ending cutscenes show that this was an absolutely terrible idea and it fails utterly, and the player was a moron for not picking that up from the last 3 games.


- Destroy. The crucible works. The Repears are rendered inert, alongside all Reaper tech. The mass relays are disabled, along with the Citadel. The next epilogue has Shepard briefly helping navigate a new galactic order, depending on friends or enemies made along the way. Hints of a problem on the horizon from Tali about dark energy reinforced by recovering data from a disabled reaper about how mass effect is destroying the universe.


- Communicate. Communicates with the Reapers. Learn about the effect of the Mass Effect, why it's bad, but they won't back down. Have to then choose another ending.


- Cooperate. If Shepard has actually built genuine cooperation across the Galaxy, actually gets through to the reapers. They agree to stop purging, in exchange the galaxy stops using mass effect beyond very tight limits. If exceeded, conflict will return. (Shepard can then either destroy/control/trust them). Ending again has navigating a new galactic order.


- MAD - like Cooperate, but Shepherd threatens to activate the crucible if they ever come back. Doesn't seem very effective, in practice the same as cooperate with a more renegade slant.


- Humanity first. This option is advocated for by TIM if you have him with you and enough time. an option to have the weapon target both reaper and other race technologies. Alien tech expert refuses to do it - renegade option to shoot them in the face. TIM (or high tech shepherd) can then activate the crucible to destroy the reapers and pick through other races to destroy their tech.


- Dark ages. Similar to humanity first but destroys all mass effect tech in the galaxy, and doesn't required TIM or killing your tech person. Unless you want to - if it's Tali she spares the Quarian fleet and lies rather obviously about it, so to include them you do have to kill her."

MK1 starts kinda the same but I would've loved to have Shang Tsung or even Shujinko take the role of new era Shang Tsung via Damashis deception, but this time it can actually be Onaga or still be Shang Tsung but the power makes it so that he can shapeshift (since Shang and Shujinko feel like the same kind of character just on different sides of good and evil)

Have Shujinko/ShangTsung do their journey throughout the realms

So I'd probably keep the options for the existing 4 endings, but add in a 5th. To elaborate...

Edit: TL;DR:  
5th option to convince the Reapers to stand down by going over major decisions made across all 3 games.

----
Destroy and Control are the options that prove the Reapers. The Reapers are Synthetic life beyond their control, and the only way to co-exist is to destroy or dominate them. You either wipe the board of all synthetic life as Anderson would have, or dominate/control them as TIM would have.

However, Synthesis should have been described more as what Saren wanted. No longer simply organic or synthetic, but something more. Also, just because everyone/everything is a mix between synthetic/organic, doesn't mean it's all happy kumbaya between everyone. In ME2, Legion explains that the Geth was split between joining Saren and Sovereign in ME1. They're all Geth, they're all Synthetic, and even though they can all communicate with each other, it doesn't mean they agree and understand each other.

Hell, just look at organics in the Citadel. They all speak common and talk to each other, but cultural differences mean we all have trouble understanding each other. The Batarians consider slavery their right and it is part of their culture, enslaving people is just part of their lifestyle. Considering how much friction the other species have with the Batarians and their culture, even though they all can sit down and talk, do you really think just because Shepard forcefully converts everyone into organic-synthetic hybrid species, the Reapers will lay down arms and be all happy happy happy with everyone else?

If anything, I think Synthesis would have made the whole thing a bit more chaotic. At least right now, the Reapers are all under a hierarchy or mission goal. Destroy and Control basically remove or rewrite that goal, but Synthesis is freeing everyone to be ""equal"" moving forward. A Reaper is the combined knowledge of all the intelligent species of that cycle. Knowing Javik and how he portrays the Prothean, do you think the Prothean Reaper *wouldn't* immediately try to indoctrinate planets and establish dominance? And the Protheans are the only species we know from previous cycles.

So yeah... all I'm saying, Synthesis is uplifting all organics and synthetics to be techno-organic hybrids, while also freeing the Reapers from their original directive of harvesting the galaxy.

The 4th option of refusing the Star Child is pretty straight forward. You basically prove the Reapers right by shooting. A lot of Reapers die, the galaxy is harvested, the cycle continues.  
I also think the 4th ending is the worst, because you've essentially handed the Reapers a completed Crucible, and they now know about the security issue with the Keepers. The next cycle will either have fixed Keepers in the Citadel, or have Keepers 2.0 with some new species caring for the Citadel. As for the Crucible, it was basically a flu shot for them now. Next cycle, even if the next species manage to create the Crucible from the beginning and plug it in, the Reapers know about it and know to block it. Heck, if the next cycle start to immediately try to build the Crucible and it gets discovered by the Citadel, the Reapers might immediately come back to do another reset.

----
So here, I would put down a 5th option: you plead your case. The culmination of all your choices across the 3 games put forward to get the Reapers to stand down. As stated, no organic ever made it this far and it's clear the cycle is flawed and a new path needs to be determined.

The Star Child is basically the Reaper AI in the Citadel, and the Citadel has records of all the things Shepard has done, all the things the species from this cycle has done, and they can both bring forth topics to talk about. Shepard can talk about how their cycle is different, is better, and the Reaper can bring up counter points.  
Topics directly related like The Geth, how the Council treats the Quarians, the fallout with the whole conflict.  
Topics like how the Rachni was handled, uplifting the Krogans, the Genophage. How the Queen was treated, the choice you made in ME1. How the different species reacted to a possible Krogran threat with what they did on Tuchanka in ME3.  
The Reaper might even bring up what Shepard did to the Batarians at the end of ME2. Putting you on full blast for doing something unthinkable, unethical, despicable, etc. Is this the kind of species you want to survive the cycle?

Basically, this would be a final gambit between you, your choices throughout the trilogy, and the Reapers. The actions you've taken can prove, deny, or go beyond the Reapers expectations from organic species. The willing sacrifice of your own to save the Council? Trusting the Rachni Queen with freedom? How you dealt with the Heretic Geth? Wrex, the Krogans, and the Genophage? So on and so forth.

If you've done more to prove the species of this cycle are different, that organics can co-exist with not just each other, but with the synthetics they create, the Reapers can choose to pull back. Their directive has failed and their job is over, but now they can attempt to work on moving forward to what's next. If it's exile back into deep space, or leave the Milky Way for another star system, so be it. Or maybe they can stick around to help. Let the scientists figure out how to prevent indoctrination, and then slowly work towards being able to co-exist. At the end of the day, the Reapers are a product of the Leviathans, and even though they are the literal boogeymen of the galaxy, the Leviathans are to blame for this whole debacle.

If your actions just prove you cannot co-exist with organics, then it'll leave you to your fate. You can't shoot/kill the Star Child, it's a hologram. You can't run to the original 3 choices, you're weakened and it probably took away the bridge to get there and/or closed the window to protect you from shooting the thing. The culmination of all your choices show you are no different from the previous cycles, only that the cycle needs some work to prevent them from getting this far again.

====

Does this mean you need to do a full Paragon run? No, there should be some choices where the Renegade choice is the ""right"" choice to make. Sometimes the right choice is the one where you need to be the bad guy. Although, this is probably more of an issue with categorizing choices as Paragon or Renegade, and how certain choices/options get locked behind the system.

At best, the Reapers stands down and becomes a new species in the Galaxy. At worst, you prove the Reapers right and war continues. Even with a Krogan army, a united Geth and Quarian fleet, and whatever other species army you can muster, all you can do is watch the Reapers decimate their forces. But at the very least, the choices you made helped decide this outcome, and not just make a choice based on what other people wanted.

You don't Destroy the Reapers because the Citadel species demanded they be destroyed.  
You don't Control the Reapers because you wanted the power of the Reapers like TIM.  
You don't force the galaxy to be uplifted into some Synthesis where everyone is now a organic-synthetic creature, like Saren wanting everyone to be better so the Reapers would let them live.  
You, Shepard, made choices over the course of 3 games that convinced the Reapers to change their directive, to choose whether to stand down and let this cycle move forward and explore something new.

Without the main Reaper directive, maybe some Reapers will stand down. Maybe some will try to force their collective cycle consciousness to establish their own new reign of power. Maybe some will fight against each other. The Reapers unshackled are AI, each powered by the collective knowledge of that cycle, and who knows how they might act without the original directive to keep them focused.

So yeah, I'd add a 5th option to where you try to convince the Reapers with your past actions. If it leads to peace, slavery, or destruction, it's because you made the choices that led to that conclusion. Not because you picked a color."

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I'd rewrite the end of Half-Life 2: Episode 2. Instead of Eli getting killed and Alyx weeping over him, you are informed that you actually saved the world forever. Then Gordon, Alyx, and Eli leap in the air for joy in sync, the scene freezes with them suspended in air, and the credits scroll to the song ""You're the Best"" by Joe Esposito."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,There's too many so I'll just go with the recent one. FF16. Get out with the subtle implied stuff. Give me an obvious spelled out good ending where Clive and Jill have at least 33 babies.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,Yeah beat one of the hardest bosses in the game not even a mending rune for a new ending or dialogue from his sister. I really wanted some sort of effect on the base game

But instead we got the dumb Star Child and a choice of 3 colours."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,I felt like the whole game was giving closure to the characters.  The main issue for me was that all the multilayered choices throughout all three games were undone by reductionist choices that had nothing to do with everything you did that went before.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I would change it to where the moment between Anderson and Sheperd is the final moment before the Cruicible fires off and it does what it was made to do; destroy the Reapers. 

However instead of destroying them a code is transmitted to the Reapers that would erase their memories and leave them with one objective: Destroy The Reapers. 

Cue a scene where the Reapers turn on each other and start tearing each other apart. 

After the montage of Reaper Slaughter, depending on your choices, Sheperd can be rescued by whichever love interest you have, if you have a high enough War Assets."

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"And also make the music that plays over the ending triumphant... after playing through the Gears franchise, I strongly feel like something along the lines of 'Finally A Tomorrow' (specifically the part that starts from the shot of Hoffman up to Carmine surviving) should have been playing during the sequence of the Reapers being destroyed, given how it not only accomplishes the goal Shepard had through the entire Trilogy but also frees not just the current species of the Galaxy but all future ones from the fate of being harvested by the Reapers (and from Javik's perspective, avenges the Protheans and all other species previously wiped out by the Reapers) so it's the biggest victory in the history of the Galaxy in that series."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"I personally disagree with this. The trilogy was never meant to be about winning but more so about how you go out.

I feel it far more fits in with the themes that are played out in alot of love crafts stories which the trilogy took so much inspiration from.

It's not about win or lose but rather it's asking if you're proud of what you left behind in your lifetime?

 Did the galaxy go out still bickering amongst eachother or did they manage to put their differences aside in the end and go out as one? Did your friends meet their end bitterly or did you help them resolve their traumas and go out with a sense of peace?

What about you? Are you proud of your actions? Did you ruthlessly pull no punches and go out with a fight the reapers won't soon forget? Or maybe you took every opportunity to bring people together? Did you manage to take the reapers down with you and assure the next cycle gets to live on? 

Basically to me the entire trilogy, 3rd game especially, is thematically similar to how a man on his death bed might feel as he looks around at all the people in his life and what he's leaving behind"
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I'd have it so Destroy is the only option. How well that goes depends on your war assets. High enough war assets, and the Geth and EDI live. I'd still have Shepard die though tbh."

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"oof seems like you fucked up... shepard can survive in one of the endings, if you have high enough war assets, there's even a cutscene showing him breathing or gasping for air among some rubble"

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,If rumors are true there's a new Half Life game in the works.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-17,There actually kinda is an ending if you played the old republic mmo. The mmo and its dlc has a continuation as to what happened to Revan and the main character from kotor 2 after the kotor storylines.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Seriously, Master Chief and Cortana should have been finished after Halo 3. Nothing they've done with the characters since has been worth the damage done to the brand. There's dozens of other Spartans we could have followed, as well as countless ODSTs and even Sangheili that would have been prime material for new stories but nope, always gotta follow the empty suit of armor. Master Chief isn't even that interesting of a character, especially after he just goes full force simp for Cortana, who is literally a computer program."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Came here to say pretty much exactly this.

ODST and Reach are the only games released after Halo 3. The rest are bad fanfic.

I wish MCC didn't have that blight stain that is 4 taking up unwelcome space."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I barely paid attantion to Halo 4 when it came out. Thought it was pretty forgettable at the time. Loved the Bungie games, but 4 just kinda slipped by.

Revisited it a few years ago and I was actually shocked at how frustratingly bad it actually is. The story, the lore, the level design, the weapon balance and sandbox; it's all just SO far below passable, it's ridiculous.

Even the art style, which can look pretty at times, is more often extremely harsh and muddy when in combat."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"I'm playing Space Marine 2 these days and it just feels like a sliver in time during the Forerunner-Flood war. 343 had a universe of endless stories to tell that they could have drawn inspiration from. We could have had 3 games focused on the Flood expansion up to the first firing of the rings alone. We could have had new flood infection on some new made planet sparkling a new race for the rings. Iunno man I'm just spitballing here. I think we could put 5 nerds in a room and write a better halo trilogy in an afternoon than 343 did in, checks notes, 12 YEARS. "
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,I agree. Halo 3 should have been the end of Master Chief and Cortona's story. Halo 4 should have rolled with Crimson and Majestic team especially when they featured a full set of support characters. 
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,You never know... SOMEHOW Master Chief has returned!
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,IMO 4 was freaking amazing and I'd end it there. 5 is where things tanked.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Yeah I mean honestly it's hard to have a more compelling narrative than humanity literally fighting desperately and heroically for survival against a zealous alien collective for decades. That premise is just so compelling that nothing can really compare to it. The sequels really should not have happened when the OT already had a satisfying ending.

  
If anything they should've just gone the Reach and ODST route and set anthology type stories in the universe that fleshed it out more. Those were some great games"

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I honestly felt the ending to 2 would've been better received if you actually got to choose to follow through with Ellie's revenge.  She had no problem leaving a bloodbath behind her like a John Wick movie until it came to the ending scenes.

That and maybe have Joel go down swinging instead of a cartel execution, he's earned that right."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"The Last of Us 1 didn't have a feel good ending either. 

The point of the end was Joel forsaking the world to save a girl that reminded him of his daughter.

TLoU2 is a game showing the results of Joel's rampage. 

The point of the end is that Joel gave Ellie a good life at the expense of Abby's and Abby ruined Ellie's life the same way Joel ruined her, leading to everyone involved getting destroyed by it.

It's a good story, people just dislike Joel died and are upset Ellie was completely broken by the end of it that she didn't even want to kill Abby anymore realizing everything she gave up for it."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Yeah I've been back and forth on it ever since I played it. Amazing gameplay. Incredible graphics. Good characters who all had great acting performances.

But like you said, there are no real ""feel good"" beats >!beyond Ellie and Dina getting some time together on the farm. Beyond that, apart from filling in the blanks of what happened between Joel and Ellie, the story of the game is just Ellie going on a revenge mission. *Twice.* Both ending mostly the same way. While that's all happening the lives of every character just get unimaginably shittier as things continue.!< By the time the credits roll you just feel depressed instead of wondering what happens next.

I can guess what's going to happen next: awful things will continue to happen to everyone. Yay."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"The “feels good” moments in TLOU2 were the flashbacks with Ellie and Joel. That sequence at the space center was incredible, and it was the moment that most reminded of the best moments of TLOU1. "
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I dig Necron. Having this judgmental embodiment of death and what that means fit the themes of the game perfectly.

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Most of the factions are diametrically ideologically opposed to each other. Even if you managed to somehow negotiate a temporary cease-fire between them, I wouldn't really buy it as an ""ending"" because I don't think the peace would last. The Brotherhood believes that the way the Institute uses technology is inherently evil and the sort of thing that could destroy the world again. The Institute's ideology and life research won't allow them to stop doing everything the Brotherhood wants. The Railroad is radically at odds with the other 2 factions and they will never agree about the personhood of synths. The Minuteman can mostly agree with everyone, but them making peace with at least one other faction is already a possible ending. 

Now, one thing I would like to see changed is the ability to have a little bit of control over the faction's future if you choose the Institute. You don't have the option to try and make the Institute better or make it start treating the people of the Commonwealth better. It is assumed that is you go Institute, they will keep kidnapping and replacing people."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"You can have an ending where only the Institute is destroyed. I feel like this is the best case scenario. It wouldn't make any sense for all the factions to have peace in the end, something needed to give."

Isn't that what happens throughout the ENTIRE GAME?"
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,I disagree. That would ruin the narrative/game. The entire premise of Night City is that there are no winners. You either die a nobody or burn out in blaze of glory. Those are exactly the endings that V has presented to them.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I thought that was actually a good ending to Mafia 2. Vito has to live with the consequences of his actions.  He wanted to be a gangster, he was willing to do anything to achieve that dream. In the end he gets what he wanted, but it came at the cost of his relationship with his sister and his best friend's life.

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,It'd be interesting if you could choose to keep going down the original path or you could choose to give up her path of vengeance and end the game early knowing what Abby and Lem's fate is.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"My head canon is that Ellie goes back to Jackson and works to regain Dina's trust. It takes time but she gets there.

The part I can't get past is that Abby took Ellie's fingers meaning she can't play the guitar anymore. This bit hurts because the guitar was how Ellie felt closer to Joel so without her fingers she loses that connection to him. I hope she found a way to play despite missing two fingers."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"She does have a chance at peace, though.

In the same way that the ending of TLOU1 is superficially happy but undercut with a note of bleak foreboding, the ending of TLOU2 is superficially grim, but undercut with a note of optimism.

Ellie has hit her rock bottom; and in hitting that rock bottom, finding out just how appallingly far one can go in the name of a loved one/to assuage one's own trauma, she's finally come to a place of true understanding for Joel, and why he did what he did.

And coming to that understanding is what finally enables her to move forward. Finally forgiving Joel for what he did. And in forgiving Joel, having to accept the final gift he wanted for her: the ability to simply go out and exist in the world, to live and have a life, and to determine the course of that life for herself. And in accepting *that,* at last, she is able to start to let go of the thing that has driven her all game: her own guilt, for not forgiving Joel, for not saving Joel, for not saving humanity, for still being alive. In achieving closure for Joel's death, she's able to start to forgive herself.

The ending of TLOU1 is a, ""They lived happily ever after... *for now,""* with an implied sword of Damocles hanging over Joel and Ellie's relationship that you know will eventually fall. The ending of TLOU2 sees Ellie go through the darkest (literal and metaphorical) storm of her life, but come out of the storm on the other side finally able to start processing her grief and trauma healthily, and start to heal."

My cope is that it mimics real life. You dont always get closure. Your choice dont always matter. 


The journey was the real ending."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I’d argue the ‘real’ problem was that the three colors all had the same result; the reapers are neutralized but the galaxy as we knew it is still effectively obliterated. 

It’s made abundantly clear throughout the entire series that the galactic community cannot exist without the Mass Relays, and only the Reapers possess the technology to build and repair them. And in each version of the ending, the entire network is destroyed, effectively ending galactic society. Every planet that isn’t fully self sufficient at that moment is cut-off and doomed, and any planet that would have been capable of being self sufficient pre-Reapers would have been a priority target and is almost certainly in ruins (ex;Earth). In the decades to centuries it would take to even rebuild the network, assuming you even can, a gigantic chunk of the galaxy would have ended up starving to death.

There’s nothing necessarily wrong with bittersweet “…but at what cost?” kind of endings, but ME didn’t end that way. If it was anymore triumphant and saccharine a unicorn would have fallen out of Garrus’ ass."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Original release didn't even have an epilogue. A whole trilogy built around the incredible cast of characters, no epilogue to see how they turned out. Probably cut off to sell as DLC like Javik was. The vendetta I have for them will never go away. They fumbled a layup so bad that it torpedoed Mass Effect as a franchise."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,4. There are 4 options.

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,Except it's locked behind a vr game. Not everyone wants/has vr gear to play alyx.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,I don't think anyone is holding their breath and they will likely do something stupid like make it vr only like alyx so a tiny portion of all gamers actually play it
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,There has been for decades
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Hopefully. I know Deadlock has been a thing for like 8 years now, not sure how much valve's resources are split atm"
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"I actually liked master chief's empty suit protagonist writing cause it made it easy for anyone to imagine themselves as the chief in the suit. I think they fucked up trying to flesh his character out. The only thing I would think they needed for inclusion was give the player an option from a female chief but never show him/her and just let us all imagine ourselves as chief.


Or or yeah just let be a random Spartan. "
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Agreed. MCC was great cause it allowed me and my buddy to play Reach to Halo 3 on couch co-op in 2019 just like the good old days. 


We used pull the couch right up to the TV. "
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,Map and level design was a noticeable step down compared to prior games. 
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Or at the very least another ODST game following new characters we've never seen before, they could make several games about them without even having to touch the main story. Unfortunately 343i was run by the same thought process that there must always be a ""bigger and badder"" threat just like all the other floundering sci-fi action stories we get nowadays. "

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Ghost's story was under fulfilling. Cool concepts, but they should have followed the initial trailer's narrative. Starts out as a full sized convention force and turns into a covert ops/guerilla warfare. "
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,I fucking hate the blades and if I had it my way I’d speak to parrthurnax and then take a decision to kill the blades instead. Fuck em.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I liked the ending of Instincts, Predator, 2, 3 and Blood Dragon. "
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,3 has. You save your friends and beautiful gf and return back to civillization. That's probably the best ending there can be. Literaly Hollywood-grade good ending.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-17,Far Cry 5 plus the colory expansion ( yh i forgot name ) has a pretty classic happy ending where you can even kinda redeem some of the antagonists if you really want.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"To each their own, I felt cheated when Snake didn't get closure and Kojima chickened out, unable to kill his protege."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,I think this it is. If she killed Abby then the game would be better. Stories about revenge where you decide in the end spare the person sucks. Ellie killed over thousand random guys but somehow Abby deserve mercy?
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I think TLoU2 was on the right track with giving Joel a cartel execution. That's kind of what it's all about, there are no heroes and there is no glory, the world is just fucked and nobody is special.  

Then they chickened out at the end by having literally every character waffle on their ideals. Tommy suddenly becomes obsessed with vengeance and doesn't care who gets hurt, Abby suddenly decides violence is bad and wants to be a good role model for Lev, Ellie goes back and forth like 3 times on whether she's batman or a family gal.  

Could probably get away with ONE of those and make it interesting, but all of it together was just sloppy and felt inconsistent. It's probably realistic, that's how people are, but it's a shoddy narrative.  

IMO they should have gone harder on the idea that Abby follows in the footsteps of Joel, her former mortal enemy, and Ellie is forced to see in Lev a better version of herself, what she could've been and what Joel wanted her to be. They were ALMOST there but fumbled it by trying to do too much at once."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,">The point of the end was Joel forsaking the world to save a girl that reminded him of his daughter.


That is if you think the Fireflies are actually capable of manufacturing a cure. I don't think they could and they were mighty fast in deciding to kill Ellie."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"100% the only reason people hate TLOU 2 is because Joel dies, which is unfortunate because it really sets up the plot of the game well and reinforces the core thesis of the game that revenge is a self destructive concept in its very nature."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,That's what I said. The ending of the series would be the end of the first game.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,That was such a bad cop out. Sending in a radiation proof ally should've been a secret ending kind of option
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Yeah, which makes it even more infuriating that it has no effect at all on the ending."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,Joe was my guy😂
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,Nothing distracts like shooting them to death. Or a stick of dynamite.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"I don't see it that way. I think Tommy always wanted revenge but didn't want Ellie to have that life. Tommy was by Joel's side during the early years when everyone was out for themselves and they were doing bad things just trying to survive so Tommy knew there would be no happy ending in pursuing Abby and didn't want that for Ellie, he knew Joel wouldn't want it either. Knowing that wasn't enough to deter him from going after Abby though, which is why he went out there on his own.

I think his change at the end was driven more by desperation and hatred of Abby causing him to override his fear of allowing Ellie to indulge her rage than an actual view change. After all, Ellie had already gone out there and already done horrible things so why not try to finish the job?"
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Tommy has a TBI from being shot alongside the brain. TBIs notoriously cause massive personality shifts. In addition to this, you see in both the first and second game that being involved in the Jackson community, being a helper, devoting himself to being one of the community's protectors is something that gives his life a lot of purpose and meaning.

By the time of the farmhouse chapter, he's had time to not only stew in the loss of his brother and his inability to avenge him, he is also physically disabled. He walks with a heavy limp, he suffers from chronic pain; he can't even park himself atop a tower and help guard Jackson's perimeter, because he's blind in one eye, and can no longer use his signature weapon: the sniper rifle. The nature of his injuries and of the setting mean that Tommy can no longer be active in the way he was; can no longer contribute to his community in the way that gave him purpose. And so in addition to the psychological damage wrought by both trauma and his brain injury, for the duration of the timeskip, he's had nothing to do *but* sit around and stew in his own bitterness."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,Tommy berating Ellie at the end was so out of character. I hated that bit so much.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,This! Well said: the comparison between the endings (optimistic with note of bleakness / bleak with a note of optimism) is spot on.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"It's not really an argument, it's a proven point that the creator was poorly staffed, under pressure from the studio, and didn't get to do what he wanted. It's just like the original ending to Evangelion vs literally any other ending. You might say ""well we got the original ending"". well, yea. Look at the actual endings they went on to make when they had the freedom to do it, though."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Nah, not the full picture. Square said just end it at disc one. He has openly said he didn't get to do what he wanted. It would have turned out differently and quite likely better. Hence the original post."

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Honestly see them retconning that. Continuning Mass Effect post reaper war in the milky way basically makes control and synthesis impossible endings to explain.


Whatever new threat comes up would need to be way deadlier than the reapers and synthesis is an asspull perfect world where conflict theoretically will no longer happen so a threat would need to be from beyond the galaxy.


And it's a retcon I wouldn't mind at all, seeing how shitty ME3's ending was."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"It's sad, but logical in a way. If the Geth survive Rannoch, they absorb the Reaper code to become completely sentient, intelligent beings. Same way for EDI because she has the Reaper Code after taking the Reaper IFF in ME2.  The destroy beam just doesn't discriminate and will eliminate anything with the Reaper code."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,The hardest choices require the strongest will
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Yeah, that's some thick ass cope.."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Yeah my issue was the ending was badly written, rushed and answered unneeded questions. It was so bad that I've boycotted EA since and I didn't even bother touching Andromeda. 

If you cut out the Star child and had Destroy as the ending then it's ok enough. Even one that ends with Shep dying isn't an issue as long as it was executed better. My suggestion for a cheesy RotJ ending would have just pleased the majority."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,The leaks so far seem to indicate that there's a non VR title and a VR title in development. With Deadlock too it seems like Valve is finally starting to make games again.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Yes ODST could have been it's own trilogy. They could have just made an ODST game for every chief game. 


Since they're just human, they could have done a Dead Space rip off even of just one ODST surviving a flood infected ship. "
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"But Paarthurnax is the OG and having him suggest you kill the Blades would imply that they were right. Fuck em, though, seriously."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"It would have been, if they didn't foreshadow it with your character basically now being a psychopath and mentally deranged from killing people. Far from a Hollywood action movie good guy wins ending."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Snake is still dead from the aging, isn't he? He just gets a few months for closure."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Abby deserved to die, she sucks."

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,I really like the part of the epilogue where Ellie tried to play the guitar again but couldn't because she lost her fingers which was more symbolism of giving everything up for revenge. She has nothing now. Not even the only thing left of Joel.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I genuinely can't comprehend how people can hold these intellectually dishonest and reductive narratives when it comes to criticism of something they like. That behavior is fucking all over Reddit and the internet.

It's insane to claim TLOU2 is only criticized because Joel died. There's so many good videos and reviews going over the story and its flaws."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Joel dying and Abby living amd Ellie never getting to avenge him, having to live on knowing his murderer and the one who crippled her is running around free and clear."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"you need to re-read that interview. he was not talking about the story being incomplete. he was talking about \*how\* they finished the game was a regret. They didnt end after solaris, and they moved into the studio and worked on it day and night just to be able to tell the whole story. there are no questioned left unanswered for xenogears."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-17,"One of the main reasons that type of ending was never that likely is cause BG3 takes place in the Forgotten Realms. This is one of the more high fantasy type settings of D&D where pretty much anything is possible.

Even when people were killed of for plot reasons and story or even progress of time; like the Companions of Drizzt, these guys reincarnated like a few decades after their death. Gods walk around and die almost all the time here."

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"For what it’s worth, Andromeda isn’t half bad. The facial animations and most of the bugs got cleaned up, and the combat is pretty fun. Story isn’t great but it isn’t offensively bad or anything. Worth picking up on sale for like $10.

You can pretty plainly tell why it wasn’t exactly a runaway success at release, but there’s meat on the bone. 

The greatest tragedy is the lack of Mass Effect games and media. S tier sci-fi universe mostly left to rot."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,They just acquired a bunch of devs from Hopoo Games (of Risk of Rain 2) too so that's a good sign.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"At least how I understood it, he managed to snap back and regain his humanity by saving his friends and returning home, while the other ending symbolizes him embracing the new psychopath side."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Right. My headcanon is in the 8 months following GOTP, snake became something of a global celebrity; he traveled with otacon and sunny, told his story, essentially cleared his name as rhe truth of the patriots came out, but the more he told, the more people questioned, irritating him to no end as his health declined, robbing him of his ability to even walk in time. In time, the authorities that once were out for his head became replaced by endless paparrazzo.

One morning, he felt a presence awake him. It was that of his old friend, gray fox. He knew what that meant. All he wanted was to watch the sunrise one more time before they left. As a fleet of  news vans pulled up on the nomad, snake laid down, and passed away with a smile on his face, like in the projectbitoh novel. They had no choice but to lift the search, the alert, ro leave him oracon and sunny alone. Snake left the world doing what he did best - giving his pursuers the slip. He got away."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"No, I think context matters a lot in a situation like that.

Full stop, they weren't gonna manufacturer a cure in that grimy hospital room. The only thing they'd have achieved is Ellie being dead and the possibility of a cure along with her."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"It's not daring to try, it's deciding to murder a girl."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I literally cried at that point. I can't believe I had to dig this deep into the comments to find someone defending the end of TLOU2, it was basically a perfect story, and any other ending would've been a disservice to the rest of the story."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Funny how most of the criticism about the game came out immediately after the plot got leaked ahead of the game launching and a lot of the complaints never changed. What else is to complain about? The existence of gay relationships? The fact that Abby has muscles even though it makes perfect sense in context? The only valid complaint about the game is that it's probably too long, the rest are a bunch of hogwash propagated by people who didn't even play the damn game."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Ellie letting go of revenge because it cost her everything she loved is the entire point of the game, the game is a warning against seeking revenge. Also I wouldn't really say Abbie is running free considering she lost basically everyone she loved and was nearly tortured to death alongside her only remaining friend. It makes me sad that these points missed you because of how clearly they are portrayed in the game."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"
""...the story in Xenogears wasn't finished. And not just limited to the monologue. It wouldn't have been so simple to make it like the game of disc 1. Probably, it's as finished as it ever will be. Maybe if the players are aggravated enough, it could be redone in the future.""

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"That's more of a stretch because the crucible activates every relay. The only way Joker, EDI, and any geth make it far is by making an FTL jump blind, which is dangerous and the pulse from the crucible theoretically travels faster since it's propelled by the relays.


Then again, I'm no Mass Effect lore expert."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Kinda defeats the purpose, since Reapers are all over the galaxy"
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-17,I’d agree with this. Pretty forgettable story wise but I thought the moment to moment action gameplay was great.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-20,"Yeah,  looking it up Valve has had a ton of hires, all people from really good studios. Definitely seems like they are cooking something up. "
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Can't quite remember, it's been ages, but I seem to recall it being ambiguous and that the island changed you.  The other ending was you getting gutted by a crazy bitch."

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Just because the leaks caused outrage, a lot of which was unfair and bigoted, doesn't mean that there isn't valid criticism to be had. 

If you think the game is a storytelling masterpiece with the only flaw being that it's probably too long, then by all means enjoy and express that. But you're filling in the reasons why people dislike the story and invalidate them in the process, that's just bad faith."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,look up who that person is. he has no authority on the matter. its a random university student's 'experience' with playing the game. it'd be like if you wrote a review.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"It doesn't, but that's beside the point. They argued against ""forsaking the world"", not for Joel being a good guy..."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"They explicitly didn't ask Ellie for her say, and they weren't capable of actually following through with making a cure. One could make a reasonable argument that they were about to murder Ellie. They certainly were from Joel's perspective. And if they were about to murder Ellie, then murdering them to stop them can be justified."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I've literally never once seen a valid criticism of TLOU 2. It's always the same bull that people were saying since the leaks. It's not bad faith because it's literally the truth. If you don't like the game or the story, that's fine, but that doesn't mean the complaints are valid either."

I'm just curious as to why BotW was higher than NieR in the score category. I'm not being toxic towards BotW (I own both), but I can only think of the reason being that BotW just had a lot more exposure and people who've played the game. I personally found the BotW score to be a bit disappointing because it was so limited but I understand it is because of the nature of the game. So I am just curious as to why the soundtrack stood out to people."

Also, Aloy’s voice actress was nothing special. She was very monotone and wooden. The voice actress for Senua in Hellblade was way better. She actually showed a range of emotion.

Its very apperent that with regards to Breath of the Wild getting such crazy high ott praise and GOAT talk etc... You have to remember that Zelda receives the same treatment from most gaming sites... ie. A total lack of objectivity due to just being Zelda/Nintendo. Whereas other rpg games(like say Horizon Zero Dawn) get criticised for being ""unoriginal"" and ""not innovate enough"" while being compared to every other rpg out there while the latest Zelda, which is the most generic Zelda yet and borrows ideas from every rpg game out there gets an ""Greatest game ever, masterpiece, GOTY"" talk just for being Zelda. Gotta love those double standards. Essentially every Zelda game that is released is the greatest of all time/GOTY, till the next one comes out.

PS. Also at the same time i remember all the same gaming critics and journos and a fair few gamers gushed over likes of Skyward Sword or the likes of Dragon Age:Inquisition in a similiar fashion with glowing reviews and ott hyperbolic praise as well... So yeeeaah im a gonna take these overly positive statements/reviews of Zelda BOTW with a large grain of salt. From what ive read and seen its not doing anything that other games havent done better before it, but because its Zelda im meant to think its the best thing since sliced bred. No thank you. I give it six months to a year later when everyone will be saying it wasn't that awesome after all, and there will be redactions and a dialing down of the ott hyperbolic praise and a more honest appraisal can be had. Thats what usually happens with Zelda games.﻿"

I got BotW because I had nothing else to play at launch, and Odyssey because I was on a Platformer kick after A Hat in Time. Odyssey, was a great game, but it felt like a very good Mario game. BotW though, felt like something new. I don't think I've ever played a game that felt so unlike a ""video game"" before. I kept trying stupid shit that would never work in another video game, just to see what would happen, and it all worked. I kept trying to break the game, to see the illusion fall apart, and they kept just working.

/r/gaming is way too hiveminded. Cuphead for best score? Lol. Surprised it didn't win best narrative too here."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,Agreed. I played both games and Nier definitely has the most phenomenal score of any game released this year. BOTW doesn't even come close.
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,"Speaking as someone who played BotW and NieR for several dozens of hours each, I can say that I hands down pick BotW. I loved NieR, and it’s definitely my favorite PC game of all time. But it still can’t even come close to BotW IMO.

I think that the narrative of BotW was very subtle, but very strong. After finishing the game and the second DLC (still haven’t gotten around to the first, I don’t even know what it is yet), I can say that the narrative totally engulfed me and I caught myself uncontrollably smiling at the key points.

While NieR does have an amazing score, I think the great thing about BotW was that it didn’t. I mean, the music was amazing, but most of your adventure was silent. It really built onto the huge world and the sensation it brought. That alone, for challenging the conventions of how a game’s music should be formatted, is what makes me think BotW managed to outperform NeiR.

But if I’m going to be totally honest, NeiR should have won both times. I personally feel that, even though BotW was my favorite, if they were equally popular games, NeiR would have won. You are totally right in saying that there wasn’t an equal playing field, but that’s life. I’m sure there’s a much smaller game out there with a better narrative and music than both BotW and NeiR. Maybe even Petscop."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-11,maybe a game that has you slogging through tens of hours of of bland gameplay through a bland world only to have to do it all over again with even more blandness for little payoff is a bad game
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,I didn't care for Nier Automata's narrative. The ideas were novel but the execution was poor. The plot was choppy due to the split chapters and aside from 2B and 9S none of the characters were fleshed out or had any real development.
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-05,It’s more like ”how many who vote play what game.”

I wish more people had the joy of experiencing NieR: Automata. Hell, I wish more people would play HZD too. These games both highlight why games can be a great medium."

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,"I like Breath of the Wild so far because it seems every of-age female wants some of that link booty.

I've barely started playing either, that is my judgment so far."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-12,"Me too. Personally I'm biased towards Zelda. It's not that I don't like Mario, but I never grew up with him, except for at friends' houses and such playing MarioKart. And I like some of the platforming games, but surprisingly this is the first time I beat a Mario game. Huh.

It was a new experience honestly and I liked the fact that it was more free and open than the hyper-linear designs they've previously had. It was clever, sounded amazing, and although I'm not a big fan of the art style, it did look nice. My personal favorites were the Metropolis and Wooded Kingdoms which looked stunning.

But BOTW was something different altogether. I had a connection the series. I was familiar with the world, but I wasn't familiar with BOTW's. It was different in all the best ways. Not only did the game look absolutely fucking beautiful, but the word was so alive. It wasn't just a few select areas with people. There were towns all over. People travelled the roads. Enemies were fairly intelligent, using weapons on the ground and other enemies as weapons. Literally my only complaints about the game were weapon durability (not the system itself but how extreme it was) and rain when you need to climb. 

BOTW and Odyssey are both something special. Odyssey perfects a series classic in Mario 64 (haven't played it but I've heard it's amazing) but BOTW reignites the fire in a series. It showed us that it was worth it to wait all those years for a new Zelda. And I'm so fucking excited for the next game."

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-10,"The combat is great, and so is the music.
The story seems good on your first play through, but once you know all of the twists the game has the worst story I've ever seen. It retcons itself (something is set up and retconed within the span of one cutscene once) the characters actions make no sense, it tries to make you sympathise with madmen, and what little character development there is is boring or cliche."

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-10,Definitely isn't. Games worthy enough to be considered an eSport are actually fun to watch. Overwatch is the most boring fucking game I've ever witnessed. Many others say the same. Overwatch has no right to be considered the best eSport game. There are games way better that have pulled way more viewership in tournaments. I'm baffled at all the 12 year olds on this sub that voted for Overwatch knowing that there are far superior games and most people agree the game is not very entertaining to spectate.

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,"Odyssey is fantastically designed, but BotW was a constant new and exciting experience. I just didn't feel that from Odyssey. It's the difference between the best version of something I've done before, versus trying something new in a hobby that I thought I'd never try something that felt new again. Everything in Odyssey impressed, but nothing surprised, not everything in BotW impressed (there are definitely issues), but there were just so many surprises in a ""games don't do that"", sense. 

I don't know how else to describe it. But I've put like 150 hours into Zelda, and maybe 40 into Odyssey, and I'm still playing Zelda 8 months after release and finding new stuff."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,"I have so many problems with Odyssey that it makes me mad that people call it well-polished. It's not. The story is short, the ending is disappointing, moons had the same problem korok seeds did, and the fact that some of Mario's moves are motion control only is a huge turn-off for me. I know I don't ""need"" the motion controls, but I hated playing in handheld because of this, and handheld was a big draw for me. SMO is great, don't get me wrong, it's one of my favorite games of the year despite how I talked about it. I just don't think it's better than Zelda in any way, including ""polish""."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,"Yeah, I remember being stuck in the rain and being like ""I need to rest so this rain passes, and thinking, I wonder if I can take that metal door and wedge it here to get out of the rain so I can start a fire. Everything in my video game limitations lexicon screamed ""This is dumb, there is no way that will work"", and it did. Time and time again I either discovered moments like this, or saw other people discovering things like this, and it was just a constant stream of ""oh, they actually thought this out to that extent?"" moments. From a game design perspective, I don't think anything I've ever played has had as well thought out and cohesive mechanics."

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-09,"I respect your opinion, however in regards to ""Best ESport"" I think it's ridiculous that CS didn't win. Its ESports fan base is just so much larger than that of Overwatch and Rocket League, and its really a unique ESport in that the concept is extremely simple and you don't really need to understand any game mechanics to spectate it - everything is very intuitive in that way.

Even if CS didn't win, how was it not on the top 3? I mean arguably I could see LoL and maybe DOTA being up there but RL and OW???"
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,"OW is good, but that's it. It's just good.

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-17,"When was the last you watched it? Recently they're really pushing for esports which is a lot easier to digest and understand. The cameras move a lot more smoothly, they have replays, a top down view occasionally, and teams have their own color and white for ""away"" teams. Does seem like they kind of tried to make it too much like US football though."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,And it clearly is not the best esports game.
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-12,"THat’s maybe true for dota (dota players tend to play only dota, they have way less games in their steam library) but that’s not the case at all for csgo in my experience"

BOTW probably still has my favorite because almost no other game uses music in the same way it does and I'm a sucker for minimalist piano and its audio design is ridiculous, but Xenoblade 2 is a close second for me right now. And I'll admit it has more earworms.

Also, that ending theme."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,"Some general criticisms

*The world is bland looking and sort boring

*The side quests are basically ""Go here, kill this robot and collect an item""

*The supporting characters are underdeveloped and the Villains are severely lacking

*Too much of the story relies on expositional data logs

*The item/upgrade system requires too much grinding

*The game didnt need to be broken up into multiple playthroughs. 9S's story was almost identical to 2B's with 1 or 2 extra tidbits of information and the playthrough just had you repeat everything you've already done but added the hacking minigame.

*The game has a message that's all too familiar and redundant. We get it, AI can have feelings too, War is pointless, whats the meaning to life, yada yada yada...it's all been done before and Nier Automata just beats you over the head with it from start to finish.

With all that being said it's still a well made game and the presentation was great. It just didnt ""Wow"" me like most people."

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-05,I think the audience that frequents the sub is probably not that into esports. I mean I think it's still really up in the air whether Overwatch goes anywhere as an esport and this coming year is going to be a big test to see if they can actually start bringing in the viewers.
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-10,"I used it as a starting point and added in many areas. We have another plan for next year. For the most part, what we have got the job done rather well. I’m rather positive it wouldn’t have changed the top 3 in any category."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-05,That might explain why only 2/3 of people on Xbox even bothered to complete the first area. They may have felt it was too slow.

I would think to myself ""this should be blowing my mind right now"", and I was really trying to force myself to feel that feeling after a while, but it wasn't happening for me.

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-05,It’s because Rocket League/Psyonix has terrible marketing and not really good production value compared to top tier e-sports. The game is pretty much soccer which is already the most viewed real life sport. Idk how they haven’t captured a larger audience by now. I feel like Latin America would eat the game up
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,"I agree on your point about the characters, I felt the same there. I also agree about the story not being as special as some make it out to be.

My other problem was the combat. I felt that the game never forces you to play different and you fight every enemy the same. Also, you are basically the same as the beginning in the end except for a few minor changes. Though I heard when you max things out gameplay changes but in my playthrough to E I was never able to max everything or anything besides the Engine Blade.

I think the bland world, although from a game standpoint is very lacking, worked for the game itself. I think people hype the multiple playthroughs a little, but I do think A and B were slightly cool in that it gives you extra tidbits second time around. It's basically continuing the story with credits in-between. I feel like most side quest in games are the same so I never dock games for them.

That being said I do think it's great at being a game, but doesn't amount to be untouchable as many claim it to be. It's an okay game overall."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,"

* It's an dying world, what are you hoping for.

* The side quests is simple, yes, but I don't think it's insignificant for it can add a lot to the game' world. 
* If this is about A2, yes, but only ingame.
* This is personal so i don't judge you.
* Again, this is also personal. You don't HAVE to do so.
* I don't think of route B as ""another playthrough"" because it isn't. A normal playthough is consist of three main route, A, B, C. And I suppose you don't know the purpose of playing as 9S in route B as well?
* Perhaps. But it's not about the theme or the message, it's the way the story is told.


If it didn't ""wow"" you then simply it isn't for you. You don't have to love everything. But you need to fully undertand the game story or at least a main part of it to bash the game for something like ""overhyped"". "

What you watch isn't tied to what you know. I know football in and out and it's boring as fuck compared to something like marksmen games or hockey, both of which I know little about.

What matters is that you can clearly see what is good, what is bad, and who is who, while being able to recognize a next-level skill held by pros. In OW it's just... the exact same thing repeated over and over. The minute-to-minute gameplay hardly ever changes or evolves. It's the same thing that drags NASCAR down. Oh, a left turn! Oh, a left turn! Oh, a left turn! Oh, he shot her! Oh, he shot her! Oh, he shot her!

All that leaves are investments into the personalities. Sure, that's good, but it's bad to have that as your only supporting pillar besides the level of marketing.

Narrative is a very aesthetic concept - so you get a mix of people not understanding and just a general disagreement on what resonated more.

Some of the most tired and overused tropes can be presented in a way that they connect with the viewer/reader/player.

We arent talking about a game with no narrative vs one with a strong narrative - they are both single player games with an emphasis (generally) on story.

From what I've seen of both games - they seem to be really strong in different aspects of the spectrum. I really dont think fanboy-ism has anything to do with the majority of voters (as Horizon is a brand new IP).

I hope I get to play both soon - holding off on buying a ps4 until I know wether or not TLOU 2 is coming this gen or next."

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,"For sure. I've actually spent more time on Splatoon 2 than Odyssey and Breath of the Wild combined, and I've spent a *lot* of time on Breath of the Wild and Odyssey, so that really speaks to the fact that I've been pretty hooked on this console. As much impatience as I have for Nintendo's general bullshittery, so many great hits (and so much to look forward to) in a single year is pretty spectacular. When I speak to people about the merits of the Switch they think I'm a paid Nintendo shill or something, which is pretty spectacular."

So I think the problem here is that existentialism isn't for you. About the ""belittling"" thing. Yeah, that's what happens in every fandom. They just want you to experience the same feelings but the way they force you into is a bit too harsh. 



Look, i LOVE NieR/Drakengard series and i know that there are people who don't like it and i know why. But i HATE the word ""overhyped"". It's ... subjective. People don't just praise some random game' story for no reason, right?"

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-05,"well yeah but as I said having money isn't going to make the games any more fun to watch.

I also play League as well (since beta started!), but DotA is preferred."

key word was shitpost"
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-15,"I disagree. To me an RPG is a game with a heavy focus on character choice.  Choosing what clothes to wear isn’t really very impactful though. For example in Pillars of Eternity you visual customization is pretty limited, but instead you customize your characters personality and origin in great depth. This shapes all the interactions you have, and the way characterd will treat you. Those are to me more typical RPG elements, this stuff has been streamlined/watered down and slapped on every action game and now they call it an RPG. At the end of the day its not super important, but its just some food for thought."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,"I don’t see how Nier is revolutionary in terms of storytelling. I’ve played through all 5 major endings, the only times it ever uses interaction as a storytelling device is the very beginning of the game and the very end. Beyond that, it’s world/fiction is very well developed and some of its mechanics and its UI is grounded in that fiction pretty well, but that’s not storytelling nor is it revolutionary. "

* DMC 5 (I expect Microsoft to have Cyberpunk)
* Whatever From Software are doing
* Bluepoint's next project
* Red Dead Redemption 2 exclusive stuff 
* Maybe a hint at Horizon 2
* Resident Evil 2 Remake

Also I'm not sure where Rocksteady show up (I'm leaning toward Microsoft but you never know)
 
Edit: Seeing what we have, I'm saying Rocksteady and Square's Avengers tease at Sony. That's a lot of superhero stuff but I'm not sure what other big teases there are (that we know exist) and something brief of FFVII remake. I would have said Assassin's Creed too as it usually shows up more than once but Ubi to Sony is pretty close depending on how much Ubi show. Kingdom Hearts seems pretty big too, wouldn't be surprised if Sony have some game play exclusive video.

Out of nowhere, Tony Hawk comes onto the stage on his skateboard and reveals skate 4 and a new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game that isn't complete ass.

Then, sprinting onto the stage like a madman, we see Miyamoto. He's panting and trying to catch his breath

He's holding a piece of paper in his hand

He holds it up for all to see

Here's hoping Sony was just *confirming* those four major titles would be shown, not saying they would be the *only* ones to be shown. According to a lot of sources, they heard the outcry against last year's conference being only about games we knew about, so hopefully we'll have a fair few announcements fired at our waiting eyeholes.

Last of us 2: .. how is the PS4 gonna run something so fucking movielike? I thought those graphics were a decade away. What the actual fuck.

Death Stranding: ?

Death stranding was super confusing, but you could tell it will look great and will have some sort of platforming/traversing ? section. Some stealth/hiding and combat...Ghost looked amazing visualy and the gameplay (depending on how free/scripted ) it will looked amazing also.

Spiderman looked fucking amazing, we will fight the sinister 6 AND its in the same universe as the avenger game ?!?

And they sneaked in a new ip i think with the ""Control""game that looked great.

Out walks Gabe, and the half-life 3 symbol flashes on to screen, burning bright against the darkness.

The symbol gets jumped by a funko pop headcrab, and the words, ""exclusively on PSN and mobile!"" appear underneath.

Gameplay footage shows all the main characters as funko pops, deployed onto the field, attempting to destroy an enemy base, with all the mechanics and microtransactions of a Clash of Clans rip-off.

The trailer skips ahead to show multiplayer mode, an obvious battle royale mode, featuring large scale battle on a single map of large terrain. Canned, pre-recorded audio can be heard, as your squad congratulates you on that totally awesome kill.

The crowd looks on in horror as the words ""Pre-order today to get 6 steam trading cards and 1 free month of additional challenges, used to unlock a war chest containing a new random skin!"" flash up on screen."

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Damn you Sony...they own the rights to Spidey and out of every game to make exclusive it has to be this
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Vulture’s clearly the tutorial boss. He’s been pretty pathetic all demo.
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"Wait there's more after this ""short"" break right? RIGHT!?"

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Sony exclusives always remind me how annoying exclusives are. I’m legit interested in that Spider-Man game.
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,So the presentation done?
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Suuuuper psyched at that resident evil trailer!!

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,that's it? I think they could've cut some of the longer demos short and had a few more games people were expecting 
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,I didn’t know rocksteady’s follow up to the Batman games was a Spider-Man game from insomniac

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,That was... bad? Am I allowed to say that about anything Sony?
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"The flow of this conference is not good, have people in a room showing videos and talking heads in a different location?

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Thank you Sony for just delivering footage and gameplay and cutting out all the awkward speeches.
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Best gameplay shown at E3 so far 
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Holy shit this is boring
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Anyone feel like Sony just didn’t come to play this year? Felt ridiculously under par compared to Bethesda and Microsoft.
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-11,"May be a small crowd but how about some Crash Team Racing & Crash Bash with Multiplayer support!

Also as a VR owner. I don't understand why they don't have more third person platformers, or Mortal Kombat VR! Would love some more VR content. 

Can't wait for Battle Royales to die. "
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"Well, if you like games with movie-style CGI and dark environments that presentation was definitely for you. "
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Looks like a slow start folks. Maybe they’ll pull a Bethesda and pull a good conference out of their asses.
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Well fucking played Sony

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,What's up with the so and so won comments? I think we all won because we get to enjoy these games.
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,No new Knack? smh
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"Well it started weird but it got better I guess

I'm sold on KH 3, LSOU2 and Spiderman. I think that anything else caught my attention a little bit aside for Rick n Morty, Destiny and COD. But I would need to see more of those games to see if Im sold on the idea like the other 3.

It was good, but I think MS was better.

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Intermission after one video? Is the audience moving from room to room?
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,So they’ve designed different rooms for each game? God I love sony 
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Probably going to a “proper” stage now?

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"This is.. a different take from Sony to say the least, so far. I'm not sure I've ever seen a panel like this in the middle of a showcase."

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Sony is getting a little arrogant now.
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,I would be pretty pissed as an attendee. Having to walk all over the LACC every 10 minutes to find a new seat among a crowd of 1000 people just so they can change stages. L

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Roach looks different
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"Gameplay for both of the games Sony has shown so far. You can shit on them for the intermission and what they're doing on stage, but at least they are showing you the games unlike other companies. "
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Well as it turns out all it takes for me to buy a game is a flute and a bit of sword combat. Well played Sony. 
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Ghost of Tsushima gameplay looking better than I thought it would. Fully on board the hype train for this.

Spiderman games have had a habit of being very ""dynasty warriors"" if that makes sense, in taht they'd just throw mobs of enemies to mow down at you to complete stages.

This was more or less a conference for people who wanted to see gameplay. "
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Kojima really threw in a toenail in the trailer to distract us from the fact that we still have received zero information about this game. I wonder if people will eventually get bored of the mystery of the game if they release yet another movie like trailer or will the hype maintain?
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"Dude, this format of conference was so bad"
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"What the hell did I just watch?! 

Church banjo man, then gameplay. 15 minute break with awful commentary. New conference center, white Asian guy playing flute. Probably the most interesting game shown. More bad commentary. Some more games. PlayStation logo comes up on screen, confusion in the crowd. Conference ends abruptly with more bad commentary to follow."

Dude, she knew at the end of the first game. The reason she even said this:

*""Swear to me. Swear to me that everything you said about the Fireflies was true.""*

was because she knew he was lying. She just wanted to know if he was willing to commit to it. We saw earlier in the game that she has a good bullshit detector. She went along with the lie, saying ""Okay"", because she understood why he was lying. He cared too much about her and didn't want to lose her. She felt the same way about him. "

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"I feel like he's probably taken on more of a leading role, instead of going out and actually killing people. I don't think Joel's *that* much older than Ellie, and Ellie looks like 20-30. I'd think Joel is still able to do stuff physically, we might even get a Joel sequence later on, like we did with Ellie in TLoU part 1."
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"After seeing Tomb Raider demo have a guy's buddy get killed right after a conversation and then him saying ""a body! looks recent!"" I thought why can't they make the AI ""know"" who their allies are.

Really loved how the TLOU2 AI was calling each other out by name and seemed to care about each other. God I hope that wasn't just scripted for the demo."
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"IIRC, TLoU part 2 takes place 5 years after the first, so Ellie would be 19. In the first game, they said Joel had Sarah young, you can fairly estimate an age of 18-22. When the outbreak started, Sarah was 12, making Joel 30-34. The rest of the game takes place 20 years later. Making him 50-54. Then tack on the five years in between parts one and two, and Joel is 55-59.

My personal bet is that Joel does take a leader role, but gets killed by the people who Ellie said that “[she’d] find and kill every last one of them” in the trailer that was released last year. I think she wasn’t actually talking to Joel, but just imagining his ghost. "

109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-11,"Not killing Joel would be stupid, it would make the entire game pointless. What point would Abby and the others serve? For what reason would Ellie be going for revenge, did they accidentally run over her dog? 

Joel dying simply reminds us that there are always two sides, as well as consequences to your actions. Just because we played Joel we see the good guy who wanted to save a girl. However from Abby’s perspective it is a selfish guy who decided one life was more important than the rest of the world, and killed her dad who was trying to find a cure. Joel doomed the world with his actions, something even Ellie acknowledged. To let him off scott free would be bad writing."
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-11,They aren't changing the story. What they'll probably do is change the order in which the story is told and get more Abby at the start and kill Joel towards the midpoint of the game.

109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-11,"Stop your bitching. Killing Joel was a good thing for Ellies story, plus gameplay with Ellie was quick and intense, playing as Abbie was brutal and a great perspective. You are not safe in the world of the last of us. Take it as it is."
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-11,"That's the story they wanted to tell and told it. They defend it publicly in several interviews. If you, the gamer, don't like it, it is a you problem. There are many pieces of work that don't tell the story a particular segment of consumers want to hear. It doesn't mean it a bad story. Oftentimes it's a good story, it just elicits unpleasant feelings in you, which is one of the main goals of a piece of art."

109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-11,I think that will anger the fans even more. They fucked and they should own it. They can still make a great third part. For me part 2 was great also
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-12,They should make him come back as some kind of mutated zombie an he’s the one that kills Ellie

109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-12,All I know is Ellie is for sure dying in part 3.
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-12,"Doomed the world? 

Wait are we acting like the bishock method of harvesting little sisters was truly the best way to go about saving the world?"
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-11,"This is what I was thinking, it's not called the last Joel and Ellie, it's the last of US."
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-11,Whats your favorite videogame character rn?
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-11,">That's the story they wanted to tell and told it. They defend it publicly in several interviews. If you, the gamer, don't like it, it is a you problem.

That doesn't make it a good story. And I'm hardly the only one who complained about it. Joel was sacrificed for the sake of a shallow revenge story. It wasn't compelling or well-written at all. A complete waste of all its characters, not even just Joel."
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-12,"Oh boy, check out the pencil dick on this incel everybody!"
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-12,"Perhaps you should re read the comment. From the perspective of Abby and her people, and once again even Ellie acknowledges it, that yes he doomed the world. The operation on Ellie would have killed her, but it was literally the only thing they could find to develop a cure, nothing else has worked. Abby’s dad did not just skip his happy ass in there and be happy go lucky over this, he was struggling and was torn, Abby has to console him and even tells her dad if she was in Ellie’s place she would want him to do the surgery. Ellie was pissed at Joel when she found out the truth. So again yes Joel doomed everyone, he took Ellie the only person ever to be immune and who could have become a cure, and killed all the people who knew about it as well as who could perform the surgery and make a cure. 

It doesn’t mean that it is an easy choice, no one would approach that situation as if it was a simple thing. I agree with Abby, if there was a major out break and people all over the world were dying and I were some how immune, and I find out that I could be used to make a cure and save millions but the operation would kill me, then I would go ahead and do it. Would I wish there was another way? Of course, but in this situation, our tech and everything is basically gone, we are out of our resources and pretty much all our experts. So you have no other options. It’s this or that. I’m pretty sure if everyone told Ellie before the surgery, she would have agreed to it as well. So again yes Joel doomed the world with his choice. However you seem to be thinking that they are in our world and they were not over run with zombie like creatures, and still have unlimited resources, and that the people involved weren’t acting with any humanity. They were, the decision was agony for them, but they could not think of any other options. It was all they had."
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-11,"Idk why “the last joel and ellie” made me laugh so hard, imagine? Like literally nobody can be named joel or ellie 💀 but yea i hated those crybabys, i did love tlou2, even tho the “second part” shocked me at the beginning, at the end i enjoyed playing as abby and getting to know her"
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-11,Why lol
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-11,"I don't agree. It is well written, and Abby is a great, well-developed character. You can dislike where the story went without thinking it's a bad-written story. 

But your question was about whether they will change one of the key parts of the story and so far there are no evidence suggesting that they are even considering doing that."
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-12,"Sounds like retconning to me. From messed up scientists not thinking about the human they plan to sacrifice for a potential greater good, to a laughable one that just said, we were only humans trying to save the world. We mourned our father and killed the man who killed him but you shouldn't kill us because where does it end? 

What did I miss?"
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-12,"Well whoever that character is, imagine that in the next installment of that franchise that character gets incredibly dumbed down and whacked in the first 30 mins and then has about 45 minutes total screentime in a 20 hour long game. Its not about the fact that he died, its the way they worked with his character. Joel always reminded me of Leon in The Professional, I loved this movie ever since and Leon is one of my all time favorite characters. But Joel legit got thrown away like a bottle cap. And I dont mean he needed some heroic last act, but 12 hours of the game tries to make us understand Abbies perspective, but what about Joels?, we see flashbacks of Abby and her father, why not flashbacks of Joel and Sarah?. Like is it that hard to understand?."
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-13,"They did think about the person who would be sacrificed. The surgeon didn’t want to do it. Ellies mom’s friend who promised to take care of Ellie didn’t want to do it, no one wanted to do it. Sounds like you just decided no one has any humanity. No one said sacrificing her was right. 

I also never said Abby was right in killing him. However when Ellie killed Abby’s people, she ultimately chose to let Ellie go, and Ellie chose to go after her again. Abby only went after Joel, the guy who did the killing, and let Ellie and Joel’s brother go, Ellie and Joel’s brother chose to go after everyone. And refused to move on were Abby did in the end. Abby was in the perfect position to get all of them but she didn’t. That’s what you missed. When you go for revenge, and then that person goes for revenge, you end up in a never ending circle until everyone is dead. Even Ellie’s girl told her to let it go, but Ellie chose to continue and lost her girl and the baby because she chose to leave. In the end neither side was in the right, Abby’s lover Owen even called her out. Can’t remember everyone’s names it’s been a minute since I played. But when you’re looking at perspectives, both sides see themselves as the victim. It’s never one sided. That is another thing you missed."
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-12,"We had a whole game on Joel's perspective, and you having this emotion is I say what they meant to do. You hate Abby, you hate the makers of the game for making no one safe in an apocalyptic game."
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-12,"No we had a whole game on Joel and Ellie building up a relationship through having a common goal. The flashback of Sarah dying was just the premise. And again Im not saying the 2nd one shouldve been about Joel, but if the game is all about discovering the different sides of tragedy than there shouldve been a stronger focus on him, dude got turned into an idiot and wasted like a goon in some Tarantino movie. I dont understand how anyone can argue that this wasnt just wasted. Tragic characters do exist and are justified but Joel just got written out.   


And thats always funny how people assume so much just because someone isnt on their side of the argument. Let me guess Im ""some overweight incel that only feels spite towards women because he doesnt have any game and I hate gay and trans people just because""?. I dont hate Abby, I just think her character was just flat as hell and didnt bring much to the table, most of the characters just felt like plot devices, and I dont hate those who made the game, I just think that they failed at what they were trying to do and wasting one of the top 10 game characters in the process was just a bad trade off. I genuinely felt nothing when the credits rolled other than what a waste this was. And no one is safe in the apocalypse?, my point was that Joel dying isnt the issue, its the value and relevance he had in the story. Its like ""no one is really just good or evil, this game is just too realistic for you...but yeah, Joel deserved it fuck that guy!""."
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-12,"Joel did deserve to die, ellie deserves to die as well, abby too, everyone in that world deserves to die, and the whole game is about Joel getting killed because abby wanted revenge, and bc of that ellie going after abby for revenge as well, i don't see how you can't see that abby not killing Joel is not an option, he killed her father, wtf even i would want to kill joel for that, or you want Joel to be a superhero that can't ever be killed because people love him? Wtf"
109hb4r,2023-01-11,2023-01-13,"Dude I said like 5 times that Joel dying wasnt the main issue, I wasnt even surprised when I heard it prior to release. And I guess if Abby also deserved to die Ellie made a mistake letting her live at the end is what youre saying?.

And I just red about some early draft in which Abby ""infiltrates"" Jackson and actually gets close to Joel before shit goes down. Now just imagine Abby being half dead in the snow, Joel and Tommy find her and take her in, Abby gets a whole different impression of him than she expected, she befriends Ellie and over the course she genuinely doubts that killing him would be right seeing him being this good man just trying to protect everybody. But the more she sees that it reminds her of what he took from her and ends up killing him.

Those that loved Joel so much wouldve got to play him more, you would have a great projection of the grey area of morality and good vs evil and if they wanted a revenge plot they could do it. This wouldve been so much more nuanced than Joel dying to a golf club in the first 30 min and the rest of it mostly a series of events that just happen.

Joel used to be such a distinctive and memorable character, easily top10 for most ppl and what they did was just a disgrace and I just dont understand how anyone in his right mind things this was the pinnacle of story writing in videogames. Decent fanfiction wouldve been more satisfying than that."
18aysvu,2023-12-05,2023-12-05,That looks sick.
18aysvu,2023-12-05,2023-12-05,Fuck those stupid review bombers who killed the games popularity. It’s a good game with a few flaws sure but it did not deserve to be shut on so hard.
18aysvu,2023-12-05,2023-12-05,"This looks really awesome. If you’ve ever watched clips of people playing TLOU2 really aggressively, you know how fluid and beautiful it looks in the hands of somebody who has mastered the combat. I’m genuinely really excited!"
18aysvu,2023-12-05,2023-12-05,Okay this might get me to actually play the game if it came to PC.
18aysvu,2023-12-05,2023-12-05,Interesting.

18aysvu,2023-12-05,2023-12-05,"I like TLOU2's gameplay, and this is very much a focus on that, which is cool.

I love Roguelikes but I don't know how I feel about TLOU2's version of it. Those ""modifiers"" looked pretty meh.

Unless they have a BUNCH of different environments and enemy-placements? I can see this getting kinda boring pretty quickly, at least as a Roguelike."

So playing the game is fun, but I disagree about the story. There was nothing the writers could do to make up for the fact that they killed off Joel that early in the story. We NEEDED more time with the duo seeing them grown up going on a couple more adventures together, something, anything."

waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,">”Let me know your thoughts”

I think it’s been two years and this discussion was worn out a couple months after the game released"
waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,"TLOU 1 for me. 

Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy TLOU 2. I think it's definitely one of the better games in recent times, particularly from a technical standpoint, but in terms of narrative it just can't hold a candle to its predecessor."
waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,Well I thought it was pretty neat
waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,"I don't even know ""story game"" means, but I'm guessing it means a strict, linear game that unfolds like a play by giving you stage directions to act out, token combat, and breaking it up with cutscenes.

It's the least interesting type of game to me, because it doesn't exploit the unique qualities of games to tell the story. It might as well just be a novel or a film.

But still, the characters were uninteresting. Ellie and Dina had too much in common for there to be any chemistry. There were many wasteful characters who just took up space and time and left as quickly as they came into the story after they had served their functional purpose. It went on forever. I preferred Abby's section to Elle's, but the inclusion of both was a bad idea. It was the most heavy handed solution to the problem of getting the player to understand things from both sides.

I think if this game didn't dazzle people with graphics - if it were a novel for instance, or an RPGmaker game, people wouldn't have given it the time of day."
waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,"The game would have been a 10/10 if Joel died later in the game. I would have liked to see him kick some ass. I think his death fits the game, just not at the beginning"
waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,"Very few games get a real emotional response out of me. That game managed to make me sick to my stomach with the decisions ellie kept feeling like she had to make. That alone is worthy of praise in my experience. There were ham fisted plot points and some seriously unrealistic actions taken, and I felt like the moral they were trying to push was a little obvious and dumbed down for a 5 year old. But then I saw the response to it and realized they knew the audience better than I did."
waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,Now u see it
waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,True
waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,"Regardless the justification of your revenge, you can still become a villain was then point actually.  And your comment up there is why this game has such a serious divide."
waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,"And after killing all her friends and see her let me leave, I will still go for revenge even if what I did was 20 times worst than what she did to me.

I could have been great if Abby killed Elie at the end."
waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,"In the moment she was about to kill Abbie, Ellie thought of a good Joel memory and decided to try and start moving in from this cycle. It’s great tbh"
waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,A few minor flaws is always apart of a story. Besides most of those people attacked Ellie too.
waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,Everyone got garbage opinions
waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,Give it a shot
waw0i9,2022-07-29,2022-07-29,We got like 9 hrs with them both together and the several flashbacks in part 2. If they would’ve gone on another adventure in 2 it would’ve been playing it safe. Glad they took the risk to expand the world and the story. They latched onto the idea that even good people die in that world and Joel deserved it. Still love Joel tho

havmt3,2020-06-17,2020-06-18,"The point really is that it doesn't matter if it sells like heroin, or is DOA. People interested in the game can buy it, and people not interested in the game can not buy it. Neither choice affects anyone but the individual person. 

If you think the devs are stupid, or they ""shit on the game"", or the game looks terrible, or you just hate sequels, literally any possible reason you can think of to not want to buy the game: **you don't have to.** The game comes out, you save your $60, and that's it. You've successfully avoided the game, and all you had to do, was absolutely nothing.

Going on forums and demanding (or even asking politely) that other people not buy the game, it's two types of people:

* People who want to be on the cynical bandwagons, where it's popular to hate on x, y, z

or

* People who delude themselves into thinking that their personal opinion affects, or should affect, others."

8wcrtr,2018-07-05,2018-07-05,I'm speechless.
8wcrtr,2018-07-05,2018-07-06,You going for a teen look?

kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Pffff
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"Im not gonna call rigged

But how the fuck did this get 7 awards and game of the year?"
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,I'm actually so confused. I mean it kinda makes sense because of who voted but it was a very mediocre game. Man critics are seriously out of touch with the gamers
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,This game was complete and udder propaganda horse shit
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,It’s shouldn’t have won but sure it’s fine. Doom or animal crossing were my guesses. That’s just my personal opinion. I’m not going call it rigged like the other people
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,is this a joke?
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"After seeing some posts over here bashing about its win, good to see a positive one in rising. It did deserve it. I don’t say it often coz I don’t wanna start a fight."
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Maybe it did.  I never played any of the games motioned for any award because none of them interested me.  Which is the underlying problem with these events and awards.  In the end they mean nothing as I am not going to spend a few hundred dollars on a PlayStation to play this game.  So no point in arguing who won or not.  PLAY WHAT YOU ENJOY AND ENJOY IT!
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"How do they deserve it? The gameplay was literally recycled from the first one, barely any changes and the story was mediocre at best."
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,I'm not mad at this. I hate the story but the gameplay was so fucking good omg. It's the combat the matters most to me and this game just did it perfectly. It was so satisfying
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"r/gaming is not the right community to post this, there are g... G-.... Game-.... GAMERS here"
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Based
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Mediocrity and cash money for the win.
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,the game have a bad story but good gameplay
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Angry chuds malding. Gotta lover capital-G gamers crying over an award show.
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"It was an amazing game, I guess, I think the judges judged it as a game and not in the context of all the controversies, and they voted the game despite knowing well that they are gonna get hate, so it truly says that this is a truly amazing game"
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Maybe because it was good?
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Unlike the gamers who review bombed it minutes after it's release
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"question: did you know all the controversies before playing the game? Did it influence your view on this game in some way? No hate to you tho, I'm not trying to start an argument, it's just that I want to know if it actually came from your genuine opinion"
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,That's why I don't get about people say what you will about the story but naughtydog fucking killed it with the gameplay they did everything right in that aspect.
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,[deleted]
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Prolly the most based post I've seen on Reddit to date
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"Best narrative though I mean come on that's just absurd, there were games that weren't even nominated that would have deserved best narrative over part 2"
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Your kidding right?
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,It was absolute shite
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"I heard about them but I made sure to avoid spoilers. Bought it on release because I loved part 1 (which is why I don't think launch sales should be any indication of the game's quality). I played the entire game from start to finish. Enjoyed some aspects, namely the visuals. But the gameplay was bland, repetitive and nothing new, and the story... well, was the story lol"
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"ah yes the ""oh you don't like the game? Then it must be because of the controversies!"" The game is just mediocore at best. Honestly it's a story-focused game, with a story that doesn't really make sense. You kill many randoms with no remorse, then when Ellie gets to kill people that actually screwed her over, she just doesn't do it, or breaks down because of it? Oh and then we go back to killing randoms again!"
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Smelly ass
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"Too bad Destiny 2’s new campaign didn’t count as a new game, that would’ve at least had best audio or narrative, it had a great story to it"
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Jeez man. I just wanted to know
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Maybe audio but I wouldn't necessarily say narrative I've played a lot of destiny and no offense but unless they've made some big changes to how they handle their writing for the game i wouldn't say they've ever been as good as a lot of more narrative focused games.
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"Regardless if they had heard the controversies, not liking the game would still have been their genuine opinion."
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"it's okay, but still the way you said it just made it look like you implied that it's just due to controversy. Oooooor it can just be me, because I've already seen far too many people reject any criticism because ""ur a bigot lol"" ;-;"
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"well, Crowd mentality can also be a factor, that's why I asked this fine fellow about it, you know what they say: Monkey see monkey do"
kavzqd,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,It aight
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The combat looks brilliantly brutal, holy shit."
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You can go ahead and stop E3 now
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The dynamic combat was impressive 
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"“I think they should be terrified of you.” 

Well, that statement seems a bit...
*cuts to her stabbing a baddie*
Layered."
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I can hear the cpu fans on my pro spinning up now. 
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I could never imagine a game so cool as TLoU 2.
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Welp, buyin a PS4 Pro now
"
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What &#37; of that trailer was doctored or scripted? Would like to get a solid number on that from the studio.
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Tlou is my favorite game of all time. I've waited so long for this and I'm willing to wait even longer. I have never been so fucking hyped for a game.
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Omg they way they hung that guy and cut open his abdomen, wtf."
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This game looks amazing.  Just like the first ~~movie~~ game, looks like It'll be an interactive cinematic experience.  As a less-than-Conservative Christian, I'm curious how my very-Conservative Christian gamer friends will react lol!

Edit: Fixed the stupid"
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Well, not that I didn’t expect it, but it seems Naughty Dog is about to produce another masterpiece that puts its competition to shame. Just the trailer is beautifully put together. Their storytelling and character development is on another level that I can’t think of another game game that comes close to capturing human emotions

EDIT: obviously I didn’t mean to send “game” twice
DOUBLE EDIT: Is there anyone else that can produce high quality characters/storylines better than Naughty Dog right now? The whole Uncharted series was way above average, and the first Last of Us was the best I’ve seen ever. Just from this trailer, it seems they’ve done it again. Remarkable."
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I am going to get nuked for this, but what's new? Excluding graphical upgrades, it looks pretty much the same as the first one.."
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I would love to see a mother walk in on a 12 year old playing this game during the bar scene and just be like wut the hell are you playing
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Brutal, yet satisfying "
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"""Fucker"""
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Does it stand upright w/o obstructions (e.g. does it sit in a shelf)?
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,ND is known for keeping it real during their gameplay trailers. You can see how the player makes mistakes all the time.
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Judging from what we’ve seen so far, the story is going to take the characters to a whole new place in their lives, is going to introduce some new characters/themes, show this world as it has changed over the several years since the first game, and integrate some new combat mechanics also. You should know already that this game is going to be a different experience than the first one."
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yeah the problem is the Lesbians not the graphic and brutal violence.
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,its just two girls kissing. perfectly normal.
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The game will not be accessible for 12 year olds  for brutality reasons and not a kiss between two women you dumbass
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Brutal combat is never not satisfying 
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It lays flat in a tv stand but the back of the stand is open. Loudest I’ve heard it is God of war though.
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This is america
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"When did I say ""problem""? I think it's funny cause it would make a 12 year old boy horny to see two girls kissing. It would be unusual, since the games she sees him play are typically shooting people, to walk in and he is seemingly playing a kiss at the rodeo game. "
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"ugh yeah jesus but the sensual ramp up, it would be unusual for a 12 year old boy to be playing if the mom saw a second of the screen.

Edit to add: Like I watched the lesbian leaning anime Strawberry Panic under my covers in secret when I was 12. You think if my mom walked in she'd be like, yes perfectly normal, or would she be like.. ""...wut are you watching right now..?"""
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It would be unusual for any 12 year old to be playing this game considering it will almost definitely be rated 18/R, its the parents fault at that point."
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"but games have always been violent and they haven't always been two people kissing, that's what makes it unusual. Fuck he could be raised by two moms and have four grandmothers and there could be no straight people in the world the mom would be like ""are you playing a rodeo kissing game...?"""
8qew0e,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah I guess if she walked in at the exact moment they kissed and then left before it transitioned into the night scene then it would be an odd style of game, but that's not really the point I'm getting at "
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"I mean, all that is very true. But I thought the story was by far the strongest aspect."
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Technically it was impressive but imo a story-driven game should have an interesting story. This is was made the first game a masterpiece. While the prequel has improved many aspects I felt like it has lost it's narrative.
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Because story is all they do that's actually unique.

Graphics and detail is a meaningless benchmark because something better is always gonna come alone and beat it."
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Why do you think the game with the most GOTY awards in history is slept on?
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,[removed]
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"So you think one of the top selling games in 2020 was slept on?

(The following will have spoilers but the games over a year old and I’m not sure why you would be on this thread if you hadn’t played it).

Ignoring that rather odd point TLOU2 has a lot of issues.

Claims of padding not being in the game is wrong, so much of the game time is empty walking with nothing happening.

The second half is an attempt to add sympathy but doesn’t really work.  The reason being you have to be on one side for a story to work if you’re trying to be both sides you end up with a mess that doesn’t fit coherently.  

Look at NIER Replicant and how it does it’s B,C,D play through and adds more to the “bad guys” and how you that makes you think about the whole game as a whole and how you are “the bad guy” from a certain point of view.

TLOU2 doesn’t really succeed in this as it tries to show Abby’s change after meeting Lev & Yara in such a short period of time after having killed 20+ Scars already in your short time in her story.

The change is too abrupt as she had shown no interest in leaving up to that point so that whole side of the story doesn’t work.

Ellie letting them go and whilst being happy with Dina despite suffering only to change her mind after Tommy has a go at her doesn’t fit her character.

Whilst revenge is something she wanted she does feel strongly about family and loyalty and wouldn’t of abandoned her child and partner.

The gameplay aspect is also suspect, ND can’t do combat still.

The shooting is just awful, considering both Abby & Ellie are supposed to be very proficient and arguably some of the highest skilled in their respective factions you would expect a better experience from this side but it is very clunky.

You need to use your melee a lot as ammo is in short and this is biggest issue with the game which tries to portray its self as immersive.

You will have bad guys fire 10,000 bullets each at you while sneak and execute them as you have only have 3 bullets, yet when you check their corpse they have no ammo on them.

The main gameplay loop end up being spam triangle around every corner of every room as your resources are always poor and that’s just dull.

The games 25 hours long and it feels like 10 hours of it is spam triangle, 5 hours walking with talking and 5 hours of combat and 5 hours of stealth.

Also the playing guitar was ok the first time but is repeated far too often to shove a payoff at the end, oh look Ellie can’t play guitar anymore as her revenge mission was bad and she’s lost a connection to Joel.

As soon as the fingers were bitten off you knew what was happening at the end.

The original had a quite a lot of these issues but the shorter play time masked them.

I don’t mind the game it’s worth playing and it’s a solid 7/10 but it really is a bit of a mess thematically and in its story not really working, we know all 3 sides are good/bad already and the story portrays this poorly by making people just change.

By far the best bits are the stealth but they really need to kill off infinite ammo on bad guys if they are trying to portray a more grounded experience and get rid of having to open every cupboard which lets be honest if there’s a human presence their would already of been looted properly."
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-29,I honestly feel bad for you guys who didn't enjoy the game man.
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Oh sure, I feel like media outlets and professional reviewer‘s recognize it as a great achievement. But as far as discourse between regular folks in places like reddit I don’t really see it discussed beyond the story."
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,What about it put you off?
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-20,"So not only did you ignore my plea to discuss the game on its merits outside of the story direction, but you somehow think that game mechanics like having the enemies run out of bullets or the player inheriting the enemies’ massive cachet of ammunition or that there should be no looting would somehow improve the game from a design standpoint? Do you hear how ridiculous that sounds?

And “spamming X”? Did you even play the game? Even if you cited the right button for melee, it’s not true or fair criticism. If you try to spam ⏹ on even the most basic zombie, you would just die. Unless you played on easy or something, and if so, why complain about it being boring?"
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,That’s because somehow the story is controversial. I don’t see it but a lot of people are triggered for some reason over it
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,[removed]
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-20,"I mean if you’re gonna respond at least actually respond to what I said rather than making stuff up.

Your responses are just typical to the usual fanboy, you didn’t play the game, you played on easy despite the game not having an “easy” mode it has adjustments to the amount of combat as many people do think the combat mechanics are borderline broke, I played on moderate as that’s what the games balanced around.

I didn’t say you spam melee, I said you used melee/stealth kills more as resources are poor so sneaking and killing people that way makes more sense.

I didn’t say there should be no looting nor did I say you should inherit enemies infinite ammo.

Imagine for a second a rework to the way enemies had/managed ammo, they should only be able to carry x amount same as anyone else but if they are in a base/outpost they can resupply from a finite amount that is stored their.  So you can bait shots until they have to go get more, if you’re quick enough and you can then loot the ammo before it runs out, it should also be where the meds are set so you aren’t just walking around spamming ‘triangle’ (feel better now) to loot the area.

It would make for a better experience and change how you infiltrated that section.

But no you don’t discuss anything just rant about stuff I never said."
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,"Yeah, that’s a bad reason to not play it. They don’t redeem anyone. They just make you understand that the Villian of your story is the hero of someone else’s. Abby had every right to kill Joel. He murdered everyone she loved including her father. Since you’re never gonna play it these spoilers mean nothing to you but you’re missing out by following the hive mind and not just experiencing something for yourself."
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-20,Hey man I can’t help it if your complaints were indecipherable nonsense.
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,[removed]
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-20,"Except they weren’t.

You’re just upset that someone doesnt like the game as much as you do."
rirgtk,2021-12-17,2021-12-18,Yeah it would suck to have to think or experiencing any emotions
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"The original didn't need a sequel, the ending was perfect for the story they told. This second one just feels unnecessarily tacked on."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"I don't care about the leaks, I want to play it for myself"
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"I'm buying it day one regardless of the leaks, I'm sick of all the complaining about SJW and all that other crap."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"I'll play it with an open mind, and try to give the game the benefit of the doubt. I just hope they dont try and shove some bullshit agenda down my throat. I play games to get away from the bullshit."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"People that didn't heard the spoilers, people that thought It was good, and people like me that know didn't like the story but know that the game can be good I mean you play a game sometimes for the gameplay and don't mind the story at all like AC Syndicate"
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-19,I haven't read the leaks so I still have complete faith in the game. I preordered the $170 Collectors Edition due to being such a huge fan of the first game. I'm so excited for release!
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,I do. There is no reason why not to. Game is 100 gb in size with a lot of content. And I loved the first game that’s that. I am playing for the story now. When it will come out on pc then I’ll replace the ugly females with sexy mods and then it will be perfect.
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"I feel maybe it's not living up to the frist one, or massive technical issues or maybe it was designed on ps4 just for new hardware to pop up and them wanting to be a next Gen launch title which would cement the game as a must have title to just play a new console."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"It's never going to be as good as the original. They're trying to make lightning strike twice and surf solely on the hype it generates. I'll probably play it, but I'll wait a year and read the reviews first."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,I don't expect the game to very enjoyable to play compared to what else is available so I don't have much faith in it at all really. I fully expect rave reviews and 10/10 scores a plenty though.
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,Yea. Plus I’m not transphobic
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"Honestly the game could be a masterpiece but I don’t want to fund the company who has been illegally striking content on the internet, risking some youtuber’s livelihoods all in the name of censoring their opinions about the game. However the game is most definitely not a masterpiece but another cliche jab at stereotypical ‘homophobic’ Christian faith, a glorified Brazzers Lesbian movie and takes away from the ending of the first game making a mockery of it and the characters we loved. God bless the man who leaked it, hope he got paid in the end."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"I didn't have a lot of faith in the first place. The first one was just mediocre, and i didn't expect any better from the sequel."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"Nevermind the sjw stuff, Naughty Dog is pulling an MGS2, and ppl are not gonna like it"
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,Me too. Gamers seem to complain more about “sjw’s” and “agendas” then there are actual sjw’s.
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,Recent games had SJW agendas (i.e. Battlefield 5). Don’t know about TLOU though.
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,Can you give anymore detail on the Brazzers Lesbian movie?
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-19,"Battlefield 5? Wtf are you talking about? See that's the thing, all these edgey millennials are just creating  make believe agendas just to be mad at something."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,No they didnt
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"Two lesbians make out on a couch.

God forbid two characters who are romantically involved do anything remotely intimate in a video game. It's not like The Witcher and it's LITERALLY MULTIPLE SEX SCENES."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"The leaks have reported multiple sex scenes that add little to the story, not only that but much of the story revolves around the fact Ellie is a lesbian (hence the homophobic Christian cult hunting her). So much for not sexualising female characters, I guess."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"Nah, they really do. Some more than others, but few games are free of the crap."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,Thats not what ppl are angry about
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"Nobody is out for Ellie, its the straight character that replaces Ellie everyone is up in steroid jacked arms for"
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"In the context of a complaint about it being a lesbian brazzers video, it is."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"True, missed that comment. But the anger is not directed at ellie, or her gf at all, its the new protagonist that you play most of the game as that is getting ppl angry."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"Depends on the circles you frequent, and when you check in. I've seen the focus shift from the death of a particular character, to the fundimentalist antagonists, to the supposed masculinity of female characters to 'appease the trannies'.

About the only valid criticism is Sony's handling of the leak, and attempts to bully reporters and youtubers into not talking about it."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"The character in question is very masculine, but not meant to be trans, she in fact, looks like shes on steroids, which is why alot of people are criticising it for not only being an unrealistic beauty standard(a fact the people who usually complain about unrealistic standards are wierdly silent about) but also highly unrealistic in the setting, as steroids would not be available, and keeping up the 3000+ calorie diet needed for a woman to have such a physique would also be quite hard. It just seems forced, but I don't think its going to ruin the game, but there are valid criticism for such a character you should be able to pose."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"We must have seen very different videos, because all insaw was a reasionably athletic young woman with minimal body fat and an unkempt appearance. Not some 3000+ calorie she-hulk."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"Then you probably didn't see enough, look at the gameplay, then compare her to top level female UFC fighters and Olympians, the person who this character is based on does crossfit and bodybuilding, both are rife with steroids, if you don't see it then you're just naive imo. Either way, the calorie intake alone would be staggering, difficult to pull off post Apocalypse. And even if thats not doing it for you, its still an unrealistic standard."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"> its still an unrealistic standard.

I mean, so was Joel's broad chest and strong physique, considering he was a middle age alcoholic who spent more time avoiding work than actually trying to survive. 

>Then you probably didn't see enough

Honestly, no. Not really. The Last Of Us wasn't that good a game in the first place, and my interest in the sequel was more out of trying to keep up on the latest overblown scandal in gaming."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"Joel didn't grow up during the apocalypse, much easier for men to retain such a physique than it is for women, Abby has arms that are the result of steroids and a massive diet, wether or not you believe its steroids is irrelevant as the diet thing kills it. Women can absolutely get ripped, but not jacked like abby is without help, her ingame model has the arms of a man.."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,">Joel didn't grow up during the apocalypse, much easier for men to retain such a physique than it is for women

Not with intake of high-calorie foodstuffs, particularly alcohol. They call it a beer gut for a reason. There's a difference between maintaining physique, and not gaining fat.

> but not jacked like abby is without help

She looks like any moderately butch highschooler who plays on literally any sports team. In a world where physical activity is the difference between life and death, she isn't remotely outrageous, physically. And that is definitely NOT a 3000 calorie a day body. Maybe, MAYBE 2500, but that's even pushing it, depending on the actual foods their eating. 

It's actually not difficult to meet your daily calorie requirement even in a relatively harsh subsistence environment. Really, the only thing that would keep people from being able to survive the apocalypse is outside threats, because growing food is surprisingly easy with a little knowhow. It's far, FAR more difficult to feed 300 million people in urban environments than to survive an apocalypse growing your own. 

Y'all are really just trying to find things to complain about."
gm3vym,2020-05-18,2020-05-18,"You clearly havent seen the leak, she looks like she's on steroids. Deny it all you want, I don't see any reason to deny the obvious, but you do you."
120lw3n,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,This is brilliant! I've been thinking of getting a tattoo that mixes the Ellie design with something else as well - probably from Deus Ex.

hoe37e,2020-07-09,2020-07-10,The fact that this game has a 42% completion rate is insane. Most games average around 20% completion. The first game is only at 40% and that's over the course of seven years.

hoe37e,2020-07-09,2020-07-09,I’m still upset there’s no difficulty trophy. I earned that platinum on the first one. Taking the difficulty trophies out feels like The gaming equivalent to a participation trophy.

hoe37e,2020-07-09,2020-07-10,"I wasn't trying to imply that it was surprising because the game isn't good. It's objectively uncommon for a game to have a completion rate that high, especially a 25+ hour game and only 3 weeks in."

hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,It’s your money.  Go for it.
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,Are you my doppelganger? Cuz i'm the same way. >_<
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,It's what I did for Mighty Number 9.
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,"Game is fine.
Haters gonna hate."
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,Yes. Get it. Fuck the hate. So far the story has gripped my like fat kid to his baby back rib. I can understand why people might dislike the story but the outright hate is unnecessary. Most of them haven’t even beaten the games cus it ain’t short and it just came out. The world and the acting is by far some of gaming finest and the atmosphere gets me SO engaged. It’s like really walking through a post apocalypse zombie filled world. Combat is mad fun and sneaking is challenging in its own right. I think the hate is undeserved. The critique maybe not so much but it’s FAR from a bad game my lord.
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,"The hate between NMS and Part II is drastically different. A lot of the hate directed towards NMS nowadays is just uninformed people thinking it's still the mess it was at launch.

Part II is such a mishandled and drop in quality story wise that I don't know how people who loved the first game could even put it close to its predecessor."
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,The game is fantastic. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,"No Man's Sky was absolute shit at launch, and is apparently a decent and complete game now. I'll never know, because I'll never play it after the shitty release the dev gave it.

Last of Us 2 is excellent so far, and people are either butt hurt because they're homophobes or because they don't like the way certain story aspects were handled. I disagree with them on both counts."
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,"Most hate/love this game gets is coming from some political shit people are feeling, from a neutral point of view since all the political shit doesn't matter to me i would give it around 6 out of 10.

- Graphics are amazing and that feels like an understatement

- there are some accessibility options that makes the game playable by people with disabilities, honestly i wasn't aware that such audiences are interested in gaming but anyway i just disable all of them because for a fully functional person playing with those is like using a cheat code, they are enabled by default.

- game mechanics almost same as the old one no upgrades or new stuff

- story line : this is the worst part, i don't want to spoil it for you but take the emotional roller-coaster that game of thrones made you feel and multiply it by a 100 ""remember how last season felt, remember how the red wedding felt"" , especially if you played the first part, if you haven't played the first part, well that also won't be a problem you can still play it but most of the story you wouldn't get. Edit: my feedback here might have been a little too vague, i didn't like the story it could have been better, the same context and conclusion could have been delivered in a better way. They really missed the mark in this department. 

All of that being said my recommendation is don't buy at full price."
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-28,I’d send you my copy of I didn’t buy it digitally.
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,Thanks for this blog post
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,You definitely should! The game is hilarious and goofy as fuck. Last time I laughed this hard was during Detroit: Become Human.
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,It’s more that it’s a sequel to a very popular game and the hype and pressure to live up to the original don’t seem there
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,"Did you play NMS at launch or much later?  It was trash on launch, with many features they specifically claimed to be in the game missing.  They had to put STICKERS over the multiplayer logo on the game boxes ffs."
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,At least it has good rope physics lol
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,"> No Man's Sky was absolute shit at launch.

If this is your opinion, I will not dispute it. I loved NMS at launch."
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-28,"Too late, already bought it.

Day 1 in Seattle as Abby. So far, I like it (mostly). Don't like Abby very much, though.

Usually, I prefer games that provide me with the freedom of choice. This one is... I really need to get used to that sort of game."
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,I loved Detroit. That game was so goddamn annoying that I fell in love with the gameplay the second I bought it.
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,"At launch. First hour player. And man, it was perfect.

I never listened to what they promised. I just saw the game in the store and I knew *This is it*"
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,">I loved NMS at launch.

I can't respect your opinion as a gamer then. That game was fucking horrible at launch."
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-28,I think you’ll have a few more things you might struggle with in the game. Like when it preaches at you about how shitty all the stuff it forced you to do is.
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-23,I'm glad you liked it.  But the majority didn't.
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,"Noted.

I do respect your opinion. Don't agree, though. Because for me, it was perfect. Have my upvote."
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-28,"Probably, yeah.

But honestly, I'm actively ignoring the social implications of the game. If I wanted to experience a life full of shit and controversial decisions, I'd just relive my life from 2004 to 2006.

I'm not questioning the game design but my preferences in video games."
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-23,"Yeah, I know. Maybe if I had followed the docu and promises they gave and never fulfilled, I'd have hated, too. Gladly, I didn't. Still playing it from time to time, visiting the systems named after me."
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,You should play a good game and see what that's like and how alien it is from NMS at launch.
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,What do you consider a good game in this extremely specific genre? Freelancer?
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,"I meant a good game in general. Preferably something that was released in a complete and playable state, not the $60 demo No Man's Sky was."
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,"I've played those, aswell. I'm a fucking old dude. Played my first game on the good old Commodore C20."
hcuolr,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,Then you have no excuse. We're done here.
w7dr0k,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,I've played it once and never again. It's just a really exhausting game
w7dr0k,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,Tried getting through it again on three separate occasions and get bored with it fairly quick. To be clear I don't hate the game I just don't see myself revisiting anytime soon
w7dr0k,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,"I loved everything about the first game. The second game is a technical masterpiece as you stated. The visuals, design and especially sound design are near perfect. The issues for me was the story. They made some very bold choices for characters in this one that just did not work
for me. I wanted a continuation of the story of Joel and Ellie and there are some parts of the game that again nail that feeling ie the opening and a couple of moments in the middle of the game, but it fell short IMO on delivering on what made the first game truly special. I get what they were going for as far as making you feel uncomfortable playing some of these sections. At a point it made me frustrated with choices the characters are making and their motives for doing so. The game has some great set pieces and gameplay mechanics, but at the end I felt the story made me feel like shit and that was maybe the point but it’s worth a play though to see for yourself but def play the first game if you have not."
w7dr0k,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,"Honestly I still don't like the game at all. Gameplay is decent, visuals are great but a purely realistic style is just boring to me, level design and exploration is bad, characters are bad, writing overall is bad, and the pacing is *ass*, which guts just about every other part of the game. The only purely good thing I can say about the game, aside from the visuals, is that the soundtrack is very good.

I'm glad I didn't have much connection to the first game cause all my disappointment here could've really been amplified otherwise."
w7dr0k,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,I don’t think it’s that peoples minds changed it’s just been out long enough now that the people that didn’t like it have moved on and it’s the people that did enjoy it still talking about it.
w7dr0k,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,"Good game, bad last of us"
w7dr0k,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,"My opinion has actually gotten worse the more time i spend with it. I played it around launch time and was mildly impressed, the gameplay was solid, the graphics were top notch, the story kinda sucked in that ""HBO too dramatic for it's own good"" style.  
I went back and played it again about a month ago and it's actually worse. now that the veneer has chipped away I'm starting to notice all the little bugs and reused assets. The story has gotten much worse too now that I know what happens in the late game. I've started seeing all of the plot holes, Contrivances, and just asinine decisions to force the drama.  


So I went from a solid 8 or 7 at launch down to a 4 or 5."
w7dr0k,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,I didn't play it but I saw an entire letsplay- I thought the game looked really good and the gameplay loop also looked neat. I thought its thesis was fucking dogshit stupid though.
w7dr0k,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,"IMO, the way they handled Joel was the equivalent of Halo 2 coming out and axing Chief, or Splinter Cell killing off Sam in Pandora Tomorrow. Coyly you imagine if Forbidden West came out and kill Areola in the the beginning?"
w7dr0k,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,"my issue wasn't that Joel got killed, everyone following the game kinda expected that to happen. My issue was that the setup was really contrived, and the fallout of him being executed was just bad writing. His death set up the whole chain of plot points to the revenge scene at the end, which, while cliche was somewhat engaging. But the ending kind of invalidates the whole point of killing him in the first place.  
you dont have a character like Ellie get progressively more angry at the loss of Joel throughout the game, only to do a 180 at the end because of a single flashback, No real person would ever do that. And for a game built around people reacting organically, it completely falls on it's face."
w7dr0k,2022-07-25,2022-07-25,"Yeah. The opening hit you in the feels and then it goes off the rails quickly. That’s one thing in any medium that bugs me. You have an established character. They act in a certain way because of their experiences. Then you make that character do a 180 without explaining why or having the foresight to write a compelling reason for them act in this different way. I think of Luke in the sequel trilogy or Joel in this game. He is a hardened survivor, some can make the point he is not a good person for his actions. He would be wary of any strangers or new people entering the town and in pet 2 he is like hi, welcome. Want to come to come to our town and live with us. Then go about doing what they do and then making you play as that person and saying you have to like them now. You can make characters change and act differently but there needs to be a reason why that is compelling."
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"I think goty is really personal, for example I didn't like at all tlou but enjoyed the hell out of Doom eternal"
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"I haven't had a chance to play TLoU2 myself and everyone I've seen hating on it always has super vague reasons for the hate. 

So honestly, what was so bad about The Last of Us 2 anyways?"
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Who cares? Does it affect your enjoyment of your favorite games?
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"Game of the year award should be given to only those games which are released on all three platforms: Windows, PS and Xbox. This would end exclusive deals. 

What do you guys think about that?"
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,No.
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,LOL yall need to grow up
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"Fairly? Hell no.
I aint saying its a bad game, but there were alot of discrepancies.
Too many awards for it; barely any for GoT."
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"no, the story was cliched and spat on everything the first game built"
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Doom should have won. Just for that soundtrack
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Who cares?
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,I don't care. It's only in the emotionally stunted bizzaro world of Reddit that anyone seems to care about game of the year.
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Where is the i don't care option ?
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,"Yes. Fight me. 

Ghost of Tsushima will always be my personal goty2020 though, shame it got robbed but TLOU2 was much deserving. 

PlayStation stays winning though 😎"
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Lol Y’all are really salty about this huh?
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Yes because it's the best game released this year.
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,i haven't played it either. what i heard about was how they butchered the story that was carried from the first game
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Well if PS didnt have exclusives most people would go to xbox for the game pass
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,i 100% agree.
kb04l7,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,Yes me no care becus i smort

8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,that girl is definitely dead or clickerfied
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,everyone talking about this girl being dead and im just missin joel :( 
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I happened to have paused it for a moment then noticed a similarity.  Went back to double check and there it was.

Could this be why Ellie is very angry in this game?"
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,thats not an easter egg.
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,A Turkish all seeing eye!
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"D e d,  TLoU world is brutal and unforgiving. Cant wait to jump back into it. "
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Good eye
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yissss
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Easter egg or foreshadowing...
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Top: Picture with circle over bracelet. 
  
Bottom: black rectangle with circle in bottom right"
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So... the made Ellie a buff lesbian?
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"My thoughts exactly.  Leaning more towards the ""dead"" side.  This game looks like it's going to be about way more than just the infected.  The first game was too, but this will eclipse the first game in that respect.  This is about regular people.  The infected are just an added part that we'll deal with on the side."
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yea, she ded."
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Or the combat scene is a flashback and Ellie gave her girlfriend a bracelet.
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,**CLICKERFIED**
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Weren't clickers zombies that had been zombies for too long? Unless those scenes are years apart I'd go for just dead (or zombie)
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I read a comment where the user suggested that in the reveal teaser, Joel is actualy a ghost talking to Elie. (That was a gut punch) "
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Maybe not, but I think you get what I mean.  It's hidden in plain sight."
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It's a low light shot.  What can I say?

EDIT: Forgot a word."
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What?  
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-23,She been gay since the first game bruh. 
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Here’s my theory involving all the trailers. Ellie Amon was originally in that weird cult. They had something to do with making/breeding humans that were immune for some reason. And I’m sure it’s super fucked up. It has something to do with the dragon flies. I’m sure because the dragon flies, man. 

Ellie up and disappeared (rescued by Joel) the coaches are, someone KNOWS she exists. It has to do with that cult. 

Joel may die. That child definitely does because this is last of us. Ellie is about to uncover some major shit. "
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,U goddam rite
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The trailer told us he was alive. The guy who approached Ellie said ""Your father chewed me out"" or something like that. If I had to guess, Ellie and Joel and trying to live peacefully with others, and then they get attacked by a group of bandits called ""Insert name here"", these bandits kill everyone she has come to care about, and sends Ellie on a rage filled, revenge adventure to hunt them down. Just a guess."
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I think he means it has story significance, an eager egg is usually unrelated to the actual game. "
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Fireflies you mean.  And that's a possibility.  Seems a little far fetched to me, but hey, that's why we'll play it."
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"He's certainly alive before the attack, but that teaser was after. We don't know if Joel made it or not."
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Lol you are assuming that teaser is before any of this. 
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Right.  I couldn't think of a way to put it in a short and to the point title so that's what I went with.
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-13,"Lmao yes! That what happens when I haven’t slept in 24 hours. 

Lmao but can you imagine a rival group calling themselves the dragon flies? lol"
8qgoio,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm guessing that they're holding off on a big reveal of Joel because the game seems to focus of Ellie so much, and it'll have a bigger effect when they do finally reveal Joel."

gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,Yikes seems someone cant handle me criticising a poor story
gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,But you’re wrong. You haven’t even played it to even have an opinion on it so you’re not worth anymore of my time. Again bye 👋
gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,Then please do tell me how I'm wrong and you dont have to reply to me and then say bye because you're kind of contradicting yourself
gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,"You haven't even played it either, so by logic you're wrong as well"
gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,"Don’t tell me what to do pal! You’re not my daddy. Also you are wrong, and bye again 👋"

gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,Well the fact you're defending that pile of shit means you think it's good.
gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,Lol what question... 👋
gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,Might wanna prepare some hate buddy from peeps

gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,You tell me how you’re correct lol.
gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,The only thing I dislike about the game is the story but graphically it does look pretty impressive for a console game.
gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,"I was the one asking the question not you so please do tell me how TLOU2 story is ""amazing"""
gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,"Eh it looks like most triple A games in 2020, nothing special imo. But yeah the story is beyond awful"
gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,I didn’t say it’s amazing. You stated it’s garbage so you have some answering to do... not me lol. So I ask you. How is it “garbage”?
gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,">But you’re wrong. 

You're the one that got yourself into this boat buddy by saying I'm wrong so tell me how I'm ""wrong"" and how your opinion is better than mine somehow."
gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,">>But you’re wrong. 
>
>You're the one that got yourself into this boat buddy by saying I'm wrong so tell me how I'm ""wrong"" and how your opinion is better than mine somehow.

Your wrong because no matter how sadly you try your never gonna redefine opinion to mean fact 

All the guy said is that your wrong about your opinion on a story being fact, which hes right about

Get a grip and get over the fact people like something you dont"
gfwy2r,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,I do have a grip but I'm asking how I'm wrong since he did say that my opinion didnt matter.

tpvikf,2022-03-27,2022-03-27,TLOU2 is amazing. One of the only games of this gen with quality similar to that of RDR2
tpvikf,2022-03-27,2022-03-27,"I don't know if it was that divisive, just that the unhappy people were really, really, loud about it"

tpvikf,2022-03-27,2022-03-27,"For me the divisive FF was FFXV.

I was sooo hyped with the debut video, but when the game was released it was nothing similar anymore.

Instantly lost all urge to play."
tpvikf,2022-03-27,2022-03-27,Shouldn't have posted this when American's are online. They'll rabidly defend the garbage writing for some weird reason.
tpvikf,2022-03-27,2022-03-27,"The pacing (both combat and story) was off in TLOU2. I enjoyed the game, but not quite as much as the first. It took me months to figure out why. My conclusion was the pacing, which is a difficult thing to nail and is subjective."
tpvikf,2022-03-27,2022-03-27,Everything is better than the first. The only divisive thing is the story.
tpvikf,2022-03-27,2022-03-28,Final fantasy 13 was good too.
tpvikf,2022-03-27,2022-03-27,The entire subreddit got locked and it wasn't because of tourists hating it. It bombed with a huge amount of hardcore fans.
tpvikf,2022-03-27,2022-03-28,"""Garbage writing"" for which game?"
tpvikf,2022-03-27,2022-03-28,Which was better than the first.

k0hmkq,2020-11-25,2020-11-25,"*SPOILERS for this p.o.s. game* 
For me, had nothing to do with the transgender characters or anything like that. I thought the game sucked because it embraces a tradeoff of story for violence, and they love that cliche ""nothing ever gets solved and everything is sad"" mentality. They set it up to be this BIG vengeance tale where the person EVERYONE hates is the only one who gets her vengeance. Not to mention Abby is a fuckin homewrecker, if she would have left the dude and his pregnant gf alone they *might* have been less distracted and been able to sail away without getting murdered, but nooo. The whole story is a big drama emo tale with excessive violence thrown in to make up for the fact they KNEW the story sucked whale dicks. 
  Like walking dead or Game of thrones it lost its way and the ending shit the bed hardcore. 

*rant over, sorry*"

k0hmkq,2020-11-25,2020-11-25,I went in blind and it took me completely by surprise and I was all in for revenge. It was brutal and I was happy to inflict that pain right back. So as a story dynamic I thought it was excellent.
o4ar4y,2021-06-20,2021-06-20,Game may be divisive but there’s no denying how awesome the museum section was. :’)
o4ar4y,2021-06-20,2021-06-20,TLOU2 is a good game.

My best friend from 6th grade (I'm a grad student now!) Has been creating some amazing art and I really wanted to share this Anniversary Collection for TLOU2 since he doesn't have a Reddit account."

qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-20,"Obviously, in a story-driven game it’ll be hard not to spoil

It’s not about that scene, it’s what leads into it, Joel acts out of character a lot which is bad for story purposes in a story driven game

If it happened in a more “incidental” way it would have made more sense but that isn’t Joel

Also maybe she is justified but by the time that justification comes we are too angry at her, if it happened after we get to like her (have us play as her for an hour, get us to start loving her father etc. before the news came than we get into the place and see the mess and realize what happened) maybe the feeling would be different but since it isn’t the case…

Also the ending makes no sense because Ellie thinks about Joel and acts completely different, storywise it makes no sense and since we mostly want to end the goal seeing the protagonist give up made no sense"
qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-20,"Honestly, I think TLOU2 suffered from a poor plot structure first and foremost. ""That scene"" was fine, but the reveal happened way too early in the game. Players should have spent hours playing as the ""Antagonist"", getting invested in her story and her friends, getting to know the WLF, stuff like that. Her entire flashback and setup arc needed to happen before ""that scene"", not after. Then, the cat-and-mouse story that kicks off between the ""Protagonist"" and the ""Antagonist"" would have been far more compelling and players would have been far more likely to actually care about the ""Antagonist's"" side of the story instead of getting angry that they were forced to play as a character they have hated since the beginning of the game."

qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-20,"I agree with you, I actually never felt like that towards any villain. That desire of killing, that bloodlust that the game made me feel. I am not kidding I actually stopped playing the game and wasn’t able to play it again my psychologist told me that those triggers produce stress and anxiety and is affecting me so sadly I had to stop. But honestly games now a days don’t make you feel you you want to kill the villain"
qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-20,"I thought the game did a great job of reinforcing its overall themes: the ugliness of violence, and the futility and destructiveness of revenge. There's lots of complex emotions being played with, and I don't think a lot of gamers really want that. Most want fairly black and white characters. There isn't really a hero to root for in the game, just a bunch of horribly broken people making mistakes. 

The loss of a beloved character was done in the way it was to, I believe, highlight the point that revenge is destructive, and violence often ugly and unexpected. It's gutting because it's supposed to be. I don't think a lot of people were able to handle that kind of tone.

The game has issues, but I think it handles its major themes expertly."
qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-21,I have basically no issues with any of the story other than the pathetic execution.
qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-20,"We get it, you have shit taste in games."
qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-20,"For me, I still ended up understanding and also kind of Like her.. AFTER what happened, obviously way later in the game but still. 

I do agree about Joel acting a little out of character but it didn't bother me that much, it all felt pretty realistic to how we'd act."
qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-20,"Fair! That's a valid opinion as to why you don't like it.
I'm just glad you didn't just say NOPE after.. That scene."
qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-20,"I've never seen it better put before! Could not agree more. That's exactly it. If I had any awards to give you, I would sir!"
qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-20,"I guess each of us cares more or less on different aspects of the story and characters (one thing I forgot to mention was Abby ridiculous figure in a post-apocalyptic scenario and especially working in a group) 

If you liked the game, good for you, I personally really dislike it and both of us have good motivations"
qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-20,"Definitely! This, I can just happily say we both had valid views etc. But those who just turned it off after.. yknow, should just keep going!"
qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-20,It’s their choice not to play
qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-20,Sure but I'm saying they should keep playing it! It ain't over til Ellie sings..or doesn't.
qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-20,Why play a game you don’t enjoy?
qy1ign,2021-11-20,2021-11-21,"Because when replaying or rewatching the story with some games, changes how you feel about it. For instance, I really didn't like Horizon when it first came out, put it down for like a year then replayed thinking wtf was I talking about lol as I loved it."
