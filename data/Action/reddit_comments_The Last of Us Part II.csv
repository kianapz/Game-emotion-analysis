Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,here's the trailer.httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vljxielomnzm edit and here's the official version without the audience reaction.httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vw2wnvvj33wo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i guarantee we're going to see loads of people getting ellie's tattoo.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"don't know if anyone noticed, but the window from the menu background of the first game seems to be the window from the room where ellie is in the trailer. or they look really similar."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,so it looks like the story will be something like this fireflies find ellie and joel fireflies kill a lot of tommy's village people feels ellie and joel will hunt the fireflies during the hunt ellie will learn the truth more feels that i cant handle bittersweet ending like the first

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"the last of us is the best gaming experience i've ever had, from the gutwrenching opening through the gutwrenching ending and all the gutwrenching in between especially those rats in the hotel basement. for me it elevated video games onto an equal footing with all other forms of storytelling art if roger ebert had seen tlou he would have been convinced. when they announced the film adaptation i was crushed there is literally nothing about a film that could improve upon the experience of the game. it's the first game to make me feel that way. and it's the first game to make me feel the way i feel right now upon seeing this on the front page. some are saying the first game was a complete story and doesn't need a sequel. they're not wrong. i don't care. i needed this badly and with the same team behind it i know they can do no wrong. let's do this."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"reasons joel may be dead and he's just a hallucination 1. he asks ellie if she's really going to go through with this, which seems to suggest that she's alone in whatever she's facing could be that they had some sort of falling out or poorly chosen words if he intends to help her 2. he doesn't appear to have any blood on him whatsoever, even though ellie has several cuts and blood flowing could be that he just found her and she did all the fighting before he arrived 3. a possible motivation for ellie's anger is that joel was killed by whomever she's going after though there may be another explanation 4. his hair and beard were graying in the first game when ellie was much younger and it appears that it looks the same even though she is clearly older now 5. he appears to emerge from the sunlight as if a ghost as he enters the house reasons joel may not be dead 1. the grass, mud and water appear to move as he walks through the scene please let me know if there's anything i missed. i tried listening to the song but didn't come away with anything other than she appears to be incredibly angry and vengeful against her enemies, perhaps not even caring if she dies."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"in the first game you could find a piece of paper that explained that 40 of the world's population was dead or infected. that still leaves a majority of the human population to rebuild. they would just need to stay in walled cities. i wasn't really conflicted at the end of the first game because of that. humanity isn't doomed, things just got set back for a while."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i'm as hyped as the rest of the people in this thread, but i worry about the fireflies seemingly being so prominent. their organization seemed to be in ruins after the first game. that angle seemed to have been explored and resolved. unless they have a really good reason to include the fireflies again i worry that we'll get a rehash which fails to explore new issues. i'm sure they can pull it off if they really want to, i just want a good reason for the faction to be back at the center of things."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"i'm a pc guy. might have to grab a ps4 for this to see what the fuss is about, cause i wanna bite."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"personally, i want it to be where the fireflies are trying to find and take ellie in because they've run out of candidates killed off all the immune they could get their hands on, or couldn't find another and having been trying to track her down since while trying to find a vaccine for the older generation, and ellie is wanting to kill them because they're coming after her. as you play through the game, joel is getting old, wistful, and even more tired of the world, and seeing his fauxdaughter becoming so angry is making him question whether or not there is any humanity left in the world i'm going off the theory that joel saved ellie not only because she had kind of replaced his daughter, but because she was his idealized humanity  someone who cares enough for others to willingly die just at the chance it might save people, and it starts to slip just all he did to save her, and she begins to realize that she could of been the cure, and that this whole time joel has been lying to her. at the climax, she leaves him. literally just turns her back on him and walks out after learning the full truth and probably somewhere along the line they'll divulge she does have antibodies that are replicable or something, so she'll see it as joel's fault the world is still the way it is, so that her reaction and decision makes sense. it won't be where she leaves him to die, but she'll do something to save his old ass, and then just leave him, probably with a we're equal now quip, and it'll destroy him completely. his first daughter was taken from him, and so he tried his hardest to keep people from taking his second daughter, but doing so led her to leave him. it would also tie into how joel asks ellie if she really wants to go through with killing the fireflies, as he knows that the greatest chance of her finding out the truth will present itself as they interact on any level with the fireflies. it would be brutal throughout with a good fucktonnage of feels, but that's what i hope happens"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"i just want to share this with some of the people on the 'imaginary joel' bandwagon the same actor who played joel played the hero of bioshock infinite and in the second dlc plays the hero again but you play a girl and the voice actor who plays joelbooker plays the main hero... but he's dead and in your head. i seriously don't think naughty dog is going to make last of us 2's 'b. plot' for lack of a better term use the exact same device from a game that had the exact same voice actor. also, you do not see his face, puberty you grow a lot more than a 4050 something regresses, if you make it to 50 with hair and mass you aren't bald and skinny by 55 unless you get cancer, they do not show his face and light works on hair somewhat so you don't know his hair color wait for a poster for christ sake, and she killed the people in the house or got into a fight, joel walked inside from the outside and had a gun so he probably didn't have to scrap she obviously did, they could've been in different places, so cut that mr. robot trope shit out right now with your assuming asses get a job edit the game director said the last of us is a story about these two, they will both be big players, in an interview about it 11 hours ago. i think he's being quite literal."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"really? the first game wrapped the story up pretty well. joel made a stupidass decision that damned humanity, lied to the girl that could have saved the world, then cut to black."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,joel being dead seems a little clich. i hope the story isn't that predictable.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,only reason for me to own a ps4
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,did this guy just get multiple gold for posting news???
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,too bad it got overshadowed by knack 2 babyyyyyy
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,is it still ps4 exclusive?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"this had 11k upvotes a couple hours ago, xbone fans are not happy, i guess"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"as a pc player... feelsbadman, oh well... there's tons of other games."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,ffs reading the comments here it's no wonder the gaming industry has been fucking us over for so long now. for some of you it's like a competition as to who can be the most cringe worthy fanboy.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,im crying. this is the happiest minute of my day.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"fuck yes. anyone have any idea if it's gonna be a continuation of the same story or a completely separate concept? obviously the announcement was just made, but some people may have heard rumors or seen something, thanks. i'm pumped!"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"negative karma inbound... am i the only one really pissed off by this? the story had been told. i would have much preferred a sequel, exploring tess  joel's relationship or what happened between tommy and the fireflies. instead we get a stupidly hyped up trailer with the setup simply being gotta kill em all. are you serious? that's the best they could come up with?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,we're done with joel and ellie's story lol jk we dont have a creative bone in our body!

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"for a minute, i thought the crowd cheers were part of the trailer, remembering how in her past life she used to sing for large numbers of people and it was as if she was on the stage in a concert."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i am so excited. the last of us is my all time favourite games. i am crying tears of happiness! 'd
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i've been waiting for this moment for the last 3 years. to the point where i almost fucking cried when i saw the fireflies logo. the last of us hit me so hard that every other game seemed bland in comparison.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"alright, time to get a ps4"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,time to get a ps4!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,the last of us was a gaming experience unlike anything ever published. i cried at the beginning of the first game. so many touching moments. this game could surpass dare i say the original. i'm all in.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i don't cry much, but i legit shed a few tears seeing a sequel announced to my favorite media franchise of all time. naughty dog is going to do this right and i cannot fucking wait to play this."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,time to replay the first one
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i sorta got a kill bill vibe at the end there, without all the campiness of course. that and the whole 'part 2' thing. maybe fireflies killed her husband and stole her baby to get the cure that joel denied them?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"naughty dog. the reason i own a ps3, and the reason i will soon own a ps4."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i told myself that it's best to leave tlou alone as it's a masterpiece. that being said i can't be more excited right now!!!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"after playing through the first game at my friends house i was blown away by the story, might just have to buy a ps4 now"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i screamed when i saw the fireflies logo.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i am so ready for these feels
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i thought i heard mention that the sequel wouldn't feature joel and ellie and that it'd be a selfcontained story in the same universe. as much as i love the first one, it felt complete. i don't really want more joel and ellie."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"brilliant. now the mind numbing wait commences. spring 2017 please naughty dog? and definitely getting a firefly revenge vibe from this trailer, the sign at the beginning wasn't for nothing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"they're really channeling cat powerhttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vkqutuxqts6m with that scene. not a fan of zombie stories, but good for people who like this game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i have yet to play the first one. but since i recently got a ps4, that can be solved."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i can't wait for this, i have the utmost trust in nd to do this sequel justice and i'm so glad that joel and ellie are coming back. i was so scared they were gonna make the sequel a spinoff about marlene. tlou is easily one of my favorite games of all time and i've been waiting for this news for years. thank you naughty dog! now to wait for release date announcements!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,naughty dog making the internet explode today.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,why the fuck did you just post the title card instead of the trailer or the tweet from nd or literally anything that couldn't potentially be fake
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i won't lie, i was so mad at the end of the last of us. selfish."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i guess that was the only way to title this game......still sad is isn't last of us 2electric boogaloo

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,not sure if this game needs a sequel. would rather nd did something fresh. will still play the everloving fuck out of it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,time to dust off the ps4
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"finally, about time, hopefully this game won't have any issues on launch, and also be a full game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i really really need to get around to playing the first one.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,pure speculation someone killed her kid. fireflies maybe because her kid had the cure as well or someonesomething else. but it has to do with her kid.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"holy fucking shit, this was so unexpected. soooo excited now and it looks like i'm going to start a new playthrough of tlou today."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"welp, i guess it's time to buy a ps4."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,so it wasn't the last of them then...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"if i buy a ps4, does it have backwards compatibility so i could play the first one?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"god i loved this first game so much, incredibly happy that they just announced the sequel. take my money pls."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,hearing the audience reaction got me so much more hyped
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i wish they came out for pc. i don't have any game console and would love to play the first one.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,really would like to see a last of us movie as long as hollywood stayed true to form. quite possibly the best story of any video game ever.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"development of the last of us began in 2009, soon after the release of naughty dog's previous game, uncharted 2 among thieves. tlou 1 came out june 2013. so... uncharted 3 came out this past may... safe to say we could be waiting until ?? 2022? lol hopefully nowhere as long as tlou 1 though..."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"can we take a moment to talk about how drop dead gorgeous that trailer was? like seriously if that's ingame then the new bar has been set for visuals... and i'm a pc player. i suppose 60 fps will be too much to hope for on a ps4, but it's stunning none the less."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i just bought an xbox one. i dun fucked up.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,well fuck. this is the only exclusive that can get me to buy a playstation 4. rip 400 bucks.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i trust naughty dog to make a great game, because that's kind of their thing, but i can't help but be a bit disappointed that they're following the same characters after that perfect ending. spoilers a man loses his daughter, his heart turns to stone as he struggles to survive in the apocalypse, learns to love a surrogate daughter again after resisting it so long, and then, upon facing the decision between loosing another daughter or watching the world's last hope disappear, chooses her, and speaks the lie that may end the world. cut to black. spoilers what a perfect stopping point. i hope last of us 2 doesn't end up in the same spot as telltale's walking dead season 2, with that beautiful ambiguity smashed to pieces."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i'm so fucking excited. i had tears in my eyes.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"is it my imagination, or is the window and curtain in the room where ellie is playing the same one as the one in the main menu of the first game?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i have very mixed feelings about this. i absolutely loved the last of us, but i thought it ended perfectly. it was a complete story that didn't need a sequel."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,this and red dead redemption? oh my...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"shut up and take my jar of nails, stick and duck tape i just found!!!!!"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,anyone else stoked for factions? tlou was amazing and what's was even more amazing was that they included an incredibly fun death match to go along with an incredible story.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"last of us is a really good movie, it's objectively pretty awful as a piece of interactive entertainment they should just make movies instead"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"assuming we get to play both characters, it would make sense if ellie is both faster and has a better aim than joel. she was always better with the bow. joel should still be more of a slugger."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"so i've never played the first game, but i've played loads and loads of classic titles. the last of us is definitely one missing from my collection, so will definitely need to pick it up and play"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i'm assuming that the man walking in isn't joel and is in fact joel's brother. he doesn't sound anything like joel nor look like him. judging from ellie's anger, joel was probably killed"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,fuck it is just a trailer for a game.....but man i am so tense right now and i don't even really know why.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"and another uncharted! sony is really playing their cards well. any gamer would have a hard time buying an xbox over a ps4, especially with all the exclusives coming around. different markets i guess. xbox is media first games second, ps4 is gaming first media second."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i am gushing buckets, holy fuck i can't wait, give me the walt disney treatment until it's out."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"the last of us was just a master at creating incredible characters with so many layers to which we could all relate. joel wasn't a 100 pure, white knight protagonist he had flaws and made mistakes, despite his good heart. that's what made this game feel so real. i have never had such complex feelings after finishing a video game until i played the last of us. i remember right when joel lied to ellie and the game cut to black. my heart sank and i felt cheated and closure at the same time. god damn, i love that game. naughtydog, we place our faith in you. don't screw this up."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,as a pc player naughty dog is more of a youtube production company to me.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,my only question is will we get an ellie and joel duet?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"any news on the release date? also, i wasn't as taken back by ellie returning seeing as she's the one who's immune to the virus. that's quite the factor to leave out of part 2."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i really just hope we get to see bill kick ass again.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,to be honest and i know i'll get downvotes for this i'm a bit disappointed. the last of us had such a good ending and was such a good one off game that i was hoping they would have just let it be. my guess is that sony made them do it for salea. i was hoping for a new ip. i'll still buy and play it nonetheless.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i sorta end up wondering the same thing as with walking dead... how many zombies could there realistically still be at this point ? walking dead has shown that zombies decay just like any regular corpse and obviously the amount of new zombies being spawned would be going down as less and less survivors are present and season iii of the telltale game will already be 5 years into the apocalypse. and if i remember correctly, last of us has the zombies turn into those really big guys that throw shit if they survive long enough. so at some point almost every single zombie would be bosslevels of though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i can't wait to see the new weapons they will implement into the game. thank you naughty dog!!!!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,hopefully they port 1 to pc...i can only dream....
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,oh my fucking god the hype train has left the station and went straight into orbit in the andromeda galaxy. it's gone.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,pinch me i must be dreaming! somebody pinch me!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,so what was that stuff about not preordering games?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,shame they didn't announce this at e3. would have been the ultimate press conference.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i am beyond thrilled for this! itrust naughty dog to make a great sequel, they know how well received the first game was. can't wait!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,theory joel coming from the light may imply he's dead and he's just imaging joel. perhaps joel got killed by fireflies and ellie is out for revenge
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"can't wait! a little annoyed to see sony show another game that is years away. the first party is gone, up to this point, this gen."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i feel like a kid on christmas. i haven't been this genuinely happy to see a trailer in, well, ever."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"op, you should've just said sony game maybe include part ii announced! and let people guess which one is it while watching the trailer"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"on one hand im shitting myself with joy over this, but on the other i'm kinda sad that it's gonna have ellie and joel as the protagonists again. i felt like their story wrapped up nicely in the first game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i just hope they give the giraffes much bigger roles than the ones they had in the first game. let's see them fighting alongside joel and ellie. i want to see joel breaking necks and giraffes swinging em!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,it would be amazing if they released it for the ps3 as well as the ps4.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,must not preord.....ahhhhhtake mah money!!!!!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i think i'm going to die! i am getting this day 1! i feel bad for any game going up against this for game of the year when it comes out.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,ellie is going to kill all the fireflies. joel will die in the process. i fucking love it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,the hype is real!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"no! this is exactly what i didn't want from a last of us sequel! their story was done in mind, i really wanted their future left to my imagination. i was really hoping they'd just move on to a different cast in another area. someone must feel the same way i do... but at least they didn't call it the last of us 2"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,httpimgur.comwaprjx9 omg living this is live unreal....
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i have a feeling it'll be a trilogy. considering it's with roman numerals. if a title has that, there'll usually be 3."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i am gonna buy a ps4 for this game only part 1 was great i hope part 2 is going to be as good as part 1
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i need a moment. i also need a new pair of pants.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i just finished playing the original remastered and i loved it so seeing this is like a freaking christmas gift. ellie grew up and looks so boss
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i was an idiot an spoiled last of us by watching that pewdiepie video of him finishing the game. now i feel nothing.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i feel like the only person on reddit that's not nearly as excited as everyone else. the first one was ...alright.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i'm just hoping this lives up to the legacy of the first one, or at least doesn't tarnish it. although, i trust naughty dog."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i am so pumped now. the last of us is such an amazing game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,the last of us ii announced? halflife 3 confirmed!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i'm so excited i might throw up.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i have a theory for this. it was a village of fireflies, perhaps the last of them... or a group that ellie or she and joel were part of, and they got attacked. you can see there are no dead zombies anywhere, so i'd assume she is refering to killing people and not clickers."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"my chest is hurting, cant tell if heart attack or inner fangirl clawing to get out, cant contain excitement."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i'm disappointed that this story is going to revolve around joel and ellie again. i feel that this world has a rich enough environment that it could have, and should have, been about another persongroup. i always believed that joel and ellie's storyline ended perfectly even if it may not have been what we were expecting or, perhaps, wanting."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,for some reasoned i was hoping the blood was from a tear and at the end it reveals her to be infected when she looks up.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,whooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttt yes
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,shouldn't it be called the last of them? seems like a missed opportunity.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i still need to beat the first one.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,loved the first one. the best emotional game out there imo.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i can't be the only person who thought that the original ended perfectly. i feel adding anything to it kind of ruins that exceptionally cold ending that they finished with. but who knows, if the story is just as good this time around then fuck it. i'm excited regardless, just remember people. no preorders."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,got a real rick grimes feel goin there

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i think joel is already dead. the way he just materialized from the mist when the battle was already over and the way ellie is talking seems that she is on a mission to avenge him. just my take and i kind of hope i'm wrong.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"going back too kill all the butterflies only to have the awkward moment. ok ok, so what if..... ummm maybe just maybe there possibly could of maybe just maybe been a slight, and i emphasize slight chance there was possibly a cure"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,yea i understand the last of us is one of the best game ever created but no ones talks about knack 2!?!?!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"ellie's the cop that plays by her own rules and is determined to get revenge of the this who murdered her partner. joel's the grizzled chief who still got it, but knows ellie's surpassed him in terms of skill and knows he can't and shouldn't stop her. he'll watch her back while she goes for broke. oh, hell yes! let's do this! great choice for the second chapter."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,saw this on twitter rn

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"will buy this game, buy all the dlc, preorder it, preorder it again because i love this franchise."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"whoa. dude, what if joel is dead and ellie is saying that to avenge him. watch the trailer again. joel comes from the light after ellie left a path of destruction. he would never let her go in alone. also, they don't show his face. his hair doesn't look as aged. what if he becomes her sara in the sense that he dies early on and it leaves a huge impact on her. the blood running down her face can symbolize a tear, as well."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,depression cured!

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,still need to play part 1! been too busy moving and working lately
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i still haven't played the first one.  i wish it were on another platform. what's the cheapest way to play it guys?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i really want to play it and the first one but i'm not buying a console for it. i really hope it comes to pc.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"gonna be honest, i didn't think this was necessary. didn't even think the dlc was necessary. but it's like drinking beer with friends, if they're all going to you might as well join them and enjoy the time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"the only reason i bought a ps4 is to play last of us, i sold it last week and now this gets announced. i'm guessing naughty dog is still playstation only."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"can confirm,it was the shit if you were there with the crowd when it was announced."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,cool. i look forward to watching the game on a youtube edit after someone puts them self through playing it. the first one was amazing like that.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"only reason i bought a ps3, my 4 has just been sat waiting for this!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,holy shit lou is litterally the only console game i've played in the last 5 years and it was by far the best experience i've had since. loved it! i'm beyond hyped for this
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i think this justifies a ps4 purchase next year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i have been very adamant about this not happening. the first game is sheer perfection in terms of storytelling, and i honestly didn't want that tarnished through sequels that couldn't live up to it. but, after seeing this, fuck it  give me more last of us."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"man i really need to buy or borrow a ps to play last of us one of these days, haven't ever played it but it really is that great, yes?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,best news of my life!!

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i bought my first ps3 when the last of us came out. now i'll buy a ps4 for the sequel and also bloodborne, finally."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i never played the game but i watched a play through because it looked good and i'm actually excited to do the same thing again. am i weird? probably.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i see a lot of speculating about joel's death, which is possible. but what if ellie has a boyfriendlady friend that she loses to the fireflies? ellie is too hot to be single even in that world."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"holy fuck yes, this is by far my most anticipated game right now. the first one was easily one of the best games of all time, and i just finished uncharted 4 which was right up there in terms of the story, graphicspresentation, music and everything. stayed up til 5.30am beating it on crushing because i just couldn't stop"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,can someone give me a run down on this game? i've heard nothing but good about it. i haven't seen any gameplay or played it at all tho but i might with this one coming out.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i wonder if people will be levelheaded about this game, judge it fairly for it's strengths and flaws, or overhype it to hell and present it as the best game of all time like the first one."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"this is awesome and i'm excited, but i'm also reminded of the hype train preceding no man's sky, mafia iii, final fantasy xiv, sonic the hedgehog 2006, star wars battlefront, duke nukem forever, aliens colonial marines, the order 1886, tony hawk pro skater 5, assassin's creed unity, etc. that said  i can't wait, but i also won't preorder."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,loved the storytelling and cut scenes in the last one so much. the gameplay and pallet pushing was rubbish though. i sure hope they can fix those issues in the next one.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,now people can shut up about whether it would be about ellie and joel or not.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i've only played the first hour of the first game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,for the first time since i was a teenager i am truly excited for a game.... will be getting this on launch day and will be booking a day of work.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,the last of us had one of the most emotional first parts in a game that i've ever played. the entire story of the game was absolutely amazing and i encourage anyone with a ps4 to play it. i can't friggin wait for part 2 to come out.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,holy shiiiitttttt

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,the last of us is the only game i watched on youtube as a pcxbox gamer. hopefully this one is good enough to watch too.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,this is by far the best thing happening today!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i guess this will hold me down while i wait for a jak and daxter
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"welp, looks like i better play the first one sooner now. how are ps3 prices?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i'm not that excited simply because the first game was so perfect by itself that i dont want a sequal to ruin it. although knowing naughty dog it'll probobly be better than all expectations and i'll be happily incorrect.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,my body is ready
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"best thing is, we had no leaks about this, genuine excitement at the reveal. i hope e3 next year is actually an exciting event and not a checklist of leaks."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,every time i've opened reddit in the last two hours i've hyperventilated a little each time i see this post
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,remember when big announcements were reserved for e3? seems like that time has passed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"the 2 p.m. panel had no real new details, but displayed some forest concept art to the tune of new theme by gustavo santaolalla, who returns as composer."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"if they do kill off joel, they are gonna have to think a lot about how he's gonna die. i expect a freaking awesome  meaningful death scene. and there better be a death scene."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i thought after mw3 i would never get hyped for a game. i was wrong, im on this hype train!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i think the original last of us was the pinnacle of video game storytelling and hopefully this second one can live up to these expectations.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,well shit... guess i need to get a ps4 after all
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,glad its part 2 rather than a new story

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"haven't seen any comments mention this. but, that isn't joel in the trailer. i'm going to assume that's tommy. joel had brown hair while tommy had dirty blonde hair. watch 238244 again to see what i mean. so, i assume all the theories about joel being dead are accurate which is pretty sad."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,step 1 make this game for more than just the playstation. step 2 make hella bank. step 3 release part 1 for other things as well. step 4 collect more dollars.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,yes. fuck yes. no more to say.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i want this. i still think the first game had the best narrative in video games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,why did i sell my ps4???????fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucccccccccccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,is there last of us for pc?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,information learned at the panel with niel player plays as ellie. she plays differently. no other information on that. ellie is 19 years old. this game is about hate. the first game was about love.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"this is like half life 3, but better."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"excited about this! cautious, but excited. the last of us worked so well as a standalone story about joel life through tragedy. while ellie wasn't my favorite part of the original, i think seeing her grown up, taking on what can only be the personality of her and joel combined, has the potential to give us a story that is both respectful of the original and simultaneously its own entity. my only gripe from the trailer rewrite that last line of dialogue if it's going to be in the game. it's great as a way to shed some light on a potential storyline but, beyond the teaser, it's a tad too clich for me to consider it noteworthy. all in all, though, i am very intrigued! i will likely pick up another ps4 next year. it's encouraging to see such strong incoming material."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i knew it was coming. i tried to tell people but they wouldn't believe me.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"the ocd in me really wants nd to rerelease the last of us under the last of us part i. box art, menus, everything."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"boy, i can't wait to watch this movie! oh, it's a game? the first one was a game too? oh..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,here's a thought. a lot of people are conflicted about them being the protagonists. what if they're not. what if naughty dog is brutal and kills them in the first chapter? kind of like the unexpected death of joel's daughter in the first one. it just wrecked us and i imagine they could do the same to joel and ellie and start with new characters. either way i feel like joel doesn't survive this one.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,im crying already.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i solely play on xbox and always hate on ps not in a serious way, it's more a joke but i loved tlou immensely. very excited to watch a playthrough of this in the future!"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i would have much rather seen a new ip come first, but ok i guess."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,oh my god this game is hyped. i really hope they don't fuck it up!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"nooo no no! don't ruin this for us!! there is no need for this, please!"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,still haven't played the first.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"as a pc gamer, this is honestly the only reason why i will get a ps4 also for rd2 until it, hopefully, comes out on pc later on"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,man it's too bad this is an exclusive. i jumped ship to pc last year and i would love to play this but it ain't worth a whole new console
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,dicks fucking out
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,omg
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"dear naughty dog, please don't do an ubisoft or ea on this...."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,3 fucking years. guys!!!! yes yes yes i woke up to this notification im so happy
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"sigh i guess i'll have my soul destroyed by these masters of storytelling. i'm so excited for the game but i'm so afraid of what will happen to joel, ellie, and their relationship. i want everything to turn out alright but . . . i don't know if it will."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,cannot wait. i'm so emotionally attached to this game. i remember being first in line back in 8th grade to get it. played it until 6am. i actually got my name on one of the firefly medals because of an ign costume contest
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i can see it now the last of us 2 the rest of us
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,where and when did she get a tat?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i'm a little nervous for it because i feel like the first game ended perfectly. seems a little weird that they are continuing with the same characters.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,seems she's gonna ellieminate them all huh
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,hopefully they'll actually implement a multiplayer survival mode this time around
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,who's hyped tho? because i am!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,and just when i thought i could finally get off the hype train. sigh fuck it. let's ride all the way to hell!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,i should probably play the first one.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,my reaction to the trailer httpm.imgur.comgallerypqhzn
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,joel is dead. calling it
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"this is amazing and all and i'm extremely looking forward to this but fuck you, naughty dog, for not leaving ellie and joel alone and focusing on different characters. this is going to be so saddening to me and if joel dies which seems like a pretty big probability i'm literally going to croak. love you, naughty dog, please don't conform to the unwritten rules of emotional draining stories 101, you're better than this. a good ending doesn't make you weak the rest of the ride is heartwrenching. tragedy for the sake of tragedy just feels redundant, and believe me, i love me a sad ending, but i just don't think it'll do good for the last of us. anyways, so excited!!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,aaaaah deep breath aaaaaaaaaaaaah

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,is it bad if my first reaction to seeing ellie in the trailer is the porn won't be weird anymore?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"spoiler if you haven't seen the trailer yet when ellie says i'm going to kill them all, it almost feels like she's referring to the fireflies, because of what they tried to do."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,i just started playing the original. bought an old ps3 just to play this and rdr. what's the odds of part 2 coming to pc? having to do without mouse and keyboard takes away some of the joy frankly.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,they should have called the original the second to the last of us then.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,anyone notice how the two main characters in this trailer were in the first game?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,that feeling when you decided to buy a xbox one for christmas instead of a ps4.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,the last of us 2 the last of the last of us
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i didn't play the first one but i saw all the gameplay for it. i recently built a pc. if naughty dog got enough support to make a pc version of this, would they be inclined to do it or are they under a very restricted contract with sony?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"this looks great, but i don't like the ellie tattoo."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i wish theyd make pc versions given the game has such great graphics.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"woe us. woe us, the ones that do not own a gaming console. woe us, that stuck with pc gaming, because controllers are just not our thing. hoping for a pc release one day though."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,never understood why everyone is freaking out over the game. don't get me wrong it's an amazing game but i think people are overreacting a bit
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i have told myself i'll be buying a ps4 only if there is ever a sequel to the last of us, which imo is among the very best video games ever created. looks like i'll buying one soon. fuck it, i didn't want to get a ps4, but i have a too strong emotional connection to ellie and joel to pass this up.  can't wait to get to know what naughty dog comes up with this time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"maybe it's because i have not played much of the 1st one, but.... that was kinda dumb?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i never knew what four minutes of goosebumps straight felt like until i watched this trailer.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,this might actually be the first time guitar playing has been animated correctly and perfectly in video games. guitar hero and rock band ain't got shit on naughty dog.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,but.... it had an ending.... last of us's ending was good... the story was done.... it doesnt need a sequel....

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,my prediction. joel is fucking dead. she looked at least 1015 years older. joel of course only from behind looked about the same age. no extra grey hair etc. not to mention the whole walking out of the light deal. blood rage ellie
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"as much as i love the last of us, i kind of don't need a sequel. the ending was just perfect and i dont' want to ruin it. well, probably gonna preorder anyway."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,the last of us is my alltime favorite game ever. i've never played a single second of it. i just watched the playthrough of it on youtube. this looks amazing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"i like how they are calling it part 2 not just 2, it feels like they planned it with care and not just want to call it 2, but instead hopefully a continuation on the story."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,i wish last of us was on pc!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"did anybody know anything about the first one prerelease? my friend told me there was an embargo prerelease so nobody knew anything about it. i went into it with absolutely no ideas or expectations. i had no clue it was a zombie game until the neighbor came crashing through. my friend who told me this, he doesn't really follow much as far as gaming goes. so was it common knowledge that this was a zombie game? or was everyone surprised like i was? having no expectations imo made it sooo much fucking better. i'm sure this one will be great, but if the first wasn't well known, i wish they changed the title and left us wondering about it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"honestly, i have been a pc and xbox boy for a long time. i haven't played playstation since playstation 2. this, this has pushed me over the edge with jealously. i have been so jealous of all the amazing story games that have only came to playstation. i have on impulse, bought a playstation 4, and it will be here in 10 days!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,remember when naughty dog presented the last of us demos that showed sophisticated ai and gameplay mechanics and then delivered a final product which had none of those things?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,ehh who cares kind of a bad game if the story wasnt decent

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"the game is massively overrated. pretty good story, bad gameplay. also console exclusive."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"and here i am waiting for the first one to be ported to pc. which is never gonna happen. smh inb4 console gamers mass downvote me i actually like the game, i just wish it wasn't restricted to one console"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,that's sad. it won't reach the same epicness of the first one.. some ips are meant to be oneoff. it's like the lion king 2 and 3.. we simply don't talk about those anymore. the movies who shant be named.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,should've called it the last of them and there would've been a title drop in the trailer.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,anyone else getting the vibe that ellie kills joel at the end of this one?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"everyone can at least admit that the last of us isn't actually a good game. more a good cinematic experience, but take away the cinematic experience and your left with wonky controls and strange gameplay choices."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,not on pc? not interested.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,well the first one sucked in my opinion so im not excited. sure this comment will be downvoted to hell by the hivemind though which is unfortunate.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"take it easy, it wasn't that good."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,that moment when you realize you've never played the last of us and probably will never get to.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"in the last of us, the level design and environments were great. art and audio were great. sneak and engagement mechanics were awesome. the weapon diversity and usefulness, paired with inventory management was fantastic. ai was pretty dang good. even ellie was a compelling character. but joel was inexcusable. his clich paternal attachment throughout the game, and especially at the end, was exhaustively selfish. my recurring thought through the last level was i don't want to do this. joel, paired with the third person perspective, really degraded my appreciation of this game. ellie was way smarter and emotionally much stronger than joel, and would have seen through his crap in less than a year. she'd have ditched his oppressive paternal bs as soon as possible. seeing them together again is a disappointment unless it's a temporary rendezvous like joel  bill from the first installment. there are so many more stories to be told. make no mistake, this sequel is targeted at our wallets just like every sequential blockbuster film or aaa game stuffed into the market place this last decade. if it follows their recipe for success, it will be the same thing all over again. always remember downvote to disagree"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"not on pc, don't care"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"ew a sequel to a game that was already shit... cringe!!! where's black ops 4???? edit before my karma gets annihilated, this was meant to be sarcastic. i am fucking hyped for this game."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i'll play it like everyone else, but this is a game that didnt need a sequel. it told a great contained story, had a complex and emotionally resonant ending, and had closure for joel's arc. it was a great example of a aaa game actually doing a pretty artistic ending, and now we're getting the sequel. i don't think it's necessary. it's like cormac mccarthy writing a sequel to the road. it's dumb. i really liked how the last of us felt more like a piece of art than a commodity. i just feel the more they push it, the farther it gets away from the road, and the closer it gets to the walking dead. it's like if the red dead sequel turned out to be about marston's son if it's about the son turning into a noble gunslinger and living happily ever after, that ruins the first ending. if it's about him having a tough demise like his dad, there's no point in even telling that story. that story was already toldperfectly and conciselyin the red dead epilogue. sometimes a story is perfect, and you can leave it be. if schindler's list was a videogame, two years later we wouldve got schindler's list 2 the return of schindler the walking dead sucks, guys"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,would it be released in 2017? i really cannot wait for 2 years. otherwise ps4 would be a legacy console by then
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,i loved the first game. i don't think i'm going to like part two. they should have used the setting to tell a different story.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"even for the setting, that was overly dramatic"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,part i and ii should be released for the pc... just sayin'

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,this is so weird. i didn't even play the 1st game but i nearly teared up when i saw the trailer. fucking hell thsoe graphics are awesome. and we play as ellie ? wonder what happen to joel.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"what if seeing joel was just a hallucination, and ellie is just gonna go on a killing rampage because they killed him? just a theory..."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,the best part about the higher difficulty in tlou was that it didn't really allow you that luxury. i constantly felt like i was scrambling for bullets and crafting materials.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"my only problem with this announcement is that the first game had the perfect ending, i felt relief at joel and ellie's survival like never before playing a video game, yet the somber realisation of what that meant, the sacrifice joel made. i really hope naughty dog have the narrative mapped out for this. but damn, i can't wait to play it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"this trailer is fucking brilliant. it barely showed anything, but it got people so fucking pumped. also, brilliant idea to release the trailer with people's reactions in the background. hearing the crowd going wild at the key points makes this a whole new experience."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,before this i always said i'd like to leave joel and ellie alone but make more games in the universe. needless to say this trailer changed that.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,deleted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,music too. score was amazing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"theories and observations i've seen and made so far  joel materializes out of thin air  he appears to move through the tall grass in the doorway like a ghost  he steps over the puddle, and does not step on the grass it appears to move out of the way if his foot, but it could just have been the wind  he looks remarkably fine despite the battle that just took place"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,that was blood running down the gash on her forehead
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"guessing they came for ellie, killed people close to her joel's brother? and now she's gonna fuck them up."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"the fireflies track down and execute joel. ellie is on the war path for revenge. joel throughout the game is going to haunt ellie, trying to get her to turn back and let it go, because she knows that if she doesn't, she's going to be killed. the first game was a father dealing with the loss of his daughter, and this one will be about a daughter dealing with the loss of her father."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"my current theory is that the settlement gets overrun by an opposing group, maybe firefly remnants, with only a handful surviving including ellie. i get the feeling they'll pull a fast one with joel and show that he's dead and is haunting ellie in visionsdreams"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i assume someone has come and killed everyone at the little town they ended up at
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"we just have to wait until we have the psnow service available for the ps4 so we can stream it to pc. you know, since naguhty dog is never going to go cross platform"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,hsha naughty dog ever done anything not for playstation?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"speaking of what song ellie should've been playing, remember in the first game when joel said he should teach her how to play the guitar? well... this trailer shows that he actually did... i don't know, but i think that's so fucking cute had to curse there to reinforce my masculinity"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,thats crazy fam nobody else pointed this out
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,that's good to know. i assumed it would be somewhat realistic otherwise they wouldn't have chosen to show the hands etc.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"original, 249, slim 299, pro 399. there's still sales going on."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,butthurt fanboys. from pc and xbox
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,a girl who was already 14 or 15 looks way different at age 2021 while a dude that was 40 doesn't really look much different at age 45. even if it is 10 years and ellie is 25 and joel is 50 he would not look much different.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,me too but damn i'm hype for just about anything naughty dog makes
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"remember when druckmann said we'd never play as ellie? naughty gods lie a lot to the press, and i am so glad they do."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"they said it's still in very early development, i wouldn't expect to see it until 2018, at which point ps4 prices should be pretty affordable to buy back in"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"eewww, it's almost like he'd be banging his surrogate daughter... wait, he would be!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,they didn't seem to be much in ruins to me. the big chase scene had a bunch of them pretty well armed. all we saw was a few dead doctors and a named higher up kick the bucket. they could still be around in force. they probably found another doctor and then went back after ellie since they knew she was still alive.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,probably xbone or pc people who are bitter they won't get it
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"there's a ridiculously active amount of positive comments flooding my inbox, probably someone botting it with downvotes"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,why two consoles? the first last of us is on ps4 as well

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,disgusting to see so many people saying good things about an amazing game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"in a world of 7 billion people, the answer is always no."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"i played it and thought the game was good, but certainly not amazing as a lot of people do. i think our opinion is absolutely valid, but you have to understand that when you add the last line of your post, now bring on the downvotes! you're delegitimizing your point, because it comes across as you not liking the game only to be a contrarian and rustle jimmies."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"wow, its almost like people have different tastes. if you don't like something move on, never understood why people feel the need to say something for the sake of saying it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,there are dozens of us!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,nah... it's a great movie trapped inside a crappy game.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"don't think you opinion will last long here. props to ya for being honest and all but i fully disagree. i liked the gameplay, like a lot. i played through it on all difficulties. but none the less i ain't hating."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"totally. i want more lou, i loved the first, but i didn't want to see joel or ellie ever again. this has so many ways it can be completely ruined."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,when has naughty dog ever made something subpar since partnering with sony? even their lowest rated titles are still in contention for goty for their release years.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,exactly what i said. updoots all around.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"didn't notice, guess so"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,the only way this won't be ps4 exclusive is if it jumps to ps5
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"watch a streamlets play of it on youtube, it's essentially exactly the same experience as the gameplay elements are... erm.."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,there's a trailer in this thread that shows joel and ellie.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i never thought there would be a part 2 ...

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,true. and it has more upvotes than the post that actually includes the trailer. op saw his chance for karma out the ass and he took it.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,every one knew it was a zombie game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,playstation has some decent titles on it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,play every uncharted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,cause that's bad...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,umm... that is the purpose because it is a storydriven game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,that's just an opinion man. i loved the gameplay. it feels oldschool and is so immersive. reminds me of playing splinter cell and imagining being sam fisher. i like a game that you can get lost in. all the new crap today is reskinned versions of the same old games over and over. that's just my opinion though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,i really don't understand why people would get pissy about your opinion. that would be as silly as being angry over a book or movie being translated into another language. it's not like there should be a monopoly on art or stories.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,we both know it's not gonna happen
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i really like it but it's so overrated. linear and the story isn't really that deep. there's just a twist
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i'm ducking out of this comment chain before it gets hostile.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,get out. get out!!!!!!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"it's everything i hate about american aaa games these days. endless cutscenes, repetitive and uninspired gameplay, the same old mechanics. uncharted is even worse. but obviously people love these types of games so i guess the industry is gonna keep doing this for a while. why innovate when you can make the same shit over and over and people eat it up."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,your opinion sucks!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i loved it for the opposite of why you hate it, the gameplay was satisfying and exciting, the controls were sharp, the story was full of emotion, and i genuinely came to care about the characters. i am sure that if we sat down, looked at the game, and explained our opinions to each other i would start to see some flaws, and you would start to see some strengths. but the reason it is getting a squeal is because more people looked at the game like i did, and less like you did. it doesn't mean that you are wrong, it just means that your opinion on the game is not shared by many others and thus your opinions are drowned out by the vocal majority."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"i think there's an element of millennial entitlement to this circlejerk. i don't get it, but some of us agree that tlou sucks."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,if they want to completely undo the first games legacy and tank their reviews maybe.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i don't think anyone disagrees with that. forgettable game mechanics, but likely the best story ever told through the video game medium."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"wow. i really thought that the development of the relationship between joel and ellie was fantastic. sure, there were cliche things about it, but given the nature of the two characters, particularly joel, i thought that how everything wound up was solid. it made sense for his character. and i think it was at least hinted at a little bit that ellie was suspicious of joel in the end. maybe i'm wrong. either way, i respect your opinion."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"no where in the first game did the last of us imply that there was nobody left, i just don't understand how the last of us, part 2, merits a sarcastic response or snarky attitude as if after the first one there was no one left?"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,this is basically the only thing left for nonpc gamers to boast about. so i doubt it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,then why even comment?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"for you people reading this in the future. look how stupid people like this bought into the hype, not realising that the sequel completely ruined the entire game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"how was it hand holding? just try a harder difficulty, and it's a zombie game so it's predestined to be formulaic, though it is the best one out there so far."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,it's okay that you didn't like it. have you played the multiplayer?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"this was a huge problem in 4. lou was better, or it actually made sense. it plays significantly better too. my biggest fear has nothing to do with game style here, and everything to do with potentially destroying the first game by touching joelellie again. a huge risk."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i played it on the hardest difficulty the first time through and thoroughly enjoyed it except for the graveyard clicker stairs that automatically make you not crouch walk when you touch them.... felt like i had to count bullets and plan it out prior to each encounter, but could do it without bullets if i really really needed to. played it the other day on an easier difficulty to revisit the story and discovered that joel has radar."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,nothing bad can happen to you if you never leave your room
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i really hope they can pull off another story with these two without forcing it or ruining the story arc of part 1
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,common story telling is leading me to believe we are going to see joel die...and i feel tears build up just at the thought of that
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i'm so excited to get invested in their lives again. never have i been so invested in two peoples relationship

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i'm thinking either fall 2017 or spring 2018. i am willing to bet it won't come out in 2019, that's not how these things work. remember, it's been in development for at least a year, probably even more than that. there's no way it'll come out later than first half of 2018."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i'm welling up, they even included the ivy covered window from the opening menu! so fucking stoked!!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"same here. i was a little worried about them revisiting joel and ellie because the first was so good and i didn't want them to ruin it, but this trailer that barely showed anything makes me feel like continuing with them is just... right."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"nah man it's essential for a trailer to give an outline of the entire movie's plot, so you don't need to actually watch it to know it sucks"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,literally the game that makes me buy a ps4.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"don't forget horizon zero dawn and mother effing death stranding! oh and a little game called god of war all coming to the ps4, i think it is safe to buy one just for those games!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"joel is one of the most fleshed out characters in any video game ever. he is grey as fuck in his moral dealings, and at the same time completely relatable in nearly every situation. he quite possibly doomed humanity, but you can barely fault him for doing it. fuck, i loved the characters in this game!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"it is naughty dog we're talking about here. they're arguably the best gamebased storytellers in the business. i mean, they made nathan drake, an indiana jonesesque 10 year old fantasy hero come to lifeish character seem relatable in uncharted 4 and ellie is up there as the one of the most connectable autocorrect tells me that isn't a word but bleh game characters ever made. they're capable to say the least."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"you felt relief? man that ending was super sad. they may have survived bit all the trust in their relationship is gone. joel lied to ellie and she knew it. ellie will always stay near joel as she has no one else but nothing will ever be the same between them. they may have survived but joel did the wrong thing and although they'll never say that, they both absolutely know it. heartbreaking."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i reckon joel in the trailer is a ghost and they killed him.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,remind me! 2 years!

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i think you're spot on. i think the fireflies killed joel and now ellie is hallucinating and seeing him, driven by the anger of the death of her best friend she is out for vengeance."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,the first game was about a father dealing with the loss of his daughter. this one will be about a daughter dealing with the loss of her father.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,where does this info come from? i don't think they would leave something that important out of the actual game because it affects their relationship so much.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,well it looks like they are a few years in the future. i'm just guessing but maybe she is sad that all the people of the town they are in probably the one with rick's brother were killed when they tried to capture ellie. so killing pretty much all your friends and neighbors could give the reaction that ellie had.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,i agree and it's my personal favorite. there has never been another game that i was so invested in. i have always wished i could get the experience from that initial play through again. it was like reading a really really good book. and now i'll get that chance.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"yeah you're not wrong. i replayed it the other days and some mechanics still stick out, like how close you can be to enemies without them seeing you. i understand that it's a game but it sorta breaks the immersion. still, the story is what made it. all the small interactions really built up their relationship."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,there it is. worried for my guy but it'll be interesting to see if they do take that on.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"no, its naughty dog everything they make is awesome. i just think that as a story it was done, it had a satisfying ending and now its just.... continuing? it seems like its getting a sequel not because it needed one, but purely because it will obviously make a lot of money. this happens a lot in tv and movies, whenever something is successful the studio gets pressured to make it another few dozen times. i want to see sequels to titles not just because the last game was good and sold well, but because there is room to continue to build on the characters and world a spin off on the other hand would have been great, same world, different place and characters. you get to explore the world a bit more, maybe the game takes place in europe and we see how that part of the world is dealing with the apocalypse, and we get a new set of characters who have room to develop over the course of the game. a direct sequel though just feels unnecessary, like its done just because its a safe investment"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"you are right, for joel's character, it did make sense. his character was obviously shaped by the loss of his daughter. the character flaw of emotional inadaptability made him very flat. the relationship that developed between the two was indeed superior to relationships we see in many games these days. how many other aaa titles actually feature compelling relationship content? in a market flooded with super linear fps titles geared toward online multiplayer, a game with a relationship like this is invigorating. i believe the relationship between joel and ellie only occurred because 1. joel had a daughter again, and 2. ellie needed someone to aid her across the country. now that ellie no longer requires a travel buddy, the necessity of joel's character is greatly diminished. i respect yours as well. discourse like this is might encourage more from devs. shut up and take my money is much less compelling."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i don't think it will end with joel's death but i think his death will be part of the climax and ellie will be forced to move on alone or with a new character we meet. in the first one i thought joel was going to die when he fell on that rebar. i actually thought the game was over for a second. that was a tense moment.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"this one gets me every time, a vaccine would not save humanity at this point imo. most of the time the runners and clickers brutally grab the person and kill them rather than turn them. on top of that the fireflies are a group with an agenda, they would most likely use it as a weapon, like spread spores to military to eliminate them. also since they have had people like ellie before and they didn't just let her wake up and tell joel this is what she wanted. the fireflies are shady as fuck so the decision like every decision joel makes isn't black and white imo"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"the point is that humanity is doomed whether or not ellie lives or dies. it comes down to who are really the bad guys? if we flushed out everyone with the parasites, humanity is still going to be evil. joel realized this and made the choice figuring that ellie's life wasn't going to be the end all for evil."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"he quite possibly doomed humanity, but you can barely fault him for doing it. joel did not doom mankind, they were doing just fine when they were working together like in that village halfway through the game. it's the human who were causing their own misery in nearly every case. i mean, yeah, the initial epidemic killed people, like ebola, like black death, but it's people fearing each other who turned everything to shit."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,ding. this is why they are bringing them back.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"to be fair, ellie could simply be evidence that humanity is slowly adapting to the spores. so while joel may have made humanity suffer for a bit longer, there is still a high chance, imo anyway, that more people with ellie's condition brain change after being bitten or whatevs will appear in the future."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,not to mention in a post reveal interview they talked about how they were so dissatisfied with the stories they kept coming up with they almost gave up on a sequel all together because they refused to tell a story that would dilute the first game. which means if they're doing it they know they've hit on a really good narrative.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,honestly that would be worst. if ellie dies and it ends that implies a joel suicide.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,that would be 2016 as a game.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-07,just bought the remastered edition the other day after seeing this post. wanted to see what all the fuzz is about. just finished it. holy shit. great fucking game. def in my top five. highly recommended.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"what do you expect in an announcement thread for the game that's regularly cited as a favorite to those who have played it? 90 of the downvotes sum up to i don't get what all the hype is about. it's a game that won 100 awards and is receiving a sequel after almost 4 years, but somehow you're angry that fans are excited for it??"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"oh i see, yeah a spin off would have been awesome"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"you can buy the first three in one disc. the uncharted collection. i recommend the first three, it's what i did and it made me appreciate the story more by the time i finished uc4."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,removed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,they always advertised it as similar to uncharted a cinematic game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i never got that impression, and honestly i don't think it would suit being an open world game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-05,"that's what doesn't make any sense to me! if games want to make more money then they should make them available across all platforms, unless they're afraid of piracy on pc? i see what you mean about certain games working better on pc, but for the vast majority of games it just makes more sense to make them universally available. there are some great sony titles out there, but i'm not going to buy a ps3 or ps4 just to have them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,go cry somewhere else.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"you really want to get your opinion out there to people, don't you?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"through the video game medium, yeah. i think it's up there at the top. mass effect, halo...what other games had stories this compelling?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"well the way heshe worded it did come across that way, in all fairness."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"i love how the ps4 community downvotes you for typing stuff like this. i'm definitely missing out by not owning one... seriously guys, exclusives suck regardless of your preferred platform. pc gets more exclusives than any consoles combined and i hate that it does that, even if they do tend to get dumbed down when ported over to consoles or when developed on both. exclusives are crap. those that support these decisions, just like preordering idiots, are making gaming worse for everyone, regardless of preferred platform."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"i agree. i'm hoping that they will explore the harsh reality of joel's dependence on ellie, rather than paint him as some sort of adoptive father, from her perspective. as you said, her character showed more emotional depth than his, so hopefully they'll capitalize on her strengths and her further maturing during whatever time has passed since the events of the first game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,yes
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"well indeed, it would be nice if pc was simply the defacto so we could all focus on it but that won't happen whilst sony make money from these boxes."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i just don't play video games that often.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i can't speak for everyone, but i hadn't seen a game like this before the graphics, the storyline, falling in love with the characters. this game got my fiance to stop skipping the cut scenes as well, so that's a huge win. i'll admit, it isn't for everyone, most things aren't, i just absolutely loved it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,it actually very different. uncharted is more fast paced and the last of us relies more on strategy. you have less ammo and a large emphasis on crafting itemsweapons.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-14,it's weird.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-01-08,you do realize days gone is coming out years after the last of us
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"it's way more fun without it, trust me. i just used patience and camera angles and it was a ton of fun... the whole radar thing didn't seem to fit the game. joel's not a clicker!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"that's grounded mode the hardest difficulty no radar, less ammo, smarter enemies."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,don't die
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"don't try to fight the clickers. sneak right past them. wait for bill to unlock the door. get through the door, and you are in the clear. there are a lot of points in that game where complete stealth is the best course of action."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,just spitballing here and tagging just in case i think the people she killed in the house there were fireflies. the framing makes it seem like their mark was on a stop sign outside the house and it was their territory. my guess is that joel tells her the truth pretty early in the game first third at least and then the full story along with new information we get makes her want to kill them allspoiler
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,perfect.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,damn you beat me to it lmao
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,i agree completely. finishing tlou was the only time i've ever thought i just played a perfect game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,it really was amazing it's the on the pedestal with portal 2 and the half life series. the story telling is flawless.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,still remember the what is the matrix commercials and only seeing some short clip of trinity in the air before seeing it. i mean that reveal was awesome
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"those are the same people who within the first 10 minutes of a movie starting complain that they're confused and don't know who everyone is. god this makes me rage internally. no i don't know who he is, i watched exactly as much as you have!!!!!!!!"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,just finished bloodborne and i haven't had that much fun in a while. and stress...that too
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,literally the two games that made me buy a ps4
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i absolutely question joel's decision . ellie had made a choice, and he stole that from her. not for her, but because he himself couldn't stand losing her. he possibly betrayed the world to save ellie, but ultimately, he betrayed ellie to save himself. which is why he lies to her in the final moments of the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"eh, that depends on how you did it i think. i perfect stealthed the last bit, didn't kill anyone and got into the operating room unseen. my logic was that holy shit that's a lot of machine guns, so i thought i was supposed to do that. turns out most people just killed everyone including the surgeons and nurses, and i feel like killing the doctors was kind of unnecessary. but, in retrospect, i think killing absolutely everyone was the canon ending."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,seems to me the primary threat of infection comes from airborne spores rather than direct contact with infected. a vaccine would be hugely helpful.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"replaying it, they do point out in the beginning that some people get infected just from spores growing in their homes. the spores might keep spreadingin that case, a vaccine might be the only way."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,also since they have had people like ellie before and they didn't just let her wake up and tell joel this is what she wanted they really did have others like ellie? i thought that joel made that up completely.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,how the heck did they think they were going to make a vaccine out of nowhere? do you know how long it takes to design a vaccine vector and test it?!? factoring in their lack of manpower or infrastructure... impossible! especially as it was just the fireflies. i think the only way would be as a collaborative effort with several governments around the world. assuming the rest of the world has a surviving population.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"i think saving ellie was the right choice as well. was humanity meant to be saved? think about all the bad people you met in the game, then think about the good people. two black guys, and one camp. the rest wanted to do the worst to you."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"oh, i bet the fireflies came in and killed everyone where ellie and joel were staying, trying to get her back. and now she wants revenge."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"wait. i thought the had immune people, was part of joel's lie. no one had shown immunity before ellie. unless i missed something."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"i saw it as more of a conflict of ideologies between joel and ellie, and the whole cure thing is just the backdrop. everybody ellie cared about was killed by the infected apart from marlene, but she doesn't know that, and she sees dying for the sake of possibly finding a cure as like her calling. she's willing to sacrifice herself to get rid of the infected. joel on the other hand, everybody he cares about is killed by humans. they kill his daughter, tess, and they would have killed ellie too if he hadn't intervened. so his only real purpose is just to hold onto something that people can't take from him, whatever the cost. so in the end, even if the main characters don't fully realize it themselves, the main conflict is ellie's selflessness vs. joel's selfishness. and of course joel wins completely. there's a little ambiguity at the end about whether she believes his story or not, but either way it's a pretty tragic ending for ellie imo. so yeah at the heart of it i see it as just a deeply personal story about the differences between those two characters bear in mind also that ellie has probably lost at least as many people she loves as joel has and the whole apocalypse thing was just a stage for it to play out on. as far as the story is concerned, what happens to humanity doesn't really matter."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"yeah that's the background of joel decision, specially after seeing the game introduction."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i think an interesting plot narrative would be that he dies while trying in some form or another to tell her the truth about her.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,literally just bought a 100 ps4 pros because of this brilliance.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"same here, i thought she was on a stage singing to people."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-04,"iirc he had his daughter early, and he didn't go to college? so he was probably 50 during the first game, late 40s?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"buttfuckit  bill, 2033"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,fify ftfy ftfy
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,the first game explored how many younger people prolly wouldn't survive postoutbreak. i could imagine there being a scenario where ellie is one of the very few her age who actually survived.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"not that they even know for sure if they can reverseengineer ellie into a cure, which is one of the reasons why the first game ended like it did."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"yeah, and even with a cure i think it's too late for most of them anyway. not saying a cute is a bad thing, but it won't fix everything"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,without the torture of course.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"and on top of that, he looks like he didn't just fight and kill those people. he looks clean and unscathed, not like the brutal joel we see throughout the first one. plus, he'd be a few years older and is bound to be slower, which makes him being unharmed less likely."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,then bruce willis shows up asking for work.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,i thought that was just a scene of joel teaching ellie the guitar?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2016-12-03,"the thing is though, you have to wonder if it would truly be ellie's choice, or if she would make the choice because she felt obligated to do so. saving humanity at the cost of your own life is a heavy burden for a 14yo kid. obviously, joel loves her and had his own personal reasons to lie to her at the end as, but i also feel that he did not let her make her own decision because, ultimately, it wouldn't really be her decision. it's easy for us to say that a single life is a small price to pay, but i don't blame joel for not wanting to force that sacrifice upon her. besides, there was no guarantee that the experiments would even successfully create an effective vaccine that could be massproduced. and even if it did, the fireflies proved themselves to be a shady bunch. think of the power to be had by controlling the production and distribution of such a vaccine! the humanity that ellie could have maybe, possibly saved, perhaps, would then be at the whim and mercy of the fireflies."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,holy shit this looks good. like really good. i'd preorder it tonight if i could. that scene alone would be worth 60 even if the rest of the game sucks itwont. i'm definitely taking a long weekend to myself to play through this game as soon as i get it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i was wondering, how did they get the two actresses so close together for the kissing scene? as far as i know they're wearing a headpiece that is protruding from their forehead to record the eye movement's and facial cues. how would they be able to get so close to each other without bumping that clunky mocap gear?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,maybe it's just mods doing their job but i'm very happy to see an almost total absence of oh mugawd yucky gay kisses in ma vidya games stupid sjw's and their virtue signaling!!! this looks incredible.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"don't forget this is an official gameplay trailer captured on dev kits. they can augment detail, draw distance, and every shot has been expertly composited by movie professionals to remove aliasing, and all natural defects. not slamming the game, i'm sure it will be great. but official trailers and screens have been heavily augmented."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,badass! cant wait for this game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,cannot wait for this game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"we should keep our expectations in check. i remember the last of us 2012 e3 trailer had awesome ai reactions and interactions during combat. the final product's ai, however, was never as smart as the trailer's. this trailer was carefully curated for its audience. that final animation where it transitions from combat back to the cutscene is an example i'm not convinced we'll see the same thing in the final product."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i might be wrong, but i'm like 95 sure this wasn't actual gameplay, merely something prerendered and prerecorded in order to give players a good idea of what the game would be like. the animations were just a bit too smooth, and the transitions between gameplay and cutscene were a bit too seamless, even when triggered by completely random events like simply crouching under a truck or killing a particular guy. this kind of thing happens all the time for example the first gameplay demo of bioshock infinite shown at e3 wasn't a gameplay demo at all, since the enemy ai wasn't done yet  it was all scripted, and it wouldn't surprise me if naughty dog used preexisting assets and animations in order to create their own demo, which is either completely prerendered from scratch and made to look like ingame footage or actually ingame footage, but extremely heavily scripted and most likely playing itself in order to trigger all of the scripted events at the appropriate time. i'm not saying that the game won't be amazing, because it's naughty dog and it'll probably be, but maybe don't expect the final release to be quite as smooth and cinematic as the demo."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,very excited to see ellie hopefully find love and continue to be a badass!

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i havent had a ps since the psone and have been an avid xbox gamer since, but when tlou came out i single sessioned it on a mates console on survivor and was blown away. the original was easily one of the most engrossing and polished games ive ever played. seeing this trailer, once again, blew me away at the level of world crafting and detail that has gone into creating it. one of the smallest details that actually blew my mind was when ellie is hiding behind the car and has her hand on it, it slightly adjusts as her body and camera does. i know its small but when developers put that level of detail into a game you know you have an unforgettable experience on your hands. this time around i am so tempted to get a ps, i actually dont care if this game is the only one i ever play on it. easily my favourite trailer of e3 and there were some superb ones, but this was truly outstanding."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"a few notes, looks like ellie's love interest is a player. seems like she's leading ellie on, i'm sure at this point ellie has a reputation of being a bad ass and protector. ellie's friend mentions her old man. nice reference to joel. he also states that the old man has been critiquing his patrols. joel is alive. graphics look impecable. foliage is massively improved and resembles uncharted 4's beautiful landscapes. fog is also noteworthy. crafting seems to be imrpoved. very fast in this demo, we'll see how it plays. looks like there are plenty of new toys to play with explosive arrows!! along side classics like the med kit. combat is absolutely brutal. not for the faint of heart. vaulting and jumping looks so smooth the environmental interaction is really what gets me excited. bullets shattering glass, ellie diving under the truck, ellie getting thrown through the glass in the store... animations are truly impressive. easily my most anticipated game."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"a lot of this gameplay isn't actually gameplay. it's cinematic gameplay, that's highly scripted, uses camera pans, custom animations, dialogue, scenarios, visual effects and more, that won't play out the same way or at all in release. the original e3 gameplay reveal for the last of us was the same way, except this time they took it to a whole other level. i'm sure it'll be a fantastic game, but to call this gameplay is stretching it pretty far."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the gunshots seem so realistic. incredible detail when it comes to the impact and bullet paths. also the variety and brutality in the takedown shots is so fitting for the game. so excited for whats to come!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,literal chills anticipating a game that has everything that trailer just showed.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,holy shit...i'd watch someone play that and have a ball
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that looks like fun
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i got downvoted for saying that joel is probably dead after the first teaser came out, but im still willing to bet its true, or that itll happen early on in the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,game looks great. she looks a lot different from the earlier promo art.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the most realistic game play ive ever seen. the reactions in the fights really stand out to me! when shes dodging stray bullets. just so many small things that make this trailer amazing!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i gasped and held my breath like 30 times throughout this entire trailer omg
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i'm hyped
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"lets hope this trailer isn't overly scripted, i would love to see the boundaries get pushed yet again by this series. the attention to detail and the over all emotion that they're bringing to the table is something that i'm very excited to see. if the game does flow and build around the player as well as get directly affected by the decisions and quick choices you decide to make like they do in this trailer. imagine then the gameplay that will take place against the infected. i'm genuinely excited to play this game and see where the journey goes."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,fucking nutted on those scavengers. i wonder how they play into the story and if well see any clicker gameplay soon.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i dont even play this game or have any consoles but this looks amazing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that is unfuckingbelievable.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"while i love this trailer, it's important to note that most of the stuff you see is scripted. since it's naughty dog i'm willing to say that what you see is somewhat close to what we'll get, but at the end of the day it's certainly not gonna look like that 100."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i was screaming like a little girl while watching this. so good.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,incredible
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the movement looks heavy, you can see momentum carry through as ellie moves over objects. not abrupt in turns, or suddenly stopping to change direction. a commendable detail to have in the game. it was almost hard to tell between cinematic scenes and actual gameplay if it wasnt for the hud. this is the result for spending extra time to get those details in motion capture."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"all the combat and stealthy action is awesome, but the thing that impressed me the most is...the faces are just incredible."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,holy shit. ill buy a ps4 pro for this. done.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"that was a perfect trailer, i'd rather watch it then any action film."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it honestly looked too good. like how is some of that stuff possible? stuff like picking up then throwing the bottle immediately. is that actually possible? i may need to actually give the first one a go. i played it a lil bit but if that trailer is normal gameplay i need to try it again.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,hope naughty dog reads this whole comment section!

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i believe the graphics can be this good and the animations this fluid. what i dont believe is the camera and camera angel will be anything like this and thats what makes to video so smooth.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the first one deserved its universal 1010 and this one looks even better!! i'm wary of judging by trailers, but this is naughty dog, not ubisoft. can't fucking wait!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,wow..just wow.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i love how the blood remains on the floor during the fights. this attention to the details creates a really immersive experience. they made an amazing work.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the music at the beginning is little sadie as covered by crooked still for those who wanted to know. the song is an old folk tune sung by many others at different times.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"god please let there be multiplayer. i loved the story of the first game but the multiplayer was where it was at for me. stealthing around, shooting people with a bow or sneaking up on them with a shiv. it was the game that made me love being stealthy in multiplayer games, i do it with every game that allows me to, but nothing has lived up to the feeling i'd get from last of us."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"as someone who hasnt owned a playstation since ps2 and hasnt really kept up with console gaming for the past several years, this kind of reminds me of metal gear solid from a gameplay perspective. am i completely off base with this? i used to love mgs but havent played a game like that in years cuz i havent had a playstation for the past two generations."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"some of those animations just look too good to be true but naughty dog have given me no reason to ever doubt they could do it. it is unbelievable what this team is capable of. from when she crawls under the car and scans the area around her and shooting the enemy through the cheek and the blood pouring from there. the way she bounces off the car as shes charged into only to dispatch one enemy and eventually kill the other and smoothly picking up the machete. this gameplay is a work of technical marvel. naughty dog are going to provide us with a real game changer, that is something i will confidently say until the game is released. also, appreciate the off comment about joel in the beginning. ellie is going to reach some dark places in this game. such a believable step in the narrative."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,everything about this trailer was sexy.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"my breakdown after watching a few times. its long, but i hope worth the read alright. so. first scene takes place before all this gameplay obviously. they live somewhere with power, music, where they put on ballsparties. neat. things have advanced well since the first one. joel is mentioned in passing, ellie seems weary of him. ellie along with others is set to be going on a run, this always makes joel uptight because he takes on more responsibility with preparing the groups. cool. ellie and the girl dance, kiss, all cool. now, as it transitions from the kiss to this.... hunt she is on, we see her stabbing this guy in the throat. notice, she is now wearing the bracelet that was being worn by the girl she was kissing. im imagining something happened to her. probably on the run they mentioned preparing for or why would the story be picking up right there? that run will be important. things will happen. so we will have to see how she came to be in possession of it. unless seattle, which is a confirmed game location, is where theyve settled as a group since the first one, she has traveled here for something since the first scene. now remember, the clip we got of the woman being dragged and hung up in a tree by a group of people played out almost exactly the way the scene did here. theyve got a guy hung by his neck, standing on a bucket, and they shove him off and cut him open. a lot of people, myself included, have been thinking that clip was of ellies mother before ellie was born, and wed be going between two timelines. but if that is the case, the group doing this.... hanging and gutting have been doing that same things for a long time. right? like... 18 years at least. so now im not so sure about the timeline of that first scene we got. backpedaling for a second, as ellie leaves was coming up on that clearing, there is a brick wall with graffiti of a woman with text reading may she guide you. they refer to ellie as a wolf, and theyre still tossing around things like wretch which were used in the clip we got months back. so this is the same group, some religious seeming nutjobs. but i cant yet figure out how they will get on ellies radar unless this is a group that had something to do with her mother. and its some long overdue revenge. thoughts? thanks for reading, guys. cant wait to get our hands on it."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i don't have any problem with ellie being gay, but the opening scene of her making out seemed forced and awkward. i mean, even if it was a straight couple i'd feel the same way. interestingly, i've never seen a straight couple presented in a trailer this way. it's obvious what they were trying to project, but i wish they would allow the player to experience her relationships naturally. unnecessarily forced, especially for a premier trailer. everything else looked fantastic though."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,now this is how you do a gameplay trailer. i hate how lots of gameplay trailers are obnoxiously staged. i think the worst ones are the voice actors trying to simulate real friends or real online players  they sound so fake it sickkens me. everything here seemed fairly natural and intuitive and the decisions the player makes while some are a little dramatized in terms of speed were also pretty natural. i also love the subtle ai reactions to things assuming those will be in the actual game.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it was the realistic movement animations which really shocked me in the first one. so i cant wait to see them in action in this one .
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,wrenching out that arrow!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"at the risk of sounding like a creep, that kissing animation was one of the most realistic kisses i've seen on a videogame."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i love how she picked up the arrow and added it to the quiver. and you can see exactly how many arrows she has.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,almost as fluid as pubg
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"also, its so nice to see gameplay from someone who doesnt suck major balls playing their game"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"be cautious, e3 trailers have a history of being very fake."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,well there's a very good chance it's scripted hard
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what about that putting her knife away animation though? it sort of just disappears up her butt. doubting its fully scripted based just on that
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,when she took the arrow out the corpse! naughty dog excel at these small details.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,nerd
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,last of us 1 has a similar smoothness in its presentation but it wasnt like that in game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the only sick thing was that beyondcringey let me rub my sweat into your face scene
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,nice catch! you know in dark souls the ring of the evil eye gives you health upon killing enemies. something to be said i suppose.. i'm hoping she gives ellie the bracelet before she goes out the next day. these things never end well
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,right? d crooked still has been a favorite for me for a long time. was super excited to hear them in the trailer!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i am going to use the fuck out of those arrows, dude."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what about joel?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,are we sure it's not fake? in some cases it looked too fluid... biggest red herring for me is her pulling the arrow out of her shoulder when she was in cover.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"at first i was like, who the fuck is glenn?? then i remembered."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,he was obviously hiding under the dumpster again.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,did i miss something? are naughty dog and twd doing a collab here?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,when i saw that hand to hand combathttpsi.imgur.com5khejsm.png
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"if it was any other developer, i would think its all scripted bullshit but...its naughty dog."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"lol, watching this made me think of tomb raider in so many ways. this looks like a more refined version of it's combat, but i'm still plenty excited for the next tomb raider."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"as a longtime fan of the tomb raider franchise, its a little bittersweet for sure. but im really happy for nd and i cant wait to play tlou pt.2."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i was thinking the exact same thing. i was considering buying shadow, but i like naughty dog, and square enix managed to fuck up both hitman and deus ex. maybe i'll snag it at a redbox."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,guerrila games also raised an eyebrow or two when the red haired girl hid in the tall grass to avoid being spotted by cult members.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the graphics were so fucking amazing and the gameplay was so fluid the ai reacting to your moves, the different cover, the multiple paths. and that hand to hand combat is outstanding. it's easy to see why naughty dog says this game is based on hate whereas the last one was based on love"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it was wasnt it!? the one thing that pissed me off, during the live chat a bunch basement dwelling cyber warriors fat losers were pissed about the lesbian part. so pathetic, put a bad taste in my mouth."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm preeeeety sure the ai doesn't behave that way when she loses then in the grass and hides under the truck. you know, complex and clearly scripted conversations involving custom animations and npcs instructing other npcs on tactics and strategy. that part seemed bs to me. still, i'd be perfectly happy to be wrong. real happy."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i want to believe but if you compared the last of us reveal to the final game it didnt run exactly like that. i really want to believe the final game will be close to what we saw today because i looked amazing.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i want some fucked up new infected
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i would be happy, lorewise, if their numbers are falling by this point in the timeline. they can't reproduce, they don't seem to be great at taking care of themselves, there are fewer and fewer humans to infect and the ones who are left are obviously a lot smarter and more savvy than they once were. it seems like natural attrition starvation, injury, disease, age and obviously human aggression would have thinned their numbers considerably."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"in the beginning, the guy says something like your old man really laid into me or something like that. i really hope that's joel, but then the gameplay part seems like a skip forward in time so who knows what happens from there. i'm so fucking pumped!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,is that who the asian dude was referring to when he said your old man really laid into me today?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"ya playing as ellie could be cool, but i still want joel present. one of best parts was the interactions between them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"hes probably almost 60 at this point. ellie 14 in first game, he was 45. shes probably early 20s. 25? so hes 50  55, having lived an incredibly brutal and damag8ng lifestyle for decades in a world with limited healthcare. id be surprised hes still fighting unless he really has to, which, of course, he will have to."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"buy it. get last of us 1. get god of war. get horizon zero dawn. get uncharted. get infamous second son. get spiderman when that comes out. youre missing out on so much and you wont regret it once you buy it. edit forgot bloodborne. souls games arent my cup of tea, sorry for leaving it out edit 2 also forgot detroit become human. sorry edit 3 agh, i forgot shadow of the colossus too. id say sorry again but im probably gonna edit this about 15 more times anyways edit 4 not actually adding anything, but clarifying something about this list. these are all ps4 exclusives. theyre what makes the system worth buying over an xbox or pc. games that are available on multiple systems i.e. witcher 3 arent being included. that doesnt mean that theyre bad, its just that they could be purchased on more than one system. no one buys nintendo consoles for the games that you could get elsewhere."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,idk why you haven't yet
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i did a month ago. wouldn't even think twice about recommending to anyone. its 100 worth it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i was always an xbox guy but got really into retro gaming over the last couple years. i finally got a ps2 about a year ago and then a ps3 6 months ago and have played all of the previous generation titles i never got a chance too. im currently price checking ps4s and trying to justify having two current gen consoles.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i try to keep up on games but i really don't have time anymore. the last game i played was tlou. and i'm posting here right now so i obviously loved it and am keeping up on news for the sequel. i'm going to seriously consider looking for a cheap deal on a ps4 and tlou2 when it comes out. but man, it's hard to justify. but it's either that or watch some guy play it on youtube and i don't want to do that either."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"if i were you i wouldn't just yet for one big reason, next gen of consoles are probably right around the corner, i wouldn't be surprised if ps5 and next xbox are shown at e3 2019, so it's possible last of us 2 will either be a launch title for ps5 or it'll be released on both consoles with an improved graphics version on ps5. not saying don't buy the ps4, just wait and see what the situation will be."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,gogo get the kingdom hearts bundle
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,im buying one on the weekend for persona 5. this is just icing on the cake for me
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,lol it's way more reasons if you think this is it
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i'm waiting for a price drop before i get one. i've only just got a ps3 for the exclusives and that was second hand.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"for real. i havent played proper video games excluding mobile games since like mac payne 2, and this makes me want to pick something up."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,might as well buy a ps4 pro or wait for the ps5 because i'm dead certain the last of us 2 will be available for both ps4 and ps5.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"yep, i bought mine 3 years ago all because i knew i would want kh3 and the last of us 2. its finally here."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,honestly about to do the same. had an xbox console all my life and have a kickass pc right now but that was absolutely amazing. can anyone here speak on the psvr? is it any good?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,just did it for this and god of war. worth it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"that dlc was perfect, just the right length, gave us some new stuff to do and was an emotional gut punch."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"honestly left behind was goty worthy in its own right. everyone should play it. but based on how relationships go in tlou universe, i'm worrying about that other girl"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it doesn't even matter, either. like, she's gay, so what. cool. back to the awesome gameplay footage."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm not surprised by that so much as ellie saying to coolasianguytm that he'll be back with her in a week, then openly kisses her..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i wonder how her sexuality is going to impact the story, if at all."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,pft people were still denying it. it was a kiss between friends was a common theme in threads about the dlc. as if its somehow unfathomable that a woman can be a lesbian.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,hopefully the romance has substantial relevance to the main game like mgs3 or uncharted and not some tacked on uninteresting subplot just to eat up more cutscene time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"eh. it makes sense considering the dlc for sure but i can see why some people are still surprised. i mean, if every girl who ever kissed another girl in their preteen years was a lesbian the world would be a very different place i'd wager. experimentation with sexuality seems to be a part of being teenager for many people and it's hardly a sure thing at that age. that said, ellie is a strong character regardless of her orientation and she's a badass now. normally, i'd be skeptical that they were shoehorning in the romance in most cases, but naughty dog does characters right. i'm sure all their inclusions add relevant depth to the story and the characters."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,or listened to her... like at all.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i just loved the callback from the ending from the dlc to the ending of the main story. being all poetic and shit.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"honestly, who cares about her sexuality. the game looks great!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"thats a good point. i was thinking the same thing and i didnt even play the dlc. i was thinking, i wonder if that was mentioned in the dlc? while i was watching this trailer. sad thing is that i own the ps4 version of tlou with the fucking dlc. now feel like even more of an asshole for never playing it. guess i need to go do that now..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i'm fucking ecstatic over this.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"haven't seen more than 30 minutes worth of anything related to the last of us, can someone explain the context please or is this something that would need quite a while to understand?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i am not surprised, just a bit mad that they spent 4 minutes on that instead of showing more gameplay."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it was just kinda weird they felt half the trailer needs to be devoted to it
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i kinda have a feeling that this is the new trend for a lot of characters recently. hey, look at x, but guess what, heshe is gaylesbian. feels a bit like the devs are trying to use this as a method to increase public attention. whenever i hear press talking about a character in a game, there is a high chance that it is gaylesbian. overwatch for example first came to my attention when suddenly everywhere ppl said that tracer would be lesbian..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i hope they take cues from the dlc where we can manipulate the infected into taking out our human enemies for us.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,but why the ridiculous cringe
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i don't think your sexuality is permanently defined at the age of 14. i have a female friend that dated 2 dudes, 3 girls and is now happily married to another dude. by that order. at some point she really thought she was a lesbian until she met the guy she married."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"tbf, ellie is probably put of by the idea of a male partner since that one dude from the first game tried to rape her.spoiler"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"no, it was subtle in the dlc. in this a statement is being made."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,who buys dlc?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"ellie's sexuality, in my unpopular opinion, was probably a conscious decision in order to address issues with people sexualizing her relationship with joel"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"you do realize that nobody is surprised by it, right? way to put words into people's mouths."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i didn't even realize it was the game until they showed ellie...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i don't think it was worth the awkward ten minute intermission.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the only reason i played it was because my playstation 4 came with it as a bundle. im so glad i did because that game is perfect.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,stop whatever you are doing and go play it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"omg, i actually got a ps3 a few months ago hadn't played a playstation since the original at my next door neighbour's house  we used to play a lot of twisted metal 2. i used to have an original xbox and played a lot of halohalo 2. anyways, i decided to get an old ps3 few months back and ended up guying the last of us for 5. i had no idea what it was about, but just heard that it had good reviews. i actually just beat the game about 3 weeks ago and it was absolutely outstanding. quite honestly the best game i've ever played. i fucking love ellie."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i played it about 6 months ago and was fucking shocked. it's the greatest game ever made.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i've put off playing through my fourth time for too long
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that running bottle grab and throw. wow.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"nd might've created a new 'class' of scripted gameplay tbh. assuming the trailer isn't being misleading, there are a lot of things going on very quickly. a ton of bandwidth and no discernable hitchingchaining in the animation, amazing stuff. i've also never seen that many concurrent scriptsai entities look so fast and simultaneously smooth. not without extreme corridor constraints to lighten the load. incredible work."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"first game was the same way. blew people away the graphics it had on ps3, me included."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it's really crazy to think tlou1 was ps3. 5 years ago almost to the day.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"just curious, why were you pissed? i didn't watch it"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,people have short memories.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"yeah, nd are masters at this sort of semiscripted sequence. i love it! like being in a movie. same in the uncharted games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"yeah i don't get the confusion. the trailer is impressive as hell and the dynamic bits like that one archer dying, dropping four arrows and ellie picking them up might be a bit scripted, but the general gameplay loop if you can call that with tlou in the trailer was 100 the stuff you'll be doing. heck, one of the upgrades you could get for joel was a big crafting speed increase, simply because you might need to craft that shiv right fucking now."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,maybe a little scripted... but the first game had some amazing sequences. if you played the first and knew what naughty dog is capable of this isn't much if any of an exaggeration
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"overall, you got a lot of camera control in the first game. i don't imagine they'll change that. gotta be able to keep an eye out for the 7,000,000 assholes they throw at you in a situation."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it is an entire media hub that can replace everything so long as you have internet access. sports, youtube, netflix, hbo, hulu, roku, amazon prime, spotify, plex, and usb playback. it also has a decent blu ray player that also plays 3d blu rays and dvds. doesn't play normal cds which is a bummer. all in all though it is pretty damn versatile machine."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"true, but have you seen uncharted 4?"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it's sad that people who enjoy playing stories in the shoes of others would lack such simple understanding
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,which is funny because she was gay in the last game. so they must be too young to remember and are shitting on a game theyve never seen
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"apparently you cant just have a genuine lesbian character in a game without people acting like its a big deal, its their own damn fault for automatically assuming ellie was straight."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,my guess is that the settlement she's with gets massacred. the last game involved tragedy.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,not a chance it's out this year

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,multiplayer in the first game was wildly underrated.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it was still rendered in game though right? so at least visually that was true to what we can expect when the game comes out
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,tlou came out 5 years ago and had smooth gameplay similar to this. i fully believe there will be plenty of combat gameplay with built in cinematic actions.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,has naughty dog ever not delivered the same experience they demonstrated at e3? ever? not once when i played uncharted 4 did i think that the game was not following the quality of the gameplay reveals. the player interacts with the game the same way naughty dog demonstrates. unfair statement to make there. i dont think you know as much as you think you do.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,why make the main character of an extremely popular and well reviewed game gay ? why make them straight? to me i think instead of risking alienating fans why not make he straight why on earth would you find the character being gay alienating? what is it about gay people that makes you feel you need some kind of safe space?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"so you are okay with the concept of being gay, but dont like the fact that the gay agenda is present in a game you like. the first thing to clarify is that this is ellies story, not joels. which means we will be learning her views and perspective. naughtydog is not pushing this just because of sjw, but also to tell a narrative. besides, even undoing what they did in the left behind dlc in this game will not undo that fact the ellie is still a member of lgbtq. if they made her love interest a guy for part 2, she would then be considered bisexual, and that would contradict her personality as it was already established in the first gamedlc. tldr even if they made her love interest a guy, it changes nothing in terms of storytelling. youll still be playing as a lesbian whether you like it or not."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i am straight and i understand the emotion here. two people having gone through tough shit falling for each other during a close dance. must be a personal problem of you.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,don't know why you were downvoted into oblivion. you were very respectful in your views. some people are easily triggered. but maybe ellie isn't a full on lesbian. maybe she's bisexual that would add another layer to the story. seems like her gf is bisexual.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"so you remember the last time they showed a trailer at e3 for the first lou? amazing details just like this one, details found nowhere in the actual game. are people really still falling for this?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,removed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"that was in the original last of us even on ps3, you shoot someone in the forehead and you can see blood flow. crazy how they managed that on such old technology."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"see the division i absolutely want this game to be as amazing and as detailed as it looks here, but i'm trying to temper my expectations"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you could already do that in the first one kinda right? i guess it looks a bit smoother here tho.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,maybe they mocapped shitloads of animations and just use them in general patrol animations.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i reckon they already have walking animations down. it's stitching together the movements that's ridiculously impressive here. it looks amazing. it's like prerendered cutsxene quality.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"when the baddies are at the door covering angles and especially when axe man comes around a corner raising his axe just in case. wow. i never felt so bad about a character killing an ai as the woman checked under the car and ellie pops her. damn, we finally here."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,youre not wrong...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"definately scripted, but the question is wether it is movementscripted in the game itself, or more like a rendered trailerstyle."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the e3 2012 reveal is still online and ellie throw a brick at a guy a joel runs him into the wall and bashes his head into a table. those are in the original game. you can throw an item at someone and if you have an upgraded melee or even with your fists you can do things like that. so please, state facts when you reply to someone. no need to spread misinformation."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"completely unexpected, but incredibly welcome."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,crafting specialty arrows and shit? colour me hyped
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,for the fucking bloaters
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"you get a exploding arrow and you get a exploding arrow, everyone gets exploding arrows!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i mean, he showed up in the first teaser, which takes place after whatever tragedy makes ellie go all murdery, so it's safe to assume he's at least fine following the initial tragedy."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,he was mentioned. the guy says to ellie your old man
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"hell if i know mate, i was also left waiting for his appearance. he was on the reveal trailer and was mentioned in this one tho, so at least we know hes alive."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,then eye remembered.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"been rewatching twd, i didn't really like glenn the first time through but episode to episode he's grown on me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"no, its just a dumb all asian people look alike joke."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,'i'm just gonna pick a random planet to land on...how about this one right here....cue jurassic park music'
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"definitely some scripted unrealistic stuff in here, just like their tlou 1 demo"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,square enix has already made 2 tomb raider games and they were great. the third game is probably very similar to those so if you liked the first 2 you're probably gonna enjoy shadow. also shadow is gonna release this year and last of us 2 is unlikely to this year so you can play both
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"and the hyper realistic face animations that the npcs did. they actually reacted to being attacked. also, that cheekshot when ellie was hiding under that car, blood started dripping from the wound on that woman's face. naughty dog has this magical quality where they can program 5 extra gpus into a playstation."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,based on hate i see it. some of those hits were vicious and bloodthirsty.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,can we highlight the hyper realistic wounds as well?!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,remember that the ai seemed like that as well during the original e3 reveal for the first one. but it was really dumbed down in the full release. i hope they fix it this time around.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,gameplay was so fluid especially true for melee. one of my biggest gripes with the first game was the clumsiness of the melee combat but it looked really cool in this trailer.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that's facts. it's poor boy szn
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the animation when the woman who checked under the truck got shot in the cheek was slick af. i'm pretty sure we won't get to see it ingame, but hell if we will i'll fucking lose my mind. that animation seemd to be specially made for a character crouching down, and getting shot in a specific part of the head. if there really are multiple headshot animations and different hitboxes in the head.. that's crazy."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i know i've played several games where the ai will call out commands to other npcs, like flank him left, or search here, etc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i assumed it was a seamless transition into a cut scene. with the ability to shoot when the option came. not hard for them to do
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yea the game will look and play well but all that stuff was b s just like the first demo of los 1.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"normally id think the same, but its naughty dog we are talking about. dont get me wrong im not saying that since its a particular developer, they cant go wrong. its a combination of factors. the gameplay demo of the first tlou had similar aspects great graphics and the expectations were met and great ai interactions. these ones werent completely met while it was possible in the final game to get people begging for their life, ellie helping you and the such, these things were really rare and not as groundbreaking as the demo made them look, and the general ai was actually quite bad. basically, they dumbed it down, supposedly because of technological limitations. then came uncharted 4 the gameplay demo showed a lot of amazing interactions, like nathan making his way through a crowd pushing people aside and saying sorry and similar things, or a lot of general small touches that felt really scripted im sure he doesnt push people like that in the final game, or you can just follow a single path but in the end the game was no less impressive than the demo made it look like. in fact, u4 already addressed what you said about people loosing you in the tall grass the system were enemies lost track of you but kept looking in your general direction worked really good. i think we can trust nd on this one the last of us became one of the most beloved games in recent history, and they already failed us with the first one as far as scripts and ai are concerned, then with u4 they showed us that with the ps4 they could actually improve greatly. i dont think they would show us such impressive feats because lets be honest, some small and big details in this demo require enormous thinking and attention if they werent sure they could pull this off. i think that what gives us the impression of too many scripted events and too many impossible things to actually implement is the missing parts of the hud and the fact that we dont know to what extent we are looking at gameplay or cutscenes. ill be clearer for example, the hidingunderthecarandbeingdiscovered part could just be a new feature, in the sense that when you are in that kind of open combat and you flee in the direction of certain vehiclesbuildings, you hide under them. then the rest is easy, you just have to implement animations and reactions so that the ai can look for you under cars and get spooked when they suddenly find you, and then can pull you out of you cover just like we saw. maybe theres even button prompts to hideaim and so on, but they removed them to make it look more seamless. maybe the big guy with the hammer was like a miniboss, and maybe theres a decent number of enemies like him they require more hits, have a more detailed combat style, have a finish him death and so on that would explain what we have perceived like a this guys interactions are scripted thing. a clear example of what i mean is the moment ellie pulls the arrow out of her shoulder couldnt we see the prompt to take it out, we would have thought of a scripted event, or maybe something like the far cry healing animations. the fact that the hud clearly shows you have to hit r1 if i remember correctly makes us understand that theres just a new bodydamage system that gives penaltiesrewards on healthstatus based on how fast or how slowly you take care of certain injuries. this makes for an incredibly realistic gameplay mechanic while being relatively simple and not too this wont be in the final game. with the acquired experience on ps4 its not too unrealistic to expect a lot of things that are little on their own but that make for an incredibly profound experience together take the healing system, just a little bit more of crafting maybe even just arrows, a hide under things system, a give the npcs names and whistles system and something like that and you get a game that plays a lot better than the first one. i loved the makingof video on u4 and the digital foundry analysis on the game, because it explained this kind of things for example, the enemies bodies had inertia so that when killed they would fall in the direction they were running, or away from the explosion that killed them. same goes for the dynamic foliage that reacted to explosions and wind at the same time. all small touches, but so many of them that the game feels alive. the kind of wow, technology! that makes you feel immersed even when its actually useless, like when we first saw that the ice cubes melted in metal gear solid. nd are my favorite developers and many of their games are among my favorites, but im not being incautious just because its them i wont shout masterpiece until ive played it. nonetheless, i am conscious of their capabilities and think that we shouldnt dismiss the demo as yeah it will be good but not as good as this just because it looks great. i think skepticism shouldnt be excessive when we talk about technology. sure, lets think i am not convinced yet, but not this is impossible, because many things wouldnt exist if the minds that made them thought it was hopeless. this will be particularly true in the next years when the first ps5 and xbox2 or whatever its called games will be presented im sure everything will give us this is watch dogs all over again kind of vibes, and caution will be necessary, but we should also have a little faith, because we will never know what we miss if we throw away everything as soon as it makes us think its too good to be true. im not saying all this just about what you wrote, i know you were just expressing sane skepticism, this wall of text is just my thoughts about all this and i felt like your comment was the best one to reply to. please dont feel attacked, i just wanted to say all this."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"eh hard to say, i wouldn't be shocked if they did that stuff regardless of where you hid... but it would be kinda strange considering how the ai fails to see her several times when clearly visible  hopefully they make the detection more sensitive otherwise stealth gameplay will be 2 ez."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,actually i watched a talk at a game developer conference regarding the last of us and the ai barks and conversations. they didnt have a ton of custom animations but the writers and actors made a ton of random scripted conversations guards can have that can get interrupted by noises from the player which then branches into a small search before the convo continues and different conversationcombat transitions based on when they find u during their conversations. they also made it so the ai will say things while they do stuff to give the imitation of tactics.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"if uncharted 4 is anything to go by, naughty dogs e3 demos are pretty much what the end game looks like"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"well, tlou was ps3 and old p this has had a lot of years to be built, so, never know."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that's pretty standard
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i would love if they'd put attention into these details, like naming every npc along the way."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,most likely ai changes the state depending on what happens and then one of the npcs calls the sound file.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"wouldn't be surprising, i mean the first tlou gameplay trailer was fairly scripted."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,have you not played the first one...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,just went back and watched it. it actually played very similar. the combat and moving mechanics are exactly the same. the big miss from tlou was the enemies didnt behave as intelligently as implied by the gameplay reveal.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm pretty sure it will, look at uncharted 4, the epic chase scene was exactly the same maybe even better in the final game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the only thing different from the reveal to tlou was the ai wasnt as smart, but the gameplay was basically the same, the melee fighting like picking up wooden bar and beating the shit outa people was just as dynamic as they showed in the trailers"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i doubt it. tlou1 went back and forth between human areas and infected areas. only in the dlc was there crossover between the two enemy types. im sure this was just a human area.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,im guessing certain areas are more developed while some are just infected havens
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i hope theyre still pretty integral to this one. i loved the infected characters in lou. it was so intense trying to evade and fight them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"if you remember the first game though, you spend a substantial amount of time figbting other survivors. this could easily just be a sequence without infected. although the idea that they may be dying of is interesting, and would honestly make sense."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,infected animals please
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i thought the gameplay part was a flashback? the chick is joking about ellie being terrifying, and then ellie thinks about she is, maybe, just a little bit, actually terrifying. i also thought it was funny that ellie thought a little bit of sweat was gross, but is more than familiar with having her hands full of literal gore."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,or tommy?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i think so. i'm 80 sure that's who he's talking about, he could also be talking about tommy but i doubt it. still, i want to see joel i know this games main spotlight is on ellie, and thats fine, but they can't just give us this grizzled bad ass we grew attached to for an entire game and then just make him disappear. i just hope he plays a bigger picture than what is being shown."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,he was in the other trailer. my guess is that they are separated and you play different segments as joel and as ellie.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,did i read somewhere it was 5 years later? putting ellie at 19 i think.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"easy there with the goty. left behind was like an interactive flashback in tlou. it was very cool for what it was, but there was one meaningful fight in the entire thing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i loved the dlc but calling it goty worthy is a little gas.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"considering ellie is wearing her bracelet when she stabs that dude in the neck, i'd bet a thousand dollars she dies. probably abruptly and brutally"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,people should worry less about ellie's sexuality and more about how she has the kiss of death.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"look at the bracelet shes wearing, then check ellies wrist in the gameplay segment."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,not to mention the bracelet the girl is wearing in the dancing scene is the same bracelet ellie is wearing when shes destroying everyone. unless theyre pulling a switcharoo and the fighting happens before the dancing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"lol goty worthy, i know people love to praise tlou and rightly so, its an amazing piece of storytelling but that statement is just riduculous, its a 2 hour expansion."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"maybe that dude will be our new joel? we've already got an openly gay protagonist, i'm down for an asian dude, next! btw ... did no one else think this place looked familiar? that bit where ellie hid under the truck ... a military checkpoint in the first game that you clear out as joel?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the actress who voiced ellie won an award for that dlc
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,apologies. i dont understand what your acronyms mean. i just bought my first ps4 last month and am only 13 through lou
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i'm worrying about that other girl is she real? i can't imagine ellie actually being nervous about being stared at unless she was worried they were going to rob them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"fuck her, joel is 1000000 gonna fucking die."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i mean....considering how out of nowhere and forced that was...seeing as ellie always referred to the girl in the stand alone game as a friend. never anything else. but, either way, its whatever."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,lmao no one else has mentioned this but that was what i was shocked by like damn ms steal yo girl i guess
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i thought of this after watching the trailer. the asian guy doesn't seem to understand why ellie's old man joel i hopeassume, maybe tommy assuming they're in colorado is so protective. maybe nobody knows of ellie's immunity. the play here is by her being a lesbian she wouldn't ever pass the possibly genetic immunity to children."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,there are literally hundreds of games and movies where the main point of the protagonist is to save and or get revenge for killing wifesignificant other. i highly doubt it's just about showing her being gay.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i wanted less gameplay and even more emotional story.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,why not show more gameplay in addition to the 4 minutes of story? it doesn't have to be one or the other.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm not the guy but my guess is because it was kinda meh. the new ip's were toss ups. everything cool has been shown before. we were just shown a little more, and lastly. why the hell wouldn't they at least tell us the state of ff vii remake. they know that's what people want to know about. but it's going to be used as bait for years to come. at least and official statement on the development would be nice."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"yeah, i get that, fully. this will be an incredibly unpopular opinion and i feel a bit weird expressing it as well because i know how much effort and quality naughtydog and the writers put in the game, but the ending felt a bit on the cheap side. joel lost his daughter, made a strong connection to ellie and now will do anything and everything to not lose her like he did his daughter. because of this plot point, i felt a bit annoyed that joel was then immediately presented with the most compelling reason ever to not protect his 'daughter'.. and obviously he was not going to give her up. it felt too much like a a scenario from a thought experiment. i didn't consider the ending a 'rough one', but i felt so damn angry that the character that most embodied the 'voice of reason' in this dystopialooking at the big picture, etc., marlenespoiler, ended up being the main antagonist. similarly, the people most equipped to progressing the 'greater storyline' that is, restoring the world and curing the virus, were reduced to helpless targets of violent kill animations."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,nothing beats the braindead nature of the stealth ai in far cry games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"in the new tomb raider gameplay, there was a part where two guards are chatting, she distracts one of them and kills the other, then the last guard turns back to the guy he was talking to and just goes a body! made me sad  too hard to just call him geoff and have his friend be sad when he dies instead kf just being 'alerted'?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"yeah, i'm gonna go ahead and say that just like the first game's insane reveal trailer, this doesn't represent typical gameplay."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"watered down as in, actually made it a system instead of a semi playable scripted trailer, like this one. naughty dog games are amazing, but they absolutely create a perfect play through of a section to show off their game, and it never quite actually works that way in real gameplay. still extremely impressive. but thats def the reality."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the thing about good ai is that it's based on cinematiclike direction. naughty dog is very very specific about having filmlike planners for the environments. it's not generic mashed together forest environment, but rather each area has a specific, almost choreographed environment where if you run along the path, their ai tends to work around it very very well. grass is placed in a way that it can be used to flank someone. cars are placed in a way that you can hop over one and quickly slide under the next. working around this environment, they can probably build environment macros that are specific scenery types that work better with their ai than others, but if you do weird things, the ai starts to fall apart. i think some companies are trying to build real enemy ai, but the problem is, a computer whose goal is to try to shoot you, can only get better by being more accurate and deadly, which makes it non realistic. real ai should be about knowing how to pursuit, but also being human enough to make mistakes. gta v is probably the best example of poorly made ai. and fallout 4. hard is literally just they can shoot you from really really far away with very powerful guns."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"thats because this was scripted gameplay. it's an advertisement, that's it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"true, but even if we only get half of what we see here in the trailer..it'll still be an autobuy for me. curious that we didn't get to see joel tho."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i kinda disagree mate, check herehttpsyoutu.bekblookec3vu. last struggle for the shotgun seems scripted, the rest was all as delivered, maybe the delivered version was better. and i finished the last of us like 6 months ago."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the final game had that.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i dont personally think this is a developer that we need to be concerned about. naughty dog has proven time and time again that they care about their games and are willing to put tons of detail into things. if this were ea, it would be different. however, on the contrary, this is a studio that has proven themselves as a true powerhouses within the industry over the years. i am pretty sure we will be fine."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"they've had a long time to work on this project. the learned what worked and what didn't with the first one. hopefully they've got it down to an art this time around. i know how these things go, and this almost certainly isn't how the final product will look. but god damn, that was fucking beautiful. even if you just take it for the features shown lying under vehicles, picking up objects on the move, using human shields. this game is going to be amazing."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it wasn't that far off. the cinematic fight that lead to the end was really the only thing that wasn't in the game. maybe the guy hiding behind the door as well. but short of that the combat was pretty much how i remember it. it's been a while though.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"odds are its not a bait and switch. the first one had incredibly impressive ai and voice cohesion in its trailer and didnt disappoint in the finished product, and theres no reason to doubt a sequel that naughty dog has spent years carefully crafting"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"in the gameplay from 2012, the animations are much more indepth, joel picks up a revolvers and empties the bullets into his hand, while in the game the animation is way less smooth. no misinformation here"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i just hope they keep the dynamic going somehow. a massive part of what made tlou so good was their relationship. it'd be a shame to see him sidelined massively in favor of new characters that tag along.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i'm thinking the game has flashbacks to whatever time this dance was and joel will be alive then. it'll follow ellie up until joel is killed and that'll explain the present of why she's killing people.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"besides the shotgun grappling near the end of tlou1 demo, pretty much everything in that demo could be replicated though. under the right circumstances, enemies do beg for their life like the end of the demo."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the shotgun at the end was scripted but what about the rest? enemies begging for life? ellie giving you a moment to attack by launching a brick? that all happens in gameplay.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i think some parts were scripted. for example the part where she shoots the girl in the cheek, if that was not scripted it's simply mindblowing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it's also amazing how the surroundings are integrated into the fights. like when ellie got thrown through the glass in the abandoned store! that trailer was fucking incredible to watch.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"naughty dog has this magical quality where they can program 5 extra gpus into a playstation. i was listening to a cool podcast a while ago about the history of naughty dog, and when they first made crash they put so much more into the game then the playstations memory was capable of handling. they had the console always spinning up the disc for the next chunk of data and sony was worried that would drastically reduce the lifespan of the console to mere weeks. luckily the part was super under rated in terms of durability and worked out fine but it was a really clever bit of programming from naughty dog to make much larger levels and have more polygons on the same hardware."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i hope they keep the arrow being stuck in you mechanic. it'd be awesome that if struck with an arrow, ellie has that animation to pull it out when you find an opportunity to stop moving."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i agree. that's not to say it was bad, and the combat still interacted with the environment well, but you have to remember e3 is where developers show the best they have. i believe the combat will still be great, though, and i do expect it to be greatly improved over the previous game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the only thing i recall changing was ripping the guns from enemies' hands.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it has to be scripted though, it was to perfect not to be."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"dollars to donuts they can just rng specific hit location and it will be fine. create hitboxes for different areas e.g. head, upper left torso, etc., and roll for a specific hit location and play through maybe 35 corresponding animations based on the rng. 99100 times, it'll be plausible. 1100 times, you had gun to cheek and it somehow plays an animation for a high center forehead shot. welp, you're playing a videogame."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"demos like this are generally scripted, so i think its actually something of a moot point regarding difficulty. its actually easier to script something like this than it is to get it to look cool naturally. even when a game can look as cool it does in the gameplay demo, its easier to control it directly."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"will be 2 ez i reeeally don't mind it being too easy. a game like this is less a game and more a movie. when the levels get challenging, the flow of the gameplay is halted and it makes for a chunkier experience. it's better to be able to breeze through it somewhat so that the pace is more natural."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the animations are way slicker than they are in the final game, which is something that happens in pretty much all naughty dog e3 demos. joel never picks up a revolver so fluidly and he never drops the shells into his hand like in the trailer and etc"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that's an interesting narrative take on it. i wonder if they would try to put a moral spin on it but i personally doubt they would.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"quick correction, ellie is not genetically immune, she is just infected by a strain of the fungus that doesn't progress past the first stage of infection. it is why the doctors needed to remove her brain in order to get a large enough sample of the fungus rather than just taking a blood sample."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i know its the apocalypse but im sure enough medical knowledge survived to do an artificial insemination procedure or two
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the play here is by her being a lesbian she wouldn't ever pass the possibly genetic immunity not enjoyably.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i think the girlfriend knows her immunity. i think that's part of the they're jealous of you line. she didn't strike me as an arrogant person who'd say yeah all those guys are jealous of you, because you have me and i'm so sexy and awesome and it didn't come across as a selfdeprecating joke. maybe that implies that more people know of ellie's immunity and that's where the jealousy stems from. or she just means they're jelly, cuz you're a super skilled killer., but that'd be just weird to say."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i like to imagine that i kissed a girl and i liked it played on a loop in your head till you acknowledged that you kissed a girl and you liked it. not that i think katy perry's little ditty is some lesbian anthem... it's just funny.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"probably because people don't usually say i hope this romance has a narrative about most heterosexual romance in games, maybe? just a guess, though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"why wouldn't i have the same concern? for uncharted 4, it was definitely concerning how nd would juggle the marriage of nate and elena alongside the newly introduced brother sam and rival rafe in the midst of another treasure hunting adventure while keeping things fresh and engaging. nd pulled it off then, and it remains to be seen if they can pull tlou2 off."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm aware. i just didn't want to make my post all about the labels so i avoided it. i'll be clear. she's a badass lesbian, and that's cool."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,but what did this have to do with the dlc that someone mentioned?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,he made errors in judgement
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"actually, i am the author of the book 'video game romances for dummies.' you should give it a read, it seems right up your alley."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"thank you. heterosexuals can just live their lives, but apparently gay people are political simply by existing. such horseshit."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i didn't say political.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"a child being attracted to an older male figure isn't that uncommon, why it's up to the adult to correct feelings they may be confused about. ellie could be attracted to him or another person, but that's not saying joel would reciprocate. whole other story. i think you meant depraved, not deprived lol"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,ok perhaps. any reason you can think of regarding why they decided to make her a lesbian?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"when i first saw it on stream i thought it was the coolest thing but then they said intermission and just thought ok that was cool, but not that cool"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"that is an excellent way of putting it. last of us blended a lot of the previous gen gimmicks seamlessly together and with such profound characters that it really blew me away the first time i played it. even five years later, it's still my personal choice for best game over all."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i figured it was ff7. that remake has been talked about for 15 years

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"as far as gameplay goes, uncharted 4 actually looked better than the e3 demos."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,they scream that it's forced and shoehorned in and i'm always like how?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i sorted by controversial and still don't see those type of comments
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm mostly a pc gamer but i bought a ps4 pretty much just for the exclusives and i'm so glad i did. the last of us was probably one of the best story games i've ever played. i haven't even got around to god of war yet, but that's next on my list. i never really preorder games but i'm 10037 going to preorder the last of us part 2. as for affordability, i bought my ps4 second hand on ebay for 150 and i have had no problems with it. it came with a fully working controller and all the cables, and cod infinite warfare came included i'm probably not gonna play it ever but oh well. i'm sure you could find one for at least the same price, maybe less. i'd try to avoid getting a ps3 as the games tend not to run as well or look as nice as the ps4, and future games will not be released to ps3. i still buy most games for my pc but ps4 has so many amazing exclusives that i had to buy a ps4 and haven't regretted it since."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"how many movies, tv shows, books, and hell even comics have a plot line that revolves around the main characters relationship with someone else? spiderman and mary jane, nathan drake and elana, even romeo and juliet. all of these pieces of media portray someone in love with someone else, it isn't the complete cornerstone of the story. but it is a good chunk of it. so just because a character is gay doesn't mean it's trying to be inclusive, they are just portraying a realistic human being with thoughts and desires."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,or other minority if you add up minorities and gay white people im sure youll get around 30 of the us population
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,withoit a gay main character or other minority in the storyline is it really a bad thing that most media properties have one minority?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it's hard to find any mainstream media these days without a gay main character or other minority in the storyline. yeah, and you know what else has a ton of gay people? real life."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,name one movie that made more than 500 million dollars with a gay protagonist
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"okay, and before these more recent media installments that are supposedly full of gay people, who has been primarily featured from the fucking dawn of the media until now? you expect every new game or show to cater to you because it has for so long."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this is factually incorrect. stop spreading bullshit lies please.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you would have no reaction if that time was spent showing heterosexual romance
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,she was gay when the dlc came out 3 or 4 years ago
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,like did they really have to make a we're gay and people stare at us plot in 2018? how dare the develop their characters to be akin to real people.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"if a minority or woman exists, it's always forced. i truly don't get these people."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,people like you make a bigger deal out of it than the lgbt community.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"in more states? if youre referring to the u.s., gay marriage has been legal in every state for....years...."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"but clearly your prejudice is showing. you view a gay character as not normal, a fad, catering. if her romantic interest was a man, all you would have said was this game looks amazing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it's a dumb thing for you to say. a craze? it's a time where it's being more accepted. people are opening up about it more. at the same time when video games are really about characters and stories. we're past the time when you needed a man with a gun on a box to sell a game. and developers are taking advantage of it. it's not a cash in craze, it's oh, more people are finally becoming less ignorant of playing as a girl or lgbt, finally. you have no proof the character designers at naughty dog made ellie a lesbian because it's a popular thing. what a stupid thing to say."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"damn, lets just only make games about straight white men then huh"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,kiss me already
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i am well aware, buddy."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"this doesn't make much sense, is wow bad because since you are neither an orc nor a warlock you can't connect? is nier automata bad because you are not a woman android? are the mario games bad because you are not a plumber nor italian? not to burst your bubble but there are not many games about boring dudes with boring lives that spend their life on the internet. so maybe you should stop gaming at all?"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,would someone please think about the straight men?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,uh... welcome to being a female gamer...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,how do you think all the gay people feel when all these games with straight relationships are being dished out? you dont they think they feel the same. let them have some representation.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i cannot play a game if the protagonist isnt a white straight guy youre a fucking idiot
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,seems forced because you dont like it. there will never be a day where a game can have a gay protagonist without it feeling forced upon you because you wont admit your prejudices. am i hitting the mark? inb4 no
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,can you actually name another gay main protagonist in a game or are you just talking out of your ass?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"seems forced. translation i cant provide a single good reason to explain why its bad other than i personally dont like it, so im going to weasel out and be as vague as i possibly can."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,seems forced they have literally been planning this since before the game even came out.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,everybody also does a lot more straight white male stuff. you gonna complain about that stuff being forced too?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"of course they are referring to ellie being a lesbian, they are thinking that naughty dog made her a lesbian only because these days everybody is talking about diversity, instead naughty dog made it pretty clear in the last game's dlc itself that ellie is a lesbian....."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"witcher 3, assassins creed unity, bully, mass effect, uncharted  to name but a few. you are overexaggerating to an absurd degree. roughly 9 minutes of the video is gameplay footage of exploration and brutal violence. you're getting upset over a kiss that lasts if i'm being generous upwards of 10 seconds? at what point did ellie almost beheading people demonstrate her lesbianism? you're acting very entitled."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i feel you. i wasn't happy with the ending at first. it took me a couple of says.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"totally. i mean how else is a 14 year old girl going to murder a large man accustomed to hyper violence? it just felt so fucked to be a part of it, as the player. like i wanted her to be okay and not have to do those things to people. im glad they made a game that made me feel those things, though. never experienced it before, and havent since."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"most stealth games honestly, like oh my god one of our guys is over here with his throat cut, we need to look around for at least 30 seconds before going about our day!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it definitely did, i was holding up a guy who had a stick and when he heard my gun click he said, oh, someone's out of ammo and rushed me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,definitely. guess im just a little jaded. naughty dog has produced games that made me feel connected to the characters. the pure rage i felt at the last level of the first game.. i went from a playthrough with no guns used to just blasting every single piece of shit in the facility.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,they don't care about their games' multiplayer after release though. yes i'm upset at the lack of multiplayer support for uncharted 4.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"well, buddy, to be honest, they've made 4 straight games in the same series that i found to be absolute dogshit. last of us was fine but uncharted 14 are complete ass. the only thing i respect about them are the visuals. the newer tomb raider games did what they were trying to do but a lot better."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,picking up objects on the go was a huge feature that i loved seeing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"to add a disclaimer, i did play the first game and absolutely loved it. i bought a ps3 just to play it. just picked up a ps4 recently due to bf2 and that was just fking trash. i guess you can call me a lifelong gamer who has been disappointed time and time again. seeing what sony has shown  cyberpunk has given me hope. really, really hope they pull this off and not scripting stuff."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,his name should be enough
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it was a great day when i realized you could kill clickers with bricksmashing to the face. not bottles, though... i guess naughty dog doesn't realize how hard beer bottles actually are to break."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,in brick we trust!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,impressive ai walks around on predefined patrol route.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i mean it was a really immersive ai but they were kinda as dumb as it comes from time to time. especially the part that nobody seemed to notice ellie is still one of the few things that bother me with the game. i really wonder if we will play most of the game solo now or if it was just this scene. i would really miss all those small interactions between ellie and joel.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"joel picks up a revolvers and empties the bullets into his hand you didn't say that in your original comment. next time be specific. that animation being removed was for the better. why would i stealth choke someone only to get seen because i stood up to individually remove bullets from a gun. that was actually the best thing they didn't add. no misinformation here  yes it is if you don't specify. everything in the e3 reveal was in the game except for the ending shotgun animation because it was different in game and getting the ammo from the gun. so yeah, you did speak misinformation."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i made that mistake my first play through. biggest regret so far. i just...let my boyfriend find out on his own. hilarious.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i didn't quite understand that bit. isn't the girl she's dancing with together with another guy and she used to be the asian guy's jesse? girlfriend? wasn't she the person ellie and jesse talked about? or is that another person? but why is that girl so abrasive to jesse then? maybe i just didn't pay attention well enough, but before the kiss and kind of even during the kiss i thought she's ellie's drunk bestie, who just fools around a bit, because i thought she was with jesse and now she's with the other guy."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,goddammit this is why we can't have nice things.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that asian guy said your old man really tore into me. joel confirmed!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,they referred to ellies old man in this gameplay reveal. we can assume joel is alive and well
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"been confirmed joel is in the game, and alive. no visions."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,after this trailer im not so sure its joel she is in a murdery rage about as much as its the girl she kisses
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yeah i was loving how we saw ellie finesse through the map. it would have been epic to see joel just kind of brute force his way through a couple of the enemies just so we truly grasp the contrast between the two.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"yup. you just very rarely run into those situations, because you're either not gonna fuck with most of the enemies, if you can avoid them, or you turn the game on easy mode and just turn it into a fun shooting gallery d"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"definitely had a lot of scripted elements, much like the original the last of us gameplay trailer from e3 2012httpsyoutu.be8zykj0glnqs still, looks incredible"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i am a huge fan of naughty dog and the last of us but i find it hard to believe that 90 of that wasn't scripted. and i expect them to downgrade the graphics a tiny bit too. i really hope i'm wrong and that trailer was actual gameplay though. fingers crossed.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"that grab and drag out from under the truck? almost certainly scripted. willing to bet that part is scripted, and that little truck scene connects the two normal fighting areas."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,they even did this in tlou. if you haven't played it yet you're in for a fucking treatttt.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"just how accurately they model where shots land is impressive. how each shot lands with purpose in a precise location and is then represented precisely on the body. every shot and every swing of the sword had weight to it and resulted in a wound that actually effected the movement of the npc. this is exactly what ive been waiting for in a combat system and a lot of people might think they just painstakingly put that together. but it really looks like they just opened up the door for how we look at combat in a video game. if they actually pull off the final game with what we saw today, theyre going to change the industry."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i don't think the hardware was the issue though. the demo on that same hardware looked amazing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,at some point you gotta remember it's a game. if you want the ai to be super realistic this game would lowkey be impossible to stealth through at all.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,oh yeah i forgot that that was something they originally had in the game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"no, there was so much more that they ripped out, like enemies waiting to ambush you without it being scripted and enemies rushing you once you ran out of ammo when they can hear your gun click."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yeah this seems most likely to me
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,there he is! open fires blindly
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the original crysis.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"cutscene is the wrong word, i just don't know the right one. more like a qte i guess?? so it's a completely scripted moment right once you crawl under. idk"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,just rewatched the first trailer and it didn't even show his face so idk what you're talking about he didn't age. and if he was a ghost and he had nothing to do with the fight idk why he would be holding a gun.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm on a bit of a budget, i just built a killer pc but i can't stay away from all these playstation exclusives. so, i guess i'll wait for a couple of months and buy the pro version."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i might just die if joel gets killed off.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,thanks! ok now my personal urban dictionary is more complete
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,should it be tlou?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,so why could she walk through the spore sections with no mask on?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,couldnt she just go around biting everyone so they dont become infected with the original fungus?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"where was this said? it wasn't in the game, and she's the only person to have been infected with that strain? without a cannon source, i'll stick with immunity"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"no, ellie actually has or had, if they're changing things an immunity. her body caused the virus to mutate. i find ellie kissing someone important, as it was suggested that she could still pass on the virus by biting others."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,wait so if she got bitten again would she be zombified or still no?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,don't forget that in the first trailer with the guitar we see that she's been bit again but around the collarbone area if memory serves me right
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the ollllllllllllllllllll' turkey baster trick.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that'd be really dark.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"nice, so you managed to write a shitty book with bad reviews. good job! i made a book teach your child how to read in 100 easy lessons. i think it fits you perfectly"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i have no issue with any character in a game. merely stating that these 2 sites absolutely love to politicize the shit out of gay characters in movies, shows, and games constantly. apparently they migrate here too. you're politicizing it, jackass."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what statement is being made then? please elaborate
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the point you're making here and elsewhere is that it's being shoved in people's faces, but aren't way more heterosexual relationships shoved in peoples faces? you start the first game as a daughter running around a house looking for her dad. the point i'm making is that you're acting like her being gay is a statement when it's just reality, and when you point that out but ignore the straight relationships, you're acting like one is ok and one isn't."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"whoops, autocorrect! thanks!"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what the fuck you can? god dammit
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i suspect that was because trying to slave an npc to the player's momenttomoment totally unpredictable movements and have that npc's movements capable of breaking stealth for you is utterly unworkable from a game enjoyment perspective, especially in higher difficulties remember, the game is basically one giant escort mission, haha. is the same reason why i almost always avoided traveling with companions in skyrim. imagine being on one of harder difficulties, where you've had to really conserve resources to survive, successfully stealthing your way through almost an entire particularly difficult section, only to have ellie go in a random direction other than the one you want because the ai pathing says to, thus breaking your cover and forcing you to either waste those precious resources or start the area all over again. it's one thing if the player stuffs up and breaks their stealth then you're just mad at yourself, but an npc doing it is just infuriating. again, looking at you skyrim  carefully avoid a trap, then npc follower just walks straight through and triggers it, ruining your attempt at stealth and bringing everyone running on that note, no idiot companion, sniping with bow and arrow from stealth does not mean it's time to charge into melee if they're only wounded and get in the way of my followup killing shot!   yes, it can lead to some silly moments breaking immersion with ellie in plain sight of totally oblivious enemies, but it's that and be an otherwise fantastic game, or marginally more realistic, but far far more infuriating, if not almost gamebreaking in parts."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"for sure, but for a game that's clearly going for realism that was a low point in the trailer for me  again assuming it's not superscripted and considering the last one i doubt it was much it's way better than just about every other game ai but still..."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,show me literally one instance of either site being mad that there's a straight couple in a video game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"and the vast, vast majority of romance in media isn't gay either. around 10 of people are gay, yet like 99,999999 of romantic representation is media is straight. finally having gay representation in mainstream media shouldn't be met with that's pandering, they're just queer baiting, they're just sjws. when in fact, it's just representing people as people actually are, some of which are gay 10 of people are gay, of course there will be gay people in stories edit it's hard to know exactly how many people are actually lgbt and how many are out, but at least 3.5 of americans arehttpswilliamsinstitute.law.ucla.eduwpcontentuploadsgateshowmanypeoplelgbtapr2011.pdf and 20 of millennialshttpswww.nbcnews.comfeaturenbcoutsurvey20percentmillennialsidentifylgbtqn740791"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"yeah, this is one thing that ticks me off about the criticism of tlou. the developers knew this was an issue, but the alternative was far worse. i'd much rather have the occasional jank of an enemy ignoring an ai companion than have to worry about them fucking up my attempts at stealth, any day of the week."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"just saw that it doesnt seem very hard to empty a revolver while crouched. probably so, but that animation seemed unnecessary in the end tho. it's just like when ellie removed the arrow...it's cool to see but is that going to work in the game tho? what if i get hit with 3 or 4 arrows, will i remove each one? that's the same question with that revolver animation, why would i want to do that for every revolver in the game just to get 1 or 2 bullets. by removing it, you're not losing anything."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"not who you replied to, but i think joel is such an important character that they'd really have to pull off something amazing, storywise, to just write him out like that. for the sake of transparency, i haven't played all of the original game but i've seen enough to know how well the two characters work together from a story point of view."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"except that's a shitty excuse and having your partner never be in genuine danger during gameplay completely betrays the concept of the game same with bioshock infinite and god of war. re4 was an escort quest for 2rds of the game with a highly vulnerable partner and they managed to still make it fair, fun and skill based. of course, re4 didnt emphasize stealth, but if you cant make those two elements of your game work together maybe the entire concept of the game is flawed. and what amazing next gen ai did they use to make re4 work? they made ashley stick to your ass like glue when following, stay exactly where you told her to when waiting, and made enemies prioritize capturing her over killing her. turns out a simple approach can work wonders with some critical thinking. other elements of the combat system support the escort quest design too, like a lack of hitscan enemies."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,if that's an issue for you then i wonder how you felt about ellie basically shrugging off bullet wounds and an arrow hole in her shoulder.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,something that game did very well that i hadn't ever experienced was the mixing of churchytype music with gunplay. it just fit in so well. using a silenced ak and putting a few rounds into someone's skull while in the background can be heard let the water wash away your sins... it just worked. it helps that the ost in fc5 was pretty spectacular as well.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,i honestly don't think i'm emotionally ready to play this game. it took me forever to play through the first game after multiple restarts. not because it was a terrible game  it's probably my favorite  but because the first game's story and melancholy atmosphere kept wrecking my fucking world. i have the ellie edition preordered. i very rarely preorder games  and never a 230 preorder. but jesus christ that preorder is one of the best i've ever seen. and this series has such a special place in my heart. this game... i'm just not ready for it.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"man... the blatant homophobia that exists in this sub. i know that as gamers, we're toxic by nature, but i also like to think that those of us who dont waste our lives on mobas have a bit of civility and tend to lean progressive. what the hell is the issue guys? leaks never tell you a story, and whoever did leak the game more than likely did so with a homophobic agenda, trying to get people to voice their discontent over plot point x or y. i've avoided most of the spoilers, save for the fact that there is a homosexual relationship involving ellie. ...but again i have to ask, why the hell is this such a big problem? if there is something else that was seen in the leaks, then why not take those things with a grain of salt, as nd have said that the leaks werent wholly accurate. there could have easily been someone intentionally trying to make the game sound bad. i dunno. but then again, as someone who played the original 20 years ago, i loved the hell out of the ffvii remake... if peoplr want to be salty and hate things to hate them, i suppose that's on them. but hating people for loving who they love? people arent things. dont hate people for such frivolous and trivial reasons. i'll take my downboats off the air, thanks ira."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,this is a console exclusive and not the game of a generation. it looks poised to be the game of the lgbt community though. but great job the cinematic style of the game certainly fits what you were going for.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"the first game is maybe my favorite game and im still very much looking forward to this one. if the story was the worst ever made, i could just skip the cutscenes. 99.9 of my enjoyment of the first one was from actually playing the game, not watching the movie clips. i dont even think the story in the first one was all that great, pretty generic. but im pumped as hell to play the second one."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,i mean the leaks are true. what happens is true. thats enough for me. im actually sad at how relieved i am that the leaks happened and i commend the leakers. im assuming they didnt want their fan base who have been waiting a while for this to buy what sounds like something trey parker and matt stone would put into a south park episode. hey!! first gold thank you!

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,actually i think it needs to move to more spots. currently it just looks like it is going back and forth. but if make it to 3 spots it gives an illusion of flow.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"atleast the gameplay looks good, story seems to have been trashed by unwanted consultants."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,you don't know how well the story is done.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"!abby, the daughter of one of the surgeons that joel killed tracks him down and kills him, ellie then tracks her down and kills some of her gang, you then play as abby for something like 13 of the game and in the end you, playing as abby, beat the shit out of ellie and leave her for dead, it's implied that ellie's friends will seek revenge on abby.! all of this is confirmed btw, i've watched about 2 hours of leaked clips."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,the people who were looking forward to the game were disappointed that !the main character is being killed off.! that was the big scandal.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,to me i don't care the ellie is a lesbian but what i do care about is that she's a lesbian with a straight character. abby looks weird but imma not talk about it. the story is so awful that i'm glad it got leaked
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"why is it that whenever people state their legitimate concerns about a game or whatever, there's always the whiteknight that needs to whip out this argument. there's so much else to be concerned about from the game and from naughty dog itself. try again."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,shes fucking jacked its hilarious. you go enjoy being lectured at by a video game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,i am not saying thats bad i just hate it when video games become political but it will be bad because of that
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"its a post apocalyptic hellscape and every day is a struggle for survival. what should i do? i know, ill get a wicked sleeve tattoo that looks totally awesome."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,hey! he has a different opinion!! downvote downvote downvote
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,surprise in a good way? i've been avoiding the leaks like the covid19
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"the leaks are quite revealing. without spoiling anything, the fans are gonna be angry."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,1.5 hours isn't a massive amount by a fucking longshot
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"well i appreciate you not spoiling it and offering some insight. i'm still set on playing it, so hopefully going in with an open mind still lets me enjoy it. that being said, i will start to dial back my assumption that the criticism is coming from a place of homophobia however, there is an unfortunate amount of posts that do exhibit that exact behavior. i am hopeful that you're correct and it is genuinely criticism of the gameplaynarrative that was leaked."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"yeah, someone else has informed me than it's more than what i've heard but as i responded to the other user, i have seen homophobic sentiments creep up in some.posts that are decrying the sequel as garbage. but now i know that probably isnt the majority, and i'm just hoping that the game is as good as i have faith that it is. if not, definitely my loss."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,i see we have a sophisticate in our midst.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"i specifically said i didnt see the leaks, and my other responses have cemented that fact as well as shown that i am open to being wrong about the situation."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"true, but damn a little co star recognition."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,!not for long though.!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,considering the majority of the arguably terrible plot points have been leaked.....playing it at this point is moot unless you enjoy losing money.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"!ellie doesn't die. the leak i saw made it seem like abby spares her and dina. also the part where you play as abby fighting against ellie looked weird as fuck for me. i couldn't help but root for ellie watching it, especially when the player makes a wrong move and dies.!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,i dont really feel like this is worth the firestorm its getting. i mean its the only spoiler i read but the ambiguity of everyones moral compass in the first game is gonna create waves. id be interested in exploring it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,so you know all that investment you put into the characters in the first game? out the window.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,hope you didn't enjoy all the character development of the last one
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,just imagine game of thrones season 8 and youve got a pretty good idea.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,don't watch game of thrones season 1 then.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"90 of games are political... cod, mgs, cyberpunk, mass effect, wolfenstein, the list is basically endless."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,if you think tlou1 wasn't political you didn't pay attention.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,nearly every game have somekind of political message. and no you guys said the same about battlefield and in the end it still sold millions. you just crying its not your political viewpoint they are showing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"nah, you're just fine with politics in games as long as you agree with them, you just have a kneejerk reaction to people who are different from you getting screentime and use a dislike for politics as an excuse."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"you must've hated fallout. and bioshock. and oh man, you're going to fucking loathe cyberpunk when it comes out this fall! politics everywhere, from capitalist critiques to genderbending fluidity and racial commentary. at least you'll always have mario, i suppose. though maybe the super crown powerup that spawned bowsette killed that franchise for you? damn those identity politics! man, it's tough trying to avoid 'politics in games.' might be easier to stop nitpicking and just enjoy the game. what did gamergaters used to say? it's about ethics in journalism, they should only talk about the gameplay, right? maybe you in particular should just focus on whether the gameplay is fun. and, like, actually play the game before judging it."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"ehh.... well i really don't want to ruin it for you seeing as how the game means a lot to you. after reading this series has such a special place in my heart. this game... i'm just not ready for it i just feel so bad because damn.. you are less ready for it than you realize. you may want to block replies from this post because of how commonplace the leaks are now. there's tons of memes being made about it as well. i loved the last of us but as for tlou2, it's very clear they went more for shock value and agenda pushing rather than making an actually compelling story that could be universally enjoyed."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"not really, if you're upset at the leaks you don't actually know why the first game was good. fuck the fans who just wanted a happy go lucky romp with joel and ellie."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"as far as leaks go, regarding essential plot points, i would definitely keep my opinion. probably could have reworded it regarding gameplay though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"the choices that were made are mind boggling. they represent the unfortunate new trend of a self absorbed parasite retconning others hard work. maybe the gameplay is great and the story can take the back seat. i personally wasn't too impressed by the initial game, so i have no initiative to spoil it for others. however, the choices that have been made are questionable at best. there are a million ways to subvert an audiences expectations and emotionally manipulate them to help the medium. instead, the new direction seems to ask the userbase to take a mighty whiff, because the self installed sycophants say your flatulence is sublime."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"didnt nd say those leaks werent exactly on point? edit i havent seen the leaks, but i saw that nd said they werent all accurate"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,ive avoided leaks so i guess ill just make my own decision when i play it myself.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"just because it got leaked and you heard of what happens, doesn't mean that you get to spoil the game for others. i read the leaks and i know what happens and i'm conflicted on how to feel about the game, but i'm mature enough not to spoil it for anyone and i'm letting people experience the game for themselves,  make their own opinions on the game when it comes out. so please stop ruining the fun for others"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"source? i think she did, or if she didnt, druckmann is still her simp so her stain is still on the game, the leaks are proof of that."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"!i know, that's why i said abby leaves her for dead, in the state ellie was in after their fight she would definetly die from her injuries, but it is fiction so you never know.! !i also have no idea how they intend to make us hate ellie to the point of wanting to kill her, that whole bossfight felt so out of place, but i'll reserve my whole judgement for the full release.!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,!we don't know the exact ending. some say that ellie recovers after abby spares her and dina and a few months later goes to kill her and does end up killing her. the new trailer with ellie straggling someone i in favor of this. others say that after ellie recovers she does go after abby but that is the game over and it just sets up ellie as the villain for the next game with abby still alive. i guess the game will try hard to set up abby as a good person and the homophobic cult will probably be used for this as a moral punching bag. !
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"the problem is to create that ambiguity their rewriting what actually happened in the first game. thats such lazy, hamfisted writing its not gonna create waves, its just gonna piss of the fanbase."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"!joel is killed is a very humiliating way. he is redesigned as comically evil looking and retconned as just a murder whereas the ending of the original was morally ambiguous. neil wants to get the point across that you were wrong if sympathized with in the ending of the first game. and abby is a complete asspull being steroid level buff and carefree training in a gym amidst a zombie apocalypse. for me personally, this controversy has little to do with the story itself and the fact that the director is intentionally doing this to spite his fanbase.!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,exactly how?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,and they do away with it using pc bull crap
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,or season 1.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,the reaction was very similar at the time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,doom eternal isn't political.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"just because the game mentions politics doesn't make it a political shipwreck where they force opinions down your throat. like wolfenstein includes nazis, are they trying to make you a nazi when you play wolfenstein, no of course not."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,no its just they killed off some good characters and naughty dog has been treating their employees like shit
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,well first of all i would like to say good argument but when a game kills of characters to be more woke i just think its a bit stupid especially since these characters are so good and have had lots of development to kill them off just isnt the right thing to do
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"nobody deserves to be represented in media. its about picking the characters you need to tell the story. i suppose they certainly make for a unique story. it wouldn't have been a problem and well recepted if it did not deviate so starkly from part 1. people were looking forward to see the story of their favourite character unfold. there was one metal gear solid game featuring raiden as it's main character, one. then they went back to solid snake. i am sure the game will find it's audience, but if you alter your franchise a good chunk of the audience you attracted to that point will have opinions."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,turning an entire group into a caricature for woke points is a rotten thing to do.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"happy go lucky romp? is that what you really think people want? i'm imagine people want to see joel get a good send off, and ellie growing old with her partner until the end of time. sure sprinkle in some hardships, epic fights, and survival scenarios in there for good measure. they could even go down a story piece of crazed red necks hunting them to use them for breeding pods or something. this could have easily been a slam dunk, but not only are they ruining the characters, but they are forcing you to play someone you should hate."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"lol, the lengths people go to just to virtue signal."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,nd has been lying about the leaks. just saying.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,even if only a few were wrong still makes for a terrible story all around.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"go for it, i just hope you aren't completely disappointed like i am in the end."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,their rewriting what actually happened in the first game. fucking where?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,the first one's writing was incredibly cliched and predictable. writing isn't their strong suit despite the praise that gets heaped on them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"!also he just hates joel apparently, the dude that spits on him is literally modeled to look like himself!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"well, joel kinda is the villain in the eyes of the world. he literally killed a bunch of people and stopped the development of a cure for his own selfish desires. to save his daughter. x200b it is a very emotional and romantic setting, but looked at objectively, he could be labelled as the villain, depending on the viewpoint."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,can't say without spoilers.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,loving the mask occasionally slipping with the whiners lmao
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,it is though. at a bare minimum it's a rejection of the makyr's subjugation of people seen as lesser by them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"please think before you speak ahahahah. are the creators of last of us trying to make you lgbt? no lmfao. are they trying to make you christian? also no. it's a story dummy, just like every other political game. just because something includes lgbt main characters doesn't mean the creators are trying to convert people. silly on soo many levels."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,you said in your comment you don't like it because of political messages and now it's suddenly the crunch and the killing of some characters.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,ever heard not to judge a book by its cover?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,you know you're an idiot when you think not wetting your pants over an unreleased game is virtue signaling.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,everything that upsets my narrative is lies and virtue signalling
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"well i'll wait for a source a bit more credible than udephire from reddit, if it's all the same to you."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"well, i suppose i'll just use my sony rewards points to buy the game, and if it turns out not great, nothing lost. but having not seen the leaks, i'm going in very optimistic. i trust nd to make a good game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,me too man
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"he could be labelled as the villain, depending on the viewpoint. nah. it's an extremely manipulating story because it's a pseudo dilemma there is no even remotely realistic scenario where you can justify killing an innocent person because of good intentions. at how many people killed would development of a cure be worth it? even if it's only one person, doctors scooping around an innocent person's brains will always be murder. but you don't even know that it would take one person and you never know that in an remotely realistic scenario it would take one person. killing ellie for the cure is more of a thought experiment than anything would you kill an innocent person because someone else promised you something? literally the last person we know who used to chop people open for the better of mankind was josef mengele."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"i've read the spoilers and it's kinda weird how people have played the game already and knows that everything is bad about the game. it's almost as if the choices that joel made in the first game actually has consequences...but games shouldn't have that tho, right?  it's just weird how people have already played the game and can say it's bad. i'm still lost at that...but i'm not shocked that people are judging something without playing it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"you realize people can dislike the game for different reasons, right?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,have you seen the leaks? i dont think what happens to a specific person in the story is good. its down right atrocious how they handled it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"the game is gonna be garbage anyways whether or not it has political opinions forced in, the story is all kinds of wack. now go on and preorder your golf game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-19,i would like to apologize but i dont like when video games talk about politics right now because after a period of time the message just doesnt work and also i bought the bioshock remastered trilogy and it really good and im about to beat the second game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,they assumed shes trans because she's muscular and refuse to be convinced otherwise.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,you write that like that's not okay. they get to have an opinion about a work of fiction.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-21,"1. there seems to be a lot of lesbian, because reasons happening in the storytelling. maybe i'm in a minority of gay people, but i don't appreciate sexual orientation being used hamfistedly as a selling point. many of us have fought long and hard to be treated just like everyone else, only to have shit loads of bad will stirred up by a bunch of people often not gay that seem determined to force unpleasant portrayals of being gay onto audiences that have made no bones about expressing how unreceptive they are to that. this is practically antigay propaganda as it stands. 1. as i state in my other comment, the devs are totally unconstrained in designing characters, and in abby they've literally given us a monster. what am i supposed to think about that? there's a huge difference between writing a story that is challenging and a snuff flick. we've all seen the gratuitous violence, we've all seen the killing of dogs spruiked as feature. who are these sickos writing this stuff? why would i want to put myself in the position of participating in what currently looks like a brutal violence on rails experience? this looks disgusting. 1. all of this is based on confirmed leaks, and other material. it is certainly possible that there's more to the story than what's already in the public. it doesn't look good though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,not sure how that would be identical but ok?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,getting a large amount of the story plot points isn't judging the book cover now is it?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,the leaks speak for themselves
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"they said the leaks were only a couple of screenshots. yet there is 2 hours of leaked game footage available on the internet. using your own eyes is pretty credible enough, imo."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,i trust nd to make a good game ahhhh i remember thinking like this. now i know better.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,oh you sweet summer child....i do hope you enjoy the game but i think you should wait for the reviews before buying it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,there is no even remotely realistic scenario where you can justify killing an innocent person because of good intentions what about killing lots of people defending their home in order to save someone from sacrificing themselves?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"in italy they had to decide who gets to live because they were lacking ventilators. so basically they let people die to save others. is it morally wrong to kill someone? well, most people would say yes, for good reasons. but if there is an extinction event, and you could save humanity as a whole by sacrificing one person, the situation changes. the thought experiment of saving one, or saving many has been done quite often, and imo there is no correct answer. thats why i said he is the villain, depending on the point of view. he might have doomed humanity, and thus is a villain. at the same time he stood with his morals and protected whats important to him, making him the hero. he also killed a bunch of scientists and guards though. in the end, there is no actual good or bad in this post apocalyptic world. its everyone for themselves."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,it is not even a 'cure vs a person's life' dilemma. they don't have any cure  they just have one person with funny brain chemistry that is somehow immune or at least highly resistant. and if their first idea is 'let's kill her and root around in her brain' then i doubt they have any researchers competent enough to have even a remote chance to develop a cure.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"oh no, consequences are fine. honestly joel not dying would have been unexpected to anyone not currently sucking on their toes.. storytelling can be pretty simplistic, and people writing for videogames are usually not laureates. you sacrifice the hero character if they have something to die for, especially in a sequel. i'm just confused why they decided to have the climax from the villains perspective. the beginning, middle of the story? cool choice, nice small sequence. but the whole end? this is no empire, it is a video game that people waited 7 years for. if they have an expansion in the pipeline, they should announce that now and quell everyone's fears. if that is coming out in 1 year then this is actually fucking brilliant, but i highly doubt that. imagine generating this much hate and getting to play as ellie again, it is too genius to be true."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"i do, doesnt make it any less amusing when i actually see someone whining about these nonissues edit three comments in and hes whining about the gays being shoehorned into video games, this community is hilarious"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,you don't know how they handled it. you saw it without buildup of context
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,deleted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-21,"i don't appreciate sexual orientation being used hamfistedly as a selling point. didn't seem hamfisted to me. she's a lesbian living her life. if they replaced the girl with a guy this wouldn't even be conversation. it's not like they are preaching equal rights or something like that, it's one minor characteristic of the character. you called this a brutal violence on rails experience, have you played the first last of us? it's pretty violent. in abby they've literally given us a monster. what am i supposed to think about that? in the leaks it implied that spoilers joel killed her father. she wanted revenge and she got it. i don't think that makes her monster, but if that's you opinion, why is that a bad thing? anyone has the capability to be a monster. i also want to point out that the leak only gave us a vertical slice of the story. we don't know everything that leads to those events. your opinion of how the characters are handled might be different with the scope of the full story."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"its a game. you are meant to play it, not read a plot synopsis. also, why is playing as someone you might hate a bad thing? no one complains about star wars games where you play as the empire."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"well, but that would require me to actually look at the leaks, and i'd prefer to be surprised as opposed to having it ruined  and regardless, i'm talking about the leaked list of 'plot points' that apparently got out. nd has said that isnt an accurate list. as far as screenshots or videos... well i'm patient enough not to have jumped on that stuff."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,i'll learn this time if i'm wrong. for now i've not been proven wrong with their games i've played
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"nah. i dont much trust reviewers. they would have at least a few that i used to read told me to avoid ffviir, and i loved that game to pieces. i also tend to be pretty open minded about where writers take a narrative. i run a tabletop rpg game and write my own content, and sometimes it doesnt agree with people, but that's okay. this just isnt the story for you. no harmed feelings. if it's the story that nd wants to tell, i'm going to respect the creative process. edit i appreciate the wellwishes though!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"in italy they had to decide who gets to live because they were lacking ventilators. first things first, a bit off topic but this is a proven false story for both italy and spain secondly, doctors do chose who to treat first in like a car accident incident based on severity, judging who is in most danger and who has more chances to live. both these cases are irrelevant to us because we are not talking about dying people.  you could save humanity as a whole by sacrificing one person, the situation changes. that's why i said the dilemma is a false one and it's just manipulation. there is no situation where killing someone would result in the life of everyone else. how could the doctors know that they would have to kill just one person before the cure? literally impossible to know. if anything this means that the doctors actually killed many others previously to get to this point. there is no point of view, you cannot kill anyone just to experiment. there is no dooming humanity because you can't possibly know how the cure can be made.  in the end, there is no actual good or bad in this post apocalyptic world. its everyone for themselves. that's nonsense. of course there is. for example for josef mengele, the nazi's failing was the end of the world. that's why he did all the horrific things that he did. you are justifying the same logic."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,i mean its only a non issue if you dont care about crap writing
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"trust me if you hadnt seen the leaks, there are no redeeming qualitys of the way they handled it. thats not the only thing, but im not gonna spoil it for those who want to keep it a surprise. there is no way with context what i saw could be good. if anything it would honestly be worse."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"not saying for or against anything here, but most of the time, it's because it never feels organic to the situation. it isn't a character that happens to be x, y, or z it's almost always hey look at this character that is x, y, andor z! a lot of things movies, games, books, etc. they fall into this trap. they include stuff for the sake of inclusion. which is fine, but it's going to look and feel bad for people on the outside. this is especially so for.... oh idk, a game company that fires one of the best game writers in the entire business who happens to be female and replaces her with a man who says he wants to empower women in gaming, and proceeds to throw her script and story into the garbage. that's what ticks me off. not the character existing, just the fact that the character wasn't intended, and feels shoehorned into a plot that already had a direction before being stripped of it's old identity, and we are left with very little reason why and can only make assumptions. x200b of course there are just some bigoted assholes that just outright hate her because she might be transgaymasculinewhatever. all i know is that even people i hold close to me that are lgbt fucking hate this character and the guy who got the original writer kicked off. it's not always about the exact message someone is trying to say, it's why and how they are trying to get that message across! and giving our previous main character the same treatment as a golfball in an undignified death by a random af character is 100 the wrong way, especially since it 1 makes ellie look weak since she couldn't save joel, and 2 makes the supposedly strong female character look weak since she couldn't win fairly!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,just buy it if you want to play it. what do you care if others like it. i never played fortnite and don't intend to. none of the 600kk playing it give a shit.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,knowing how the journey ends can't be helped by a decent road there. also playing the villain can be an awesome experience if done correctly. pitting you against characters you care about on the other hand isn't the way you do it. i grew to love ellie and joel over the first game and then expansion. why on earth would i want to kill them for any reason at all? even if the villains hate is justified it doesn't make for good story telling to force you to kill the characters you want to see win in my opinion. a villains motivations can be shown in so many other ways.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"the nonissue being when certain individuals whine about sjws and pc shit, i.e, things that arent issues"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"i've seen it. you haven't seen any buildup, context, or catharsis."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,deleted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"i think the problem is that tlou2 haters and i suppose fortnite haters as well have 1. not played the game, but 2. won't stfu about how much they hate it. their opinions are just not in good faith, which is obviously obnoxious. if you don't want to play the game, good for you, but don't force your way into the conversation about something you have not and will not play when others are trying to enjoy it. it's like busting into a movie theater to talk about how much movies suck. just... don't go, man. leave 'em be."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"why on earth would i want to kill them for any reason at all? why would you want to play any game where the hero sacrifices themselves? seeing joel from the perspective of someone to whom he is the villain, the monster who butchered her father and his friends, sounds interesting to me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"it becomes an issue when it starts interfering with things that you enjoy negatively though. i dont understand why stuff has to be shoehorned into preexisting franchises, it has almost never worked well. if the lgbt community wants representation in video games, why not make a game that is centralized around the lgbt community, with a whole cast of gay characters, instead of making other games feel like a lecture with underdeveloped characters?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,i don't care enough to tell them. why do you care so much about their opinion about a video game ?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,this kind of is a videogame sub. its entire point is opinions about videogames. the thread kinda involved tlou2. it ain't like they drop their opinion about tlou2 out of the blue in a random thread. i think some people are just salty other gamers won't buy a game with a lesbian and transgender lead.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,don't you know? if a game isn't completely generic and predictable then it's a betrayal.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,ya he is a bad guy in that context but why force players to play his killer in my point.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"lol, so much for its the storytelling youre unironically whining about forced diversity and gay characters here lmfao"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"the only confirmed lgbtq characters in tlou2 are ellie and dina. you're calling ellie underdeveloped? also, you have no fucking clue who's well developed in tlou2."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"this is a forum for discussion, i am discussing the topic to understand their point of view."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"this kind of is a videogame sub. its entire point is opinions about videogames. yeah, but they're not offering an opinion about video games, they're offering opinions about the lgbtq community. case in point i think some people are just salty other gamers won't buy a game with a lesbian and transgender lead. as it were, prejudice is repugnant to many. this is hardly any different than people who wouldn't watch a movie with a black lead in the 1960's. they were missing out, though, cause sidney poitier is awesome."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,it really betrays how sheltered a lot of gamers are that they can't handle something just a little different from the slop they normally consume.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,because it would be an interesting perspective?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"whining yeah, i care so much about this game that i didnt even play the first one lol and it is about the storytelling. shoehorning poorly executed characters that are a big part of the game affects the story, no?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"to be honest, i was at work while doing all this commenting and was under the impression that abby was lgbt, not sure where i picked that information up. and i don't really follow the game, so most of what i know is from reddit. that being said, i'm not sure why the person i was arguing with was making people disliking the game an issue of homophobia since ellie has been confirmed as lesbianbi since her and dina's kiss was revealed, and the majority of people didn't give a shit, and the hate train only started after the story was leaked and it apparently sucked. also not sure why any of my supposedly nonsensical arguments got any upvotes lol"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,ah okay it came across as if you rather they don't have a point of view.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"i dont think you realise how hilarious i find it that youre trying to pass off your issues as storytelling, but two comments in youre already whining about the gays in your video games hahaha."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"abby was lgbt, not sure where i picked that information up people lying about the game because she's muscular."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"whatever dude. im all for inclusion, but inclusion solely for the purpose of inclusion sticks out like a sore thumb. im done trying with you because its obvious that youll just ignore everything i say for the sake of preserving a pre existing view you have of people who dislike tlou2."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"the sake of preserving a pre existing view you have of people who dislike tlou2. yes you complaining about gay people did nothing to solidify my view, all 100 my fault"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,i never once complained about gay people??? lmao everything ive said in this thread was about shoehorning. but ok
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"and er, shoehorning what exactly?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,"well if they decided to shoehorne dinausaurs instead, people would complain about that as well. this is shitty writing on their part and that wouldn't change even if they had made the character different"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-20,abby isn't trans. you're feeling facto bitching about ellie who was gay in left behind.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,for those at work february 21 2020.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,ive never played a game with such a gripping and emotional story as the first one. left me feeling empty after i finished it. so ready for joel and ellie again
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,ellie has bad luck with the ladies.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,i have never been this excited to hear a clicker  give me this game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"ready to get emotionally wrecked by this game, 2020 cant come soon enough!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,it looks like dina was killed. you can see dina's bracelet on ellie's wrist in one of the shots of the trailer so i think that confirms it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,ashley johnson is going to kill it again. shes a monstah!!!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,inject this shit into my fucking veins

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,they're bamboozling us dina ain't gonna die this early in the game... right?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,i literally cried when i saw joel
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,you think i'd let you do this alone?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"i swear to god, if naughty dog kills joel in this one, it might be one of the saddest things to happen in the history of video games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"i think that ellie has found out about joel's lie in the time between the last game and now and parted ways with him over it, hence her not too enthusiastic response when he shows up at the end of the trailer"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,my wife and i are expecting a baby that week. who needs sleep anyway...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,that joel moment got me to shed a very manly tear.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,the trailer could have use a dash of gustavo santaolalla.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,this is going to be cross generational isnt it??
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,if naughty dog mocapped my erection after seeing this trailer they'd have all the animations they needed to create a game about rocket propulsion

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,okay so the plot will probably resolve around the revenge around ellie her new girlfriend! i was scared it would be revenge about joel. i am very excited about this and how the relationship between joel and ellie will develop.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"okay, but why is ellie wearing a mask?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,for thos ootl who's dina? i feel like i've missed something big

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,ive been waiting so long. and now the release is in sight. im ready for what im 100 sure will be a another amazing game. here we go.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,nice
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,auuuuugh tears in my eyes when joel finally appeared.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"looks gorgeous! however, being a revenge plot kinda worries me in how generic it could be at least what the trailer suggests. but naughty dog is pretty great at turning genre conventions upside down, in a way."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,preordered this game in 2017. been a long wait but im pleased naughty dog are releasing when they feel its truly ready. joel and ellie on the road again!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,are you kidding me!? this is releasing the day before my wedding. the best day of my life just became the day that delayed my last of us part ii game time! you can call out sick for your wedding right?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"huge speculation between this and the very first trailer where we see joel enter through a doorway of light, i'm guessing joel is also dead and ellie is hallucinating him as she goes further down her path of anger and revenge. it is where her mind will put what what is good in her so she can compartmentalize and be a guardian angelthe voice of her subconscious, et cetera. i'll stick by this until whenif we see him in action and actually interacting with the world outside of being a comforting voice for ellie. a big part of the marketing of the first game is how ellie is helpful in fights and we haven't seen any of that sort of marketing for this yet granted, it may be so we'll known that they don't need to now. either way i am so goddamned psyched. and ashley johnson's performance from the trailers seems phenomenal. which makes sense, she is so talented. but like...a new benchmark for performance capture. so excited to experience this game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,that literally sent chills down my spine. so many masterpieces coming soon i cant wait!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"people are saying the dina death could be a fake out and it's actually joel who dies, but it could also be tommy who dies. and of course joel would go on a revenge mission with ellie to avenge tommy and possibly rescue dina if she'd been kidnapped. edit someone in the comments mentioned dina could be a firefly spy, and while that remains an interesting possibility, i think another alternative is that the fireflies somehow find out where ellie is living and still want her for the potential to create a curevaccine against the cordiceps, and try to kidnap her and fail but end up taking dina instead and using her as bait to draw ellie into a trap."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"i'm so fucking glad naughty dog is still making single player, storydriven adventure games their way. it's pretty much just them and cdpr holding the line against shitty gamesasaservice microtransactionfarming bullshit."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"hoping like crazy that this trailer is a big misdirect and that the game doesn't fall so cleanly into the simplistic my girlfriend is killed now i gotta kill everyone trope especially considering how overdone and harmful that cliche has been in a lot of media over the years bury your gays and all that. i mean, naughty dog has a reputation for messing with its fans. they literally promised people that ellie wouldn't be playable in tlou 1 and that was an outright lie which i love."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"i really wish i was into this game, seems like a masterpiece. but i hate horrors, stealth and jumpscares with a passion. i'll try the first one since it'll be free but i don't think i will enjoy it"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,i really hope joel isnt dead and appearing as a ghostconscience like a lot of people are saying. its such a cliche and overused trope at this point and joel deserves better than being killed offscreen between the two games. i believe hes alive and estranged from ellie and the camp due to the mistrust growing between them after the lie he told.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"oh lord take me, for my body is ready."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"ellie is wearing a gas mask in the trailer against the spores, so her community probably doesn't know about her bite!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,anyone know where to preorder? cant find it on amazon?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,yeeeeeet
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"well, time to make one exception to the remember, no preorders rule i guess."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"me and everyone on the internet  never preorder x200b me now  ok, maybe just for this game"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"looks absolutely amazing, what a great time to be a gamer."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,not convinced that its joel who puts her hand over ellies mouth towards the end of the trailer. looks like it jumps from an outdoor scene to indoor honestly looks like a basement. definitely some editing trickery going on here.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,this game is the only one that could get goty ahead of cyberpunk imo.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,they seriously have one of the most invested relationships out of any video game characters
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"it was the best storytelling experience that i've ever experienced in any form of media. i hate when people try to say that it was trash or overrated, it was a god damn masterpiece"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,same here. when joel says 'do you think i'd let you do this on your own' i teared up chrissakes
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"i don't know, i was pretty emotional about finding the princess in mario."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"im hyped, but im also feeling anxious. i bet a lot of the game is going to be joel trying to keep ellie from finding out there coulda been a cure. prob gonna be some decent angst."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"yeah, i've never played the series at all and this trailer honestly makes me wanna try it. edit oh it's ps exclusive. nvm. guess i'll just watch the story."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"spoiler warning. i disliked that they expected me to just shoot the doctors though at the end when i entered the operating room. had an awkward standoff where i didn't shoot them, and then realized i couldn't progress the story without shooting them. i didn't really want to shoot them. hell, i wasn't even sure they were making a bad decision. but the game didn't do a good job of making me do it. should have had one of the doctors pull a sidearm or something, instead of just making me cold blood murder them."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"cough cough and you know, ellie talks about getting revenge and you hear her scream after a gunshot in a situation where its obvious dina was kidnapped..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,that was some walking dead level of foreshadowing. the game will be amazing though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"i think this trailer revealed waaaay too much, even the joel reveal. the death of dina would be 10x more powerful if it wasn't revealed in a trailer months before release"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,good... because i want a game about joel and ellie anyway.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-26,"hey! aasimar are people, too!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,the first game literally opened with joel's daughter getting gunned down. dina is too good and pure for the world of this game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"bold prediction dina gets kidnapped, joel shows up to help ellie rescue her. they finally track her down to find out she is part of the fireflies and her kidnapping was staged to lure out joel and ellie. dina kills joel in front of ellie, then ellie goes on a revenge tour."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,probably a bamboozle. why spoil such a pivotal moment in the story like that?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,it was like joel talking to us thinking he'd be dead for this game. god damn it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,didn't we all.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,literally?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"you know it's coming lol, he's not going to die of old age"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,since the ending of the first walking dead game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"oh, she knew the moment the credits rolled in the first game. that's my take, anyway."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,i think joel is dead and ellie is a wee bit crazy
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,same dude. i think we're going to have to live off 17 minutes of sleep a night.. give or take. edit. congrats!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"i get it, you gotta get that baby on an all nighter to finish the first one before it can play the second installment."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"congrats all future parents! i dont know whats more terrifying, the thought of changing all those diapers or the clickers."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,i'm expecting a baby about a week earlier lol. i guess we'll have something to do after being woken up countless times in the middle of the night
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"in all honesty, you'll probably get a pretty nice amount of gaming time in during that first month or so. don't get me wrong, you'll be tired as shit and your entire life schedule is going to be thrown in the blender, but newborns sleep a lot and there will be a lot of time where you can just sit with them in a baby carrier as you game away at like 3 in the morning. so not all hope is lost"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"my wife gave birth to our daughter 3 months ago. we named her ellie. can't wait for this, although i have no idea when i'll have the time to play it. children are exhausting. good luck my friend!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"its actually the perfect time. when my little dude was born he slept enough that i finished my ps4 platinums for uncharted 13, and finally played through the re2 remake and platinum. babies sleep a lot in the first while and even when awake mostly just want to be held."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"congrats, and.. my condolences for your free time. you will have none."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,man i'm at work trying to hold back my emotions from seeing papa joel lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,it will be the same as the first and will release on ps5 a few months after its release
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,rrarecompliments
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,i thought the game was coming this year. i was saving my gaming budget for it. this is the only game i have waited this desperately.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,could go either way.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,you never know what happened to her. maybe she betrayed ellie and killed all her friends. or she does die. or she was bitten and had to be killed by the dangerous group since they idealize sins and suchs and now pursue a cure going against joel because she says she has to finish
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,maybe because she still? does not want to disclose to everybody the fact that !she's immune!.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"must be part of the story dlc, i missed out on it too. is the dlc standalone and available on the ps4?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,orange man bad
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,not if you want to keep your spouse.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,no! i don't want it to be true but it's what i also speculated after the first trailer. my hopeful guess is that joel is not dead and will just be the secondary role like ellie was in the first game. i have a feeling joel may die in this game but i also think there is a chance he might live since there is bound to be a third and final game and they both need to be in it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,i think these games are a bit too grounded in realism aside from the zombies for that to ever be a driving force in the plot.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,this isn't a question. ellie needs you. joel needs you. cloud still has dumb hair.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,well supposedly all ps4 games will be backwards compatible on the ps5 so that's a plus!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,that would be undead nightmare.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,you are in for a lot of emotional pain then
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,i'm sorry dude.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,nice
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,i never played it on the first one. i was pretty miffed that the platinum was walled off behind mandatory multiplayer.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,you could. or if you feel like waiting until november 2020 the ps5 will likely be out by then.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"i just, finally, played it for the first time a couple weeks ago. it's such a fantastic game. really grew on me and got to me emotionally. get it!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,if you have playstation plus it's actually going to be one of the free games for october.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,did you play it at all?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"i can understand that. it's definitely not a game focused on really in depth gameplay. it's there, just not as mechanically complex as some games. the story is meant to be the driving motivation to keep playing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,it took me a few chapters to really get into it but after that i was totally sucked in.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,spoken like true gamers

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,this game was revealed over three years ago.. this is the release date trailer d
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,they revealed this december 2016.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,i hate when people try to say that it was trash or overrated. who are these philistines you are surrounded by?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"my best friend never played it, he said the zombie trope is overdone and stupid. im hounding him until he plays it, even gave him my copy, because it really is so much more than a zombie game. it isnt really even about the infected, the human elements are the majority of the story, and i hope i can get him to play through it before tlou2 comes out."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"not sure if i would agree for the claim being best storytelling. the most recent god of war game would give tlou a run for its money. it has depth, inter and intra personal growth from both kratos and atreus quite similar with the growth between joel and ellie, both games have amazing voice acting that i would say rival many aaa animated movie titles out there. i would say horizonzero dawn would make a close 2nd runner up when it comes to storytelling and game play mechanics. i've played all 3 titles all with multiple replays and each offered unique storytelling techniques and game play but best of all, offline main campaign mode ftw."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,thats how i feel about rdr2

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,absolutely the most terrifying enemy i've ever encountered.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"as hype as i am for this game, i am a bit disappointed they revealed that in the trailer. i would have like to learn about ellie's bloodlust through playing the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"it's gonna be so hilarious when they swerve the shit out of you guys and it turns out dina was a plant by the fireflies to get close to them and joel is the one she's watching die... which is why you haven't seen joel in any of the gameplay stuff. which is why the dina relationship is somewhat new in one of the trailers. which is why she says, i'm going to finish this, suggesting a prolonged conflict and not just them randomly targeting some girl that had nothing to do with any of it. which is why she looks at tommy with a shocked look and says, what are you doing? because he isn''t willing to avenge his brother. which is then coincidentally why a hand randomly grabs her further during the journey back at the city where the last game ended and it's actually tommy showing up to help. finally, which is why they used that tricky cut between the hand grabbing her and an entirely unrelated scene with joel inside a house. as emotionally guarded as ellie is, you could actually take this swerve really deep into the story and it still make sense and turn out really powerful."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,yep i was more commenting on the bracelet than anything and trying to drum up discussion. it is pretty obvious but you never know it could be a fakeout by naughty dog.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,the death of dina would be 10x more powerful if it wasn't revealed in a trailer months before release it wasnt though. nobody actually knows if she dies.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"people complain about spoilers, but the reality is that a trailer needs to show a character's motivations. for people that aren't sold on the game, they'll understand ellie's desire for putting herself in harm's way."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,joel was in the very first teaser though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"everyone had already guessed it from the last trailer... naughty dog is master storyteller...there are more, bigger things to uncover in the story"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,after reading your comment i'm starting to agree with you. too many plot points were revealed here. teaser trailers these days are more like how the actual trailer should be.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,joel was revealed back in 2016.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,you really think that they would spoil something like dina's death? lmfao. they are jebaiting you are you are falling in the trap like a rat with cheese. hilarious. naught dog and marketing
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"or if you have time you can replay it again, because it seems the first one will be free with ps next month."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"dina wasn't in the first one. she's just been shown in the trailers for part 2, and we don't know much about her other than she's another resident of that community and has a crush on ellie put mildly bc we don't know how deep their relationship is yet."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,you should really replay it. might as well before we get part 2!

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,im digging this theory. something about dina just seems too perfect to be true.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"it's the inciting incident which typically isn't a spoiler for most stories. that being said, there could still be more to it."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"that's a good point, wasn't thinking about that. i guess i figured it was just a well known fact to tommy and his settlement, but i guess maybe only tommy and his wife know."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"it's just the trailers, she's not in the dlc. however the dlc is 100 worth getting, is available on the ps4 but i don't know if it's stand alone"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,just got fadeeeed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,i'm going to find... and i'm going to kill... every. last. one of them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"hey there! there were three important reasons i didn't enjoy tlou. first, the sidekick would run around through scenes directly in front of enemies because they were invisible to the enemy ai. unfortunately, so many of these events over the course of the game during key scenes destroyed any concern i felt for her safety, and pulled me out of the suspense. secondly, i didn't like how the gunplay felt, so as you can imagine, that's an important part of the package. finally, i found the route through the game extremely linear, and felt that i was punished when i searched for supplies off the obvious path. i consistently reached dead ends that were tedious to come back from, especially empty handed. visually the game was excellent for the console, but otherwise i didn't enjoy it. hope these make sense!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"i'll chime in. the narrative was really compelling, absolutely. the gameplay however was kind of dull. the gunplay, the crafting, linear nature of the levels, immersion breaking companion, etc, just didn't captivate me anywhere near the level the story did. cinematic games just don't do it for me anymore unfortunately. i have no illwill against anyone who likes them, i can definitely understand why people love them. it's the same reason control felt like a slog and so did god of war to a lesser extent just derivative gameplay mechanics we've seen over and over for the last 10 years, kept goingfresh by a compelling narrative. it's why a game like rocket league will always get more hours of gameplay then anything else. again just imo, but i'm one of the ones who didn't completely enjoy tlou and why something like death stranding or cyberpunk will get my money over the tlou2 due to how the focus seems to be primarily on gameplay."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"i just recently played it for the first time and i've been telling myself that the reason i didn't think it was as great as everyone said was because it felt dated, i'm sure at the time of original release it was phenomenal."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"im sorry but god of war has nothing on tlou in terms of storytelling. i loved god of war 2018 and it surpasses tlou in terms of graphics, gameplay, and much more but the story was just alright. atreus really took a dive in terms of writing before kratos revealed his power to him. we get it your angsty and have a bunch of animosity towards your dad but whiny writing for the kid that drags on isnt enjoyable."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"itd be hard to choose between god of war and the last of us, but i think horizon is just a tier lower than those games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"as much as i really enjoyed horizon zero dawn, i was not quite as invested in the characters as i was with tlou. the overall big picture story of hzd was amazing, and learning about the downfall and the whole truth about zero dawn was pretty mindblowing, but it didn't make me cry the way that tlou did on multiple occasions, of i still think of it as the gold standard for storytelling and connection with characters. i was emotionally invested, not just in joel and ellie, but others as well. the guy with his little brother in the sewers really hit hard too. i also felt a lot of panic with tlou when it came to shortage of supplies and especially ammunition and first aid. every shot had to count and i don't think i was ever at full health through almost all of the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,when i was watching this trailer i was thinking about that gow game. it was great!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"tlou has a great deal of depth. you can prefer whichever one you want, but it has depth."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"yeah, god of war was great, but story and characters have nothing on tlou"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,another classic. i personally preferred the first rdr but rdr2 is up there with the best
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"the controls sucked and the story has been done a thousand times before you definetly haven't played it then, and tell me wich game or series already did the plot of tlou. tlou is unlike anything else, in term of plot."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"that she shouldnt kiss on the first date? i mean, were a little more progressive, but i guess second or third date will be okay."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,can't wait to be unable to finish grounded
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"yeah i'm super disappointed in myself for watching the trailer. it gave away what felt like a lot, all that seems left is to uncover the outcome of the story. unless everything shown in the advert is a bait and switch and the main plot is awaiting us all in the latter half of the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"i mean, pretty much everybody predicted dina was gonna die. it could be a fakeout but it just emphasises that dina's death is not the point and we're definitely gonna see dina dying quite early in the game. tlou was a story told time and time again about the rough and tough guy reluctantly forced to travel with a young kid who he eventually starts caring deeply for. the predictability didn't stop tlou from being an awesome story but imo enhanced ithttpswww.jbeplatform.comcontentjournals10.1075ssol.3.1.09lea because it was all about the journey and not the destination. same thing goes for tlou2 i imagine. it will be about ellie's personal journey of loss, grief, and redemption. i don't need twists and surprises, i just want a wellcrafted journey."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"i mean ellie's gf had more death flags than the unite nations has countries. first trailer showed she wanted to get revenge and the second showed her having a relationship. kind of obvious what would happen. the thing i'm looking forward to is how does that death impact her journey for revenge. they can lead into a lot of interesting situations like john wick story arc, deal with the devil, hamlet, etc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"i feel like they sorta gave it away already in the previous e3 gameplay trailer. right after she kissed dina, it transitions to her killing a guard and she is seen with dinas bracelet."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"that could be the opening scene though, just like joels daughter dying started off the first game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,hmmm....i'm convinced. can you do star wars episode 9 next?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"as much as i wish the plot was more complex in this way, it seems like you can see joel's face and beard in one of the mouth grabbing frames. it could be a sort of ghost joel thing though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"yeah thats certainly the easiest assumption atm but it doesnt really make sense to me to give up so much of the plot. its suspiciously too obvious for me to believe thats what happens. for example elle could have escaped and found the bracelet in the process. now its not a revenge mission, its a rescue mission. wont know for sure till we play it. all that aside im excited to see a more mature, possibly darker version of elle than the original. maybe a less apathetic, calmer john too."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,theyre clearly in a relationship based on the trailer.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"i can see that. i think because what we've seen of her so far has been so...sweet, i think? that it's clear she doesn't fit, and it's throwing us off so either she's evil or she is just too sweet to live."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,i mean just look at the trailer smoking the devil's lettuce and turning ellie to the gay side. she's a delinquent of the highest order.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,my theory...and people probably won't like it. the trailer isn't necessarily in chronological order. the whole scene with joel near the end of the trailer is at the beginning of the game. dina is taken and joel is killed. i could more easily see ellie going on a blood fueled killing spree if that was the case.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,u really think that they would spoil something like dina's death? lmfao. they are jebaiting you are you are falling in the trap like a rat with cheese. hilarious. naught dog and marketing
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,yeah i have a strong feeling this trailer is intentionally misleading is. if joel doesnt die id be pretty surprised.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"i used to be cautiously optimistic about bloodlines 2, but then i saw the gameplay footage. the graphics and combat system have obviously been improved massively, but the charm seem to have gone. and said charm is what made the first one such a cult classic, that's still enjoyable to play to this day, despite how clunky it is. if the demo turns out to just be a poor example, or something that was later completely changed, i'll buy it. oh also, the disco music in the sequel has gotten a massive downgrade."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"dont understand why youre being downvoted. your opinion is interesting and valid. id like to reply with my personal opinion on it. no game is perfect and bugs are bound to happen. the last of us was very much a story driven game rather than relying on mechanics and exploration, it focused on character development, emotion and suspense. its intentional that its linear. the same way a movie is linear. it wasnt about making choices but about discovering the reason the characters made choices. you lived their story. the gun mechanics were supposed to be difficult and the intention was to avoid using the gun. the lack of ammunition made it more realistic. stress and fear can make aiming difficult etc, etc. i noticed the bugs and issues through my many play throughs. beauty is in the eye of the beholder. the story and acting was worth a little bit of coding errors bugs. im looking forward to lou ii and have been for years!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"i agree with all of this, and for that reason i simply thought the game was okay. but, it's so loved by so many people and justly so, having a mediocretolow opinion on the game makes it sound like i hated it. that's what i've always felt anyway. also it was the same year as bioshock infinite and that game was better in every category for me and i will absolutely die on that hill."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"that's kinda the point of those dead ends. sometimes there's stuff there, sometimes there isn't. it's supposed to make you feel more desperate and low on supplies."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"i would agree with you on the gunplay part... however... i kind of put that down to the fact that joel is just a guy. he's your average working guy next door he's not military, or a cop, or anything else that would've had extensive firearm training. with that in mind, it made sense that the gunplay was clunky. i also agree that the game was linear, but i didn't mind that since it was done to tell a story. i loved uncharted and they were all linear as well, and i'm really enjoying detroit become human which is even more linear. but it serves the story. games, like tv, movies, books, or any other artform, are subjective. people like what they like."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"i just finished playing this for the first time yesterday. while i loved all the characters very much, thought the game did a good job of humanizing kratos which i didn't even think was possible, and adore the various storytime moments in the boat and on the world tree, the story itself fell flat pretty badly in the end. i think they were trying to go for leaving the audience wanting more, but instead i felt like there wasn't enough given in the first place. or rather perhaps too much of the wrong stuff. it seemed like most of the story was about odin and the various mysteries of what he wanted in jotunheim, why this tyr guy wanted to stop it, and all that. and by the time i got to the end, i had almost completely forgotten about the whole ashes reason for the journey. meanwhile, i barely cared about baldur. i expected him to be a bit player for the whole story. kept waiting for thor to show up and lead the way to odin being the big bad. i guess that's still the plan, but they paced it so poorly for that to be the plot of an entirely different game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"i also love the game. i thought the sharp turn in atreus' character after finding out his power, and then the sharp turn back once he gets set straight, was pretty jarring."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"horizon was a lot more fun than tlou and gow2018. the worldbuilding in horizon was pretty cool, but the character drama was less compelling."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"horizon's surfacelevel plot was fine and got the job done, but the fucking lore they came up with for that world is next level awesome."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"i wouldn't be so certain. the scene where it looks like joel grabs ellie and she says 'what are you doing here' is different from the scene where it shows joel's face. there is a jump cut there, from outside to what looks like the inside of a building. there is a bit of editing trickery going on here, and i bet it might be joel who is the one who gets shot. remember, the game left off with joel slaughtering a bunch of fireflies...he didn't kill all of them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"well naughty dog did trick journalists into thinking ellie wasn't playable for the first game. then on release, she actually was lol"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,im hoping its about as relevant as joel losing his daughter. but even that was a huge hook me in moment i enjoyed experiencing when i played...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,im betting those events happen pretty early in the game.. revenge is probably going to be the meat of the game..
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,it could very well be that everything they showed in the trailer happens in the first hour or so. just the setup for the story.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,naughty dog has been known to deceive with their trailers. the story may be entirely different than what we think it will be.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"i'm guessing for a plot switch half way. i bet we only saw a quarter of the story, which based on the completion time of the last one it's only 34 hours."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"true to an extent, the majority of tlous story was pretty standard as far as plot beats, just well done and sealed together with the centrals duos relationship. the finale however is very much unpredictable. its a huge gut punch melding between a very good ending and a very bad ending that plays off our desires experiencing it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"i thought the same thing, but tommy also has a beard and scraggly hair nowadays. he and joel look very similar now"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"true, i just wasn't sure whether to label dina as ellie's girlfriend, love interest, or whatever else."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,nahhhh ellie has always been on the gay side.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"definitely could see this, well said."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,it would be weird if joel died before ellie finds out that he lied to her at the end of the first game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"if they kill joel, i'm blaming you and you're gonna have to hold me"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,i think the main story will involve the fireflys looking for ellie and causing havok in the village then ellie will feel guilty for not being their to protect them while she was out on revenge.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"it would explain why she has dina's bracelet also. maybe she wants to go out and find whoever killed joel. so she is ready to head out and dina gives her the bracelet and tells her, i want you to come back to me or something like that"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"i can't see them including joel's death in a trailer, but i think your point about it not being in chronological order is correct"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"am i the only one who doesn't think they have been coy with joel? i mean, he was in the very first reveal you sure you wanna go through with this? trailer back in 2016, right? the fans then went batshit sayin', joel's dead! or it's his ghost! smh..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,this is what i think. youd think if she didnt know she would be excited to see him. wtf are you doing here isnt exactly a warm welcome...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"yeah, the creative director for the first game said as much about the ending. he said ellie never believed joels lie, and decided she needed to make her own choices, so they end up parting ways."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,i wouldnt be able to guess mate im currently at work too.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-25,"horizon's gameplay in those terms is outstanding. its action isn't just look how well i dodged and smacked the enemy, but instead a constant, onthefly, reactionary strategy. it's like if you took monster hunter's hunting combat and combined with zelda's puzzle combat. i wish more games had you fight difficult foes in that manner, rather than just evade it and hit it a lot."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2019-09-24,"hard to comprehend that other people have different opinions that seems awfully presumptuous. i enjoy a discussion and as such i enjoy when other people have different opinions than mine, otherwise it's an echo chamber and that's no fun. sorry if i hurt your feelings or something but i was only looking for a discussion. if you don't want one than fair enough, but can you understand my misreading your intentions? when one asserts, x is shitty, that usually means they feel strongly enough about x to have a conversation. i played the game and thought it was pretty good, not masterpiece maybe but pretty good, and i was open to having my mind changed. anyway, as you were."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,that was brutal and confusing
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"at its core, the last of us part ii is still very much about ellie and joel, but for this reveal, we wanted to showcase several new characters that are integral to their next journey. were sure you have many questions after watching this scene. were also pretty sure that were going to see all sorts of theories about whom these characters are, where and when this scene takes place, and how all of this fits into ellie and joels next story. for now were keeping mum, but were excited to see what yall make of this piece of the puzzle."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,a huge amount of money  time  naughty dog equals the last of us part 2 equals masterpiece. i'm afraid to imagine how much awards this game will win?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,i'm thinking this cult was responsible for taking out ellie and joel's friends at the house from the first trailer and now they're getting revenge.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,i really hate how they announce a game generally 2 years before its released. looking at you days gone.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,i never finished the first one. i should do that.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,man naughty dog games are some of the few i can still get excited for. the industry is getting so much worse imo that it almost makes me give up on it but naughty dog reminds me why i fell in love with the hobby to begin with. i'm sure this game will be fantastic
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,incredible. the amount of tension within this scene is consuming. the cinematography on display is honestly second to none in the gaming industry and everything just builds so perfectly until the final frame. naughty dog are masterful at what they do.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,so is that an older ellie?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,are those ps4 gameplay graphics or cut scene graphics?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,kind of a meaningless trailer to be honest.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"could be ellie's mom. though i'm pretty sure she is assumed dead, right? anyways it looks like the lady wanted to know about her womb. like she birthed someone who's immune."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,can't wait for this. i'm gonna savor this one and try not to binge play it right away....crap i might have to replay the first one now.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,so we're playing a whole new set of characters? nice!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,how do you beat the first? its like trying to one up halflife.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,is anyone else blown away by the cinematography?! it looks like something that emmanuel lubezki himself would shoot.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,ellie got dem manarms
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"so im thinking of 2 ways the plot of tlou2 could go 1 joel and ellies story is done. the guitar trailer doesnt support this, but this trailer introduces the new characters that are going to have to have a role in the story. we follow the 3 survivors seen in this trailer as they survive in another area of america. this separates them from joel and ellies story, and could have them going against a new threat we havent seenheard of yet. this would need to be handled carefully though, since the basic rule of story telling is telling a story that needs to be told. naughty dog isnt stupid they understand this and will most likely not go with the rival survivor group route a la the walking dead tv. im hoping for a fireflylike threat, but not an exact duplicate of the fireflies. 2 we follow joel and ellie, and later in the story they run into these 3 characters. we stay in the general area of where tlou1 left off, with maybe a road trip thrown in there for varietys sake. then they all either fight this group of crazy zealots or the above mentioned fireflylike threat. the only difference between possibility 1 and 2 is that joel and ellie are the playablemain characters."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,let the circlejerk begin!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"look, i love tlou as much as you do. i love that it's gritty and real. but this, out of context, felt like way too much. it felt like shocktorture porn. if we had more context, which we will when we play the game, it would warrant this scene. this game will be incredible, don't get me wrong. but, especially when the past two weeks have been filled with violence against women, it just seems in bad taste."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"im gonna say it, i dont care, that trailer was bad. the entire trailer had me wondering if it was even lou. it didnt feel like it, it didnt look like it, it didnt sound like it. the audience didnt know either until the title popped up. it looked like days gone, and to me, thats a big mistake."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,i couldnt watch
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,was this ellie or not? i am confused and really cannot tell. she did not look like ellie from the guitar trailer maybe older? but she did resemble ashley johnson a lot. she also looks a lot more built than i would imagine ellie is going to be  however not impossible or unrealistic given hertheir situation.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"what if joel and ellie are on the 'bad' side in this game? it seems weird that they are not the focus of a new trailer yet it feels like the woman being hung might be our new protagonist. it feels like something naughty dog would consider, i never wanted a sequel if it was just going to be ellie and joel on another road trip so i hope they might have a twist in regards to the characters"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,probably will get down voted for this but what happened to the sexual harassment allegations? seems like they just swept it under the rug.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,well that was ... underwhelming
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"my theory left without marlene's leadership, it looks like the fireflies broke down and a religious aspect took hold of the militant group. i still believe the plot will be that the group tracked down joel and ellie outside of austin and attacked when the two weren't there abducting ellie's child and killing her husband and everyone else there. upon returning from a trade erran joel and ellie find their village razed and embark on a journey to hunt down the group and save ellie's young child. this is like the two brothers, they're important side characters and that was a remnant of the fireflies."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"big last of us fan, thoroughly put off by this trailer. i understand that sony probably has a thorough marketing schedule and will actually show gameplay sooner or later, but it's just goofy that anyone thinks prerendered cutscenes are a good way to market a game. it probably works on a commercial level but it's creatively bankrupt. the longer they hold back on footage for gameplay that's more or less just gonna be run of the mill third person shooter gameplay, the less i'm interested."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd its time to buy a ps4 again.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"i cant wait, the first one was amazing, by far the best mix of story,action,emotions and music in any game. btw i forgot the girls name but damn she looks like a huge dude!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,damn. i might actually bust out my ps4 again for this.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,why not just make a movie? take away the beautiful graphics and it's just a runofthemill 3rd person cover shooter. same goes for uncharted.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"i think this was a flashback to toward the start of the outbreak of the disease. the woman who was tied up might be ellies mom, who passed away after birthing ellie. hence why the clickers were referred to as demons. not sure though, thats just what i have been reading."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,keeping mum huh...?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"my best guess is they've travelled to a region that contains factions with a more religious twist to them. whatever reason it is that they are in that region will obviously remain to be seen, but the opposing factions these characters belong to will probably play an integral role in the story. perhaps them finding out that ellie is afflicted will have each faction scrambling to capture her either to kill her or deify her. edit i'm thinking in a somewhat similar vein to outlast ii, but it could go in any direction honestly. i'm excited either way though."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"i honestly dont think so, tlou was released in 2013 and the graphics honestly are still better than most stuff today without even being remastered. and with how good uncharted 4s graphics were... its gonna be amazing im sure."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"when she was laying on the ground after being cut down from the noose and the veins in her forehead were popping... it's just so much wow for me. it assists so much in the immersion of their games, i was holding my breath 3 or 4 times and the thing only lasts 5 minutes."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"currently, probably not la noire's facial animation still looks great but the textures are still real blurry even in the remastered trailer. halflife 2's were cutting edge for the time, but that was over 13 years ago holy fuck 13 years. there's a couple that come real close if not on par as naughty dog, though nd games typically have a lot more. one things for sure ingame graphics of any average game today beats all the pre rendered stuff from the 90s."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,naughty dog best animations in the biz

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,i don't think the trailer represents the gameplay graphics. this is a cinematic trailer.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,it's a cinematic trailer. it won't look like that.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,i'd say to watch it. it's just a clip and doesn't reveal anything from what i saw.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,i would watch it if i were you. not much going on in terms of spoilers. it's just a scene with some people we've never seen before.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"same. i mean having a guy do shit that's not possible is one thing, but when it's some 100 pound woman, it somehow crosses the believability line as unfair as that sounds. good to see a woman depicted as what one might look that actually had to scrape a life together in tough times."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,that's the one problem i have with this so far. it's such a tired cliche. i'm sure nd knows what they're doing though. they haven't disappointed us before.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,if you have a ps4 it's 20 to download it. you won't regret it. just checked and if you have ps plus it's only 10.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,fucking masterpiece. not exaggerating. if you have a ps3 or 4 you are doing yourself a disservice by not playing. it's not too long either 1012 hours.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,if there was one game that i could recommend to people it would be this one. the last of us is literally a masterpiece that is head and shoulders above the rest as the best game of all time to me.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,very fun game. highly recommend.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,tlou is the best game i've ever played.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,play it if you can. it's a work of art.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,i agree with the polygon article. the excessive gruesome violence is unnecesary. same reason i stopped watching walking dead when they introduced negan. if you can't sell a story without resorting to shock tactics then maybe you need to write a better story.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,anyone who can afford an up to date pc can afford a ps4...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,how come?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,no.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,based on the ingame clips in uc4 i guess real time with toned down rendering when you play.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,was ellie even in this trailer though...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,no release date. also it doesn't spoil any of the story at all. in truth it raises more questions than answers.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"sadly, no"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"no chance, friend. these will remain on consoles forever."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-11-05,"in game cutscene, gameplay will look similar to this. reference uncharted 4"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,no it was a new character
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"just speculation, but it could be her mother from before ellie was porn edit born lmfao"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,they said they're just introducing some new characters in this trailer. whether they're playable or not has not been revealed.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,but... half life was one uped by half life 2.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,that's not ellie.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"at its core, the last of us part ii is still very much about ellie and joel, but for this reveal, we wanted to showcase several new characters that are integral to their next journey."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"the music was totally tlou, same goes with the brutality and everything else. the goal of this is to create more questions than answers, and they accomplished that."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"the ending made it look like days gone, but i think that is the point though. they are slowly taking their time with marketing this game because in reality they really don't need to. i had a feeling they were going to show new characters in a trailer. in reality, we are going to forget about this trailer when more videos come into the light and the same with days gone. it is very hard to make a trailer a mistake trailer. the first trailer of dead island was a big mistake, i don't know too many games that the first trailer ruined the game in the long run."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"i think they did that on purpose, it's not ment to be obvious that its tlou 2"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,what made it look like days gone?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,it's not ellie
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"i'd assume, as with any company, it is being dealt with internally and privately as it should be. why should the public have any knowledge of an ongoing investigation if there is one before an outcome is determined?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,allegations are allegations. no proof so i give no shits
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,well elaborated
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"you're making a lot of assumptions. like, a lot a lot."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,ellie is a lesbian tho?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,do you forget how they marketed the first game? they didn't even have prerendered cutscenes for the longest time. it was just footage of antszombieants. there wasn't a lick of information about the game but that marketing strategy amped up a lot of people and garnered a lot of attention when they did release footage from the game. i think naughty dog knows what they're doing. there's nothing wrong with prerendered cutscenes. that's been the industry standard for the last 20 years. they're just teasing us with tiny bits of content to get the hype going for what promises to be another amazing game from naughty dog. they don't do crap so there's no reason to lose interest. the longer they take to release the better the game will be.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,considering a big part of the game is cutscenes i don't mind.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"i don't even get you reservations. when has nd ever dissapointed you when it came to tlou or uncharted? tlou will not be a run of the mill 3rd person shooter, i can guarantee you that"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"if you're playing the last of us for the gameplay you're doing it wrong. and this is the second trailer for a story based game, it's hardly surprising that we got to see a cutscene. actual gameplay footage usually follows closer to release."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,then fuck off and cry elsewhere?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,who said that? this the smallest snippet of gameplay you cant tell anything from this
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,so the entire game happens at night and around a campfire? welp color me uninterested.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,then don't buy it twat.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,username checks out...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,if it's out by christmas 2018 that would be perfect. i'd obviously prefer they take their time though to make the best game possible.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,didn't they postpone the first one?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"i seriously hope you're right, i can avoid buying a ps5 altogether if that's the case"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"i'm thinking this is a flashback from before, or soon after, the safe zones were set up. this cult is clearly religious. and that woman played by, of course, laura bailey is ellie's mom."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,nope
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,in game graphics are different then rendered cutscenes though. assuming these are rendered
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"la noire looked really weird with those great facial animations mixed up with those blurry textures. too shame, cause it would do much better with better textures. yes, remaster is coming out, but too late and not even better textures for pc. classic r."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"blur does incredible work but it's a whole different ball game. blur makes highly polished rendered animated shorts which gives a lot more room and freedom to rig and animate, not to mention light. naughty dog's work is all realtime inengine which is just a whole other level of difficulty."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"this. most animations were terrific, some mediocre at best. i am referring to the two men dragging a body builder like she weighs 20 kilos, the man pulling the noose again like she weighs nothing, the kid cutting the rope, the kid drawing the bow. on an unrelated note, i also found the sound of the hammer hitting the woman's arm really unrealistic. it's almost as if he were hitting chainmail..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"haha, what."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"i can see you're getting downvoted for this, but for what it's worth i agree with you. i'm not denying that the animations are super technically accomplished and miles ahead of the first game, but same as you i feel like they've now landed squarely in uncanny valley territory."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,the sound sends chills down my spine.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,nice try

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,one of my favorite scenes in the whole game. made takens interrogation scene look like a light slap on the wrist.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"good question... i picked 10 years arbitrarily. i think the last game that got me really wrapped up in the story was the original halflife and it's expansions. as well as 2 i suppose. but for the time, the original consumed my life like no game really had before. i honestly have a very hard time immersing myself in games. so when it does happen it's pretty special. i bought sleeping dogs on steam the other day on a whim because it was like 5, but i can't even bring myself to open it. can't even explain why. but this happens often. i know it's a great game too."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"it is a cliche that makes sense though. religions spend a lot of time concerning themselves with the apocalypse. eschatology is huge in religious studies. it makes sense that certain people will lean heavily on their faith to explain why the world is the way it is, and to guide them going forward."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"well we got like, a three second bible verse and an apostate reference. she could just be a nut, in the same vein as jared letos character in blade runner."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"i mean zombie game was also a tired cliche. as long as it's the setting or central conflict of the world rather than the focus of the story, cliche is good. it means they don't have to devote much of the script to explaining it and can focus on the story they want to tell."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,the setting is the us though where christians are the overwhelming majority. it makes only makes sense with how the bible ends with the apocalypse  the coming of jesus.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"we still might see some flashback. i mean, this woman looks a bit similar to ellie from tlou2 teaser and in this video that woman was about to cut her unborn child from her, so we may presume it could be ellie. also what was kratos son doing there? came to say hello from another trailer? hehe"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"this make sense because it's slightly implied the woman is pregnant. could explain ellies immunity. wild guess, ellies mom got pregnant from some sort of mutated half infected man she loved. ellie was born with immunity."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,oh sorry i didnt see that lol. thanks for the info!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,the first trailer did exactly that in a better way. this was just confusing and seemed like an afterthought.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"the use of wet deep forests and hanging people the last trailer reveal for days gone actually brought out real hanging people for the audience the muddy and orange color palette last of us used more of a green and yellow color no recognizable characters or signals no fireflies, no fungus, no guitar music"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,maybe she just dabbled?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"never cared for uncharted, even having played 2 and 3. but yeah, in terms of gameplay unfortunately that's an area where the last of us is a mostly unremarkable third person shooter. in fact the mobility of uncharted actually makes it more impressive to me, although not by much. that was always a disappointment for me. i don't expect 2 to raise the bar much higher but i'm optimistic even in spite of what i think is a silly lack of gameplay footage. the storytelling is compelling and the art direction in the first game is good, and i didn't see much of that in this clip. if this is just how they market the gamesdon't recall the marketing for the first one besides the initial teaser with joel interrogating the guy, that's fine. i just didn't find this clip compelling on any of the levels that made the first one compelling to me. if that offends people, i'm sorry."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"if you're playing the last of us for the gameplay you're doing it wrong. don't presume to claim that there's a right or wrong way to enjoy a game, that's just silly. if you're marketing a game without its gameplay, you're doing it wrong. i don't see scorsese marketing his films with still shots of the screenplays or storyboards, because those aren't films. prerendered cutscenes are not games. gameplay is what makes games what they are, so marketing campaigns that seek primarily to advertise things other than gameplay are doing the game a disservice and actively dissuading people who care about gameplay first and foremost. not sure what it is about that sentiment that seems to be hurting feelings, as it's an extremely common criticism of game trailers."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,the first game came out in june i think? around e3 during the summer. considering it's only the second trailer and it's just a cinematic with no gameplay i wouldn't expect it at all next year.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,that was true on ps3 but on uncharted 4 everything was rendered in front of you. i noticed the transitions seemed really good and then i noticed there was no cutscene viewer like before.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"almost no games use prerendered cutscenes anymore. that being said, this game is in super early production and i can guarantee this is a prerendered animation and not from in game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,it'll get a non vr pc port in a year after launch. rockstar is greedy in the sense they want you to buy more variations of the copy instead of gyping you

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,you could reason that she somewhat ignored it because of adrenaline and maybe.. just maybe because she had to kill that other bitch to survive.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"beyond this, religion is a way to understand death. there was a study that found that those who were exposed i.e. reminded to death immediately and uncompromising clung to their belief systems. if you're exposed to death daily, you're going to need a belief system to cling to to cope. religion fills that void for many."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,but still a cliche. it would be better to try to re interpret the role. make them the victims instead of the guys in power or something new. i felt like watching some resident evil type of post apocalyptic world instead of tlof world.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"well, leto's character acted that way because he realized he was making people and saw himself as challenging god, especially since he kind of delayed the apocalypse. i doubt that's the case here, so probably a cult."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,i don't think the woman was pregnant. unless i missed something in the trailer explicitly stating it. given where she was going to be hung it was most likely a tree meant for heretics and sinners who could not repent. edit given the girls reflexes and how she snuck up on her executioner while being hung i'd wager its ellie.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,i guess you weren't around during the snesgenesis days.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,i'd say ps2 and xbox was even more heated. they were the last two fighters in the console wars for sure.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,neil druckman the director confirmed this is an in game cutscene
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-30,"yeah dude, i know what the uncanny valley is. naughy dog is the single best developer on a technical level when it comes to animations in video games. to say that their animations fall into the uncanny valley is to say that every single animation in every single video game is utter dogshit. what i'm trying to say is your statement is ludicrous. besides this is what uncanny valley territory actually looks likehttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vflneg7cjbme, not what's being shown in this trailer, which is nighon movielevel cgi."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"yeah, but, like... part of the point of that scene was to make you start to consider that joel's only alive because he's hardly any better. yes, he cares about ellie, which makes us empathize with him, but he's also become a pretty fked up person who clearly enjoys killing people in brutal ways at this point. by the end of the game i felt that it's big achievement was making me root for a guy who, in his own way, is a selfish bastard. i think ellie feels the same way. she definitely knows what actually happened, but she forgives him, because she understands why he's so protective."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-11-20,"yeah right. dwindling resources, lack of actual food and being stuck in a large settlement for the winter? of course they're gonna be cannibals. doesn't make them any less shitty, but that doesn't justify his torture either. joel's hardly any better than them. but whatever, keep telling yourself that if that makes you feel better about yourself."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-10-31,"90?! is that a joke? there's just so much wrong with everything you've been saying. 1. religion has clearly been abused, including by the catholic church, to commit violence. 2. all video games have someone going to extremes. how else would you have reasons for the setting? there are also an abnormal number of doctors and scientists doing terrible things in video games. does that mean games are antimedicine or antiscience? 3. it's the goddamn apocalypse. acting like video games created or are a particularly large portrayer of crazy religion in the postapocalypse is absurd. it's a trope that's been around for forever. hell, even in real life most cults are apocalyptic. stop acting like a victim just cuz your group is now the target. how much media shows black people or italians as gangsters? or businessmenlawyersetc. as corrupt and evil? muslims as terrorists? all of these are similar percentages in real lifeas to how you're describing christians. and that's not even mentioning the vast majority of media that shows passionate examples of the caring pastor, or the person saved through their faith, etc. media with an excuse for violence always takes certain groups to extremes. acting like there's a particular targeting of christians is insane."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"got curious about this and did a little counting. of the publishers that have gotten more than one nomination for game of the year at tga, the list looks like this  sony 13  nintendo 10  bethesda 4  capcom 4  fromsoftware 4  ea 3  atlus 2  blizzard 2  square enix 2 fromsoft selfpublishes in japan so i went ahead and counted their namco and activision international releases as their own games. if we went by developer instead of publisher, bloodborne would also be theirs but the whole list would look very different. also split the companies that publish under multiple labels. xbox, activision, blizzard and bethesda were counted separately and the same goes for rockstar, 2k and private division."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,how many of them won? there are definitely some all time greats on this list.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,they pay for it
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,they havent made any of those games. they pay studios to make games which they then sell.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"ive never played any of these games, am i missing out or not"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,i suspect bribes. death stranding was a lot of things. goty candidate it was not.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,should death stranding really qualify?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,does death stranding still count now that kojima bought the rights back so he could release it on xbox?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"was death stranding worth it? never played it. genuine question, i'm looking for good solo games"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,astro bot is so boring! a cheap game that's not worth it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,is this not like all other industries where you just fill out a form and pay a fee to get nominated for industry awards?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,how the heck did death stranding sneak in? that game was a turd.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,cool but forbidden west does not qualify as a goty nominee on the grounds that it's a sequel which is inferior to the first.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,this would be like saying i won a popularity contest every year when my mom is the judge. those fake awards are sony bias.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,i wouldn't count studios that they don't own as playstation
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"13 games listed, and if i'm being generous, maybe about four of them are actually worth playing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,and only one of those games actually deserved the nomination lol

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-05,"you see that 2015 game, do that again please."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,red dead redemption 2 not winning goty still pisses me off so much
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,shouldnt rebirth be listed here too? i know its square enix but its still a ps5 exclusive the same way bloodborne is a ps4 exclusive despite being made by fromsoft.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,astrobot's gonna win this year. for sure.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"honestly some of these being up there feels in support of the idea that nominations are rigged and that geoff just wants a designated sony spot to ensure they keep supporting and show up to the event. ratchet and clank was not a top tier game and uncharted and death stranding were so niche in their audiences that they feel forced. one of my biggest problems with the game awards rn is how token a lot of the category nominations feel. theres always the token indy, token sony, token pc game and then the 23 games that actually got the most attention buzz surrounding them that actually will likely win. then they have 16 categories so every triple a game can get something despite the title really grasping at straws."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,hot take all of these are mid
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"a. the nominees are chosen by industry shills. b. that doesn't make them good games. c. goty isn't a real thing. it's a popularity contest decided by industry shills. d. sony didn't make death stranding or bloodborne. i own every single one of these games. i've played all of them, more than once. the second time was only because of pc releases so i could get the achievements. they aren't experiences i'm desperate to have again, though i will definitely buy ghost of yotei, venom and whatever naughty dogs next game is assuming they don't somehow fail to deliver a very well produced game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"they deliver but i still dont like ps exclusives games, im glad final fantasy will no longer be a ps exclusive."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,looking at the nominations for goty this year astro bot is the clear winner for me. team asobi taking an already great game in astros playroom and somehow improving just about every part of the gameplay is a rare achievement in game development these days
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,well considering there are probably 100s of publications giving out goty awards thats pretty meaningless.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,because the whole thing is pay to win advertising.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"yes, playstation pays to have a goty nominee every year."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,wow this is some serious glazing
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,death stranding is playstation?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,literally every game is a goty nomineewinner somewhere.. this isn't an achievement got nothing against those games just that this stat is worthless
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"same goes for pc, not sure what the big deal is."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"astro bot is good, but it's hard to believe there wasn't any other game this year that would take that spot."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,it's pretty wild when it's listed like this. what an absolute banger list of games they've put out over the years.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,shows how good sonys first party games are. ive bought most of sonys steam releases.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,well it is the sony awards.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,ghost of tsushima is such a good game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,uncharted 4 should have won that year

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,isn't that a given that the platform has a nominee for goty? why would they not have a nominee? that's like a political party not having a nominee during an election.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"and here are the firstpartyindependent developers of these games astro bot team asobi spiderman 1 and 2, ratchet and clank insomniac horizon games guerrilla god of war games santa monica death stranding kojima uncharted 4 and the last of us ii naughty dog bloodborne fromsoftware"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,yeah but how many actually won? not being condescending just genuinely curious
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"bloodborne is due for a remake. seriously. if sony can get bluepoint to remake demon's souls and quite excellently at that then surely we can get the same treatment for bloodborne? it's probably some sort of licensing quagmire but if there's a will, there's a way, as the old saying goes so hopefully it happens. at some point. yeah."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,man im behind. i have played none of these except bloodborne.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,2015 was almost a decade avo excuse me while i enjoy cobains last meal ye ole 12ga
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,uncharted 4 should have won!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,we have no ips sony
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"2024 should have ffvii rebirth as well. it may be a temporary exclusive game, but so are some other games here like horizon or god of war."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,xbox could have won it all if they stopped being cowards and made a third viva piata
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,couldn't even vote for most of these games cause i don't own a playstation. it's been getting better over the years but seriously give me bloodborn!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,most of them are available on pc.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i feel this is like congratulating a movie theater for showing oscarnominated movies.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"is astro bot really that good? i have read such high praise for this game, but the only console exclusives i have played in ages are those that trickle their way onto pc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,goty from one random outlet that is meaningless
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"goty for who, though? there are about a thousand gotys every year from every publication and website known to man. its literally the most useless accolade. lol.httpsyoutu.behqmblpsqhgm?sitj5mhozlf4d16td"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,why isnt ff7 in 2024?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,2025 bloodborne again! 10y anniversary!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,how many companies are left?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,wow what was sony doing wrong in 2014
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i have yet to play a single one of these games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,which goty? arent there about 30 gazillion of them now?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,god of the year 2018 and 2022. not a sony pony myself but god of war is peak gaming.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,playstation i sleep.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,your title says playstation but you mean sony. playstation having a nominee every year is not remarkable as there are only 3 consoles and pc and like 5 nominations. but sony as a publisher is different.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i mean, i would hope so. seems like a bare minimum requirement if youre going to ask people to invest in your system."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i mean, there are only 3 sources for goty contenders and playstation is one of them lol not the biggest flex"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,nominations are wildly different to a win
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,9
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,whole lotta xbox shiii
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i wonder what this stat looks like for other platforms though. it doesn't seem that crazy, like you would think each year there would be at least 1 nominee from other platforms like switch, xbox, and pc. am i totally off here?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"astro bot and bloodborne are the only two not on pc yet. death stranding is the only one that just recently came to xbox, but that's because of ownership change. would it even be considered a ps title anymore, technically?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,so...sony studios make good games? that's new
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"every single year apart from 2024 companies were doing stuff, now sony does not want to cash out to the devs so please enjoy astro world, a game no one really cares about. now sony works on something way bigger than games, i dont think the next year and a year after will have any worthy titles."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"horizon, god of war, spiderman. horizon, god of war, spiderman... i'm sensing a pattern"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i miss player bloodborne day 1 co op with my buddy. just exploring the levels . good times
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,duh
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,great games. but is it really surprising for one of the big 3 companies in gaming to be putting out at least one excellent game per year?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,bloodborne is from 2015?! mf im getting old
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,goty nominations are made by big companies like sony. it really is not that weird they have a nomination every year once you understand that.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,ill preface this comment by saying i dont know if all of these games are ps exclusives but im pretty sure most of them are if not all of them. so to the people who were whining about microsoft buying up big developers like bethesda and activisionblizzard and freaking out over the titles from those companies becoming xbox exclusives. this is what xbox users have been dealing with for well over a decade
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,sly 2 rerelease should be a goty nominee
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,where is rdr2?!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"wait youre telling me bloodborne, the game that everybody bitches and moans about getting a remake, is only 10 years old"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"20152020  great era in music, movies and games"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"that's why i'm still keeping ps4 and haven't even considered ps5, doubt i ever will. just so many cool games year after year and some still haven't played."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"as someone who has not had a playstation since the ps3 days, is there a way to play playstation games without one? ratchet and clank is probably the first game series i fell in love with, and i'd love to replay the old ones andor play the newest one. i have both xbox one and pc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,only one of these is a standalone with no prequel or sequel. sony we need to change that
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,sooo one of the most dominant gaming consoles in the last two decades paid had games of the year published on their platform? what a nothing burger.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"ps4 games and their sequels more or less, sony needs to get some new ips in the mix, or maybe revive some more ps3 era ips."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"not to rain on the parade, but sony is one of the biggest distributorsdeveloperswhatever, where one of the 4 console including pc choices are made by them. idk how many nominees there are in total, but if they werent getting 14 of them every year i'd be surprised"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,mmmmmmmm
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,yeah i probably should have bought a play station back in 2015
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,astro bot is just mario galaxy.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,why did they stop at 2015? seems like they had some in 2014 too ...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"that's because sony is a whole ass platform that farms out a bunch of games, and the rest are typically made by individual publishers who make a game every few years outside of the yearly garbage like cod, fifa, etc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"that forbidden west banner is a little baffling. you can't make the protagonist look like that no matter what camera angle or postprocessing you use, so i guess they just reused an asset from the first game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"fun fact, every single game on this list other than the newest, and bloodborne, have either come to pc or are scheduled to come to pc soon"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i think playstation has perfected the third person action game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and yet no bloodborne 2
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,the existence of bloodborne in any list should be a shameful reminder to sony of how they let the franchise die
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,all the single player games just goes to show ppl would rather just be left alone sometimes
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,death stranding isn't part of sony
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,deserved
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,what is astro bot?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,they do make games after all...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,bangers!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i have never played bloodborne and probably never will, but wtf? it was released in 2015? i really thought that it is only 4 or 5 years old game. time flies way too fast nowadays."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i'm not following. 1 game nominated each year for game of the year? seems like it should be more. how many has nintendo had in the past decade?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,did any of them win?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,never heard of astro bot
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,ratchet and clank for 2024
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"damn, like what is even the point of xbox anymore? gamepass? why would i buy that, when i have a console with so many great games on it. xbox need to step up with their exclusives."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,how's astro bot?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,horizon got smacked both years. releasing beside a zelda and elden ring. amazing games and incredible story telling.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,that happens when you pay a lot of money for your games to be nominated.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"jesus christ, bloodborne was 9 years ago"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,bloodborne man! what a game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,bloodborne 2 and they'll actually win it as well
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,why was spiderman 2 nominated? it was aggressively mid
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,bloodborne is the best game on the list by far
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i have played 0 of these games lol. i'm 34 and i own several of these on steam. where is days gone? that game was really good.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,wouldn't really call death stranding sony's game. they don't own the developer and wasn't sole publisher for the game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,20152019 are goat and winners in my eyes. the rest up until now not so much. except astro bot that was a unexpected surprise
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,call of duty bo6 could be up there this year
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,good god 8 years since nathan drake
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,the only game i've played and didn't enjoy from the list was bloodborne. does anyone else share the experience?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,oof xbox.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i gotta play that ratchet and clank game appearently.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"what a surprise with them having the largest market share in gaming, truly baffling."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i've only ever played uncharted out of these.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,this is the sign. bring back singleplayer only games they were peak
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i have never heard of astro bot
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,three of those games have already gotten a remaster
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,2018 was crazy
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,i picked up spiderman remastered over the weekend and it's sooooo boring. how did that get nominated for goty?!? i love spiderman but even that couldn't keep me playing. after 7 hours i gave up
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"2018 might be the best year ever. god of war, spiderman, and red dead redemption 2. what a year."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"my favourite of these is bloodborne. i think i'm officially old, media's not being made for me anymore"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,i liked death stranding but game of the year nom is a stretch.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"you're telling me that one of the biggest video game corporations in the world, nay one of the big 3 sony, microsoft and nintendo, has games that are constantly seen in the mainstream public eye and are nominated in awards shows that target mainstream games? what's next, you're gonna tell me nintendo owns pokemon?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,bloodborne should have won goty.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,hopefully we get another ratchet and clank game by the start of the ps6
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,the power of money.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,probably because playstation is all modern gamers know about gaming
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"it's a shame that as a company, sony and subsequently playstation are fucking terrible. why does every company that makes legitimately good blockbuster titles also have to be complete scumbags who treat their communities like shit?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,2020 was a helluva year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"weakest year 20, 22 or 24"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"hmmm, i've got some platinums to catch up on. couldn't do that all these years later if there are multiplayer trophies looking at you ac black flag"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"i think ill play bloodborne again, thanks!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,4 years later last of us 2 still not on ps premium smh
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,thats crazy to think about
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,only one nominee? or are there others?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,astrobot definitely deserves it. amazing game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,bloodborne
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,how the fuck is bloodborne nearly 10 years old...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,you know it's a slow year for gaming when astro bot makes goty. not saying i dont have love for platformers but i felt like there were better more mature nominations imo.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"only game i like out of those is bloodborne, the rest i dont care for."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"maybe sony should just dedicate to games  forget consoles. same with xbox, go pc software streaming"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,tlof is really good
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"not surprising. nintendo was on life support for the first couple years, third party publishers have mostly been chasing rushed live service nonsense, and xbox has been an alsoran since the end of the 360."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,have they won?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,ghost of tsushima is 4 years old but i still cant buy it for cheap
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"that reminds me, i still have to play death stranding and ghost of tsushima from my physical backlog."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"that reminds me, i still have to play death stranding and ghost of tsushima from my physical backlog."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,that is so crazy
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,with how big helldivers 2 was i'm surprised it's not beside astro bot. they really shot themselves in the foot with that one.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,spiderman2 on the ps5 is hot garbage. hopefully fixed on pc release.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,horizon twice goty??? how?? it is a boringass game with good graphics
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"it's the entire point of this. they aren't just sony games, they are sony exclusive games, heavily subsidized to attract attention to the platform. yes, the studios are extremely talented, but they sony was only able to pull this off because they had a big market advantage with the ps4, and they saw this as an investment in their ecosystem. most studios, even aaa, cannot afford to pull this off."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"a lot of comments like 'it's come to pc or other platform, then it's not sony game', lol."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"i question the legitimacy of this. as majority of console players i know only ever have a sports game such as nba2k, nhlfifamadden, gta and every years cod."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,and an ubisoft infection by the looks of it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,2022 i was eating good
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,at least 80 of these games are mediocre at best. but these awards are all paid.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,spiderman and horizon are so overrated.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,that 20152018 playstation run was legendary
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"2018 was such a good year, god of war, mh world, red dead and spiderman celeste. im blessed to say ive played each one"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,if astro bot is all we can muster for goty then it was a sad year for gamers
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"meanwhile, xbox with all its fantastic ips sitting in a closet like what gives?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,nothing to do with marketing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,2022 and 2023 is a joke although i liked the ragnarok.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"man, 8 years without an uncharted? and we got that shit movie instead? sad."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"in fairness 810 of those years nintendo was nominated too. of course 8 is less than 10 but the variety on offer is broader than sonys. i cant get behind sonys current business plan, we have a pro console, the portal and a bunch of bluetooth peripherals but barely any ps5 exclusive games. most users are still using the ps4 platform."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"i thought astro's playroom and astro bot are just little funny games and was even a bit angry when i saw astro bot is selling for full price. then i got to play both. amazing games, totally deserved goty nomination, amount of content per level is just... i have no words for this, amazing"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,sony sus
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"you have to remember  award shows are highly sponsored and often skewed to make those sponsors happy. nominations are the easiest to do, even if an award isnt won. sony has a huge budget for pr, and they love to use it. not really a marker of pure quality not saying they dont make quality games  but there are many others out there similar or better, but a marker of how much marketing money they have to toss around. or are willing to use."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,they could do something really nice and given us bloodborne sequel and port the game to sony's steam lineup... surely with 10 years of goty nominations they could spare us this?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"last of 7s, spiderman, gos, and gow only deserving spots."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-05,"is uncharted 4 actually any good? i played an uncharted a long time ago, i think if was ps34 and it was just a very bland and uninteresting gameplay"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-05,bloodborne and astroboy are the only ones worthy of the title tho. the rest are just generic triple a blockbuster games. the fastfood of gaming. it would be like calling mcdonalds the best restaurant of the year...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-05,crazy part is from that list the only games i kind of care about is god of war and possibly death stranding with maybe spider man 1 coming in third.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-05,atrobot saved this year... next year will be hard to partecipate
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-05,"nominating horizon for goty shows what's wrong with the industry these days. an absolute average game, with all sort of mechanics that has been already invented before just put in one game with apart of hunting which is the best part of the game, but still only hunting. brand new universe with new characters, story and few twists is way too little to be considered a goty pretender."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-05,i am sorry but horizon game are not goty contenders.......
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-13,"i have a playstion 4, yet as a xbox player. i dont even think any of those games are fun. its definitely rigged."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,we throw the word goty around too loosely
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"completely deserved, as a person who plays a lot of single players, almost every one that releases per year playstation have some of the most quality games i've ever played"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,would be interesting to see all games of the year since 1994 and first playstation.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,what is an action adventure game for 500 please
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,astro bot
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and next year its ghost of yotei. mark my words. it will win
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,which goty award? it seems 610 games release a game of the year edition these days.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,deleted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"and not a single game in there i give a f about. well, except maybe astro bot. the playroom was decent. shows how much different personal tastes can be. none of these games would be even in consideration for goty for me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,they all deserve it honestly
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,do you think this could be related to selling more consoles than xbox possibly
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,with all due respect i see absolutely no reason astro bot has a goty nomination let alone half of the nominations it does
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,final fantasy vii rebirth? that also got a nomination
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"jesus, i did not realise uncharted 4 was that old now...still replay it once a year at this point!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i just want bloodborne on pc
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,tried to like bloodborne. i have the game on disc. couldn't get into it. the witcher is better. looks more beautiful too. bloodborne tries to hide graphic quality with darker environments. too me doesn't look as good graphically. but most importantly there is just more to do in the witcher. horizon games was awesome too. the ones i have played on ps4 that has frozen wilds expansion. i paid for the expansions for it separately.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"playstation really does know how to make amazing games, especially single player story games"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,at least half are mediocre
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,they make the best single player games out there.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"just release bloodborne on pc sony, omfg you absolute clowns"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,of these i have only playing death stranding and can 100 recommend it for game of the decade andor game of the century.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"wow its almost like sony releases good games every year and it has that something to do with it! op  no, this is clearly sony paying money to have their games listed on nominee. there is no other way. it must be this"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,astrobot militaryclown.png
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,why is this notable to anyone? sony is a megacorporation that is also a game publisher. they arent the ones actually making the games. stop praising the suits and higherups and give credit to the game studios who actually worked on these wonderful projects.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,lots of those shouldnt have been nominated honestly
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,we all kno some of them don't deserve the spot but it's sony
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,and i wouldn't have voted for a single game on this list. shame.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"it's simple, a certain type of game tends to win these types of awards. same goes for the oscars, a certain type of film always gets best picture sony is publishing a lot of these types of games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"every single one of those games i don't give two shits about, reminds me why playstation since the ps4 era is dead to me. and i grew up adoring the ps1, ps2  ps3. i'm just expressing a personal opinion. i don't mean to shit on all the millions of people who like these games. it just got to a point where sony stopped making games that interested me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,xbox sucks
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,most of these games aren't very good frfr nocap.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,what worthless content. goty means nothing but marketing
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and they're all on pc expect astrobot and bloodborne....
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,they make good games
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,death stranding  walking simulator.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i hate exclusives. no reason to have them. you are literally taking money away from yourself. consoles are sold at a loss.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"well when you have money and own a massive portion of the industry you're going to get benefits even if they're undeserved. i say this as someone who enjoys my playstation, but god damn do the stinkers they pump out get absurdly high reviews."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,major publisher has had a goty nominee every single year in the last decade
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,all sequels lmao
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,never played any of them
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,which is sad since many of them dosnt deserve it...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,so what? only one really good game  bloodborne
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,theres like maybe 3 games here at most that deserve it lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"hzd is mediocre at best, how is that goty worthy is beyond me"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"and yet they still want to triple down on live service bullshit. they were banking so hard on concord. how did so many people see that garbage and go yeah, a ton of people are gonna love this. all it took was one trailer for everyone to know it was a dud, but none of the people making it knew? or did they all know but didn't say anything because they'd get fired?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,astro bot is nice but i dont think its worthy
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and they only won 2
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,they absolutely didnt deserve one in 2023.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"games that are platform exclusive should not be nominated for game of the year. they def shouldn't win, at least."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"they didn't make these games, they published them. at least the few that i know of. fromsoft made bloodborne, for example."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,bg3 best gave ever
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"as a selfproclaimed sonypony since ps2, a bit worrying ive only played 2 of those games, being bloodborne and ghost of tsushima, although all of those games interest me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,helldivers 2 should be nominated.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"spider man 2, hfw and got don't deserve it, ratchet was a great game, idk if it is a goty candidate, the others are worthy."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,honestly hell divers should be on there too. butttt lets just go with the single player narrative.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"like give them a category where they can shine, but none of the games are truly addicting, which was what games use to be. i like these games too."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,2018 should've gone to red dead 2. absolutely ridiculous.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i really want to play astrobot but i'm 100 certain it will be a ps monthly or ps extra game at some point and don't want to buy it. i really wish sony would do more day one releases on big names like xbox does. psn is a decent value so i'll keep it, but waiting for shit to be added is annoying."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"my only objections are tlou ii  astro bot. because, why?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,nice to see the walking simulator got nominated death stranding
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,love all these games but you can also just see a downward trend in overall game originality and quality each year as well for their best game..
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,crazy how oc players play the hzd or ratchet and clank and its all  okay games
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,returnal was not even nominated?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"just so everyone is aware, every single one of these games are also on pc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,greatness is what that is.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,they don't deserve to claim bloodborne
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,wtf is astro bot? playstation people are so weird man. tou can get an xbox with literally double the amount of games and the controller isnt designed for sangheili. like wake upppppp
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,seeing bloodborne pissed me off because it reminds me sony is about to own fromsoft
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,streak probably should have been broken in 2019 lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"bloodborne and death stranding are not playstation games, otherwise impressive."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,what the hell is astro bot?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,sony owns and pays the judges thousands of f dollars i don't give a s what their game wins. i love all those games though. but f they're b! like they're the only goddamn gaming console on the planet! why don't you go remaster another 5yearold game you f moops!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"how many won again? not being salty, just busy at work."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,not to mention rdr2
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,no returnal is insanity
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,the crack someone was smoking in 2016 to nominate uncharted a thiefs end for goty mustve been some good shit
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,2018 was such a good year for gaming
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i have almost all of them and never played them...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i liked the game, but spiderman 2 didnt deserve to be nominated"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,ghosts should have beat lou2. a story of a jin throwing away all honor and samurai tradition as they have showed to be a weakness kahn knew. to start fighting using stealth and less honorable means to defend there homeland over a story of basic revenge that doesn't solve anything
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,surely this isn't that notable? it's hardly surprising that a major games console has a nominee for game of the year every year. all that means is that the console is popular enough to have games developed for it which are good enough to be nominated for game of the year. i'm pretty certain the same is true for pc.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,to bad they are a shit company that scammed me out of 180 after their paper thin security got breached for the 10.000 thousands time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i think this kinda shows that in some of these years, either the releases were not that impressive, or a sony game must always be nominated. like, you might have liked it, but it's ratchet and clankle that memorable in comparison with other titles in this list? i don't think so in all honesty."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,how many did win goty? i only remember god of war being a winner? not sure to be honest.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,bloodborne and spiderman are fantastic games but everything else seems pretty mediocre. astro bot looks like a nice little game but i wouldn't expect it to be groundbreaking.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,tbh no console exclusive title ever deserves to be goty
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"and for half the years, they deserved to have one"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,crazy how bloodborne is still the best on that list
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,how many of them won it ?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"ratchet being nominated in 2021 over returnal is so wrong...i'm happy astro is nominated this year, i just think rift apart was a forgettable platformer that overpromised and underdelivered"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,most of them are the same game with a different skin.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"and i'll never get to even try most of them since i won't go for a low effort, cash grab pc port. something getting goty or even being nominated for it used to mean being worth buying a console for, but that value has gone down and the games aren't getting better by enough to make up for it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,weak
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,honestly only a few of those i'd ever touch. but it's cool people get into these awards and think it means something
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"if they can pay for exclusives, they can pay for nominations. sony buys a head start to every race it enters, and still manages to lose most of them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,whos game of the year? culture crave? gaming awards? aunt beth?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,helldivers 2 is better than astro bot. but thats my 2 cents.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"great list, but spiderman 2 was riding on the coat tails of the first one"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"gonna be an unpopular opinion but horizon is one of sony's most overhyped just ok games of all time with no real reason being nominated. 2017 was really only between 3 games and they had pubg on the nominees to fill slots, 2022 was when elden ring released and you could argue they put half of the nominees that year also to just fill slots cause it was definitely between elden ring and god of war."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"isn't the goty just an industry price, where everyone is petting there own shoulders and say how great they are? also isn't the goty a pay to get nominated price?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"nominations don't mean much when you are one of the big 3 consoles and spend hundreds of millions per year pumping out aaa exclusives. if they weren't gonna get any nominations, they wouldn't be paying for those games to be made since if they aren't good enough to be nominated, they aren't good enough to sell to make up for the dev cost."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,game of the year according to whom?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"to be real, even though they're all good games, some of them were nominated only because playstation."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,so you're saying sony's list for games of the year is all sony games.... interesting.....
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"death stranding, nah. definitely not a goty"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"how are these even playstation games? most of these are on pc as well, and death strandings on xbox."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,but sony will ruin fromsoft!!!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,the only good game on this list is bloodbourne. the rest is the equivalent of oscar bait. pretty games with shit gameplay.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,almost only counts in horshoes and hand grenades. how many did they actually win?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,astro bot was great!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-05,what in the world is atro bot..?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"spiderman 2 doesn't deserve the nomination, game just automatically gets nomination if it sony at this point"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,lobbyists
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,astro bot making this list is a sign of things to come. goty quality games have just shifted to platformers designed to only be played for 30 minutes. gaming is officially dead as we know it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"you would hope so right? i mean, they're a massive share of the market."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"l these games look pretty...but they're boring. 95 of these games nowadays are boring to me. if a game can't hold my attention for years, it ain't my type of game. not for the prices they charge nowadays. i have a ps5 and still play the same games i bought on my ps4. i don't think i have a single ps5 exclusive game that i playenjoy more than the games i've been playing for 6 years"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,the fuck is astrobot?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,reminder.... they think astro bot on the same level as wu kong or elden ring... goty really means nothing
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,what about sekiro?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,dont let the xbox fanboys see this.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"playstation just doesn't miss. the worst game on this list is probably tlou 2 which is a damn great game, just has some questionable plot choices."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,how did uncharted 4 get nominated that game sucked. nevermind it's just the game awards.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"feels odd that i have not played any of them and none of them appeal to me, in the least, to warrant me playing them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,pussies allowing for dual winners in a year

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,couple of those didnt deserve to be nominated to be fair lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"just to five an honest opinion as an xbox player. none of these games would ever make me want a playstation. i've bought 2 play stations in my entire life, one to play grand theft auto 3 and one to play little big planet when it first came out. the games on this list aren't enough to make me purchase another."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,a thiefs end was sonys end.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,shame that 4 of the 9 years had the same ips.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"all this shows is that the nominee list is far too wide for things like horizon 2, rift apart was shockingly mediocre, death stranding, last of us part 2, and spiderman 2 to get the nods as goty. im not sure if there is a more disappointingly generic open world series than horizon. it's so close to being great, giant mech dinosaurs are cool, but holy hell that story and gameplay."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,how the hell did horizon get nominated?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,sony should make more multiplayer games
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i get people fanboys will celebrate this, but does anyone else feel like when they look at this list, astrobot while good just doesn't really stand up compared to the rest? like blood borne, god of war, spiderman, uncharted... such a feast. it's just strange to put astro bot next to ghost of tsushima, or death stranding, you know? it also feels this year's goty are a bit light. like no game is really bad, but it also feels like none of them would be in the list in any other year."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,it's almost as if industry awards are supporting the industry...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,really? death stranding? i felt like a ups delivery guy the whole game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"western gaming media has a strong bias to the type of games sony make, so not surprising."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,really? astro bot? i feel like goty should be somthing much bigger than that
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"hell yeah, two good games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i would argue that a few of those were undeserved tbh
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,hd2 is so much better than astro bot.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and none of them deserved goty. gow stole rdr2s win and tlou2 was a joke.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"sony's built up a good reputation of making great games but that reputation is at risk now with things like concord, requiring psn on steam, their focus on live service games etc"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,every console does d what bullshit marketing is this?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and its still has no game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i see 2. two worthy games. what the hell is this?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,meh conveyor belt games with marvel writing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"playstation didn't have those nominations just because the games in question are exclusives. sony didn't make most of those games, third party developers did. credit where credit is due."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,you can really see the decline

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,horizon is a cookiecutter ubisoft open world clone that holds itself back by trying to be everything it shouldn't be.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"you do realise that they have a fix spot on the list? they could release a total shitshow and they'd get nominated. that's how those awards work. i'm not saying that they don't deliver, but having a spot alone isn't that special."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and they had to reaaaaaallyyy stretch to get astro bot to fit
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,these awards are such a joke what even is astro bot and why would it be getting game of the year over something as epic as the other games on that list.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,wow..one of the big three consoles had a goty nominee? insanity
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,how is astrobot on there? is it actually a good game?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"the only games on thatt list that i consider worthy of goty aare bloodborne, god of war, death stranding, ghost of tsushima and astro bot."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"really good games on that list, but i have an unpopular opinion about game of the year. if the game isnt available on multiple platforms, then it shouldnt be considered for goty. if the majority of gamers cant play it, then the game is really just a best of insert system here to me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and more than half of them are mediocre at best. conclusion ? goty awards are fucking trash
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,well yeah they're on the committee that chooses which games get nominated lol.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,its a fucking 2hrs commercial. sony buys adds there and therefore gets awards and nominations.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,when ya bribe the award ceremony!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"some are these are surprising to see tbh. they must've been slow years. uncharted 4 really??, last of us part 2 remake remastered and remade again, and death stranding the walking simulator should never have been contenders lol"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"yes, we all know journalists have a playstation bias."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,horizon games are cheeks
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,horizon is such a generic game. it's only popular because the incels love the mc.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,what a shitty list of games... glad im a pc gamer.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"lets be real though, astro bot isnt going to win shit."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"lol rc a goty... this game is a joke and for kids really. the fun, the humour and difficulty of the previous rc were gold, this rift apart is just bad..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,death stranding being nominated is a joke by itself
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,death stranding imo is the odd man out here. that game launched at the pinnacle of reedus and kojima fanboyism. i will die on the hill that game is not good.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,so the demo that got some dlc was the best they could do
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,ok
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"game of the year is a generic term, they are hundreds of goty each year so no surprise sony is nominated each years, unless it's for a specific ceremony?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,except death stranding isn't sony production and they don't have any rights. they only published it for certain time before it went multiplatform
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i have played 0 of these and have almost no desire to play any of them. edit wrong, ghosts of tsushima was excellent."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,shouldn't there only be one game of the year for each year? seems weird that god of war has to share
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,we were all lost to the pandemic era.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,fr wtf?! is there gonna be another one? im not up to date about rc stuff
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i just picked it up on the steam sale since i don't have a ps5. wow, it's good."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i'm on the pc timeline so only 2023 for me
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"this is the second recent one, the other came out around 2016"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"hi there, i tried to make a post but it got deleted saying i need karma? i'm not sure what that is but i would really appreciate someone helping me out by answering a question. i'm trying to find games for my 21 year old grandson who is getting a ps5 for christmas, and the man at best buy tried to sell me a blue paper card that had a yellow plus on it for 100. i'll be honest, i'm in my 70s and i'm not sure if he was trying to scam me or not. was that real money for the ps5 or fake? please help whenever you can, thank you so much!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,why deal with the toxicity of people when you can have an enjoyable experience
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,except overwatch only sp games have won the award
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,not only that but they're all thirdperson games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i mean single player games are much more likely to win goty regardless, and multiplayer games are more often than not going to benefit from being cross platform not exclusive. the big 3s major ips are all single player focused, even halo and gears are usually touted for their single player campaigns over their multiplayer."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,why is this a noteworthy question? the ps barely even gets multiplayer games that aren't crossplatform to start with
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,sony publicly announced that singleplayer is their focus since the ps4 era. makes sense they are recognised for what they focus on.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"funny enough, i think of multiplayer and single player games as completely different media, and i often immediately associate something like game of the year or greatest of all time with single player games. i love multiplayer, but to me its like comparing a sport to a book not really compatible"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i mean, this is also a brand new reddit account go for easy karma farming posts so i wouldn't give it too much attention."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"nope, it is not a coincidence. single player exclusives move consoles. i was thinking about getting an xbox but i can just wait till spring to play indiana jones so no more xbox console for me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"not that sony makes many multiplayer games in the first place, aside for their yearly mlb title and occasionally some others they do also publish mp games every now and then, such as helldivers 2 this year."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"sony pictures understands movies, and their playstation division understands games. together they help make some banger stories and adventures. i'm a pc gamer, and i will gladly admit ps is probably one of the best gaming studios and will probably buy a ps5 just for gta6.gta games hit pc 23 years later sony has an exclusive marketing deal with rockstar games, and also looking to acquire the fromsoft studios."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,no. single player games are just better
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,console exclusive multiplayer games are rare nowadays. people usually expect multiplayer games to be live service too. you cant do that and limit your player base
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"probably also the same reason i'm interested in gaming for the first time since the early aughts. i dont want to have to keep a schedule like a job to be able to keep up and compete, that shits not fun. im so glad single player games are coming back to be the norm. now if only i could get some couch coop games to play with the kids."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,really fond memories of bloodborne multiplayer.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,the best experiences are single story games. online is nothing but toxicity.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,does ps even have an exclusive prominent online multiplayer game?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,or that they are mainly first party games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"you could consider 2 of them multiplayer games that promote healthy gaming habits. i mean, with bloodborne and death stranding, you definitely benefit from playing with the multiplayer element of them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,probably not. most of the voting party probably cant play multiplayer games at peak due to that being after the review embargo is over.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"rhetorical or not sony has gone away from multiplayer games they used to have a stable of them just for shooters they had socom, killzone and the resistance games. they seem to have 0 interest in these games anymore , the concord disaster wont help things but thats on them just poorly developed. socom was and still is my favorite shooter of all time but they screwed that series up too and have buried it since."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and how many multiplayer only games sony released over the past 9 years?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,what was the last multiplayer game of the year? overwatch?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,bloodborne?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,2015 was five years ago!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"helldivers deserved a nom this year over astro, imo. i love both, but helldivers is a game that will actually influence the industry moving forward, the ones nominated are just the most popular games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and all are jump and runs with different skins
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"multiplayer games are more prone to ongoing and changing player responses, especially as changes to the game come by the way of patches and updates that can affect how players view the game. i remember earlier this year people saying that helldivers 2 should be up for consideration when it first launched but sentiments around the title seems to have shifted ever enough since then that it wouldnt be as considerable now."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,i think not!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-07,this!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-02-16,"my best guess is that, they can focus more on the single player experience meaning they wont spend time on multiplayer functions, wifi problems such as the common grounds on multiplayer games, with those servers being up and ready, the resolution would be much more accesible to the players meaning they could make the gameplay as beautiful as possible."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,its not a coincidence. they barely make multiplayer games. so stop.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"praise phillydillydee, well said"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,bruh multiplayer is already dead. no need to kick the horse further
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and then ea shows up  singleplayer games are dead
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and ea wants us to believe its dead
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"they are story based games but a few of them aren't single player bloodborne, death stranding, ghots of tsushima."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i still wish for a 5, but i understand that they can't just keep coming up with these massive lost cities that somehow were never found in the modern world"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,uc2 still unparalleled imo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,what really sucks is it has a fun multiplayer mode.... that you can't play on pc  it's a great game with a fun mp mode locked to ps4 only ps5 has to run the ps4 version to play so you are also stuck on 30fps.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,grant us eyes!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"it seems like the more we ask for it, the more sonyfrom software wanna starve us"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"between how much fans are clamboring for it and how reticent the higher ups are to even acknowledge that it exists, i honestly think that there's something actually wrong with bloodborne. like, they lost the source code, or the ghost of kentaro miura is threatening to sue miyazaki for copyright infringement or something, and they only recently started making headway on solving the problem."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,the fact that fromsoft has the same number as bethesda and capcom is pretty remarkable.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,that simple list took a lot of work.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"this requirement wouldve been limited to only the largest publishers. who else can fund the production of many high quality games in a year? also, who publishes the title would have less to do with quality than who created the game. is this criteria resulting in a list that is more about size or quality? are they the best of the big publishers or the best publishers?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-05,if supergiant gets another nom with hades 2 i would guess they will based off the ea it would be kind of wild to see them tied with the likes of blizzard and square.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"if i remember, god of war won 2018 and tlou2 in 2020. that is it from this list i think."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"quick rundown of the goty category of the game awards in this time frame. 2015  witcher 3 over bloodborne, fallout 4, mgs v, and super mario maker 2016  overwatch over inside, doom, titanfall 2, and uncharted 4 2017  lozbotw over horizon, pubg, mario odyssey, and persona 5 2018  gow over assassin's creed odyssey, celeste, spiderman, monster hunter world, and rdr2 2019  sekiro over control, death stranding, the outer worlds, re2 remake, and smash ultimate 2020  tlou 2 over animal crossing, deem eternal, ff7 remake, ghosts of tsushima, and hades 2021  it takes two over metroid dread, deathloop, psychonaughts 2, ratchet and clank, and re village 2022  elden ring over a plague tale requiem, gow ragnarok, horizon fw, stray, and xenoblade chronicles 3 2023  baldurs gate 3 over alan wake 2, loz totk, spiderman 2, re4 remake, mario wonder"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,just did a quick search god of war 2018 and tlou2 are both winners
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"at tga? only a few. but overall gotys they win more often. like uncharted 4 had the most gotys tracked in 2016, but overwatch won at tga. death stranding had the most in 2019 but lost at tga. i'm still shocked that horizon 1 finished 2nd in 2017 behind botw obviously in overall gotys. it finished ahead of mario odyssey even."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,horizon had the misfortune of going up against breath of the wild.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"oh man, socom was so good."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,some of those old ones are so funny. like wow didnt get a single nomination in any category in 2004 or 2008. madden 04 beat kotor. cod 4 didnt even get a nomination for goty. as stacked as 2007 was and there was only 3 nominations to begin with.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,well this post seems to be about goty from tga. i don't think there were tga goty awards before 2015.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"uc2 being the one that won it is kind of wild imo, and maybe im looking at it through 2009 lenses but for as much as i love uc2 i think arkham asylum was a far better game"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"idk about that, spiderman 2 felt like a step down from the first one. i liked it alright, but i was a little disappointed as a followup to sm1."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"not when some are taking up space where much better games could be included. the outer worlds being there in a year that gave us outer wilds and disco elysium is crazy. another example. nominating deathloop when you had games like hitman 3 and inscryption. then you've got cookie cutter open world games like odyssey, horizon, tsushima etc. games that have great elements in them but the lack of creativity in their open world design is very apparent. so not games that really stand out enough to be one of the best of that year"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"eh uncharted4, horizon fw, and ragnarok don't really deserve it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"please pull your head out of your ass, or at least develop better taste."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and now they're competing for goty with a childfriendly robot whose purpose is to make players experience all of the playstation's features. no kidding. and from what i've played of it so far astros bot is fantastic. it reminds me of the old mario galaxy games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i've only owned a ps4 and ps5 but i have zero regrets. i've had some of the best gaming experiences i've ever had on those two consoles. i have limited time to game so i'll take one good single player experience a year over endless multiplayer.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i just miss the ps3 days when they were more wild and experimental
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,bloodborne on pc.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,now if xbox could manage to step up their game. because at this point they are looking more like late 90s sega. which isnt a good sign. we need at least 3 big consoles. especially since 2 of them are dominated by 1 country.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,naughty dog hasn't released a new game in 5 years.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,to me it's now that i'd rather play their big games on pc and knowing i'll get them eventually means i won't get a ps5. they have blockbuster exclusives but the thing is this list basically is all their notable exclusives for the last 10 years. i can't justify buying a 500700 dollar system for that few big exclusives. also this spans 2 generations of consoles.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i agree. the first console i ever bought with my own money was a playstation 2 with gran turismo 3 and ive never looked back. nintendo nes was my first actual console  bought by my parents, of course. i cannot say the same for them. they have declined so much."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,they had a definite slump during the very early ps3 era but theyd recovered from that by 2009. and tbh it was more of a hardware pricing issue than bad games
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,as a pc gamer. i always buy the latest generation of playstation. it becomes my media hub in the living room but also means i don't wait or miss out on some genuinely fantastic first party titles. astros playroom and more recently astro bot is an incredible casual game for me or anyone who comes round to just mess around with while having fooddrinks. takes me back to super mario days of pick up  put down casual gaming.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i will be bitchin until i get bloodborne 2, bloodborne remake, or at the very least bloodborne remaster  pc release."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"sony kills it when it comes to their games. their quality standardsdemands are up there but it leads to games like these time and time again. this is why i thought it was so odd when this sub and the fromsoftware sub had a meltdown at the prospect of sony obtaining fromsoftware, people were genuinely acting like it was ea obtaining them and that they were now doomed."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i think people want a bit more variety in the portfolio as well as more games that put gameplay first. and some smaller budget but more creative stuff like shadow of the colossus was back in the ps2 days. i think tbh they should do a different genre than third person action more. like astro bot i'd love to see them do a single player fps or a western rpg
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"aloy is the most forced fucking godawful character a games company has produced. i platinumed hzd and i did not touch hfw. i am tired of seeing this stupid red head everywhere like she fucking earned it, she did not, sony is just desperate for another game mascot."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"ps3 era was dominated by xbox 360. xbox had more exclusives and they were more successful, with the exception of uncharted and last of us which was at the end of the lifecycle. i dont think anyone would take killzone over halo for example"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,3 stellar spiderman games8
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"real talk does anyone here actually think that sony doesn't deliver or something? to me sony hasn't delivered in a long time. ps4 was meh. but ps5's catalogue us downright embarassing when it comes to exclusives. even flops like the sega saturn had more exclusives than the ps5, by several hundreds of differences. their hardware experimentation is going after what others have done before. as far as i'm concerned, there's only one console developer called nintendo, with sonyms making pclites."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,microsoft has really gone down hill but besides that id agree
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"if you were following basically every gaming sub while microsoft was buying up every major publisher, then you would see that a huge number of people think sony only cheats. none of these titles were a case of being bought by sony and removed from other platforms."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"ha everyone, look at this nintenerd with his wholesome opinions. nerd!!!!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"hey there, i think their games are mostly same repeated mediocrity, 3rd person action adventure with mostly meh story, whatever gameplay and games mostly focused on being movies not games"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"sony doesn't make games the same way nintendo does. they're a publishing company, first and foremost. insomniac is the 3rd party team behind spiderman. also, you really should check out more indie games. the switch has a ton of them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"first of all, 2024  massive failure for sony. not one single game they made this year besides what, astro bot? no one cares. concord  massive failure. helldivers 2  not made by sony, not exclusive, not good. second, sony literally only had 1 or 2 first party exclusives during ps1 era  gran turismo and what, twisted metal? there weren't many impressive sony games then and even ps2 barely had first party games. sony bought all the developers who made their ps2 exclusives, after or during the ps2 era. sony didn't make spiderman. insomniac did. sony acquired insomniac after they made spiderman 2018. like 45 of sony's games were made by insomniac and that's not including all the other third party exclusive games from developers they eventually bought like naughty dog. third, nothing here is competing with anything. it's not a real competition. it's industry shills deciding which stupid, overrated aaa production is their favorite. there are countless better games with actual gameplay available. i would play something like factorio, hollow knight and 2000 others long before i'd worry about a generic third person action adventure game with platforming and other elements, which is all sony is capable of making anymore. good on them. they're a shithole company that has done their best to strangle the gaming industry, no different than nintendo and ms."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,mostly just the console warriors and the anti woke idiots. reasonable people who play games as a hobby and dont make it their entire ideology recognize that sony mostly makes quality games that are fun to play
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"as a non single player video game fan i'd say that sony doesnt deliver. on a personal level. the only game i really give a shit about from this list is bloodborne and it's not a first party game. i wouldnt want to play the other games even if i could get them for free right now. well i should clarify. i do like single player games, in fact most games i play are single player. but not single player stories or campaigns. roguelikes and strategy games sure. returnal is the only sony game i care about in recent years."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-06,in 2009 they had uncharted 2. it was the winner that year too.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"everyone knows goty is a circlejerk until it validates your opinion, then it's a flawless and objective judgement of quality"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"not only that but they're just not interesting games for the most part. or they're sequels, or cousins of other games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,how many goty editions does it take for people to notice?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"matpat has a good video about goty bias. basically it's all old dudes deciding the games so the picks are all cinematic dad games, which is exactly the type of game sony makes."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,they celebrate the developers too lmao. they litterally bring them up on stage and are personally handed the award every year
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,shoutout to microsoft's hifi rush for being nominated in other categories
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"per the psychonauts 2 docu though, ms buying double fine absolutely expanded the resources available for the game. it was only as good as it was because ms helped out, they definitely deserve the credit on that one."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"nintendo doesn't have one this year either, do they?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,xbox had forza horizon 5 and flight simulator in 2020 which were two of the highest rated games released that year and neither got a goty nomination because they're from niche genres.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i mean from this list nowadays the only exclusives are bloodborne and astrobot arent they?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"forza horizon 5 was the single highest rated game of 2021. ori will of the wisps wasn't nominated with no explanation given but presumed because it was too small with a 90 metacritic, same for ori and the blind forest with an 88, but stray was nominated with an 83. gears 5 84 and halo infinite 87 were not nominated, but death stranding 82 and ghost of tsushima 83 were nominated. there was no chance an xbox exclusive was ever going to get nominated at a show where the dorito pope chooses selection panel."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,whose game of the year is this? dont a ton of places release their versions? is there one that is definitive?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,deathloop was exclusive to ps5 for that year it wasn't. deathloop was a multiplatform release pc  ps5 in september 2021.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i still think we need to take a step back and appreciate microsoft once had a goty that was exclusive to playstation 5. this timeline is weird, man."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,do be fair regarding your last sentence they don't make any console only exclusives anymore.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,nintendo also missed this year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"death stranding probably shouldn't count as it's not sony exclusive, and isn't just published by sony."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,removed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,probably the geoff keighley show featuring geoff keighley and geoff keighley. but he did do a great job at making his awards show the definitive one also thanks to the name.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"the game awards, the by far biggest award type thing we have had going for the last 5 years? at least that's what i assumed because its the obvious one"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"agreed, seems like this is to just fill the vacuum left by no e3. these are just to drum up hype for whatever is next."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"it sort of replaced e3, so yeah, their awards seem to matter more to people now for some reason. i don't see any value in it, though it is nice when good developers like larian get their spotlight."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"an industry controlled by two companies might not technically be a monopoly, but it's certainly not healthy. the concerns about industry consolidation are a lot deeper than just the fanboy console wars."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,it was until recently.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,none of which are made by valve. edit downvote all you want. doesnt change facts.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"not really because bloodborne isn't just made on ps4, it's a sony intellectual property it's not just a game that fromsoft made on playstation, it's a sony game that fromsoft made for playstation same deal as demon's souls, fromsoft doesn't own either of those games' trademarks"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,they are listing sony published games. rebirth is from square enix as usual for the franchise.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"bloodborne like demon's souls are sony ips... sony didn't even want to release demon's souls in the west which is why it was published by atlus in the americas and namco in the europe. they did similar shit with earlier ps ips like devil dicebombastic xi  xi go for the ps12. sometimes they fund and cocreate great things and lock them in the closet until another publisher recognizes its worth and brings it out for the people to enjoy. sonys play with final fantasy and a lot of other 3rd party ips is the opposite, they throw some cash at the publisher in terms of marketing or lower license fees for the privilege of not releasing the content on other platforms. they have no ownership there just a fuck you contract to owners of other platforms."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"this is just first party stuff or else youd be seeing ff7, black myth, and alot of other exclusives here."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"in that same vein, should death stranding even be on that list as a sony nominee? kojima productions is an independent studio and ds is now on xbox."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,calling uncharted niche is wild. it sold 15 million copies.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"did you play rift apart? it was an excellent game. i'm not sure how you could call uncharted niche in any way, it's a third person shooter with puzzles. crystal dynamics made an entire trilogy of lara croft games, which the first two were great, almost based entirely around the same gameplay aspects. metaphor refantazio is nominated for goty and is about as niche a game as you could get. a lot of the categories are for specific genres too, do you want it to just be 16 awards for indie games? what are you even complaining about?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and spiderman 2 was completely mediocre.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"dude you bought and played most of these twice, and liked them enough to state you will be buying unreleased and unannounced future games, but they're not good? lol"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"sonys japan studio approached fromsoftware for a new game, it was a cooperative development."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,seems like they're just stating facts. like the fact that xbox hasn't dropped a game that's been nominated for like a decade
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,thats what she said
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,they owned the ip until just this year when kojima bought out his contract. i do agree it's kind of a grey area where more 3rd party though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,it was funded by sony.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"it was a playstation exclusive at launch, but was made by an independent team and has since come to pc and xbox."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"it's only referring to the game awards, which is generally the award show people mean when they don't reference a specific one."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,astrobot and metaphor refantazio are the best reviewed games this year and share the highest metacritic score of 94. no other game this year scored above 93
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,guess they werent good enough? i dont get the point of down casting games cause my favorite didnt make it. hell i didnt play balatro but with the way ppl spoke about it all year i aint gonna say it doesnt deserve it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"making consistent bangers for a whole decade and winning multiple goty awards isnt some mundane accomplishment, its the epitome of consistency"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,it's a platformer like super mario galaxy
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,same. not heard anything about it until i saw it was a nominee. thought it was one of those free demo things you get with sony and really didn't know what it was doing there
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,1st 3d platformer outside of nintendo to really hit the quality of mario imo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"meh, not really"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"nah, both those games are fantastic, and that's coming from someone who never played a previous ratchet game or astrobot game until these ones. they're both so well polished and pure fun to play."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i didn't enjoy god of war. i skipped out on astro bot
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,they definitely putting money in someones pocket
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,god of war won that year. and i believe tlos2 as well
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,the game awards hasn't been going since 1994 though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"out of about 14k games released each year, a list of 10 games is pretty short."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,this list is just sony owned ip nominees.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,youre not alone. couldnt care less about a single one of these titles
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,ip wasn't owned by playstation at the time of releaseit's why death stranding is on this list ff7r is a square enix game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,which one?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"i quite enjoyed bloodborne, tlous2, and uncharted 4. rift apart was quite fun, tho the game was a bit light."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"bloodborne maybe, but you are right about the others."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"there have been many winners and nominees that aren't cinematic and graphics heavy tho. but yes, sony does make a lot of cinematic heavy games. from that list tho, bloodborne and astrobot are very different from the rest."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,what games do u like?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,hey if you want to play on pc thats perfectly fine!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,who cares
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"with thier new timed exclusivity policy, it's probably a matter of time before astro bot comes to pc. no comment on the other one though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"there are several very valid and legitimate reasons to dislike the game or find it boring, but calling it walking simulator  ''i didn't play the game and i'm not basing my opinion on what the game actually offers''. it's more of a logistics planning game like eurotruck simulator but in the apocalypse, with horror touches, tons of unlockable futuristic devices to tame the terrain and optimize your deliveries, an innovative asynchronous multiplayer system, and fights against bandits, terrorists, antimatter ghosts, lovecraftian tar monsters and sometimes skeleton soldiers revived from the world wars."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,exclusives are the reason that sony is dominating the console market. seems like a pretty good reason to me.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"there is a business reason to have them. say i wanted spiderman, id have to buy a playstation when it released. and now that i have a playstation, what am i also going to buy? the other exclusives. sony continues to get a cut from software because you now are in their ecosystem. you dont have an incentive to buy all of their games if youre not invested into the hardware to play them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,exclusives allow for games to be developed faster and better. having to optimize for a particular set of hardware is a huge advantage in that process. it should allow for better games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i think as a publisher, sony is the best in terms of the quality of games that come from them and their owned studios. if they released their games to all platforms, they would sell so many games, it wouldn't matter about playstation or not. people who like playing on consoles will still buy them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"well when you have money and own a massive portion of the industry this reminds more of microsoft xbox, do you know the 75 billion dollar activision acquisition is the biggest gaming acquisition of all time and the only comparable acquisition in the entire entertainment industry was disney buying fox in 2019. xbox has more dev studios than playstation and nintendo combined."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,ms is proof owning the market and having all the money don't mean shit if you have 0 talent.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i would love to hear what you find good games then with ur incredible and divine taste.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"you say that like it should be expected, but no other publisher has achieved that not even nintendo"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"platform exclusive? most of these are on pc now, just still owned by sony."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,sony owns the vast majority of the studios that made the games though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"bloodborne was made in collaboration between sony japan studio and fromsoft. sony also owns the ip. guerrilla gamessony studio helped with death stranding, it was also developed using their engine. sony owned the ip, but they transferred the rights to kojima this year. all the other games came from their own studios"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"santa monica studios god of war, naughty dog uncharted, the last of us, team asobi astro bot, insomniac games ratchet and clank, spiderman, guerilla games horizon, killzone all fall under playstation studios. so yeah, sony made most of these games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,bloodborne and death stranding are the only 2 where sony had no say. all other games are made by children studios of ps.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,literally every game listed here expect for bloodborne is from a playstation studio
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"largest console in the world paid to have good exclusives that mostly didn't win goty isn't as good a headline, i suppose."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"death stranding is more like eurotruck simulator but in the apocalypse, with horror touches, realistic traversal and management mechanics that no other game has, tons of unlockable features, tools, weapons, exoskeletons, vehicles, accesories and infrastructure types to optimize your deliveries, fights against bandits, terrorists, antimatter ghosts, lovecraftian tar monsters and skeleton soldiers revived from the world wars, and an asynchronous multiplayer system in which players collaborate with each other by leaving ladders or climbing anchors, building bridges, roads, safehouses, watchtowers, recharging points, ziplines, donating gear and materials, signaling dangers and points of interest, returning lost cargo, even during boss fights another player's character can emerge from the ground to give you weapons and healing items."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,if that was the case why is balatro nominated this year lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,journs and shills
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,not sonys list. the game awards.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"have you played it? it has 92 positive user reviews on steam, the majority of people who actually played it enjoyed it, that's why it's getting a sequel. obviously there are seas of people who don't like it, some for very legitimate and valid reasons but many others just for prejudices and absurdly reductionist memes that don't even correctly portray what the game has to offer."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-05,one of the highest ranked games of all time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,agreed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"you would think so but no other publisher has achieved this, even nintendo missed 2016,2018, and 2024"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"the only actual good game here is bloodborne, the rest are meh 'movie' games..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,not a sony product. an activision product.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,not even ps exclusive
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,xbox fanboy here. i'm happy for playstation owners they got to enjoy these great games. i'm still waiting for the new fable..
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,the logistics planning game is bad when it's actually a logistics planning game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and whats this imaginary narrative?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,yes
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,so having a platform for indies and well some games like baldurs gate is trash gotsha let them rot
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"calling death stranding a walking simulator  ''i didn't play the game and i'm not basing my opinion on what the game actually has to offer''. although it's valid and respectable if a postapocalyptic logistics planning game with shooting action, horror touches and many unconventional gimmicks is not your cup of tea at all."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"like give them a category where they can shine, but none of the games are truly addicting, which was what games use to be."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,id bet you cash money that its going to win quite a few game of the year awards when all is said and done.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"playstation exclusive franchise. i didn't realise there had been many astrobot games until recently. it's weird this one is being nominated because it is actually the same game they've made many times, this one just has references to a lot of different sony franchises."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,its a start to finish mario rip off
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,they give their dev studios the creative freedom to risk a new ip every generation instead of relying on a ip just because its successful. sucker punch sly cooperinfamousghost of tsushima naughty dog  jak and daxterps2unchartedps3 the last of usps34 guerilla games  killzoneps3horizonps4

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"it's nominations, not winners"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,nominee
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,these are nominees not winners.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i think they are referring to nominations
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"nintendo had both botw and mario odyssey nominated for goty in 2017. if the company delivered, they should be rewarded  beside, every year sony had 2 games nominated, both were great games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"they are referring to nominees for the game awards top prize, of which there are usually 56 nominated games. of the games listed above only god of war 2018  the last of us, part ii have actually won the award with astro bot as a pending given the awards this year are next week."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"this lists nominees not winners, god of war did win that year tho"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i actually played all of my old games during the lockdown
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i saw a post earlier that said it was 5 years today they found the first case of rona. crazy to think half a decade passed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,those 2 years blur together for me
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"there will be but from that leak awhile back, its looking like rc will have a new game every start of a new generation like a launch title which as a big rc fan, sucks"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,there damm well better be. or at least make the old games playable natively. my internet sucks and i cant effectively stream them. and the less said about trying to emulate them on pc. the better.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,the devs put out spiderman 2 after but i think the leak showed that the devs are basically gonna be a marvel studio for the next decade
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i played both so my timeline is all sorts of confused. the ps version feels more recent and the pc version feels like it's been longer.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,amen
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,but then how will i know who my mom is sleeping with? there's apparently a lot of people...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"also, multiplayer games only have a shelf life of a few years until the player base moves on to the next call of duty. the game of the year award typically goes to something more timeless that can be played again in a few years. so you can actually play the goty 2014."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,im still missing good old couch coop though
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,gascoigne inters the chat
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,deleted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,considering that most people play multiplayer most people are fine dealing with it. im pretty sure people playing multiplayer games just dont give a fuck about these awards. i mean i havent seen anything from most of the games on this list.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,people like competition and playing with friends. idk that's how i feel these days
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"as an extrovert working from home, gaming is one of my social times. so single player games really aren't something i'm interested and they really just seem lonely. i'm glad others find enjoyment in it though. i'm guessing it's a good recharge moment for many."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,some people find facing another human opponent mentally engaging
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,100 i just recently started playing wow again after almost 10 years i know... only because they've finally introduced actual singleplayer end game content. you can run regular dungeons with a team of npc's or do delves by yourself or with a single friend. it's so much more enjoyable when you don't have to play with a group full of tryhards that exist purely to shit on people that don't spend every waking moment minmaxing their characters and playstyles.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"man but that is part of the fun of playing online games listening to hateful morans talk utter nonsense is always a good laugh. don't let some 13yearold call of duty shitter ruin games for you. that means the troll has won, well in their eyes."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i love toxicity, i don't take it too seriously."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,worked for overwatch year 1 !!!!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"yeah, i almost divorced my wife playing overcooked and it takes two. back to single player for me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,ok but i like my coop 14 player games. and i think more single player games should add the option like halo to play with friends.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"chuckles in the last of us 2. i hated it, but the insanity on the pro vs against is over the top."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,when you can enjoy your own toxicity.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,why deal with the toxicity of people when you can use it to balance game like yugioh did.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"this. not only can they make really fun single player games, i do t have to listen to some 12 year old screaming horribly offensive words for ten minutes straight."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,this is why i stuck with nintendo. single player and local coop for the win.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"sir, we are on reddit."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,it's not like they're not desperately trying to capture the multiplayer scene
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,not just that but a pause button goes a long way
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,ea singleplayer games are dead
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,true fucking story.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"after a decade of dota 2  csgo around a combined 12k hrs i thought i was getting tired of gaming. quit online games, started sekiro, hzd, hollow knight, hades, etc and realized i still loved gaming very much, i was just completely done with the toxicity of esports titles. i've exclusively played single player games since 2022 and it's been the most fun i've had since discovering diablo 2 as a kid not knowing shit but having fun. recently played an online game for around 34 weeks and deadlock was fun as hell but i'm already done with it and back to single player games lol"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,they should stop making every multiplayer game an mmo. maybe i just want to play a single player game but with a friend.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,imagine having to pay extra to enjoy the toxicity of people
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"that's where i've been lately, for the most part. wow classic refresh has been reminding me why."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-06,because multiplayer games are just more fun and challenging tbh
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,you can also have friends.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and even overwatch winning came with lots of criticism as overwatch didn't have the most nominations that year but won anyway.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,it takes two ?!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,baldur's gate 3 has a very robust multiplayer including splitscreen but it's not competitive multiplayer if that's what you mean.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"there was also it takes two, that wasnt single player"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,it takes two and baldurs gate 3
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,true
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"also most reviewers can only spend relatively little time per game, leading to easier story driven games getting higher scores."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,even halo and gears are usually touted for their single player campaigns over their multiplayer. in halo's heyday i would very much disagree with this. the single player campaigns were fantastic for sure...but that is absolutely not why most people bought it or what most people were talking about during halo 13 or even beyond. you can laud the single player experience while still recognizing the majority of its buzz was due to the multiplayer.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"yeah, i mean, wtf would playstation have on there? they don't make multiplayer games often. the only ones in recent time i can think of is concord and helldivers."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,because some random exec once said that it's better to focus on multiplayer than singleplayer and reddit gamers felt so insulted they can't let it go years later
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,concord
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"in 2023 they publicly announced their focus would be live service multiplayer games httpswww.polygon.com22914172sonyplaystationbungieacquisitionnewliveservicegames they planned to launch 12 live service in like 3 years. ryan adds the way people play games has changed a lot over the last few years. we have created some wonderful properties over the course of the last 25 years, with characters that people love and resonate the world over. offering the opportunity to enjoy those experiences in a completely different way is something that we are very excited about. httpswww.gamesindustry.bizplaystationbungiewillconsiderablyaccelerateourjourneywithmultiplatformliveservicegames"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"single player exclusives move consoles. probably true, but consoles are usually sold at cost or even cheaper, so moving more of them isn't worth much. there's a reason playstation titles are going crossplatform and xbox is abandoning the idea of a distinct console."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i mean honestly xboxs first upcoming first party output looks really good imo. i know the general consensus is that their finished and all their games are going multiplatform, but until it actually starts happening en masse i still think its pretty worth it to support what they got. i mean, other then gears eday and state of decay 3 and even then both start out as single player games, a lot of their first party exclusives are single player. with at least avowed, south of midnight, and fable confirmed for this year, with other stuff like perfect dark, clockwork revolution, outer worlds 2, od etc. maybe im just being a dumb fanboy, idk but i personally think theres plenty to be excited for."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"agree. look how many units nintendo moves because of the new zelda, mario, pokemon, or other mainline series release. on the other hand, xbox has always wanted to compete in the multiplayer arena. i personally stick with playstation because i prefer single player, storydriven games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"sony pictures understands movies, do they? madam web is a flop and just 7 years ago sony was very close to selling off their studio division after like 8 flops in a row. let's not act like theyre a blue chip studio pushing out hit after hit."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,it's the other way around. kadokawa fromsoft parent is facing a hostile takeover from a chinese company and went to sony to get ahead of it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"the people behind morbius, madame web and venom does not understands movies thoo."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,they don't have a deal with rockstar. the game is also coming out on xbox. going with consoles first was the devs choice
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,you say that but people play multiplayer games way more. people that have friends at least.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,4 is close because the story and gameplay are better. but that uncharted 2 pacing is just unmatched
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"yeah the spectacle might have gotten a little too grand imo. but 2 was the perfect upgrade to 1, which was fine but nothing special. the set pieces, solid gameplay and awesome mp, and extras like playing with 0 gravity or fat drake lol was so fun. plus, the graphics looked so insane back in the ps3 days."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,2020 was some bullshit goddamn
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"my assessment that nobody asked for 2015 bloodborne robbed 2016 doom robbed, inside would have been acceptable too. 2017 i'd have picked p5 but i can't say robbed here botw definitely earned its place. and odyssey honestly would have been a fair pick too, year was kinda stacked. 2018 my pick would have been mh world, or maybe celeste, but i can't really find fault in giving it to gow. 2019 control sadly had to go up against sekiro, wish it could have gotten a goty but... sekiro was the correct pick. 2020 what the actual fuck. in a year that stacked you pick the only incorrect option. everyone was robbed. 2021 i'm.... actually not familiar with this year it seems, i'd have picked metroid but only because idk about the rest. 2022 man stray and plague tale were so good but... yeah elden ring. unfortunate for those two they had to fight er for the crown. ragnarok was also worth a shout but i think it was against a lot more and higher quality competition than gow 2018. 2023 super stacked year... but it doesn't matter because bg3 is in the list, a game that could have won any year on this list with ease."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,was it controversial that bg3 won instead of totk? i can't recall the discourse last year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"just looking at which ones could have been reasonable choices as winners 2015  witcher 3 or bloodborne 2016  only overwatch 2017  only breath of the wild, though horizon zero dawn or mario odyssey could be winners in another year 2018  god of war or red dear redemption 2, even though celeste is a perfect game 2019  only sekiro except maaaybe smash ultimate if you squint 2020  the last of us 2 or ghosts of tsushima or hades what a year 2021  i guess it takes two but jeeze 2022  only elden ring 2023  only baldurs gate 3"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"yeah, the horizon series has a track record of releasing extremely close to the biggest and most hyped game of the year. i love the horizon series and feel fully confident that horizon 3 will be released the same day as a surprise collaboration between fromsoftware and nintendo for their game zelda link to the erd tree, written by a resurrected tolkien."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"ps2 was the actual innovation era. ps3 was the beginning of the modern triple a market. further, ps3 actively inhibited developers because of its much more arcane and closed requirements. hence why we have never had a port of metal gear solid 4 unlike the first three ps2 games, because it was designed to work with ps3 hardware and that made porting it a massive headache. compare the ease of transition for example from ps4 to ps5 generally smooth frontports, compared to ps3 to ps4 needed its own emulation service."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"as much as id like to see microsoft step it back up to their glory days of the 360 era, i just dont see it. theyve had multiple chances to catch back up and reclaim a foothold by acquiring multiple studios, only to close them afterwards, and every time they try to bring a classic franchise back to prominence halo infinite, or introduce a new one starfield, it seems like they take one confident step forward, and if theyre lucky only one step back."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"meh, i own all the consoles and still spend a lot of time on my sx. gamepass is the best gaming deal available today. nintendo and sony digital prices are ridiculous and whilst ps is better than it was it still lacks a lot of exclusives sadly which is all i want from it. plus a few decent gems over the last few years from ms backed studios too imo. just because they aren't console exclusives people dismiss them. people always apply the wrong metric which is sales, without realising that microsoft still move a ton of units given they have always predominantly struggled in the east and sonynintendo have heritage"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,rather have game developers instead of more consoles.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i feel like something went wrong with bloodborne, because if it wasn't the case, fromsoftware would have made a sequel, a port andor a remaster by now. instead, they went with dark souls 3, sekiro and elden ring. those aren't bad games, but a port or a remaster wouldn't have taken most of the team to do, like they could have dedicated a few people to port the game on pc while the rest would have worked on the other games. we... are getting close to bloodborne's 10year anniversary o they did use bloodborne at the end of their 30thanniversary video, so... maybe there's hope"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"microsoft is prioritizing availability, having the most games from the most studios, and then offering as many as possible in their gamepass service in order to become the netflix of gaming. honestly i think its a winning strategy because i havent needed to buy games for years, and im playing a wider variety than i did before, as well as discovering some hidden gems that i would have never otherwise played. even their cloud gaming is coming along great. while i wouldnt use it for something like cod, i regularly play it for slower paced games on my quest 3 while lying in bed."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,the downvotes are probably because no one assumed they would be in game of the year? they barely make games so why would they be there? your comment doesn't add anything. not just valve fanboys or whatever.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,you played baldurs gate 3 right?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,see i want games to be available on all platforms so i can play with whom ever i want. they make good games except concord. higher quality is not really true as we have seen much better titles come out from smaller studios like baulders gate 3 from laurian studios. sony has good games yes. corporations like sony destroy the quality of games over time. the profits always need to go up. this is why we are seeing studios shut down. studios need to be smaller and create good games without messing them up with corporate over sight.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,yeah they would give them more sales and help finance bigger games but it is what it is w sony being wierd
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"ok? but sony does have talent, 910 sony games are great, i was just saying the bad ones get treated the same as the good. spiderman 2 was to put it nicely, bad but it still got shoehorned into awards when other games very obviously did better."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"actually sony had 100 say on both of those games and ip and still do for bloodborne. they just this year sold the death stranding ip back to kojima, and they can do whatever they want with bloodborne with or without fromsofts permission or input. it would be pointless and stupid but they could give any dev studio and have them release bloodborne 2 if they wanted to"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,and those are the best two on the list.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"bloodborne was actually codeveloped with a playstation studio and they own the ip, it isnt a stretch to call the game itself a first party game"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,death stranding was from kojima studios which is independent from sony. they had a contract for ds and kojima fully owns the rights again as of this year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,don't be sad that no xbox exclusives made it to the list

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,that's a fair take. i haven't played it but i've watched a playthrough online for a while. it's not my type of game. but i'm glad it's being more well recieved than it once was. i like hideo kojima and norman reedus.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i think the last of us fans are mad at me.  uncharted is like a 7. it's not bad but it's not goty worthy of any year.  walking simulator is a 5 if you didn't want to watch a movie. if you like watching your games play themselves than i can see this being a 10. it can't be those that did it people must be mad i scorned last of us part 2. i didn't even rip into it.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,nominations arent a vote
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"ironically, there's more overwatch porn than people playing overwatch 2 right now"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i really wouldn't say that's mp. it's basically a tradtional single player games designed around coop. most mp games aren't considered because they lack story elements.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,maybe nonpvp is more accurate
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,yea but the point is that goty awards talked about campaign more than online
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,or what most people were talking about during halo 13 or even beyond. halo 1 and 2 didn't have the online multiplayer base in the slightest. most people definitely played the campaign more than anything else.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,definitely not making multiplayer games anytime soon after the last one
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,bless you for finally figuring out the real question i was asking.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,the strategy shift that brought us concord
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,nowhere did they say they would focus on live service. the majority of their ongoing projects are single player games. of those 12 included gt and mlb.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"which is fucking stupid and i think might be start of the decline of sony. sonys brand is built upon high quality single player games. a lot of the people that buy sony consoles are single player gamers that like their single player games. to completely ditch that to go to live service is basically alienating the type of people that buy your console. im guessing they recognized this was an overall bad decision and thats why factions and the spiderman live service was cancelled. yes they need some live service games so they have a secure moneymaker that allows them to pump out high quality single player games, since costs of games keep rising. however to turn all their brands into live service shit was dumb from the beginning. last 4 sony games, only 1 was the usual sony good quality. concord was the biggest flop in triple a gaming history. the until dawn remake got questionable reviews, and same with the lego horizon game. astro bot was the only one of the games that you would expect from sony. they might be fucked and there is no right answer. they clearly want to shift away from single player games because dev costs keep going up which makes them to risky to make. however out of any dev or publisher on the planet, sony is known for its single player titles. they are literally built around that market."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"playstation is going cross platform because they recognize they can profit from pc players who continually ask for their games to be made available to them. they have been successful in their ecosystem and recognize that they can profit even more from pc players who quite literally demand their products. yes you are right, consoles are typically sold at a loss, thats what makes exclusives so important. they are the incentive to invest in a specific console. similar to what i said about exclusives move consoles. xbox is abandoning distinct consoles because theirs have been underselling by comparison and need to offer up their products across the market to remain profitable after purchasing the largest casual gaming market for close to 70 billion. the difference is sony has done well in their contained ecosystem and now they are pandering to pc players while microsoft needs to offer their products everywhere to help them turn over a profit after spending way too much of the companys monopoly money to make overpriced purchases."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,avowed and clockwork revolution might move the needle for me. those look good from what i saw. but will they stay exclusive? microsofts strategy now is taking the moral high road and make their games multi platform. nvm you that they are double dipping in profit margins because they recognize that in order for gamepass to continually release quality day one exclusives they need to sell games as well as take in subscription money. im worried xbox is going to be more about profits than quality experiences like ubisoft or ea became. the examples you provide do help dissolve those worries a bit.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"one thing i've appreciated about the games microsoft has put out over the past generation is the fact that they seem to be taking risks with the games they put out. yeah, they've released a lot of stinkers and haven't really managed to achieve sony's level of quality when it comes to their games, but just look at the kind of games they put out this gen. we've gotten multiple flight simulators, multiple rts titles, a wonderful survival crafting game grounded, a multiplayer pirate fps sea of thieves, several smaller scale rpgs from obsidian, as well as a game like psychonauts 2, which in all likelihood wouldn't exist if microsoft didn't purchase double fine. meanwhile when i look over at sony's first party titles while i see nothing but great games, i also see almost nothing but single player third person action games. that isn't necessarily a bad thing, and those titles would absolutely make me pick up a playstation over an xbox. i just appreciate that xbox seems to be letting developers take risks rather than be stuck in the back half of the 360 era where everything was just gears of war, halo, and forza."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,right? sony has a couple exceptional movies surrounded by an ocean of garbage. the gaming division is probably the only thing keeping them afloat. even then i'd argue it's not even thanks to a superior platform. they simply own the right devs and have the recognizable brand
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"sony can afford to gamble on bad movies, it's part of their strategy. but acting like they haven't delivered absolute bangers like spiderman into the spiderverse, venom, bullet train, elysium, or even the delightful chaos of cloudy with a chance of meatballs? that's willful ignorance. heres the thing, sharknado 7 isnt a masterpiece that demanded sequels. it exists because studios can milk tax writeoffs from movies that bomb just hard enough. its not about the audience, it's about the balance sheet. when you're as rich as sony, bad movies arent failures. theyre calculated losses, paving the way for even bigger wins on the projects they actually care about. it's the cinematic equivalent of throwing a pawn to protect the queen."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i mean... if you're a game studio and you run to sony to save you, than sony it's probably the preferable game studio you would want to work for."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,those are called tax writeoffs. that's how spiderman across the spider verse and the new venom movie can be fantastic with extra funding. lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"he said marketing deal, which means ps gets all the commercials, if that matters to you"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"they don't have a deal with rockstar. yes they do. look it up.httpsm.imdb.comnewsni64805121 there's even rumors of sony acquiring take two, rockstar's parent company. but that's just a rumor. the game is also coming out on xbox. and spiderman is and horizen zerodawn are now on microsoft pc.... they are allowed to release games on other platforms...xbox purchased bethesda, but elder scrolls 6 will still be on playstation. what's your point? i'm just saying sony makes good games and having that sony money to support these studios will be nice. sony is pretty good about giving studios the money and funding they need, and just leaving the artist alone to create their true art."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"people that have friends at least. you say this as if the modern multiplayer games weren't designed around matchmaking complete strangers with each other. i'm not sure there's any correlation between having friends and playing popular multiplayer games, and i'm certainly not confident which direction that correlation would point."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"playing a game more doesnt necessarily mean you enjoy the game itself more. personally my enjoyment in multiplayer games come largely from the social aspect, whereas i only play single player games if i really want to play that game itself. i can only speak for myself, but ive hopped on a game countless times for countless hours that i didnt necessarily feel like playing at that moment, but did anyway because some buddies hopped on."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i don't think they bought bloodborne. sony approached from to make a game for them, so they own the ip"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"nah thats literally the microsoft playbook. sony at least releases games, even if they stay console exclusive forever. i cant remember the last time i was excited for a microsoft game release. maybe gears of war 3 was the last time"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,others addressed that sony didn't buy the ip and sit on it but also sometimes things don't need 27 sequels.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"yeah but i really wonder what they're getting from that. from a financial perspective, there's absurd amonuts of money to be made. instead, they remaster demon's souls..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"you are thinking of bethesda the studio, the stat refers to bethesda the publisher which has way more games than fromsoft"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"this is about bethesda as a publisher which would include the games from id software, machine games, arkane etc. in fact, of the 4 games counted here, only one was developed by bethesda game studios."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"we may be confusing bethesda the publisher which has many more games than 4 in the past 13 years and bethesda the studio. based on the ops description, i had assumed their list refers to bethesda the publisher, but i could be mistaken."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"yet, the scale of that achievement really depends on the competition too. this is especially true for this years nominees in my opinion, not that these nominees arent all fantastic games, but lets be honest here, most of these wouldnt have stood a chance against games like breath of the wild, elden ring proper, god of war"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"personally god of war is one of my favorite games ever. its in my all time top 5, so i dont see the problem."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"you know you could say this in 2018, but really in hindsight? rdr2 is a big large rockstar level game, but it's not as great a game as people make it out to be, it's a large game, sure. the story is a bit repretative, almost every mission 34ths of them become shooty bang bang. you shoot up a town multiple times, you rob a train multiple times, and so on. god of war though was excellent from beginning to end, it had a new level of story telling who was expecting it to explore kratos as a father after the first three games, and excellent world, an exploration of a new mythos, and a fantastic ending. it was game of the year."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i like both games but i don't think there is any justification for saying rdr2 should have won. i really love that game but it was so boring to play at times and the combat was completely void of any character compared to other 3rd person shooters that i really struggle to see how people can say it should have won over gow 2018 when that game has one of the best single player gameplay loops in recent memory. they both had great story's, both had amazing side characters, amazing worlds etc. but quite frankly only gow had the gameplay to back it up."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"rdr2 felt like 80 of a game because the world was very obviously not finished and parts of it were more or less abandoned. gow was 100 of a game, plus some extra."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"it's because red dead is a boring game. great story, characters, everything. but the actual gameplay is pure tedium."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"rdr2 has some stuff that was really good and some that was bad. gow was, overall, better, even though the good parts of gow were worse than the good parts of rdr2."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i dont. think back how many fanboys there are for gow due to gow 13. and gow 2018 is bringing kratos back. watch the sony video for gow2018 winning goty. they have some fan interactions, i cant imagine red dead getting that kind of attention."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,my response was to toxicity in online multiplayer. it doesn't imply that people who play single player have no friends.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"used to play pvp fps games for 8 years straight, now the only pvp you'll me doing is racing games. i'd rather play more chill single player games or online games then sweat my ass off and get stressed."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,you mean were redditors. gamers usually have friends
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"if the environment of a game is toxic control it. i only play helldivers, darktide, cod with my friends. if it's still toxic you're surrounded by assholes."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i know most people have soured on ow but i also think it was deserved. it had a huge impact and was amazing it's first year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"tbf elden ring was released in february and gow ragnarok in november. er would probably have more conversation around it even if they were released at the same time, but still"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,ragnarok had incredible pacing and acting and writing as well. it flowed like an incredible epic action story. elden ring is amazing in it's own ways but is best experienced in your own path carving your own way. and essentially has no writing or acting performances besides one off characters and boss intros. and deep lore for the writing.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,ludicrous. it's absolutely multiplayer it's just not pvp. it literally can't be played singleplayer.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,there is also baldurs gate 3 that can be multiplayer not pvp and of course elden ring
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"sure, i don't know much about goty's focus or bias on that. i'm only disagreeing with the quoted statement above that halo was usually touted for its single player campaigns over their multiplayer."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"hahaha, absolutely not. key word you used there is online but that's not all of multiplayer. halo 1 and 2 were the games for lan parties throughout the series. hell even its wiki page says halo 1 is widely considered one of the best multiplayer games of all time. i lived through that era everyone played halo multiplayer long before halo 3, halo 3 is just when online multi was its huge thing. but people were obsessed with the multiplayer over the single player long before then."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"the gaming division is probably the only thing keeping them afloat. lol, no. sony makes great phones, cameras, tvs, audio and musical engineering equipment, ect. video games aren't even their specialty and they still do it better than most. because they are a dominant force in the tech industry is exactly why they have a dominant console in the first place."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"the gaming division is probably the only thing keeping them afloat. that's not true, the music record label makes them more profit than the gaming divisionhttpswww.statista.comstatistics912798sonyoperatingincomebysegment. the gaming division is second and the camera and entertainment hardware businesses are third and fourth in terms of profit, respectively.  they simply own the right devs and have the recognizable brand they have the recognizable brand because they built it from the ground up and know how to nurture new developers and build them into powerhouses. look at naughty dog and insomniac, which were both making lower budget platformers during the ps2 era and are now releasing criticallyacclaimed blockbusters. invalidating this and acting like they got there by chance is weird considering microsoft has significantly more resources than sony and still can't compete with them in gaming."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"this is what i have been telling people as well. kakodawa is going to be bought no matter what, and sony is the best way for them to go tencent is the next big buyer, for example."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,red dead's problems is that it's too bloated. the campaign is way too long for it's own good.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"and some of the flaws are huge, unignorable, and completely pervasive. down to the very basics like controlling your character is clunky and unfun. and there needs to be a better gameplay loop than 'go to place, shoot 30 people, leave place to go to another place.'"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,which game are you talking about?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"that makes some people not want to play the game this argument falls a little bit flat considering that rdr2 has sold 67 million units and is the 6th best selling game of all time. for as popular as god of war was, if even only a third of the people who bought rdr2 wanted to play the game, it still had more people who wanted to play the game than god of war... rdr2 has been a monumentally popular game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i think it's because rdr2 was a much more popular game than gow with nearly 3x the sales. so i don't think it's so crazy for people to assume that would reflect in awards.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"the length of rdr2 is one of my favorite parts tbh. it added a lot to the world and characters and made the emotional moments hit a lot harder. i would disagree with it feeling empty, maybe if you compare it to a linear game like god of war but for an open world game, the world felt very alive and there were always unique moments wherever you went. its not for everyone but for the right audience me rdr2 is basically perfect, ive spent hundreds of hours doing nothing but hunting, fishing, gambling, taking care of my horses, robbing, and just riding around looking at the world."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"rdr2 had better story and character writing, better world design, and more attention to detail across the board. gow had more engaging active gameplay on average though. still red dead was the better game by a long shot."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,gow 2018 is a good storybased action game. rdr2 is a creative masterpiece.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i think we have different ideas of what makes a game. like how exactly did you find so much of the game not finished or abandoned? likeseriously?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i donthow does the amount of fanboys and attention add up to own games quality being better then the other?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,plus add the amount of attention rdr2 still gets critically and analytically. sure gow also has a story and themes that could and have been looked and discussedbut to the level of rdr2? id be real surprised if that was actually the case.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"i think it has an incredible story one of the best ive ever seen. ive been a fan of the series since the first game and seeing the evolution of kratos going from a vengeful hate filled monster hellbent on killing everybody who did him wrong or simply was in his way to a father who is desperately trying to keep that person on the inside from getting out was gripping. his character growth felt earned. even in the original games this was a man who was tortured by his past he was never just some dumb rageaholic like some insinuate, his repeated betrayal by the gods fundamentally broke him as a person. i mean even the first scene in the entire series is him trying to kill himself. the scene in 2018 gow where he retrieves the blades of chaos and he speaks to the ghost of athena and tells her i am your monster no longer is one of the best scenes in gaming, to see kratos finally throw off the shackles of his past was phenomenal. i also think the gameplay was just way more innovative and entertaining than rdr2, while rockstar has changed virtually nothing about their combat system since gta iv. i also believe the soundtrack was better in gow, not to say rdr2 has a bad soundtrack its a great soundtrack but bear mccreary put together a soundtrack that even howard shore would be proud of. there were so many times where i was just in awe of his compositions in that game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"woahreally?? genuinely asking here, like for real? what puts it there for you?   dont get me wrong i think its a great game as well, but top 5? i'm not sure if it's top 5 for me, but i've been playing video games for over 30 years and have beaten countless games i can't remember... if gow 2018 isn't in my top 5, it's just outside the only games i know i would put ahead of it are oot and ct. i thought the storytelling and writing was phenomenal. as the other person indicated, kratos showed he wasn't just an angry rage monster and learned to grow while seeking to atone. the world was beautiful. i'm not a huge open world fan but enjoyed exploring the world and seeing what it offered. the combat was challenging but was never aggravatingly so and was fun from start to finish. if someone that never played video games asked for a recommendation for games are works of art, gow is on the shortlist."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"the entire western portion of the map is like they ran out of budget, and after chapter 4 is seems pretty clear they started accelerating things to push the missions through areas that are not nearly as well fleshed out as others guarma, van horn, etc that still have elements of abandoned storylines, side quests, etc that are indicative of rushing to complete something and not having the time to clean up those old loose ends."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,the entire epilogue area is basically a big empty map only consisting of animals to hunt. and the whole island area of the story is just lame. the combat is pretty bad too.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"because goty isnt only about game quality? 90 of the vote is done by jury and 10 done by fans. think about the backlash that can be caused by the louder fanbase. thats possibly something the juries have to take into account. and even then, if the juries just prefer gow over red dead 2, then its simple as that. the winners are determined between the jury 90 and public voting 10. according to their wiki."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,lol i'm assuming you're joking but i genuinely loved miles. it was shorter than other triple aaa games but it was cheaper and still longerhigher quality than plenty of other games at that price point.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i did absolutely loved the ongoing side missions though. doing side missions with an npc that was part 3 of 9. made the side quests feel important as compared to just being a one off thing that happened. very clever. i'm surprised we're not seeing more open world games attempt this.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"yeah i just finished ghost on pc a few weeks ago, and while it is a gorgeous game with great art direction and some really clever navigation mechanics, i was pretty bored with it halfway through. the only thing i started looking forward to was finding new scenery to enjoy. otherwise, the entire game is basically run into random banditsmongols on the road, kill them, then speak to your friend to continue side quest where you... kill more mongols. most new, openworld games are pretty barebones like this i suppose while they build out their world and mechanics, but i was barely engaged for the last 20 hours of that game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,its just opinions lol they are all good.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"none of the games that were nominated that year were bad. dread was amazing, village and psychonaughts were both very good, and deathloop was a great premise but i found got a touch stale after 30 hours. the only game i found to not be worth a nomination is ironically the winner it takes two. the problem with that year is that, imo, any nominee from any other year would have likely won the award that year. ff7 or ghost of tsushima gets delayed or horizon or xc3 release earlier? sure win."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"the discourse around that game was such a mess thanks to an influx of culture war tourists trying to either attack or defend it, but i found tlou2 to be an absolutely miserable experience. one of the reviews i saw on youtube called it a petty revenge story filled with shitty unlikable people and compared it to things like the last jedi and game of thrones season 8 and i couldn't have agreed more. almost nothing about the game's narrative worked for me. it's 20ish hours of misery porn that i wish i had never played."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"it's incredibly deep and polished, just in a genre that we would normally not see a top tier game take over the cultural zeitgeist. definitely worth playing."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"i just wrote that definition  as i said in my first comment, it's okay for people to dislike it for legitimate reasons, but if you say that the game is exclusively about walk everywhere you clearly didn't played it for 40 hours, that's the length of the main story alone, you would have seen bosses, enemies, vehicles and everything i mentioned and more."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"if after the first few hours you are walking everywhere instead of using vehicles, raiding enemy camps to farm resources and building infrastructure to facilitate your deliveries, you are doing something deeply wrong, did you stay in the tutorial area for dozens of hours or something?"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,i think some people just expect every main story quest in a single player game to be mission impossible the entire way. imho those are just adhd teenagers used to high octane cod campaigns or some shit. sometimes single play rpg's and action rpgs need slower pacing at times to have dialogue with new characters and build relationships. such as atreus and angrboda going around the realm on her little quest. and so forth. i am okay with all of this. its developing a well written story with fully fleshed out characters etc.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,ive been playing it a lot recently since they did a halo 2 throwback playlist halo 2 maps and settings adjusted to make it play more like halo 2 and its super fun. infinite had a really rough launch and while its not the best halo game the current multiplayer experience is fun and active enough to be a good time. i still usually pick it over the sweatfest that mcc has become and the more or less dead game that 5 is.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,yeah cause then it would be mostly cod with a random hogwarts legacy last year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"ok, but the argument from the person i was replying to was makes some people not want to play the game. which is the same thing as people buying the game because they want to play it. his post implies more people wanted to play god of war, which is just a logical fallacy. far more people want to play rdr2 than god of war. if that's the criteria, then rdr2 is the clear winner. if it's not a valid criteria, then saying it as an argument for god of war makes no sense. this is why i said his argument fell flat. rdr was also an amazing critical success and has a better review score than god of war too. we aren't talking about call of duty here."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-04,"ok, so rdr2 actually sold 67 million not 50, so thats 16.75 million people who finished a game that takes 50 hours on average to beat. as opposed to 10.6 million people who finished a game that takes 21 hours on average to beat? think its pretty fair to say a lot of people enjoyed the shit out of rdr2. 60 more people beat a game that was over twice as long god of war had a high completion rate due to being relatively short for an open world game campaign. 25 for rdr2 is still a very strong completion rate for a long game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,that is problably because gow trophies list was really short and easy.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"this isnt a popularity contest. it's almost as if i was responding to a guy who had the argument of makes some people not want to play the game which has to do with if the people playing the game are liking it. yes, some people may not want to play the game. a hell of a lot more people do want to play the game, so the argument that some people don't is relatively meaningless for evaluating if it's good or not. that's why i said his argument fell flat. seems to have gone over people's heads."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"a lot of people have this opinion. we were dry on good games the last decade because of covid. it's only recently picked up again where we're seeing good games and a lot of them. uncharted is a popcorn game. it's not a 9 or a 10 imo. i didn't say it was bad... a 7 is good... a 910 is like zelda level. is this anywhere near that? hell no. why don't you talk to me about the game you're mad about. last of us people tend to be unhinged and have fringe opinions. it's like what's going on with that wicked movie. you have movie watchers last of us fans who want to just watch a movie in a property they enjoy and a bunch of theatre kids are singing and being rude in the theatre last of us two fans, gatekeep it, and start crying at a child's movie. if someone asks them to be quiet or stop crying about it they go on a long winded explanation on how a tropefilled story is the best thing ever written and you must not get it even though it's the most simple story concept ever. i'm only expanding on my opinion btw because you had to ironically say i'm wrong on my opinion. i'm not shoving shit in your face that you didn't ask for."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"sorta. the psn debacle and arrowhead's own nerfhappy changes did drop it off a cliff for a while  but for the last few months since september it's experienced a resurgence and honestly the game is more fun than it's ever been. once arrowhead reversed its terrible dev philosophy to one incentivizing player fun, things have greatly improved. in some sense the damage is done most of those players aren't likely to return, but it has improved and has much better retention now, and for anyone who does come back every loadout is way more viable and fun to use than it was before."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"a lot of players came back after the 60 day patch. the balance is much better and arrowhead stopped nerfing the fuck out of things that didnt need to be nerfed. they even rebuffed a lot of old stuff that they originally nerfed. the game is in a great place balance wise now. now they just need to focus on actually putting new content out for the game. they got behind because they were way to focused on balancing and nerfing shit that didnt need it, and then had to use their time rebalancing the game getting rid of the nerfs, so its likely just in the last few months they have been focusing on content. if the last time you played was before the 60 day patch, id recommend giving it another try, its a much different game now."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"absolutely. they're allowed to make money off of it, but they normally spend more than they make back as calculated, and will not even spend much or nothing at all on marketing intentionally. if a shitty underfunded movie magically does well and breaks even than it's just a bonus. movie studios don't care about movies, they care about money and balance sheets. you pay directors to care for you."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,"thats now from the lack of content tho, which is an issue. before it was dropping players because the balancing was fucking terrible. they rebalanced the game and people flooded back. since then we have only had 2 warbonds, and the dss is kind of meh. steam leaks in the change db basically confirm arrowhead is working on a new faction. this will absolutely spike the player base back up. arrowhead kind of fucked themselves when they were on a nerf fest, because instead of adding content, they kept nerfing stuff. players left to the point where there was only 15k people on on a saturday on steam and ps5 combined. they knew they had to correct course, rebalanced the game, and were holding 80k players peak between both systems for awhile. any live service game without content for a long period of time is gonna have people moving on. a lot of people are already maxed out on helldivers with nothing else to get, and the ship fully upgraded. they most likely have set the game down till arrowhead adds new content. yeah the players are falling off abit now due to this, but at least its because damn we wanna play but there is nothing new instead of holy shit they ruined this game, never touching it again."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-03,27k isn't bad though. it's a lot less than release but tons of coop horde shooters survive years with player counts below 10k. vermintide 2 plods along around 5k consecutive and spikes a few times a year thanks to steam sales. payday 2 has chugged along at 25k players for nearly a decade now. killing floor 2 barely ever got off the ground compared to helldivers but it's managed to keep 510k players throughout its life cycle. this is just the second stage of a game like helldiver's lifecycle. it's gone from short lived phenomenon that everyone's playing to the well established game that will live for another halfdecade at least. the peak player count has been higher in each of the past 4 months than it was in july that's a good sign.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"very long list of games, surely it will help in choosing best games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,didn't read it. just wanted to comment that the formatting is orgasmic.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i feel like i see hollow knight high up on every list, but somehow right now it's all the way down at 174."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,ctrf factorio  no results. disappointed.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,no comment on the contents of the list  just wanted to say well done. clearly lots of work was put into this.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,red dead 1 over red dead 2? and persona 4 that far ahead of persona 5? i love all those games but idk how i feel about that lol.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,what sucks balls after looking to this list is seeing overwatch 2016 and realizing it's literally the only game on the list that is literally impossible to play anymore. it just... no longer exists... fuck blizzard and live service model
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"surprised the game i love isn't listed here. but seriously, divinity original sin 2 is wonderful. edit 176 overall. it is redeemed. although i personally enjoyed it way more than mgsv."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,outer wilds 67 is my top game of all time. a little indie studio making their first game and its amazing to me that its got enough of a following to make it to the top 100. truly a masterpiece. space exploration mystery game. think journey meets myst. go into it and the one dlc knowing as little as possible. its an experience you can only have for the first time once.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"hold up, is fallout 3 on there and new vegas isnt? if so thats crazy! or i might be blind"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"cool! i'm surprised botw took the top spot... i always felt it lagged just a bit im the endgame. it's cool to see halflife 2 so high, that doesn't get enough love. ocarina is still my 1."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i didn't realize how old some of these games were. like, people were being eaten by grues in 77? wild."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,i just don't get the appeal of breath of the wild.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,vampire survivors sitting at 666 lol. no balatro?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"the fact that breath of the wild consistently hits the 1 spot is absurd its not a bad game, but strip away the zelda branding and people would realize how empty and bland of an open world game it is"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,my fav game of all time is missing. where is terraria? i believe its better than overwatch like wtf
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,spelunky let's go! what a great list of games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,i see a lot of good games on this list but holy hell i disagree with the ordering of it. insert unnecessary everyone has different tastes comment.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i installed the rpg filter and what i see is that 95 of the games are not rpg or use a couple of stats or perks in their gameplay. to the moon and stuff, seriously.."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,where is runescape classic with over a million players?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,breath of the wild lmao. give it another 20 years like oot and then let's see if it's still considered the best game of all time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"im genuinely confused how breath of the wild is consistently across the board the best video game in history. there are so many other titles that were earth shattering for their time when they came out compared to breath of the wild. i also feel like the talk around it died down fairly quickly , and the item damage thing seems to be a pretty big issue with a lot of people. not saying it doesnt deserve a top spot but i just dont agree with it being so concretely number 1."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,not surprised the persona franchise cracked the top 100. i am surprised that 4 is on there over 5. both great games tho
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i just spent 15 minutes browsing your site and realized i hadn't even upvoted your post, or left a comment letting you know what an awesome resource this is. bookmarked your site. will use it frequently."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"seems like the methodology will favor newer games because there are more best games of the year lists in recent years. is there a weighting to list type or some other method of correction for that? i'd also be curious to see how much nostalgia affects the ranking. meaning if you adjust every list ranking by the approximate age of the author, would you see it clump together?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,there's something truly special about walking out of the shrine for the first time in botw first zelda game i started and beat
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,i assume the goat ffx is there.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,i just heard about okami top 70 yesterday from some random youtube video the algorithm decided to play. made me smile today that it got on this list.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,i never played the last of us so i can hardly judge but it does feel weird to see this being second on such a list.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,all my bioshock bros should be rejoicing at being 9!!! feels like a huge honor to be ranked so high amongst all the others
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i was like if the secret of monkey island isent on the list then something is wrong, and there it was at 73. the secret of monkey island is one of the greatest games ever made and probably the greatest point and click adventure game made along side monkey island 2 which is 122. great to see grim fandango on there as well, would have liked full throttle also, but you cant get it all. but impressive work and fun to look through."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,i think there is a massive issue with this being only indicitive of how the game was received on release. there is no practical way to measure how well games have aged andor been updated. it's not like reviewers ever go back and update their reviews.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,i really enjoyed the last of us recently which was the remastered version. solid game all around. 2 all time though? not a chance.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,how do i get the website to show me the whole list? it only shows the first 100 for me firefox on android
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i am incredibly unsurprised the list is heavily slanted toward games from a time when people in their late 30s to early 40s would be growing up. that age group is the ones often in charge of making these kind of lists, or at least publishingediting for the publications that produce them. as such, the nostalgia bias toward that era will be incredibly strong. also the heavy nintendo bias shows the more european and especially north american bias as those consoles were the most successful over here to the point for many people, nintendo and video game console were synonymous in the early adoption days. which is exactly the kind of thing a meta analysis like this should produce. this information and data gathering is exceptional and gorgeously formatted. i wish i had a resource like this when i was doing research on game history in college."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,am i dumb or can you not view the full 1000 list? it only scrolls down to 100. for anything else you have to apply filters by decade or year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"great work, op!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"while i'm not surprised to see breath of the wild hitting number 1 not my cup of tea, but zelda sweep is expected in just about any list honestly, as evidenced by three titles in the top ten eleven, i am surprised that so many people apparently consider the last of us to be one of the best games ever created. i mean it's... it's a fine game, top 50 for sure, but 2 of all time? it's probably the biggest contributor to the overly cinematic slop sony love to throw out these days"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,am i crazy or is terraria not on the list
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,in no world are botw and tlou the two best games of all time

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"how is journey 2012 considered better than baldurs gate 3? no disrespect to journey of course, but the two games are so far apart from each other in complexity and production quality, and journey doesn't even have the excuse of being an early video game like tetris or the mario games."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"nice! but i feel like there's been a sort of a grade point inflation with more recent games, and i could see the reviewer opinions on games like botw shifting with time not just with newer games replacing it on such lists, but older games surpassing it again on such ranking lists."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"wow that's actually super cool, sometimes with some friends i do the same with not only videogames, even if we don't treat so much information in such a formal way lol. anyway, rating videogames is really tough tho. final fantasy 7 or halo combat evolved are not even close to be the best entry in the series, still they got the advantage on being the first, value that in videogames tends to be really blurry sometimes. i mean ff7 is not even bad, it did a magistral job creating what it did on ps1, but at the same time, ff9 is just better in everything, but in inventing the system. on the other hand, most people should agree on the fact that ff6 is somewhat better than ff7 too, even if it a really old style game even compared to ps1 games. same goes for doom, sure it's a legend, but what would a logical human being play today, doom or doom eternal? it's really complicated if you ask me, even if there are exceptions, like bioshock, cause at least for now, it's not too old but it's still goat. games such as tetris are easier to put on top, since the idea lives up to today too, making them more valuable from an artistic pov. i'll stop this monologue now i guess, lol."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"very interesting ! the breakdown by decade is very relevant. a lot of games ranks higher with nostalgia factor, which removes objectivity out of the rankings concerning the intrinsic quality of the game. so to say, pre2010 3d games feels very clunky in comparison to newer games. rendering techniques also evolved since and made players used to new standards, making older 3d games visually very obsolete whereas 2d games had more time to mature and are less reliant on rendering techniques to look appealing. hence i would always advocate to judge games by todays standards, as todays standards is ultimately what makes them enjoyable. games like silent hill 2 and resident evil 4 aged quite poorly, whereas zelda alttp for instance looks crispy clean to this day."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"amazing work! some thoughtsfeedback is there enough data to support platform specific lists in the sense that it's based on reviews from sources that are focused on specific platforms? my thinking here being, for early home computers, a lot of multiplatform games originated on the arcade platform, and could be pretty awful conversions banking on getting sold on the reputations of the original game. which might be reflected more properly when looking at platform specific critics. for example when looking at the all time list filtered to only show zx spectrum games it shows 38 games. the only game from the developer ultimate play the gamehttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiultimateplaythegame before they became known as rare and did a little game called golden eye is ranked at 26. uptg great games, horrible name being perhaps one of the most premiere developers for the zx spectrum and me being a commodore 64 user knowing about this says a lot for those who where around at the time of that specific platform war makes me think that list might have looked different when viewed through the lens of lists focused on that specific platform. i might be wrong andor i might not have expressed myself clearly, just a thought. a couple of other suggestions it would be nice if all items in the lists where numbered after their place on that specific list like for a search result, and not only the place on the overall list. on the about page on the site, you should add a link to this post and any future ones... or past one too for that matter. and other relevantsignificant places where discussions about this work of yours and the ones that helped you happens"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"it would be great to do an analysis of the authors of these lists based on which games they have not played. like, the overrepresentation of nintendo generally i feel reflects that they are a familyfriendly brand with broad appeal, who have huge market share due to extremely effective branding and marketing. a lot of people might play little or nothing other than nintendo games. similarly, how many reviewers play entirely on consoles and have little experience of pconly games? obviously the data doesn't exist and is unlikely to ever be gathered, but i think it would be very interesting."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i cant believe the witcher 3 is almost 10 years old already. what the fuck. i played that game into the ground as well. i almost feel like when it came out was luke 4 years ago. man this list is like time warping me. i see games and i'm like that wasn't too long ago. chrono trigger i bought from a drug dealer when for 10 bucks when i was a teenager. probably middle school. as for the list. i was counting them off from the top, i've played about 28 of 50 of those games stop counting at around 50 as i was growing up. i kind of feel lucky to have been able to experience these games as they came out or were fairly recently new. from my experience, i dont feel too good about games going forward. as it's probably age, but i don't feel games have excited me enough to go out and play it. i thought i was done buying consoles when the ps4 came out but them metal gear solid 5 was announced and i went to go purchase my ps4. nothing has really called out to me with the ps5. i really wanted to play the demons souls remake, but i've played the original and i understand what it is now. but as to why i don't feel good about games, it's the microtransactions thing. like of course i'm wrong, because great games have come out like baldurs gate 3 and elden ring. but i feel like it won't be like the frequency that this list has shown. like this list has shown that 99 has the most top games of all time. i'd figure 98, or i think 07 was the greatest time for games. just growing up during these past 3 decades for games, had truly been amazing if people who experienced it look back on it. i guess, it was a time where we had a game and usually we had to stick with that game and it became great. now, there are so many options to play games and or transactions mar a game that it's kind of easy to look past modern day games or get bored of them quickly."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"excellent list. i will definitely check it for finding games with good reviews that i might have missed. i would like to point out though, for people considering this list for playing good games from older times, that these kind of lists based on reviewers tend to miss niche or games considered iconic. they also tend to favor console games, specially nintendo. for example, shadow tactics blades of the shogun is an excellent stealth rts, but it's too niche to appear. similarly, iconic games like thief never get mentioned. even games like fallout new vegas, that's liked by hardcore fallout fans doesn't even make it to the list. there's also on occasions a disconnect between reviews and gamers. most recent example is latest elden ring dlc that got great reviews but got a mild reception from the people currently 71, mostly positive in steam."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i would be interested but not knowledgeable enough to figure out myself how many of those game came from true indie studios. maybe about 10 of that list? i have been wondering this because i have been thinking lately about how much marketing plays into games, music, books, etc. look at tetris for example, it became a mega hit purely because of its gameplay. the fact that it was so good that it managed to escape the ussr to become a global phenomenon seems to me, that in terms of pure gameplay, that it would be 1. the other 9 on the top 10 list, and the vast majority of the games in the top 100, were all good games, but they were also games that had millions and millions of dollars in promotion. how many games, books, movies, songs, etc. are out there somewhere that would completely blow away what we think of as the best but simply did not have the right marketing behind them. do we think the zelda games are great because they are great, or do we think they are great because we were told they were great when in fact they were just okay but we didn't want to be the ones who disagreed with what everyone else supposedly thinks of the games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"uilmeniavg considering you mention you want this website  ranking to be taken seriously, and also mention it has rigorous metholody. is there a source for the rankingmethodology? it's hard to take something like this at face value in any statistically relevant capacity without thorough insights into the methodology, algorithms, and scoring used. your website doesn't seem to go into detail on this either. it would go a very long way to not have this ranking be essentially a black box that cannot be peerverified. having the data set easily available, i.e. a oneclick download of sheetsdatabase filesetc... would also help with this, and further help open research into this."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"ignoring my subjective opinion that chrono trigger is the greatest of all, there are some objective issues with this aggregated list and the method used to construct it  the people who make these individual 'greatest' lists have not played all the games listed here, which is the only possible way to have a completely fair evaluation.  recency bias is a major issue in subjective ordering like this, especially ones that span decades. this makes older titles rank lower down the list.  newer lists should not be favoured more. no reasoning is given for this and it incorrect to apply random favour here. the reason for this is that there is a type of reporting bias present  many modern reviews are paidsponsored reviews which raises their scores artificially, meaning recent scores are usually higher than older scores. this means newer lists should be penalised, not favoured.  the second reporting bias here is also accounted for incorrectly  there are simply more reporters today than in 1990 for example. a game may get 5 reviews then and 50 now. this means frequency is not a metric to gauge success, and the fact it has been used as such means the output is distorted not minimally but significantly towards modern games. all in all, cool post but there are some severe statistics issues that make this list less accurate than it could be."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,the correct answer is always chrono trigger. one of its biggest advantages is that it never turned into 20 sequels and 10 spinoffs like every other successful new ip rpg of its time. since nowadays its just a popularity contest based on how big the ip is chrono trigger will lose to the 50 metroid or zelda games that exist.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"the decade distribution is basically a normal map, or, a gaussian distribution. this heavily implies that the games rankings are based on the age of the list writers. for instance, if you favor newer lists, ppl who are 40 now likely to have prominent writing positions, were in there early teens to late teens during the 90s and 00s. that heavily implies this list is basically the writer's nostalgia. if you do this again on 10yrs, i'd fully expect the 80s and 90s to drop off, and the 2010s to bump up. that's not even a guess, it's almost a certainty. since the decade distribution is just a normal distribution."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,seems like you could've just looked at some super shallow ign top 10 list or whatever which i guess is all this is an aggregate of but it misses out on some of the best games of all time for top 100. like halo 2 for example despite getting ce3 of which neither had the same impact. this is important because halo 2 basically had a full on chokehold on xbox live until late 2007 despite not even being on the current latest generation while sitting atop the list at the end and its the reason most matchmakinglobbyfriendsdashboards lists look the way they do today on services like xbox live or just games in general. when a game that was one of the most enjoyedplayed of all time on top of being something that visibly changed the gaming industry doesn't make the top 100 but the secret of monkey island does it kind of exposes how seriously anyone should ever take these things. there probably aren't 20 games all time to have that much impact. this one in particular is an indictment being delivered to gaming mediajournalism there's also games like oldschool runescape that silently prove their worth via people actually playing and enjoying them and for whatever reason they aren't on the list despite heavily outperforming almost the entire top 100 for actual decades. you can tell the lists you're pulling the information from are kind of not really plugged into what players are really doing and its just some journalist typing out their feelings. there's also the super questionable picks for top 100 like outer wilds. i got that game for free to play and its not a bad game but lol it is certainly not a top 100. that shit is totally gassed up by marketing worth a play though

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,the last of us being that high is exactly what is wrong with the industry and gamers.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"there's a major recency bias and console bias to these lists. how old do these lists get? i expect a list made in 1999 ranking the 90s would look quiet different from one made 1020 years later looking back at the 90s, for example. additionally, there's a large number of influential andor financially or critically successful pc, handheld, and mobile games that simply don't seem to get any visibility in favor of whatever the aaa flavor of the month game is. for instance, if i sort your site by 4x genre, it's largely dominated by civilization games, and not even the better ones. civ iv is not the best game in the franchise by a long shot, certainly not better by 200 spots than civ v and definitely not better by 400 spots than alpha centauri, which is an extremely influential game in the 4x space. the list doesn't even include master of orion 2, which has an entire cottage industry of moo2 clones due to just how much it defined the space 4x genre. i feel like the only thing this list really captures is the relatively recent zeitgiest of what's popular."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,have to say i dont agree with the methodology. review sites even prestigious gaming magazines are incentivized to review flagship games from major consoles highly as they get kickbacks from sales.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i think probably the merging of all time vs. end of decade vs. end of year lists is likely responsible for this. i assume there's some biasing here going on that isn't really getting well accounted for.  in total there are 98 all time lists, 51 end of decade lists, 570 end of year lists the time frames of the all time ones significantly impact which of those will be available, and the volume of end of year lists has changed over time. also there's some odd inclusion of ranked vs. unranked lists that probably make the data hard to calculate. some of the game of the decade lists like the cogs top 20 games of the decade omit rdr2 entirely, which strikes me as super odd. would say there's gonna be a lot of noise created by lists that weren't entirely created with this in mind. ars technica's goty list sure reads a lot like an unordered list other than their winner being called out as 1st as celeste. but they put rdr2 at 11th while still saying, red dead redemption is one of the best games of the decade, and its sequel bests it in every way. yet rank it behind f1 2018. i'd imagine there's a fair bit of this type of thing going on. and given ops note that losing against lower ranked games is a penalty, could skew things quite a bit. probably trying to make an ordered list out of this data is extremely hard and maybe even a lost cause. may have been better to try to group things into tiers based on breakpoints in the aggregate numbers rather than a pure ranked list. really appreciate the effort from op but without being able to see the calculations or numbers, it's hard to figure out some of the oddities."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"red dead 1 over red dead 2? yeah that struck out to me the most as well, i dont care about how it compares to other games but rdr2 is objectively better in every single way"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"i prefer way more rdr1 to rdr2. when rdr1 came out, it was really fresh in a way, literally the only great western game existing. story and characters were already really solid. the tragic ending took me completely by surprise while in rdr2 is expected from the start. and also it seems that everyone has forgotten how absolutely clunky and painful is the gameplay in rdr2, which is way less acceptable at the time it came out."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"it's not even considered the best zelda game by a lot of fans. i am pretty sure botw suffered a lot from review score inflation from most publications where most of ops data is from, probably boosted by the fact that most writers were millennials grown up with zelda games and definetly had some bias. i remember the pushback and hundreds of youtube videos and reddit about how scores are now meaningless just when botw released. i think a lot of publications took notice and dialed things down a tad, otherwise we'd see elden ring or bg3 even higher imo in this post."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"breath of the wild is not without it's issues. but for me, the fact that it was brave enough to not hold your hand and point out every little point of interest was incredibly refreshing. and playing it honestly made me feel a bit like a kid again. it's one of the few games that makes it feel like you are actually exploring and not just moving from waypoint to waypoint. it didn't matter to me that the rewards for exploring were not great, because just finding a cool thing on my own was enough of a dopamine hit to keep me moving to the next one."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"it is entirely overrated, in my opinion. it had the first true, climb any mountain, swim any river, style open world before then you couldn't literally climb any mountain, for example in games like skyrim. which gave people, especially more casual players, a unique feeling of exploration and vastness. and for that, i certainly commend it. the few things it does well, like this, it does very well and even i was captivated by the open world mechanics at first. but as a game? it's incredibly bland. the world, while vast, is rather empty. the highs from the exploration die fast when you realize that you're not really finding much in this world. the weapon breaking mechanic is borderline frustrating, especially the longer the game goes on. why couldn't you either improve weapon durability or get a weapon that cannot break the master sword can break, what is up with that?. shrines are lackluster and uninteresting, with some of the easiest puzzles i've ever seen in a zelda game or the most boring test of strength combat encounters you could imagine. it's a great game for casual players, but i need more substance in my games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"im with you, but the flip side of it is people like my wife. she loves that game and probably put 200 hours into it. i just dont see it, but it really speaks to some people."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i think a big part of it is that it isn't meant to be played to completion. it's meant to be played enough to beat. from that perspective it will appeal more to people who spend less time pouring into each game, either because they play more games, or just have less time to play. even still it's a systems rich game that has depth if you're the type willing to speed run, or hunt for unconventional solutions. i can certainly get being disappointed in it, but not every game can be for everyone for hundreds of hours. botw is great for a lot of people for 2040, and good to some for hundreds."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"i've enjoyed every zelda game except for botw, i had to force myself to finish it. it's just like with halo infinite, a mediocre open world that isn't as good as well designed levels. i hate the fact that due to it's popularity, we'll never be seeing a classic styled zelda game again..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"can't remember another game that i lost interest in as fast as botw. long time zelda fan, remember being a kid and my mom helping me beat the nes titles and then being able to beat a link to the past by myself. loved zelda, botw just didn't feel like zelda to me. and didn't feel like a strong open world rpg either. baffled how it could be in the top 10, much less 1."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"no, it deviated from the idea you had of the zelda brand, but it's still a zelda game. it's clearly not perfect for sure, the formula could and i hope it will be improved on many points, but not seeing the quality in certain aspects, the will to innovate, to offer a game with great freedom, creativity, diversified gameplay with emerging mechanics etc, is quite incomprehensible imo. this is the type of open world we need to go towards, more interactive and organic worlds with a lot of crative ways for the players to go through"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,you took the words right out of my mouth. it is absolutely criminal that people say botw is a better game than half life 2. i bet over 50 of the people who even voted in these aren't old enough to even appreciate just how revolutionary the half life series were let alone play them. the nintendo fanboyism has to stop. the worldstory of botw was bland and had questionable design decisions that negatively impacted gameplay such as weapon durability. it isn't a bad game it just is nowhere near the 1 game of all time spot. it's so exhausting always seeing fanboyism taint these lists every time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"this is why i think its crazy that people say that botw is better than totk. theyre essentially the same game, just totk filled up botws empty world with a ton of stuff"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,elden ring was a far better zelda game than botw

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,agreed. i think that whole era of games that desperately want to be movies has aged out poorly. everything else in the top10 is a game that is very much a game and i have no beef with the other selections there.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,it's at 16. that feels pretty fair.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i loved 7 way more than 9. i didn't play 26 until after 7 though, so 7 was my first since 1 and the ff legends games for gameboy. 7 is my favorite game of all time. tactics is my second favorite ff game. i've still never gotten around to playing 4, i will sometime. barely played 13, no 15 at all yet. weirdly i've been getting back into 2d rpg's, but not the actual classics, i actually prefer more modern indie games made in the style of the classics."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i would argue halo ce needs to be higher. it set the bar for fps storytelling, revolutionized fps controls into what nearly every game uses today, and is probably the only reason the xbox ever became successful. not to mention it still just holds up as a great fucking game. there's a lot of classicretro games here imo that make this list based off of their influence that have gameplay that couldn't hold my attention for 30min, but i still find myself coming back to the og halo trilogy regularly. you've def got a point about games just being revered for being the first of their kind regardless of gameplay or how they hold up today, though. it's kind of annoying seeing lists like this that are usually always just nintendo circlejerks. is anyone actually busting out their nintendo wii to replay super mario galaxy? are we gonna argue that game has more to offer or revolutionized the platforming genre in some way that sm64 or sunshine did not? you get what i mean."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i think a major reason why ff7 will always end up pretty damn high in these rankings is because it simply sold like crazy. but i personally also disagree that either vi or ix are better games, especially when replaying them today. vii hits a sweet spot in terms of pacing and presentation that feels pretty timeless that both vi in terms of presentation as well as ix in terms of pacing can't compete with. at least that's my perception. the classic ones that have been part of these lists for many years are mostly going to keep their places though, some for good reason, but i would agree that others  not so much. on the other hand, we also have newer games like elden ring and baldur's gate 3 that likely will only climb further up such a list as time goes on. i wouldn't really feel comfortable ranking these games near the very top due to fear of recency bias, but i'm fairly certain that they are very deserving of this sort of placement with a few years of distance. also maybe some of the rankings were made prior to 20222023, so the games may not even have been out yet."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"yeah, i know i preferred ff7 to ff9 the same way i preferred persona 4 to 5, largely because of the characters, story, and environments."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"one of the sources for the list seems to be best of the year lists, and of course cp77 launched too late in its year and in far too bad a state to make it onto such lists. and of course the game's redemption arc doesn't help much unless it was formally rereleased and rereviewed later on maybe in ten years when it gets a remaster and comes autopackaged with phantom liberty. although having said that, both no man's sky, which had some of the same problems, and starfield, which hasn't even really started its redemption arc yet but at least worked, more or less, are on the list, which feels weird if cp77 is not."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,it didn't have a bit of a rough start. it had one of the worst releases... but luckily they fixed it and now it's a 1010 maybe 910 imo. it definitely deserves to be somewhere on this list

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"a lot of it is nostalgia but a lot of it is also how good the game was at the time it was released. sure, by today's standards you can't compare m64 with rdr2. but in the time that m64 released it was an absolutely incredible game that influenced many many games after that. rdr2 kinda just took already existing concepts and just executed them super well but m64 was a ground breaker. there were a ton of openworld shooters by the time rdr2 released, this was just the best of them. there weren't a lot, if any, 3d platformers by the time m64 released though. same goes for games like halflife 2 or the original doom for example. playing it today the game isn't anything amazing. but back then? it was like nothing we've ever seen before."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"you kind of had to be there. by today's standard, sm64 is janky and weird, but it really changed what we thought games could be. simply being 3d and being able to go in any direction was jawdropping in 1996. there was nothing else like it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,i dunno i actually think you could have an argument about this. i have seen some video essays about rdr2 and how often if you don't do exactly what the game wants you to in missions it swats your hand and says no! do it the way i want you to for even the smallest things. it's on the surface supposed to be this open world game where you creatively approach problems but you get told by the game no do it this way. compared to the design of mario 64 which is a 3d platformer you leap and jump around in. ye it's not exactly an open world there are distinct levels but you are capable of doing what you expect to be able to. i think as far as following the apparent game design goals they outwardly present mario 64 succeeds far more than rdr2
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"my 2 cents is that theyre in the same boat as pixar movies, where they make content for kids, but its really polished, and also has enough bits thrown in to keep adults engaged and enjoying it. they have huge mass appeal and are good at it."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"the point of the project is to be an accurate reflection of games media. the result was bound to be generic, because at the end of the day all i've really done is taken an average. i understand that's not what everyone wants to see, but i think making a definitive greatest games list isn't something you can do with a mathematical formula. computers are ill suited for that task. it's too personal. too human. you'll notice that i'm careful not to say that these games are necessarily the best or greatest, only that they're the most critically acclaimed. whether or not they deserve that is up to you."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,thank you friend
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"no doubt. what gets me is that this is a best games of all time list. a game with one of the worst combat systems out of any aaa game to date is taking up a place at number 6. like, come on. in order to be one of the best games of all time, it has to be a good game first."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,thanks i also didn't get it hehe. now it's a bit clearer
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"sorry i still don't understand. what do you mean by the 2, 6, etc. for instance, what does 3. 2010s 6 mean? thank you!"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"honestly, pretty much my favourite game on the switch. never got into open world zelda, but damn does that remake perfect what zelda should be imo"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,i only found out a few days ago this game even existed. i should probably just cave and buy a switch.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,i know technically it's a wii u release but i know very few people who played on wii u and it was more or less a switch launch title.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"hypothetical 23 year old, right?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"weighting older lists doesn't make any sense, because less games were published when that list came out. when you compare all time greats lists against each other and look at a list from 1999, then it's no surprise to see only titles from the 90's on it. however, when you've the same list from 2024 and there are still some titles from the 90's on it, after 25 years of game development and new releases, then you can be sure that the old games that are one it must have something great to them. that's why giving newer lists more impact makes sense. compiling a greatest games list from lists which featured less competition makes it inaccurate."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"im thinking its just that we are still not even 5 years into the decade. if you would have made this list in 2014 instead of 2024, breath of the wild wouldnt have been out yet. you still have something like 5.5 years to add to the list. also, logic says this decade should have more games in this list by the end of the decade due to recency bias."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"thats not it. its just that we didnt have that many lists realeased post 2020 for this compilation to take from... thats why elden ring is only on 23 place and baldurs gate on 44th. the newer games couldnt have appeared on older lists, meaning they got less points just because they didnt exist back then, even if this compilation is giving more weight to newer lists."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"there was a very good video on this by razbuten. while the old big companies like ea and others are mtx heavy now , it's not that today's games are bad rather they're less impactful. this might be a hot take but i'd say celeste is a better game than super mario world , or hollow knight is better than super metroid. yet , their impact can't be overstated. and , the first type of a game you play will be more memorable than the rest in the genre. aaa games are big budget so they tend to take less risks ."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,maaaaybe also a global pandemic had some small impact on that number as well?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i think in general theres rightfully hesitation to put new games on a best of all time list. part of what gets games on lists like that are cultural impact and how they stand the test of time, and newer games are untested in that respect."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"he does say there's a slight weighting towards recent lists, but it definitely sounds slight. look at the alltime listshttpswww.acclaimedvideogames.comlists?limit100offset0typea used, and you'll see why earlier decades seem over represented... there just aren't that many from the 2020s yet. best of decade lists are also used, and we won't get one of those until 2030."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i find it interesting post 2020 we have a drop off of games making it into top 1000 or top 100. that's almost certainly just because of how short the decade is. don't forget that not only are we halfway through, but that some of these games did not launch with goat level scores but instead received retrospective praise see earthbound, for example which cannot happen to 2020 games yet, plus ordering of games can place more games in the later half of the decade. for a similar example from a different medium, watch how rolling stone's 500 greatest albums of all time has albums from the 2000s make up a bigger bulk of the list as time goes on, and how in 2003 only 12.2 of the list was albums from the 90s while by 2023 it had gone up to 20.2. time often changes perceptions."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"no, brother. you have really done a great job."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,i think lists like this have an antirecency bias. elden ring and tears of the kingdom will slowly creep up to the top over time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"indie games are on the rise though. i expect many in top10 lists the coming years, though likely under the big budget hits like a gta6. quite a few snuck into my all time favourite games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"on top of that, developing games costs more, and takes longer, if they keep having to push the envelope for what people expect. voice acting motion capture open world design new graphics technologies multiplayer singleplayer etc etc the more you add onto your to do list when making a game, the more it'll cost. and thus you end up having to either skip some, or take shortcuts"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"yeah, corporate games but also games take longer to make and covid messed up a lot of projects i'm sure. i'm glad nintendo is still just doing their own thing pumping out great games still without crazy monetisation."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"i love the corporate games name. i think if we latch onto it it'll make corporations a little less likely to make them. personally, i'd like that. corporations go where the money is, so the odds things change by giving aaa games a new moniker is low. i'd still like to try it out though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-16,"there's a reverse recency bias with games sometimes. return of the obra dinn would probably be top 40 if it came out ten years earlier, but somehow gets lost in the shuffle of so many other recently great games  along with many of those other great games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,why is that interesting? most aaa games are completely shittier version of the same game. copied and pasted with a slightly new colors and added micro transactions. the whole video game industry went to shit.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"yeah, thank god for fromsoftware and nintendo. actually, just thank god for japan. well actually now that i think about, thank god we dropped 2 nukes on them back in 1945 and then rebuilt them for the sole purpose of eventually creating zelda and demons souls"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"top 100 lists arent the top 100 best games there a mix of popularity , actual quality and most importantly nostalgia mostly true, i agree. skyrim is 10, when it isn't even the best in its franchise. not that i don't like it!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,or it's that nintendo games are some of the highest quality games out there. super mario world is still a top tier platformer if you loaded up an snes today
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i do think nintendo fans are the biggest nostalgia players. the games are good but. no. 1 for tbotw... game is just a newer zelda title that improves on previous titles and has cool features.. but i personally judge games more on overall quality and less on gameplay. the things i rate at top are stuff like chrono trigger, bioshock, fallout new vegas, tlou2, witcher 3, and ff10.. all story focused. not everyone's thing but i just cant find a game no. 1, that is all just good gameplay and nostalgia for the feeling you had when you first played the franchise."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"im not surprised. simulation and strategy games are never really on the mainstream gaming industry's radar, and thus don't receive much attention or acknowledgment outside fans of the genres despite their popularity. of those genres i only spot the sims, sc2k and civiv on the list, two of which are in the bottom 20. meanwhile very popularwell acclaimed games such as factorio, xcom, rimworld, rollercoster tycoon, the other civ entries, etc. are missing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,probably because any reviewer who played it was utterly consumed by it and never had the spare time to write anything about it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"not on any list is insane. its one of the very best executions on a genre of all time, and unsurpassed after 10 years. guess that shows how much popularity plays into these kinda of rankings, and less quality of execution on the ideagenreetc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,crazy that terraria isn't anywhere on here either. they recently passed super mario brothers for number of sales 58 million copies
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"one of my favorite gaming phenomena is the incredibly high ratings of games like euro truck simulator. they aren't overwhelmingly positive because everyone loves pretending to drive a truck, they're overwhelmingly positive because the only people who play them love those sorts of games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"i'd disagree there, the 'game feel' in 1 was better, 2 just feels like i'm playing a simulator rather than a game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,what about in terms of influence on the industry? red dead 1 was arguably the first game to really capture the feel of westerns.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"the general placement also does matter, though. if rdr2 is number 42 on any list, then that list is irrelevant and a mere statistical curiosity. it's got nothing to do with reality and we're wasting time even discussing it. i'm outta here."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"did the gameplay of rdr2 feel too slow paced for you? rdr2 is in my top ten, maybe top five, but thats a common criticism ive heard."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"this isn't on op though. you're just not seeing those games make top 100 lists as often across the gaming journalism industry. which honestly doesn't surprise me as it's a niche game genre whose popularity really lies in japan. post ddrguitar herorock band era, rhythm games in the us might see a break out niche title once in a great while. case in point, albeit anecdotal, i've been an avid gamer since the atari 2600 and i've never even heard of half the games you listed."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,the last of us is a great game that should be about 57.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,2nd of all time place for that interactive tv show quick time event simulator is utterly ridiculous. speaks for how irrelevant awards are.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"games differ from most media in interactivity and tech. with a lot of them, you actually had to be there. a remaster still usually only updates the visual aspects, not rote story or mechanics. all that to say the longer we get from tlou's release, the less it deserves the spot it has."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,7 of the top 10 are not great in my opinion but i'm heavily biased against first person perspective due to vertigo and towards complex puzzles.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,if you stream it let me know. theres a whole community of people who love watching people fall in love with this game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,that is what i feel is the issue with this guys method for creating the list. ignoring audience polls and focusing on reviewers. reviewers notoriously glaze nintendo titles. often 10 out of 10 always.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,seems the sentiment has changed. most people view new vegas as a better game than fallout 3. is this a list of game on release or all time?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"god, wind waker was good. the moment it gets remastered on switch im buying it and watching my gf play through the whole thing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"botw diverts so much from the established loz formula that i understand why it's so divisive i myself prefer something more classic like oot. having said that, the impact botw had on the gaming medium was massive it's really impressive from a gaming design standpoint, it's literal wizardry on a technical level, and totally remarkable to be the first open world game in the series and the first from nintendo. it's just nintendo demonstrating that decades later they're still kings in the business. nostalgia aside, i firmly believe it's a totally deserved 1."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,alttp is not even the best alttp game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,i feel like the fact the internet wasn't around when a lot of these games came out is a big factor. a lot of people didn't grow up with these games and see the evolution of them. my personal favorite was majora's mask but a lot of that has to due with what point in life i got it and how formative it was for me. there are quite a few newer games on this list i don't personally agree with but with how many people there are in the gaming space now it makes sense.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"100 agree, even with your zelda titles tanking. spot on."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,it's so shocking to see the rise of people's opinions on windwaker. it was very not well received on release.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,the weapons is what lost it for me. nothing feels special. i shouldnt need to constantly worry about my steel sword shattering. less effective sure. but completely broke and now i have to finish the fight with my remaining sticks? no thank you
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i felt the same about tears of the kingdom. i loved it at first. the beginning on the big sky island was fun. the new powers and building contraptions was fun. i liked that the world felt a little more lively. but once the novelty wore off, i felt like i was just playing botw again."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"yup, thats why i quit, the weapon degradation. i also hated the cooking. the game just wasnt that fun. i love almost every game on this list, except no. 1."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"it's baby's first open world game. there's some good ideas, there, but, when you're climbing towers to unlock parts of the map, you just feel like you've already done all this shit in other games over a decade ago."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,all the menus you had to dive into certainly hurt the game i think. tears of the kingdom was 1000 times worse with the menu hell.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,the durability was a great feature for me. forced me to try different weapons out in the early game. later on you have access to whatever you want basically all the time so it became a non issue.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"open world games take a ton of time to complete. theyre great for teens and students that qant bang for their buck but for qorking adults theyre often far too slow and long. elden ring is popular because unlike most open world games it has high pace, constant challenge and no real downtime."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i love both of those, i've spent hundreds of hours jsut exploring and to me, it's very fun. there's always something around the corner, and the world itself is jsut so damn beautiful... and as for weapon durability, it is controversial but i personally like it a lot. makes combat more interesting, having to choose to fight or sneak around, etc. i do think that the knighttier weapons should've had more durability though, but the whole system was fixed in totk"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"to be honest it's a good game, but shouldn't be the best game at or even near the top of an all time list. it doesn't appeal to everybody, it wasn't really revolutionary, the graphics were mid for that era, and it was a sequel in an already popular franchise. the reason why it's here is because this list is an aggregate and there are a lot of nintendo fans that really really like botw. there's nothing wrong with that, but i doubt you would find many people who have actually played a lot of games on a lot of platforms willing to put this game at the top of their best games of all time list."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,yeah it has great chill exploration.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"reddit loves humble bragging they don't 'get' a really popular game. plus it's free karma as the sheep always upvote it. i agree though, imagine not liking something that is popular! you aren't some special snowflake by announcing it"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,exploring is a part of every open world game? i'd argue that elden rings offered a lot more rewards for exploring whereas it seems with the zelda the reward was just a small shrine.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i never played a zelda game before personally i feel like that kinda helps, it's the least 'zelda' zelda game there is"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,funny i always assumed my lack of nostalgia for zelda was why i thought botw was so bland and boring.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,and rdr2 is 42 on the list? this is some bullshit
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"just because youre in the minority of people that dont like it, it doesnt make everyone else nintendo glazers. its like all the people that shit on baldurs gate 3 or eldin ring given their popularity and being critically acclaimed games."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"popularity does not mean it's inherently good. justin bieber's baby is an objectively shallow, uncreative song, yet it was absolutely massive and wildly popular at one point. that doesn't mean it's wrong to like it, but to pretend it was some lyrical masterpiece definitely is wrong. and if you want an extreme example, well... hitler was pretty popular at one point, the german people loved him. just about anything nintendo puts out gets a bump in popularity and praise just because it's nintendo. they have a ton of brand loyalty among a lot of people, similar to how a lot of disney adults will worship anything disney puts out."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,nintendo is just incredibly consistent with their firstparty games. they're nearly always incredibly polished and heavily focused on the fun aspect of gaming over anything else. it's honestly impressive that they still manage to put out bangers to this day.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i mean, they make a lot of genuinely great games, it's not super hard to understand lol. to me, they really hit their stride in the gamecube era, but they've been consistently making great games for like 40 years now"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,so you mean it was an attempt by the zelda team to cash in on current gaming trends like openworld survival badly? i agree. at least tears had stuff that made it interesting.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"totk added an annoying building system that, while deep, was either abused or ignored depending on your play style but made the durability mechanic worse by having you fix your weapons by tacking on stupid accessories to them. that and forcing the story to be told in the order you find the tears instead of sequentially was a big miss for me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,the question is would we have elden ring if we didnt have botw.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i think its a game thats had a slow burn. its been around for so long and has been popular for so long, but never had one year where it really really broke out, if you will. which is sort of what this kind of list requires."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"i think the recency bias that op mentions is a big part of it. not only does op's method give a bias to recency, but there is already a natural recency bias due to the fact there are many more publications reviewing games in 2024 than there were in 2004, let alone 1985. that's not necessarily a criticism of op's method. all methods are imperfect. the important thing is that the method is transparent."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"as a technical achievement rdr2 is clearly the better one, but the story in rdr1 is better then the story in rdr2. john marstons story was better then arthur morgans."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,an objective review if i ever read one
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"depends on what makes a game better to you. i think fallout 3 has better world design, which for some people will outweigh the better quest design of fallout new vegas. fallout 3 is also significantly more stable than new vegas."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"the fact that they decided to just choose a bunch of lists by editorial staff without any other factors consider was always going to make this list a look at what was trendy in video game media at the time the list was made, not the actual quality or popularity of the games. i think op put in a lot of effort, and i appreciate that, but this is more a meta analysis of games journalism than it is a list of the best games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"new vegas is the only fallout game i stopped playing. probably pretty unpopular, but i'd take f4 over nv every day"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,its also comparing wildly different games. i have no desire to play rdr2 because from what ive seen i wouldnt enjoy it much at all. but i could pick up mario 64 right now and have a blast with it.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"thanks for the explanation. i must have graced over that in your post. i understand the purpose better from a general media outlet tendencies point of view rather than as the defacto best games of all time list which it could be construed as in some sense i do think the project is interesting, and i can tell quite a bit of effort went in. i am uncertain, however, about the usefulness of the result."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"it means that the 2010s is the first decade to have three games on the list, and that those games are the abovementioned games, plus the 6th game on the list, which is the witcher iii wild hunt. it's an interesting metric, but it's also confusing, i know."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,or in any vein honestly. those games are incredible and far too few people have played them

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"if they used the head to head scheme for determining results, it wouldnt matter because any games that didnt exist yet wouldnt be affected by the lack of comparisons, unless the method used determines any games not on the list are considered joint last place as opposed to any games not on the list are considered unranked."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"yeah but the 90s, 2000s, and 2010s all hover around close to 30 of the list. the rate of 2020s isnt keeping up with how those decades did. 4.5 years in you would expect closer to 10 of the list. not 5. there is definitely a drop off of games making it into top 1000 or top 100 on lists, even with recency bias helping them out."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"not only that but games that rated well back in the day, then slowly dropped down the lists as newer better games were released are over represented. lets not forget that this is also published lists, meaning in many cases money changed hands between game publisher and list maker. there are a lot of games in the top 100 that do not rank above games that dont have big name publishers. not only that top 100 lists have become redundant, not much attention is paid to those, reviews on platforms like steam are as far as most people go in their research. those types of scores need to be incorporated in this list. a really cool concept, and a lot of work for sure, but it doesnt tell the whole story in terms of the true best games of all time. loz link to the past at 11 and minecraft in the 30s?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"yeah, 100. we've had some insanely good games very recently, it's just that there is a such a bloat of good games that we remember the first ones more fondly."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,yeah thats probably a factor too.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,skyrim is very much the people pleaser choice cause its really like an 810 but when it released people where on the bethesda train and if this game was released today even with updated graphics and combat equivalent to starfield it would be torn apart to a similar but lesser extent than starfield as its very flawed particularly in combat and story .
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"to be honest for an objective list its impossible due to the nature of the industry however that doesnt mean there are so massive gaps , like new vegas achieved its cult like status only in the last couple years  for good reason games great so that got excluded from the list . games like planescape torment which is very niche but one of the best written games ever is always missing of these list ."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"i bought and played it on launch, i could not get out of the first town it was that buggy and prone to crashing. it was ridiculous. it's a fantastic game when it works, which took a long time before it did, long after people had stopped reviewing it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"that is mostly online sentiment. you need to realize fallout new vegas has a very online player base that is very loud but is a rather small group. if you were to ask online which game is better , 4 or new vegas, a lot of them would say new vegas. than you would look at which fallout game people are playing and realize most people play 4. in fact, if you were to ask the same about 76, same would apply. 76 has more players than new vegas. what people say online does not represent reality in all cases. a small rabid fanbase is going to dominate conversations online more than a large group of casual players."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"it is amazing, and the only thing holding it back from being the best game is that it was rushed at the end and that triforce treasure diving shit was thrown in"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-16,it was well received on release. it was not well received when it was announced because of the previous teaser released was much more realistic looking.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i'm in the same boat as you, the zelda franchise has some of my personal favorite games of all time, but i could not stay interested in botw and also never picked up tears."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i feel like tears was so much worse that breath. i loved the story, but the constant menu switching was brutal and annoying. that said, colgera is one of my favorite zelda boss fights ever and it requires very few trips to the menu screen."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"we could totally say the opposite argument actually. we could also say that a game like elden ring is for kidsteens because it seeks easy stimulation and constant action, as if you needed action and combat all the time to keep people's attention. and that on the contrary other slower games, which put more emphasis on freedom, creativity etc, are more for adults or more mature people who don't need constant action to stay focused and invested, and who are maybe looking for something deeper than just beating up mobs and bosses i was just saying that cause imo what you said didn't make much sense"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,but for qorking adults it's about time for qorking to come back as an adjective.httpsyoutu.beecht8friw?t102 very cromulent word.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"the appeal for me with elden ring was that it had an interesting world and exploration was always rewarded. if you see something on the map that looks cool, chances are you can interact with it in some way and find something interesting. the map in botw just didn't feel interactive at all. there were no real dungeons outside of those repetitive shrines, the weapons were ass, there weren't enough bosses, there were only like 3 enemy types etc. elden ring was a better zelda game than botw for me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i mean... i can pick apart most of these points lol to be honest it's a good game, but shouldn't be the best game at or even near the top of an all time list ultimately, this is all subjective. if you don't think it should be at the top, that's fine. but it doesn't really make sense to say it shouldn't be there just because you don't think it should be. if you disagree, you can make your own list! it doesn't appeal to everybody a game for everyone is a game for no one. the best works of art in any medium are never the most popular, nor the widest appealing. and that's how it should be imo. it wasn't really revolutionary many people in the game industry would disagree with you. i'd recommend reading up on this a bit more  there are countless articles, videos, etc. of game developers talking about why the game was revolutionary. so much so that many of the biggest games nowadays have cited botw as an inspiration. the graphics were mid for that era not that graphics automatically make a good game, but the switch at its core is a handheld console. those graphics were absolutely top notch compared to other handhelds at the time, and it looked great on the tv too! and the art direction is fantastic imo  it still looks great today. it was a sequel in an already popular franchise i don't think this should disqualify a game from being one of the greats. would you say the same about half life 2, super mario 64, resident evil 4, witcher 3, skyrim, etc? plus, botw was a radical departure from every other game in the series. it's not like it's just doing the same thing the series has always done. this list is an aggregate and there are a lot of nintendo fans that really really like botw. there's nothing wrong with that, but i doubt you would find many people who have actually played a lot of games on a lot of platforms willing to put this game at the top of their best games of all time list. this list is an aggregate of lists from professional critics, publications, and awards. these are not solely nintendo fans  these are people who play all kinds of games. nintendo just happens to be one of the more innovative developerspublishers within the industry, which is why their games pop up a lot here. it doesn't have anything to do with famboyism. and fwiw, botw isn't even my all time favorite game! but taking a step back and looking at this analytically, i definitely understand why it's so high on the list."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"guess i'm the 1  but apparently not, considering we have this list. which is an aggregate of hundreds of other lists. gta is a great series, though personally it wouldn't make my top 25. gta may be more popular, sure i'd give you that."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"no, long time zelda fan here, and i found it a slog as well."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"as far as open world games go rdr2 certainly sets a very high bar for added depth, and actually making those worlds worth exploring. it makes something like botw look very barren in comparison."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,lol all the people... wat? people don't shit on elden ring or bg3.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,i hate these arguments when talking about art. whether something is good or bad is entirely subjective. the song being shallow or and uncreative in your opinion doesnt make something inherently bad.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"it's not just popularity though. they're rating it 1. like, of all the games, people are rating it the best. this isn't just x people like this game! rotten tomatoes style."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"why do people always bring up justin bieber to make this same braindead point. not the enlightened take you think it is, even if you throw an absurd hitler comparison in as well. this has nothing to do with breath of the wild, it's quality, or it's spot on this aggregated list. it's just a vague commentary on the nature of media."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"perfection doesn't exist, and the appreciation of a game is far too dependent on people's tastes. it makes no sense to believe that a perfect game existsand again i wasn't talking about botw's ranking, idk how many times i'm going to repeat it..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i was responding to the comment that said it was bland and empty, even though the game is quite deep and has plenty of qualities, even if once again it's obviously not perfect. i honestly don't care about the ranking, the best game of all time doesn't exist, it's far too dependent on the tastes of the players, it's something subjective"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i think you didn't understand what i said at all, or you interpreted it as it suited you."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"not in this way , elden ring was clearly inspired by botw. i still prefer botw, but elden ring is close as great"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,yes? they basically took dark souls and added an open world. dark souls and open worlds both exist outside of botw
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"same reason minecraft isn't higher up on the list even though it's the best selling game of all time. granted, it's hard to fairly compare a game that's evolved so much since its initial release to games that pretty much never changed."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-16,"i loved persona 3 too. 4 had an interesting murder mystery and good plot twist, 3 had a great darker atmosphere, amazing final boss sequence, and i loved akihiko and the guy that wore the beanie. 5 felt like all style, less substance. i loved ff9, and i play triple triad all the time in ff14, but the characters and story of 7 are 10x more memorable for me personally"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,the easily available money seriously undercuts the story too. i think there's a 40 hour version of rdr2 that is a lot better than what we got.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i know it's just opinion, but absolutely not. rdr2 blew away rdr1 in terms of graphics, acting, story, etc. i like john marston, but arthur morgan is on a whole other level. to me, arthur is one of the greatest video game characters of all time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"highly disagree, rdr2 was a different beast, completely out doing pretty much everything rdr1 had done. rdr1 feels like a demo in comparison, even the story and characters are so much more developed in the sequel."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i've ranted about that game a lot, it's an unpopular opinion that some agree with but most get utterly defensive about. i can only assume it's loved by people who have no interest in gaming but want to watch a slightly interactive netflix series offering you bits of immersion by requesting you push a button occasionally to move the story forward. it is not a game."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-16,"i really need to write a tool that shows exactly what's making games climb and fall in the rankings. at the moment, i can only really guess based on match up data. the key thing about rdr vs rdr 2 is the original seems to have done a lot better against the strongest games on the list. because the wins are weighted according to how strong the games are, this is probably why it ends up ahead.  breath of the wild rdr 22 rdr2 16  the last of us rdr 29 rdr2 25  tetris rdr 30 rdr2 35  halflife 2 rdr 40 rdr2 25  ocarina of time rdr 39 rdr2 24  the witcher iii rdr 30 rdr2 22 rdr2 does better against tetris, but it still paints a pretty clear picture overall. interestingly, rdr2 is actually winning about 60 of the time against the original, so i totally get why people think it should be ahead. the raw data is messy and contradictory though, as you can see."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"it is not a different subject, it was a massive part of halo and a massive part of online gaming being where it is today. to hand waive it entirely is looney. you can be as butthurt as you want but accessibility matters. it is far easier to start the campaign in halo and go got it. way easier to give someone the controller and have em understand colorful aliens bad guys, human soldier good guys. simple doesn't always mean stupid or bad or compromising. it can just be fun. it's simple fun. pick up gun and blast away some aliens and grenade go boom. halo was and is simply fun. the cornerstone of gaming."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"no but minecraft is one of the best games of all time. which is why its popular. same w elden ring, botw, last of us and skyrim. there are great indie games but to be the best game of all time the scope of the game needs to be decently large. outerwilds is great, but its just a story, it doesnt have a gameplay loop, its art style isnt the most unique and its not really replayable."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"lets not forget that this is also published lists, meaning in many cases money changed hands between game publisher and list maker i'm guessing this would only really affect new games at the time of each list's publication, of which there are many? i just can't imagine a publisher paying for someone to bump them up a top 100 list for a game that is even a few years old. i have a hard time imagining they open up their marketing budget for it at all considering how little these lists probably have on sales."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"also it's that aaa games are just too big budget and there's no aa where you can take risks . there was hi fi rush which i personally didn't enjoy as much as others , alan wale and a few others but lately if you want something that's not mainstream you have to go to indie only which while creative don't have the scale.. for eg i recently played shadow of the colossus and while it's a frustrating piece of shit i was just in awe that this was made in 2005 and was one of the best things i have ever played even though it has a lot of rough edges. idk if a game like could be made today"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-16,that is not at all my recollection of ww in the years after release.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"imo classics like ocarina manage to be awesome because of simple inventories with like 2530 items total you can get in the game, and utilizing that small inventory to be able to get awesome dungeons and puzzles that are fun to solve and utilize the few items to great levels. basically every zelda game has fit that description. then botw comes out and opens things up a lot, and one thing it does really well is provide puzzles that have multiple solutions and the tools to solve them are pretty open ended  and i genuinely think thats really cool but not necessarily zelda to me. but whats worse is the inventory system. i dont want to have to gather a bunch of random stuff and worry about my weapons condition when im playing zelda. thats what makes it so incredibly unappealing for me. it loses that simple but complex thing that every zelda game has. i even enjoy the puzzle style enough that i really enjoyed ubisofts rip off immortals fenyx rising more because it had all the fun puzzles and much less of the grinding and crafting stuff. i think botw is clearly a good game, just not for me. its not what i want out of a zelda game at all."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"the show's pacing is way worse than the game. there's so many slow moments that you could only do in a game, like ellie and sam walking around talking about stuff they're seeing while you walk around reading diaries looking for a safe code. i remember when the show aired and when one of the latest episodes came out people who were show only were saying they really liked it cause it finally gave joel and ellie's relationship some good development, which is insane, cause that relationship is so well developed at that point in the game. it's still a good show, but it left me feeling the same as most movies i've seen that are based off of books i've read. not to mention that the gameplay is just straight up fantastic. i played the multiplayer for tlou so much, and i miss it constantly."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,hard disagree. i love tlou and really enjoyed playing it. it also had one of the best multiplayer offerings in a long time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,many of the weapons have different effects that are more or less ideal for certain scenarios. plus having a strong weapon that breaks on you means you may have to resort to finishing a fight with weaker ones. it forces you to play more creatively and improvise when things dont go as planned.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"what do you mean by creative in botw? the fact that you can make a ton of useless consumables with random ingredients? there were maybe 1015 different enemy types, placed all over the map colored differently. there were four dungeons each smaller than the smallest in ocarina of time. i'm not a hater, love most zelda games with my favorite a lttp but botw lacked good dungeons, a good story, and variety."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"a game for everyone is a game for no one. the best works of art in any medium are never the most popular, nor the widest appealing. and that's how it should be imo. you are correct, but that wasn't the point i was trying to make. my point is that it didn't really excel in any one category, mass market appeal being one of those categories. i won't deny that it did a lot of things well, but there are problems with the game too and things that make it unappealing to many people specifically equipment breaking all the damn time.  games. nintendo just happens to be one of the more innovative developerspublishers within the industry, which is why their games pop up a lot here this is patently false. nintendo milks the hell out of franchises and is probably one of the least innovative publishers of the last 20 years. they execute well, but innovation is not really their strong point. they pop up on these lists because there are a ton of nintendo fan boys including critics that will play whatever the next nintendo game is. that doesn't mean they are bad games, but innovative games and new franchises are almost always significantly less popular than sequels and games that are iterations on an existing concept.  and fwiw, botw isn't even my all time favorite game! but taking a step back and looking at this analytically, i definitely understand why it's so high on the list. that's kind of the point i was trying to make. the reason it's at the top is because it made a lot of lists and this is an aggregate. most people are going to put some other game at the top of their list for whatever reason. good luck finding a consensus on what the best game actually is though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"we have this list. which is an aggregate of hundreds of other lists. the lists haven't been vetted in the authors intention of such lists. let's be real here, the greatest games of all time has never been defined, it's just a list of critically acclaimed games, peoples favorite games, and games that sold well. no objective metrics of good games exist. sports try to achieve objective metrics of good but even those are murky. hence the endless debates about who's the goat of basketball or football with everything from  of championships, to stats, to era, to longevity, to popularity, to highlight plays all being used with varying importance. gaming is an art, no one can objectively measure art, as evidenced by botw being placed first because if an objective measure did exist? that ain't it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,damn that's a crazy take to read haha. but i guess folks have different opinions. i thought breath and tears have a way way way better open world than rdr2. rdr2 for me was more like a classic a to b open world game like cyberpunk and ubisoft games. the new zeldas are more on line with outer wilds and elden ring with real true freedom and lack of forced direction and ofc spectacular open world design
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,really?? theyre popular and people love shitting on popular games. and then you got the people that you might refer to as fromsoftware glazers basically circlejerking in gaming threads about how dark souls and eldin ring are perfect games and if you dont like them you must be mentally handicapped. no criticism allowed!

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i didn't understand the connection between the creativity, the bestiary and dungeons. being creative doesn't have to do with the amount of different enemies, it has more to do with the amount of possibilities you have to achieve your goals. to stay on the combat aspect, you have possibilities to approach fights in many different ways for example, with different powers, objects, strategies etc, like for traveling or solving puzzles, that's where creativity is. as for the dungeons, yeah many of us agree on that, they were very disappointing and they are even more disappointing in totk imo, and we can hope that they will be improved. but zelda games are not limited to dungeons. and you talk about a lack of variety, but the last 2 zelda are much more varied than those of the old formula. as for the story, it has never been one of the strong points of zelda, it has never been a central element, it has always been quite secondary, perhaps even more so in the last 2 games of course, but those before were not necessarily better in this respect. for me the problem is mainly the writing which is too silly and childish but it was the same before too, i hope that there will be a change on that"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,calling nintendo one of the least innovative publishers is just hilariously off base
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"my point is that it didn't really excel in any one category, i mean, i would certainly disagree with this. and the 97 metacritic it has says a lot of others would disagree too haha. i don't think a game that doesn't excel at any one category would be one of the highest rated games of all time. there are problems with the game too and things that make it unappealing to many people specifically equipment breaking all the damn time. there are certainly problems with the game, but there are problems with any game. for some, the weapon breaking system is annoying. for others, it's a unique idea to encourage improvisation and experimentation. again, it's all subjective. this is patently false. nintendo milks the hell out of franchises and is probably one of the least innovative publishers of the last 20 years. they execute well, but innovation is not really their strong point. they reuse their ip sure, but that's not what i'm talking about. i'm talking about game design. i'm really not sure how you can call them one if the least innovative publishers out there, especially given their history. not just botw, but ocarina of time, a link to the past, mario 64, super metroid, etc i would say are all worthy inclusions in this list. plus you see the innovation clearly with their consoles  where sony and microsoft zig, nintendo always zags. and sometimes, like with the wii and the switch, they come out on top because of it. i think their zelda team is especially innovative, even now. breath of the wild completely reinvented the series and made what was probably the biggest physicschemistry based sandbox adventure game at its time of release. again, if it wasn't innovative, why do so many developers credit it as an inspiration for their own work? if it didn't innovate, what is there for them to emulate? then, they one upped themselves in tears of the kingdom with mechanics like ultrahand, fuse, ascend, etc. the way that these abilities interact with the environment is pretty unparalleled in the medium as far as i know, especially for an open world game of its scale. even with echoes of wisdom, we're already seeing unique ideas, and we've only seen one trailer for the game. it doesn't matter if link and zelda are still there  the ideas are new. brand new game mechanics. and for a list of games, that's what matters most. the reason it's at the top is because it made a lot of lists and this is an aggregate it is the aggregate, but even still if you look at a lot of the lists that were used, it comes out at the top for many. not all of them, sure, but enough to average out at 1."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"i mean i agree with most of what you're saying here! there is no true best game of all time, because you're right, it's all subjective. but according to these lists, botw made the 1 slot. and since as you said, there is no actual greatest game of all time, i don't see the point in arguing it. that's where it landed based on all these lists from various critics and publications. it is what it is."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,its not about criticism. i would bet people that think they suck don't play them. i play nintendo games and zelda games. just know they aren't the best of the pack.. mid to low in overall quality

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i agree with you. botw didn't really do anything better than all the other open world ubisoft style games, it just had a zelda theming slapped on and a weapon durability mechanic that is possibly my most hated aspect of the game. if i pick up a game to replay in that same style, i'll be going back to horizon zd or shadows of mordorwar before i go back to botw. and that's coming from someone who replays alttp, and various randomizers thereof, all the time. i should have been a prime target audience for botw, but it was very flat for me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"the world is bland and empty for you, but not for everyone. it could have been more filled, but there is also a need to have empty spaces, it is part of the spirit of the game, which is called breath of the wild. this emptiness is an integral part of the game because movement and the way to manage it is a main component, it is also a field for experimentation with the tools and power that the game offers us, in addition to being necessary for the coherence of the world a world filled with pois everywhere is less natural and organic than a game that knows how to find a balance between content and emptiness. i think that one of the main differences between the latest zelda and other open worlds is that it takes the effort to offer a fairly interactive world, with original gameplay possibilities, and that movement, travel, is a deliberately important component of the concept. but it is a game that offers great freedom to the player, and which corresponds more to those who like to experiment, to be free and creative, unlike other games much more restrictive and directive, i think that not all players have this desire to try to do things by themselves without the game necessarily forcing them to, and that is why some find the game boring i think. that is why i talk about emergent mechanics, the game offers plenty of tools, it is then up to the players to do what they want with them. but the game could have been a little smaller and more filled i say a little smaller and a little more filled, because as i said, emptiness is also necessary. haha, i think my initial comment was clearly not appreciated by those nostalgic for the old zelda games, personally i am delighted with the new formula, even if it still has a lot of room for improvement"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"do you know many games of this dimension and ambition with such an interactive world and such great freedom of gameplay and original game mechanics? i think the game must be seen as a whole. and i'm not saying that it is innovative and original in all aspects. totk is not better for me, but to each his own. i think that the new crafting and construction mechanics are an excellent idea, but not in a zelda game, or more precisely not in the way it was implemented it's not very ergonomic and certain constraints sometimes make the use of these mechanics more annoying than anything else. and imo it's the zelda with the worst atmosphere and the worst ost"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"this could definitely be just me, but it feels almost like botw and totk are more like polished tech demos for the physics engine and graphic style. nothing about them outside of the random cutscenes hidden in them feel particularly like zelda to me. i enjoyed botw greatly, but totk was a massive letdown."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i'm talking about game design. i worked in the games industry for a decade, they haven't done anything innovative in about 20 years. sure they ripped ideas from lesser known games or repackaged stuff from their previous generations, but there is nothing that they have done that is new or innovative in my opinion. games like shadow of the colossus, portal or dark souls are what i would call innovation. warcraftstarcraft was innovation, doom was innovation, dota was innovation, rocket league was innovation. plenty of lesser known indie games these days are innovative, and maybe none are on the list of greatest games of all time but the devs are doing something new and unique and interesting. mario party, mario kart, metroid and super smash bros were all what i would call innovative in their time. pokemon redblue was new and unique. since that golden era nintendo have peddled nothing but regurgitated sequels, and breath of the wild is the closest thing to innovation they have actually done since that golden era. anyways there is a reason why nintendo games are so highly rated by critics  if you give them a shit review your career is over. it's just easier to give them 5 stars or 910 than to rock the boat and actually criticize them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"my man if you seriously think nintendo games and zelda games are mid to low in quality ... sorry you are not the centrist who sees the truth, you are in a very low minority who dislikes nintendo games and that's fine"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"sorry, i'm specifically responding to your assertion that it's one's opinion that a song is or isn't shallow, i'm not suggesting that a deeper song is a better song."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,name a flaw
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"exactly. the game is fine. pretty much everything in that game had already been done before in another form. i know i'm not the target demographic because i don't really like zelda that much, but it was easily my least favorite zelda game. to the point where i wouldn't buy another one."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,that can go both ways. the world feels exciting and live to you. i didn't find the tools to be that cool and exciting. the game was fine. i think there are way more games deserving of a number 1 spot
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"honestly, if we're not bringing the cdi into the picture, i feel botw had the worst atmosphere and ost. but regardless of how i dislike the game in general, my ultimate point is that it is number one on lists not out of admiration for the game itself, but because it is a zelda game, when honestly, it probably would have been a better game outside the franchise."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,no worries d
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,i know you are but what am i?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i mean yea objectively the game is not as you say a slightly interactive netflix series it also is by definition a game, due to all the gameplay there is if you get past the couple hours of story and character building at the start like all rockstar games have."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i agree with all the examples in your first paragraph, but totally disagree with the fact that they haven't been innovative in 20 years. take tears of the kingdom as an example. how are its primary gameplay mechanics not innovative? if you in fact worked in the industry, i'd wager many of your peers would disagree with you. there was so much industry conversation when that game came out about how impressive it was from both a creative and technical standpoint. aside from my own personal anecdotes, here are some articles i could point to httpswww.bloomberg.comnewsnewsletters20230526thelegendofzeldatearsofthekingdomdazzlesgamedevelopers httpswww.forbes.comsitespaultassi20230518nooneunderstandshownintendomadethelegendofzeldatearsofthekingdom httpswww.gamesradar.com23gamedevelopersexplainwhyzeldatearsofthekingdomwillbetalkedaboutforyears and that game is just one recent example, of course. games aside, can you at least admit they are innovative with their consoles? because to say otherwise i feel is just ignorant, or at the very least, shows some sort of bias. anyways there is a reason why nintendo games are so highly rated by critics  if you give them a shit review your career is over. do you have any proof of this, or are you just spouting conspiracies? time after time both critics and publishers have denied theories like this, and there's never been any evidence. plus we even see with recent games like princess peach showtime, if a game isn't amazing, critics will call it out."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,when did i say i was a centrist. the games are objectively mid.. designed by a dedicated company to please their fans. nothing about the games are amazing or compelling. they are at best fun action games with some cool mechanics once a decade or so.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,only a minority even plays nintendo games
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,im not just saying that. hes implying that things like justin beiber are popular and objectively bad. i am saying that its not true because his perception of what is good or bad is entirely subjective.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"but i'm not talking about the ranking here, i was just responding to your comment. for me a ranking like this one doesn't make any sense anyway, as i said the best game of all time doesn't exist. each player can have his favorite games but it remains subjective and i should point out that botw isn't even my favorite game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"maybe it's just because i have grown to hate open world games, but i find it really hard to call any open world game after the genre has been beaten to death with a rusty stick by every aaa developer truly innovative. i feel like the love that botw and totk get is because nintendo brought that genre to a platform and franchise that hadn't seen anything like it. personally i enjoyed horizon zero dawn more than either of those games, probably the only open world game i have actually truly enjoyed since minecraft. maybe i will add shadows of mordor to the list as well, but i wouldn't call either shadows of mordor or horizon zero dawn innovative. edit in all fairness i didn't get through more than a couple of hours of botw or totk because i found them so insanely frustrating and boring. maybe if i had given them more of a chance i would enjoy them, but i really find it hard as an adult to dedicate time to play games i don't actually enjoy."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,135 millions switch sold
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,my comment kinda goes hand in hand with the ranking though. a game that is repetitive and boring shouldn't be in a top 10 list imo. sure you can't have a best game but you can have a highest rated game. botw making that consiste try is what gets me. every person i have actually met has a similar opinion about the game. it's fun. it's not a great game. it's ok
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,"maybe it's just because i have grown to hate open world games but like, you do recognize this is straight up bias, right? i feel like when we are discussing the innovationa of a medium, we need to throw out personal biases aside and see how it actually affects the industry. plus again, in this case, we're talking about an aggregate ranking of a list other people made  if you wouldn't rank it that high, that's fine. but to say that it shouldn't be there especially now that you've admitted you haven't even played more than a couple hours of the game just makes no sense to me. whether you like open world games or not, it doesn't change the fact that it's possible for one to come along that breaks the mold. whether you like botw or not, it doesn't change the fact that it has influenced the industry towards a direction it may not have without it. again, so many developers have publicly credited botw for influencing their game design. a game needs to be innovative in some capacity to yield that sort of effect. maybe i will add shadows of mordor to the list as well, but i wouldn't call either shadows of mordor or horizon zero dawn innovative. horizon zero dawn is actually the perfect example of an open world game that, despite being a great game, was very much not innovative. and that's a big reason why botw's release famously outshined it  because you had, within a week, two games of the same genre showcasing vastly different levels of innovation. it's not just that botw was better than horizon which is subjective, but it's because of how innovative it was at its core that sparked so much conversation. side note i'd actually say shadow of mordor had a pretty innovative feature, being its nemesis system. but as a whole, i agree the game didn't do much to move the needle. maybe if i had given them more of a chance i would enjoy them, but i really find it hard as an adult to dedicate time to play games i don't actually enjoy. and this is a totally fair take. if you don't like the games, there's no reason to force yourself to play them. but if you barely even scratched the surface of what they offer, i just don't see how it's worth wasting your time debating why they don't deserve the praise and accolades if you haven't even experienced them in full."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-15,steam alone has that many monthly users. not counting the 60mil playstation and 58mill xbox one. nintendo sold enough units to account for almost a third of the gaming audience. that is even accounting for overlap. people likely roll in play the 2 or 3 decent nintendo games each year then go back to the 100s that come out each year on other platforms. edit..aka minority
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-14,"i don't know what to tell you. you and the people around you may not represent the majority of people, don't you think ? just because some people find it boring doesn't mean it's an absolute truth. because you can find people with any opinion if you look, that's not what tells us the general appreciation of a game that, for many people, was clearly not boring. and once again the rankings don't indicate much, well it's just a kind of statistical average, in any case people shouldn't give them too much importance. there are plenty of very well ranked games that i don't care about at all and that don't interest me, i would even say that it's most of them. no game can be loved by everyone, and we all have our personal ranking, trying to be objective is futile all games are repetitive after a while, i think that the latest zelda are clearly not among the most repetitive games, on the contrary i think that it offers a lot of diversity, even if obviously like all games it has repetitive aspects that would have deserved more attention in the details and originality you have the right to not like it too much or find it boring, but that remains a personal opinion. conversely, no one is going to force you to like it"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,it's honestly weird that it even lets you preorder at all. the ps store didnt even give me an option to buy the remaster until the upgrade dropped
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"that's awesome. in a similar situation, i bought a digital copy of cyberpunk 2077 for playstation 4 way back when the game was originally released, and then for christmas 2023 i was blessed enough that one of the gifts left underneath the christmas tree for me turnedout to be a goddamned brandnew playstation 5! and after i got the machine hooked up to my 4k tv and plugged into the wall and turned it on for the very first time and did all the initial setup and h'whatnot, i came to realize that the playstation 5 allows you to download any and all games that you boughtdownloaded digitally on your playstation 4, and play them on your ps5. so naturally i started queueingup all the digital copies of games i got via my old ps4 to download after the free digital copy of spiderman 2 that the ps5 came bundled with finished downloading. and so also naturally, one of the first games from my digital ps4 library that i chose was cyberpunk 2077 cuz i'd actually never gotten around to playing it in all the years since buying it lol. and after it finished downloading, i obviously went to go click on it and start playing....but just before i did i noticed an extra button just to the right of the play game button that said upgrade to ps5 version. i assumed this would require that i pay or something but still clicked on it anyway just to see h'what h'was h'what. and to my shock  joy that button brought me to a page of the playstation store that allowed me to download the new playstation 5 version of cyberpunk 2077 absolutely free of charge because i had already purchased a digital copy of the original playstation 4 version of cyberpunk 2077! thus i wound up never even playing that ps4 copy of the game, either on my ps4 or my ps5, because now i own the playstation 5 version of the game, which is obviously the best console version of the game that exists and the 2nd best version of the game that exists behind the pc version on a proper rig obviously lol. so yeah, this seems to be something sony has been doing with ps5 versions of games that one has previously purchased on their ps4. very much a w on their part. and was apparently a horrifically buggy mess that was near unplayable until much more recently, when the devs finally managed to fixup and patch the game to the point where all those issues are resolved and the game is actually playable and enjoyable now  in other words, the game has actually been completed now, lol!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"asking for a friend bc i dont have this game and never played it, anyone know if the remastered version is adding any new content or is it just rebuying the game on ps5?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,if it isnt clear this also works for the disc version too
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"this game was released in 2020, there is no remaster it's just a bump up in graphics on the ps5.... which should be free. it would essentially be the same if a game developer on a pc game had the ultra settings of their game locked behind a 10 paywall, this is asinine and people should have to pay for this on console, almost every other game has done a ps5 version for free with better graphic fidelity and performance. stop supporting this crap."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-06-02,they just want you to buy digital so that they have control over it
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"can't wait for it to release on pc. modders will be about to fix the games story, finally."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,xbox gave you free upgrades lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,having to pay for a next gen upgrade is wild to me. if you owned skyrim when they released the remaster on steam you got the remaster free.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"this should be the norm remastering a game in itself is already shitty, every single original owner should get the remasters for free."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,if only tlou pt 2 was actually any good.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,why did you preorder a game? especially digitally lmao. terrible decision in every way

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,huh. people still preorder games. thats wild.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,why are you buying the same game twice. a train wreck of a game even.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,people need to stop pre ordering things that have been clearly shown to be discounted for them on launch
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,i don't understand why this is a w? i am pretty confident dozens of games maybe hundreds? have had free upgrades since 2020
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,what w? lmao fkn boot lickers
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,why preorder a digital game? afraid theyll run out of bytes?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,do i dont get the discount because i bought the game physically that sucks
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"gesture of goodwill. lol. should be the standard for things like this. but, how did people still not know that the upgrade would be cheap for previous owners. it's been known for a while."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"holy shit, sony actually did a good thing for once."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,this is how you get customers for life
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i still cant believe they already made a remaster. its only been 4 years. i expect either a big remake for a game that was poorly done in everything or at least resident evil 4 where its been a looong time between.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"from time to time sony can be good... it's rarely to watch it, but it happens. now something like this would be really cool about playstation plus, anything... even some price discount for people who is suscripted to it for years."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,it would be a bigger w if they improved the ux for upgrades. why do they prevent preorders for upgrades? why even allow people to buy it at full price if the upgrade is available?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,never played this. might if i can get it cheap. how do i do that without ever owning the game?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,an even better deal would be to just cancel the purchase so you dont have to play this goddamn shitty excuse of a game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,big l purchasing that game at all tbh
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,imagine paying for a graphics update lol.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,weird because when games get a remastered on steam i automatically get upgraded with no cost or inconvenience. doesnt really seem like a w to me.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"a big w would be, you bought the game already, so we turned the graphics settings up for free!"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i dont know if its a big w. it should be free. pc doesnt charge you for upgrading your computer. xbox offers smart delivery so you play whatever version works best on your hardware. yet we have playstation over here trying to get more money from you because you had the audacity to buy another console from them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"thats nice, but i wish they allow you to preload the game though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"big l,game is trash"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,why buy the same game that's only 3 years old? slightly improved graphics with the same garbage double story?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,the update isnt free and this is the bare minimum they could do. really low standards.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i didnt need a remaster anyways. it was a decent third person shooter with a horrible story twist and an utterly unlikable character. this is the most toxic elements of the film industry leaking into our games

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,seriously? there's no reason those remasters shouldn't be free if you already own the original game.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,the fact that that game is getting a remaster is nothing but a scam... what's next? metro exodus remastered?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,do they do this for good games too?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,they announced that upgrade when they announced the remaster. you should never have preordered in the first place tbh. all this was is sony covering their ass from people complaining that they played themselves.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,did you really preordered the same game that you already owned?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,how is this a w? much less a big w? you preorderd a port of a game that would have been a patch if it was any other system but because it's playstation it's 10.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,they should give refunds to anyone who bought the game in the first place.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"i still think consoles should just not be a thing anymore. at this point in time, people basically require a pc for either work or school. instead of consoles, they should be releasing mini gaming pcs or something. i don't understand the point of consoles anymore. instead of spending money upgrading to the next gen console, you could just upgrade your pc. or at least upgrading to the next gen mini gaming pc. i just don't see the justification in limiting what you're able to play for no reason. some games are on xbox, some games are on playstation. it's ridiculous. just have everything be pc and be able to play whatever you want. but it's your money. just seems like a really big waste. i can't believe they still make consoles."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,but lets put 3 diferent plus pack and if you don't have it can't play online games.. what is this the 90's? fun was the time when ps3 launched and people didn't need to pay to play online rofl consoles are weak and completly obsolete but have fun getting crumbs from psn and microsoft

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,damn thats why i never preordered. i wonder if its too late lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,such an easy win for them it should be this way with every remaster or remake of a game that isnt decades old
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,and that is how i like my semi dystopian console services.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,that's good considered they are 95 the same game with very little graphics changes lol just mainly the additional modescontent. the 10 is the correct price for what you already own 95 of.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,glad they have learned something after the last few times of being called out for predatory practices.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,please sony stop remastering the last of us games like 20 times remaster like bloodborne or make it available on pc please i beg you it's like 99 of the reason i have a ps4
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,the w would be if you could just pre order the 10 upgrade..
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,wasnt gunna upgrade. now i will. cheers  sony. can you buy call of duty now?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"tbh i see this more as a cya move then a good guy move. i absolutely appreciate the gesture, i just assume the motivation wasn't we gotta protect our consumers as much as it was probably we gotta protect ourselves. just imagine the backlash if they let all these orders go through, and then they have to deal with all the refundsexchanges. i guess i'm just cynical."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,ubisoft punching the air rn since they'll still sell games at full price. activision too.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"for months i had been wondering when this would be brought up. the price in the store did not reflect whether or not you purchased tlou already, thus causing many to preorder at full price. glad it's been fixed"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,still doesnt make up for having to pay for a stupid ps plus subscription
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,this is cool because ive been confused by the price. they have said itll be cheap for current owners but it doesnt give you an option to order it on discount if you have the game. i just figured id buy it tomorrow and joel the option is there by then.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,im actually looking forward to playing this game. only played the first and i want to give it a shot and see whether or not i like it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,so funny to see people in comments still find a way to complain. the absolute rageboner reddit as a while seems to have for playstation is insane.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,my questions is what's the price difference?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,meanwhile xbox please buy skyrimdefinitive remastered legendary revisited dragonborn plus ultimate mega game of the year edition!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"why not just give you the upgrade for free? this is sort of like the same thing, just with extra steps..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"i mean this should be standard service, having to pay more to play on both or just one console is a scam,"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"i don't understand why they didn't make the 10 upgrade available for preorder before launch day. after i heard about the discounted upgrade for owners of the original game, i was very confused trying to find it on the playstation store. all i saw was full price, and i began questioning whether i actually even owned the original or just played it through ps."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i've reread this statement many times. where's the w?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,holy hell i didn't expect that from sony
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,you should just have a free upgrade ive already purchased the game and ive bought a new console so i think the money balances tf out
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"so as i understood, you paid to get preorder the game, but sony decided that you should going fuk yourself and they gave you a freaking version of digital ps5?!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,why... is this game getting remastered? its a pretty recent game all things considered.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"wait, they already remastered the second game?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,so if i own a physical version of tlou 2 can i get the ps5 version free or is it only for digital version owners?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"it is a big win when you still have to pay to get a patch, basically?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,but why did you preorder it if you knew there was going to be a small upgrade fee? unless you didn't know. but cool on playstation for doing this.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,good storefronts don't let you make the purchase in the first place.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,its funny because mine still says unavailable for purchase because i own the ps4 version no preorder available no upgrade option just straight up  no kinda annoyed about it tbh
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,that is a w of very small proportions. but we still take those.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,or because you don't have a ps5 they're essentially making you buy one
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,where's the w?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,thats great. but why not just let people preorder the 10 update ahead of release?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,feels extremely rare to happen especially given their usual refund policies and ps plus prices
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,too bad the game isnt even remastered
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"dang, a huge corporation saying no to money? this is how you generate good will with customers. anyone know what the discount will be?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,60 day refund lmao
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,how the fuck are they doing a remaster of a game that's not even that old?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,you're still only buying a license to use with digital.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,now that's good business.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,why pre order a remake? why pre order any non indie game? why why why
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"i looked today, they wouldn't even allow me to pre order it this is the reason why. now it'll be a 10 upgrade."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,sony not doing everything they can to screw over their consumers.. did hell freeze over or something?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"i dont have the option to preorder it, is it just making me wait until tomorrow for the upgrade?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,don't preorder games at all! don't support this behavior of the greedy companies.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,not a big win at all. it's just what should be done. wouldn't be surprised if sony is paying to try to make this shit to the front page.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,this apply to disc owners?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,lol a paid upgrade is a big w... this type of shit should be free
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,big l for preordering... not only that but preordering a remaster of a 3 12 year old game...

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,the same game with some improved graphics. and the game is only a few years old.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,there are certain scenes that i don't need in 4k 60fps
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,is it? cyberpunk launched with a free upgrade for both xbox and ps. their launch had a lot of bad news surrounding it so i think a lot of people forget that they got that part right.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"plot twist, the cheaper upgrade is only available on launch day."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,big w for a remaster game lmao
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,oh crap it launches tomorrow??
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"60 days? wtf, it should be a maximum of 2 weeks depending on your bank."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"i think we should hold every company up to valve's standard which even makes things like this look pretty bad. without considering valve, this is kinda good but should still be considered the bare minimum. while considering valve this is garbage"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i'm australian and this confused me.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,why are they selling a current gen patch? lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"just got this, i'm broke so this is really convenient. i only found out they planned to make an upgrade available after buying the preorder it isn't there yet, easy to not know there even was one"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,wow where was this shit for last of us part 1 ps5 remaster? i and many others bought that game for ps3 and ps4...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"60 days to invest those funds, big w"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"i swear theyre going to announce the last of us part iii remastered, before the last of us part iii."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i picked the wrong day to switch phone numbers and update my 2 step verification  no wonder my queue was 400 people.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"i didn't realize this was releasing already. i don't love having to pay, but i'm cool with a 10 upgrade. i could see part 1 coming to extra within the next few months after milking the extra sales. offering a cheaper upgrade for part 2 will make some less hesitant on purchasing part 1."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,wait so if i have a ps4 disc do i get the discount?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"nah until we see bloodborne and ghost of tsushima on pc, playstation will be holding no ws"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"almost makes you forget how they very nearly reached into your their console, and deleted stole the movies you purchased from them..... almost makes you forget."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i wonder why even today all online refunds still take up so much time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,pretty sure this is normal. i got ps4 spiderman disc and a remastered was available for 10.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,yea when i checked it just told me i already own a version. i took that as a good sign.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,w sony
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,currently playing ffvii on hard mode on my ps5 bc it was free since i had the ps4 version. more companies should be like this.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i was thinking how does big w send messages to you
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,over 10k upvote for this dumb nothingness? no wonder big corpspublishers continue to do what they what to in the game industry when people want to lick their balls over something small like this.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,why would anyone even buy the remaster
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"big l. you already know they're going to find any way they can to keep holding onto that money so you're gonna get credit, not a refund. this is the same company that put rootkits on their music cds and wrecked countless computers and optical drives with their garbage. and you still trust them to do anything remotely close to right?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"this is most likely compliance with some the law of jurisdictions, dressed up as customer service lol sonyplaystation never ever ever do this unless their legal team as advised of a real and significant liability in terms of prosecution or civil suit."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"they could be sued otherwise, so yeah"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,no its not they upped the subscription fee and all you fools forgot about it already
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,apparently i can't purchase or upgrade until release. that's what i'm reading on ps5.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,basic decency from a corporation is a big w. and that's pretty fucking sad.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,playstation w
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,what if you miss the launch day? you could potentionally have to pay more. this seems poorly thought out.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,fucking epic!1!1!1!1!1!1!!1!1!1!1!1
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,a w would be a free upgrade ffs
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"except for the part where a refund could take 60 fucking days? this shit should be illegal, they manage to take your money instantaneously, theres no good reason it shouldnt come back just as fast."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,thats a nice step in the right direction. cant wait to see this same kind of care when it comes to ps plus and the amazing ip that have been dormant for too long
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,might just get a playstation considering they did this for them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"it makes sense though, they would be absolutely swamped with refund requests otherwise. honestly it's just saving their customer service from having to work overtime."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,how much is the deep discount?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,up to 60 days? bro what
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"i am genuinely shocked that one of these big, faceless companies did something nice for a change. way to go playstation and count your lucky stars op lol"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"wow, so nice of them to only make you only pay a little for the same shit you already own."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"theyre already remastering part ii? how many different remakes, remasters are naughty dog gonna milk out of this franchise?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"well at least after this, there hopefully won't be any more tlou remasters for a while, but i'm crossing my fingers there will be a the last of us part 1 remastered in around 34 years. nice that you don't have to pay full price for an upgrade though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,confused in australian
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,i'm confused or read it wrong what does this mean
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,yahoo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,ion care about sony or ps but this is indeed a big dubya
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"good job playstation, you screwed yourself over."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"okay, thank you this confirms why i couldn't preorder the ps5 version i own the ps4 version."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,thats cool
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"i too thought it was a purchase from the australian department store. thought it might have something to do with a recent promoted post on facebook that i saw. it was a post linking to their online store and the call to action was about getting the latest technology from big w... unfortunately, it seemed the product chosen was an automated choice because it was advertising a ps4 of which a handful of stores have like 1 remaining that they couldn't clear before the ps5 arrived. the comments on the fb post were quite funny."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"w, but can we talk about the 60 days!?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,wait if i wanted the preorder bonus but didnt wanna pay full price would i be able to do this too and get a refund before two hours lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"i know this is kind of off topic, but man as a bloodborne fan, tlou 2 getting a remaster after 3 years is a real kick in the balls. anyways gonna go eat a bowl of copium while i wait for silksong news"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,bruh op do you read fine printreviews or do you just go click buy on things like an absolute bot
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,an even bigger w would have been to just refund 40 and upgrade for free
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"not sure if this is a dumb question, but here we go. when i had a ps4 back when, i bought lou 2 for it. then i got rid of my ps and went pc. now im still pc, but also just recently bought a new ps5. i had forgotten i still had the disc version of lou 2 with me. anyways i installed it on my new ps5. will i get the upgrade for free?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,and then there is ubisoft....
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"seriously. i felt so fucked by cyberpunk at launch, and sony legit removed it from their store so that they could provide a full refund."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,what's a big discount?. like 50 of the 70 usd?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,their customer support needs to be fixed pronto
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"so they're not refunding the difference and giving us the game, they're essentially refunding everything within 60 days and i now need to go and pay a further 10 now to get the upgrade? i know it's only 10 but i don't see why they can't just refund it all bar 10. edit  completely glossed over that the refund may end up being store credit too!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,is it a win if theyre doing it because of backlash? a win wouldve been doing it without needing asked
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"more like fixing an error that would otherwise result in massive brand damage and or legal issues? pretty unspectacular if i do say so, these sorts of things should be expected."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,tthey remastered part two? huh?! it came out like twothree years ago.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,i thought this was a photo of a playstation from big w
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,anyone else find it hilarious that there's more remasters of tlou games than there are nonremasters?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,is this a big win? theyre still remastering a game that is only a few years old. its still just a massive cash grab
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,chad sony moment
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,playstation at least has dignity to refund unlike some other trash companies like nintendo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,thanks for the heads up! i have a copy of the original in my closet somewhere. never finished the game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,ohhh shiiittt say less
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,the most pointless remaster ever. tlou2 already looks nextgen...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,i dont think this is a dub i mean imagine i have an old pc and i buy a new pc to play a game i already own the graphics update is free yall getting milked with these money grabbing so called remasters its a disgusting practice in the industry. you should not be charged for better graphics after forking out for better hardware.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"considering these lot refused to refund me for the same thing when uncharted 4 was rereleased in a similar manner, this is a big win."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"i dont see this as a w, most companies wouldnt even charge for the small upgrade theyre offering. look at horizon and god of war, both had ps5 upgrades that cost nothing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,cant wait
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"that's awesome, now. if only ps wasn't like 80 billion dollars a month"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,what does big w mean
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"is it available for a discount on launch day, or from launch day? i.e is it only available for one day?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"good move, however just make it playable on both generations for free like xbox attempts to."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,oh wow they did the bare minimum and still want you to pay a few bucks for the same game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,you bought the game twice?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,a remastered version of a game which hardly needs any remastering is hardly a w.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"wow, this certainly makes me like sony more"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,stop preordering games altogether.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,meanwhile i cant play some of my ps5 game upgrades i paid for cause i redeemed the ps plus versions when i had it and support told me theres nothing they could do
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"the first of undegevinter, what a month that is going to be. yes i looked up the latin for 19 and was a sly dig at the us date format"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,i got the game on disc the ps4 version do i have to put the game in then i get the ps5 version
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,youre still paying 10 for a console upgrade other games make free lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,meanwhile i got a combo of re3 and re3 remake for 40 on gog for pc last year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,this doesnt balance the content removal that i and others paid for sony. not by a long shot
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,then they delist it 10 years from now and the physical copy skyrockets in value and you own nothing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,is it though? couldnt they have let everyone know this beforehand? how long ago did you pay for your preorder? because they wouldve been making interest on that money the whole time they had it and they sure arent refunding that back to you.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,i didn't get this message becayse i waited until the 10 upgrade was live. i did receive the preorder stuff when i bought the upgrade though. not sure if the preorder stuff is because it's upgrade or always offered. i only had the standard edition of tlou2 as well that i bought in a sale between lockdowns if memory serves. i will say it's awesome they did this though and also let you know. i bought a game in the past which came to ps plus a few days later and they refunded me for it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,they barely added anything...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,they couldn't have done this with ghost of tsushima director's cut? for context i absolutely adore ghost of tsushima. but director's cut wasn't fucking worth the initial price tag. they should have given digital deluxe edition owners a cheap upgrade path.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"wait what, wasn't part 2 release just a couple years ago? there is a remaster already? they really are milking that cow dry, huh"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,that's ... actually surprising.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,i wouldnt pay what they are asking for less pop in anyway.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,yet if you get gt7 you can play on both ps45...this is a w how? paying more to play a game you already own? seems scummy
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,sony to established customers  sony to not customers

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"1. that's the bare minimum, this is not a big w. 2. you preordered a remaster of a game that came out only a few years ago, sounds like a big l for you. actually you know what, this is a big w for sony, they suckered you into preordering a remaster for a game that's only a few years old, minimum effort maximum profits, see you in a few years when you preorder the remaster of the remaster. why does shit like this get upvoted, why are we praising companies that do the bare minimum?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,smaller thing happened to me but sony never sent me my money back they sent it to a one time use psn card so i got jiped
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,playstation is such a w console and company.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,the big win would have been to never make a remaster lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,thats decent
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,so because ive got a digital version of tlou2 i can get the ps5 remastered for free?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"i cant wait to play this, im late to the party. i know a lot of you will be envious!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,are you really praising sony for having you pay more for a game you already own? disgusting
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,theres no way he got a refund ive tried but they have never answered me
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,with cyberpunk you get the upgrade for free on all platforms
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,same thing happened to me when i was pre ordering the spider man remaster. so a win in my opinion.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,a big w would be getting a free upgrade to a game thats 3 years old if you already own it
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,is the 10 upgrade always going to be 10?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,should be free

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"the option to upgrade wasnt available for me on the psn store until the day of, which made no sense to me. they were begging for this to happen"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,why cant we get a 10 upgrade for the first one too? i dont want to spend full price on a game i already own over and over
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,wait so what if i have the disc version? are we not eligible?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,upgrade for only 10? sign me up
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,wow  i should get it too??
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,i was wondering how are they remaster a game that is still fairly new??? i was like they are trying to make as much as possible...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,playstation is actually being proconsumer for once. im impressed.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,bro how many times do they remaster these games shit is getting out of hand. pt2 is only 4yrs old
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,up to 60 days damn lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,why would he pay full price of a remastered game is what they thought even a ps5 upgrade fuck that im good.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,so i have to preorder just to still pay for it
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"i mustve missed something, why does this game need a remaster already? it looks incredible still"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,nice! im buying that today! thanks for heads up. i usually dont find this stuff out until later lol.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,what
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,deleted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,sony didn't have to do this. w for gamers who are loyal to the series . p.s i hope they do this with future remasters. a small fee or part of playstation plus service
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,i thought this was rtylerthecreator for a sec and was like why tf does this have to do with tyler the creator
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,didnt realize woolworths was still a thing. they havent been in the states since the 90s
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,why does a brand new game have a remaster? did you guys really let them sucker you into buying a linear single player game multiple times?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,the no return mode is fun as fuck
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,i wish they wouldve done this with the first game. i had just bought the remastered version of the last of us part one and the ps5 version came out maybe two months later. and i just cant justify spending another 60 bucks on the video game. i understand its a little different but still.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,do they have the same policy for part 1 if you have the remaster for ps4?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,how about 20 dollars
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,its not remastered. its just the ps4 version with more skins. theres no upgrade in terms of the graphics and performance. its a huge ripoff.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,hey good for them
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,free would've been a bigger w. but 10 isn't bad.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"jesus, what the hell went wrong?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,now this is how you take care of your costumers
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,i got it for ps4 when it first came out but i dont see the upgrade
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,why is this happening? this is just as pointless as the ps5 spiderman
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,how is this being remastered already i thought this came out recently lmao damn time flies it still feels like the las of us part two came out like last year or two years ago
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,massive playstation win they didnt want the zero brains who preordered it to waste 60
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,remastered for the ps5 only bullshit
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,i wasnt able to even make the preorder or ten dollar purchase until the day of release. it gave me an error saying i already owned the product.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,reddit talk is so damn confusing. what are you people saying??
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,i own the disc version of last of us part 2 on ps4. i wish i could upgrade to the digital version and not have to use the ps4 disc.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,i'm guessing those who are unfortunate enough to not be able to get a ps5 won't be able to get the last of us part 2 remastered version even though i already have the game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,what about the physical version? do we get a discount?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,from the little bit of the new modes i've seen it looks really good.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"thanks for the info, downloading now!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,i'd much rather an upgrade option instead of buying a new copy each time. gta v there's like 5 different versions
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,this is their way of getting rid of future free ps5 upgrades
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,good. seemed like a scam to make people buy it full price again.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,torrenting and iso literally takes no time if you know what you want.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,fao that's what you get stop supporting crappy gaming companies
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,yes big w
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,if i buy a used copy will i still be able to purchase the remaster at a discount price?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,the new modes are surprisingly fun
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,that's crazy i didn't know they actually cared lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,doing something normal conglomerates never do lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,i believe during preorders they had the game still listed at 40 and i have the ps4 digital version. even if i was to get the upgrade i wasnt going to preorder but wait until it actually dropped to see if it really was available for 10. glad sony is refunding accounts as needed for the technical blunder
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,do they refund other games for example if you bought the deluxe edition last week and this week the ultimate is on sale
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,so if i bought the disc for like 5 bucks i can upgrade to ps5 for 10? i guess thats cooli thought upgraded to ps5 were free tho. every upgrade i get has always been free
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,why da fuq did you even pre order it?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"i cant seem to find the 10 upgrade option. i installed my ps4 copy, have the disc in yet nothing. what am i doing wrong?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"if only they did this with gow ragnarok, it wants me to pay 10 to upgrade to ps5 version"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"no factions, not paying for an upgrade."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,130?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,60 days??
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,what about physical? i would be interested in the upgrade but i bought it day one physical.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,its digital they literally could let people just click download on the store since they already own it.. this sounds highly illegal.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,has any playstation user been able to upgrade for the 10 sony stated? there is no visible option to do so that i can find.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,why is anybody even buying this it's a newer gane it doesn't even need a remaster
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,damn! i want a physical copy though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-21,anyone who preordered it after the announcement that it was only a 10 upgrade was an idiot...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-21,upgrade is a good deal
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-21,"nice. i've been screwed so many times with their sales flipping. most recently last month got re village for 16 plus copped the extra 10 for dlc on sale also. total 26. now this month, they offer the gold edition plus you get the trauma dlc addon for 20"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-21,guys look what happened you
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-21,guys really seriously im my friend is rachel food and im afraid
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-21,"how do you get the preorder bonuses then if you can't preorder the upgrade? you just preorder the playstation 5 version, get it refunded, and then upgrade? that's three steps, two too many. just make the upgrade available for preorder. not much of a w if i'm reading that right."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-21,upto 60 days wtaf hahahaha
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-21,but still no upgrade for gta 5 ps4 to ps5.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-21,sony actually pretending to be a decent company lol.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,rare based sony
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,"awesome. thats the way it should be with all companies! and the 10 dollar upgrade is 100 worth it, especially for those of us who already bought and played the original version. props to you for preordering the bad boy before they had even announced the 10 upgrade option!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,wait wait wait. hold the fuck up a sec. theyre remastering tloup2? that games less than 4 years old. thats like doing a digital remaster of the fucking sonic movie.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,how is there a remaster already? the game came out 2 years ago. what a waste of time and resources on a pointless endeavour
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,is this getting a pc port??
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,me when sony do the bare minimum.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,"first time ive seen playstation willingly refund something, their policy is by far the worst"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,amazing that they take the money instantly but takes 60 days to process a refund.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,how about if you have the hard copy last of us 2 disc?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,wait do you have to preorder to get the 10? bruh dont tell me that
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,why did they remaster it?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,god damn

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,gotta preorder those digital versions of games! dont want the digital copies to run out!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,"okay fair play, i'm not sure if this was good will for customer relations or they felt bad for you actually purchasing that game tho"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,you should just wait until last of us part 2 remastered remaster. ps. you actually pre ordered this? wow. just. wow
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,this will be free on ps plus in 6 months. no reason to buy it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,upgrade is free on pc
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,"is this really a w? other games not looking at you, skyrim often do the nextgen update for free. witcher 3 and metro redux come to mind first, but there are more."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,where as xbox literally bought cod hahaha
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,highly surprised. took me a month and 29 emails to argue a refund on a game with less than an hours play time. sony have the worst refund policy from a vendor i have ever seen. the meta quest has a better refund policy ffs. sony is so far behind it hurts.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,"big w playstation on doing something they absolutely should do anyway. im not paying another 50 for the same game haha. i dont even think i should have to spend 10, honestly."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,"how can it be getting remastered, it only just came out a couple of years ago"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,"this sub needs better standards if 10 for something other games are giving for free is considered a win. and at least with the resident evil ports, you got a good game. even then, you should not be celebrating sony fixing their fuck up. that should be the bare minimum"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,"well.most upgrades are freesuch as the walking dead saints and sinners 1, jurassic world evolution 2, and other games"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,"for anyone whos confused in australia, big w means big wallaby."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,we apologise for the convenience
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,"we just going to forget that some games give free next gen upgrades since it costs them nothing and pc games don't lock you out for daring to upgrade your hardware, since the only reason the games aren't compatible between console generations is that they make it that way? i guess sure, big w for not screwing players over as much as they usually do."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,here's the same shit you already played for extra money. big win for sony. this was a comedic post right?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,thats not a big w thats standard
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,w? so you have to pay to get the game again on ps5? literally all of my next gen upgrades are free on xbox
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,bro why won't my xbox do this
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,how is paying for a game you already own a w
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,does anyone make new games any more or just make old ones shinier?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,"only playstation can take up to 60 days to refund you something you did even get. buy an xbox. they're thieves. their policy is not to refund, even when you have the right, because they can earn more money on the people that do not threat to legally challenge their refuse to reimburse. i left them for this reason. i felt i was conning people ."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,so basically they gave you your money back to spend less on your repurchase on release with pre order bonus still included. nice.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,"lol fuck that, big f. you just don't refund someone unless they request it, wtf. lots of money just got sent back to alreadydisposedof prepaid debit cards lmao"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,thats sick!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,"60 days?? i thinks it's funny that to take money from us it's immediate, but to refund it takes 60 days lol"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,yes and it's worth the 10. the no return mode is very fun.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,hahahahaha. be like cd projekt red. if you own the game the remaster should be free. this isnt a win. its a scam.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,this should be the standard not an exception but i guess its a dub
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,is it a real w when it's a decision so logical that it should have been the case from the start?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,hi
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,"an l if you asked me. yes it's it's nice gesture but after seeing the ps5 version it makes me think sony has gotten so full of itself it can just charge u for what essentially is a slightly better version over the pro version on ps4. it should have been free from the off. although i no longer play on an xbox i can atleast say they have done a better job with next gen upgrades and have no additional costs, put in disk and there you have it 4k 60fps with almost no jaggies and hdr support even for some. sony has a few great games which is its strength, but i dislike the ecosystem and thus built a pc over a ps5."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,"rare but massive w. well done, sony."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,"i had this with ac valhalla. went from ps4 to ps5 and they gave me a free upgrade. fc5 automatically remastered itself when i transferred it over. same with far cry 6, but it's a shit game so i don't play it. i wish all the ps4 games would automatically run at higher settings, like the pc games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,how much on xbox
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,why would someone pre order it when they are able to get the upgrade some people dont make sense
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,i really learnt a lot about how to run a business from this one post. damn.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,anyone know if this was only available on launch day? or would i still be able to get the 10 today on the 23rd?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,"somebody tag microsoft, forza and ubisoft. they need to learn from this then rather tell use to get comfortable renting games they can cancel at anytime and give no refund  any you'll be happy."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,i wish xbox had exclusives this goof
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"in some cases yes, but in most cases its free upgrades depending on the developer"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"when i buy a game on pc and move to a more powerful system later on, i get the hd upgrade for free. edit all yall are morons, lol. it means i have a faster computer and can turn my graphics settings up. or get a texture pack or whatever. im not a monkey. i dont care about shiny things like skins or boring, filler side quests that add nothing. i buy my games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,you know that could be for free right ?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,you have to still have the disc though
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,yea it 10 and includes some new content
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,this works for physical copies too?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"they are doing what many devs have done when charging and a basic 10 upgrade. which is fair, because you are paying for graphical updates and etc. rockstar charged 20 for gta v upgrade, then turned around and put it in the playstation plus. i was pissed whe i saw its now free.."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,"wow they realized a few tweaks isn't worth 60 bucks, good job, i wonder if ps is the one that pressed the company about this"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,im so australian that im actually confused. what is op saying if they arent talking about big w?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,most accurate post i kept reading it to work out how it related to big w. because it's not like i wouldn't make sense to bring up the store for game chat. they sell games for generally cheaper than most other retailers.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i'm too chronically online that now when i hear someone talking about the store big w i instantly think of the internet term

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,get out of my head.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i saw this and was deeply confused by the big w part of the post

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-24,"i'm not australian, and i have no fucking idea what the big w part means. my best guess is woolworths, despite not being australian."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,yes. you can buy the 10 upgrade.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"yes, you can get the remasters for 10 upgrade fee. youll need to insert your ps4 disc every time you want to play it"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"i rember when ps was just 50 per year and we got about 8 games monthly, 3 for ps3, 3 for ps4, and 2 for ps vita. this was before support for ps3vita got officially dropped in 2021, im still suprised its up to this day and that some games are still getting discounts lol, theyre all either permenantly discounted now or its an automated system put in place."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"or refunding the game... ooops, you downloaded 1mb? sorry, no refund."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,maybe one day we can back up our ps5 saves on our own usb drives like with ps4 but they are too busy nickle and dimeing us by locking save backups behind ps only.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,yeah one of the only time i called sony is when they charge me full price for ps plus renewal while it was on discount 20 off... they never wanted to either cancel the subscription or pay me back the 20... stellar customer service
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,wish they were this cool with literally anything else
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i wish they were this cool in general. xbox likes to be for the gamers because they have to be. small things like this go a long way for public perception and sony should do it more.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"their ps pricing is fine, it's 80 a year and gives you roughly 40 games"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"becuase its not sony, its the developer."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"those digital copies go quick, gotta act fast."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"i love the studio, have had family work there, so i would gladly give more money to a game and studio that's close to my heart!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,upgrade isn't visible on the store yet. at least it wasn't yesterday when i checked. i can see how people miss it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,you preordered the remaster without seeing if there was an upgrade path?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"well, the bar in the industry is really low right now, so a step up is a step up"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"also, up to 60 goddamn days to process a refund with a caveat of 'we might actually just give you store credit instead of your money back' is not exactly something to be applauded."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,corporation almost fleeces all preorders oh man good guy playstation!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,especially for a remaster of a game that isnt even five years old
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"if anything, it's an l that the ps store allows a user who owns tlou2 to pay full price for the remaster. a better service would automatically detect that the account trying to buy the game should be paying the discounted price...."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,cdpr made cyberpunk and witcher 3 upgrades from ps4 to ps5 absolutely free
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,yeah for real. let's not touch on the fact that we bought the ps4 digital version and preordered this remaster full price. sony just trying to make idiots feel better about themselves. edit and yeah before the downvotes flood in i do think people are fucking idiots for preordering a remaster of a god damn game they bought 3 years ago.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"tbf, bare minimum ethical behavior is a lot to ask for in this day and age..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,this is just rgaming rgaming are full of playstation fanboys. it's not surprising they would bootlick everything playstation and hate everything xboxnintendo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,i cant believe how long it took to find this comment
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"yeah, to show others that we care if they act so. i mean this is a first for me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,having to buy the same game twice?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,every other studiopublisher did nextgen upgrades for free. lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"higher res, some new effects, ps5 controller support and apparently some new content yeah its not great to sell that as a remaster but there have been worse cases"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"tlou remastered came out a year after tlou. tlou 2 remastered is coming out 4 years after tlou 2. the main difference is the hardware upgrade from ps3 to ps4 was more significant and ps4 wasnt backwards compatible. so this just doesnt feel as rewarding, but i dont think its that crazy"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,it released 6 months before an entirely new generation of console hardware
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"its 10, calm down everyone. id certainly pay that if i hadnt played it already"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"idk, taking advantage of better hardware?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,kinda blows by mind that tlou franchise is the one and only game franchise that gets chastised for having a remastered no one complained when spiderman had has a remastered in 2020 that added two suits
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"jesus christ the people in here praising this company for making you pay again for content that you already fucking own. i honestly thought op was being sarcastic at first... let me rephrase this hey, you bought that hardback book at your old house. we see you're moving, and we'd like you to know that you can buy that book again for your new house, at a deep discount that's what this fucking is. this is a fucking scam. httpsyoutu.belod9rlpr51k?t79"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"this is still a nice gesture regardless. i know people love hating on corporations every chance they get, but they always neglect when something positive comes out of them. it's fine to like something a company does. no one wants to constantly be negative so for them to refund a purchase where they couldve netted like 50 dollars instead of 10 is still a nice gesture, a lot wouldve just taken it and not bothered refunding it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,yeah this is literally just common sense. also holy shit these consoles are barren when it comes to video games. who tf gets excited to a remaster of a 4 year old game? lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,how is this the bare minimum? jesus christ when did gamers become so cynically entitled?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"in what universe has this ever been the bare minimum? i can't think of any other company that has done something like this. i still remember getting my ps5 and realizing a ton of games were actually giving me a free upgrade to the ps5 version if i owned the ps4 version. that was unthinkable to me, because back in the day, if a game was on the old gen and the new gen, you got one or the other. not both."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"it's not the bare minimum, it's not their responsibility to check if you are having the game already or not. i do not think they have done it for other games. that being said, op is being really generous with his money. why the fuck anyone would wanna waste 70 for something that they can get for 10 is beyond me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"it's certainly more than the bare minimum. but it's pretty obvious they're just trying to buy back good will, after the discovery incident."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-21,bare minimum? are you serious? every other platform would happily take that extra money instead of letting the consumer know that they can get it for cheaper and refund it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,your wish is granted. they are currently working on 2 new ips. they cancelled the last of us multiplayer to keep resources on them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,apparently they're doing one for horizon as well.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,didn't this game just come out? lmao why are they remastering it? who would buy that shit.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"its just a poorly named dlc, its not really a remaster."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,apparently a triple remaster is a big w
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,a studio putting employees to work on a remaster while also working on 2 new ips to keep their entire staff busy to avoid layoffs reddit cant they do something new!

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,yay sony didnt scam us! wooooo good guy sony
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,how noble of the company to allow them to purchase the same game again but for less money this time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,one thing i liked with xbox this gen was the whole smart delivery. so many of my old games were enhanced without having to shell 6070 for the same game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,it has new modes and changes that warrant the 10 charge imo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"i sort of agree, but that remaster wasn't free to develop"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"there was already a free next gen update years ago, for ps5. this has very minimal performance  graphics updates. it has some minor changes and a new game mode."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,why?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,it's a remaster though so they deserve the extra 60 bucks s
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"not only that, but preordered a remaster of a game that only came out a few years ago. with idiots like op around it's no wonder pointless cash grabs are becoming more and more common."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"if you'd read anything about it it's a 10 dollar upgrade that adds a lot of the tech they used for part 1, and also adds a new rougelike mode and extra levels that weren't part of the first game. totally reasonable for 10 bucks."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"it's a dlc basically, i doubt anyone is buying it for the upgraded graphics. i'm buying it for the shitload of stuff they added."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"if you spent as much time googling what youre actually getting for 10 as you did writing up this comment youd know the answer to that. its dlc and a bunch of other stuff, the graphics improvements are a tiny part of the package."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,what are u talking about? just curious
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"without getting actually into the narrative good and bad, gameplay wise it's a bit better, offering more stuff to craft, better upgrades, and a few subtle but welcome improvements on gameplay. not too many innovations outside the box but there's a couple of neat setpieces there's one that involves swimming that's really neat, and another i won't spoil. the big thing that bugged me, and this does somewhat tie into the narrative, is the jumping around. i won't get too deep into it but there's more than a few narrative jumps that can make progress far more annoying and may risk amplifying negative feelings towards the narrative even if you like it. if you don't care as much about linear progress that probably won't bug you."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,nobody is forcing anyone to buy this. i'm getting it for the extra content. if you have a ps4 version it runs and looks great on ps5 anyways so if someone decides the remaster isn't for them they're really not missing out on much.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,it's not really smart delivery since its a 10 upgrade.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"they refunded their payment method so your point is kind of mute. also, if you don't want to pay that price for a small upgrade then buy the original for much less, it still exists. i imagine these remasters are to keep parity with the pc version as much as anything but they should just call it directors cut or something instead."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"if you actually read the message, you'll see that it says it's refunded to your original payment method, not the psn wallet."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,only in reddit you get downvoted for supporting a studio you love.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"you're paying 70 for a game you already own though, with some added bells and whistles. for a game that came out three years ago. for a studio that crunches employees and throws out millions of dollars of work. i don't want to judge, but i just don't get it lol. edit it's actually 50, still wasting 40 which is how much the ps4 version goes for now."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"you know the little guys already got paid right? they aren't getting residuals, you're just giving some rich guy with 3 yachts even more money"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i mean at that point why not just buy a physical deluxe for like 10 more and get the poster

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,tell them the story of typical revenge is outdated and trash
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,the last of us is one of my favorite games of all time so i completely understand this sentiment.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,why preorder a digital game? why not just wait until it comes out?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,my mannnnn
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,good thing sony refunded your good will.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,you're absolutely braindead.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,most last gen console upgrades are already free
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-22,especially for sony.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"idk why everyone is downvoting that guy. banks can take as long as they like to refund you for charges that have already been processed. i work at a burger king and even we have to tell people it may take up to a week for their refund to appear in their account. its not us, its the bank. 60 days is probably just to cover their asses."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,no. getting a refund when you accidentally pay for the same game twice instead of paying for the upgrade.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,its only a 10 upgrade to the ps5 and it does add things that wasnt in the original release.. so they get a pass.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"why is this ridiculous comment being upvoted? youre not buying the same game twice. you bought the game once, and have the option to enhance its graphics and get bonus content for 10. get a clue."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,it is and it's not in a way. i'd bet a lot of dev work goes into making versions for different hardware so a small price is fair imo. now i don't agree with charging 70 again for something i already paid 70 for.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,having to lol ok
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,you forgot about paying more for the new gen edition. the copium round here is bad these days
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"its amazing to see fanboys in their natural habitat... thanks sony for letting me spend money on the same game twice my man, shit should be free"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,it's a remaster on a different console.. thats like saying i bought spyro on ps1 and now i have to buy it again for ps4!?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,choosing to buy the same game twice
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,and this game isn't an exception. tlou2 got a next gen upgrade for free a long time ago.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"even ignoring the ignorant every other here, nd did give the next gen patch for tlou2 for free."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,yeah thats just not true lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"definitely not. plenty of other devs have charnged for nextgen upgrades. some even more than 10. hogwarts legacy is a good example. the last gen version is 59.99 and only gives the last gen version. the current gen version is 69.99 and only gives the current gen version. to get both the ps4 and ps5 versions in one transaction, you must buy the digital deluxe edition for 79.99. plenty of other devs were charging 59.99 for last gen and 69.99 for current gen, and charging the 10 difference to upgrade. tlou2 was a 59.99 game, they're basically just charging the same upsell everyone else does for current gen."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,its 10 dollars loool lets calm down
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"yeah, so with how close it was to ps5 release it means the devs will have had their hands on the consoles for a significant period of development, especially given theyre a first party developer. they could have just done what a lot of devs do and have a digital upgrade. but they knew people would buy it again so why not? people give rockstar shit for doing the same thing, but apparently nd should be immune."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,and the spiderman remaster didn't even have an upgrade path! you either had to get a deluxe edition of spiderman mm or buy the ps5 version of sm1 full priced
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,nintendo would dropkick you in the face and laugh before they give you any sort of discount on cross gen games
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"yes, nintendo is by far the worst double dipper of the big 3, however that doesn't make what sony did not the bare minimum."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"it's not being nicegenerous, it's just refunding those people who were overcharged as their accounts should have defaulted to the 10 upgrade and not been given the option of a separate purchase. being charged the advertised price is not a gesture of goodwill imo."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i mean they arent wrong. most first party xbox games get free upgrades if they own the previous gen version.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,jesus christ when did gamers become so cynically entitled? you are the best example of the consumers when corps do the bare minimum. we are just used to bad policies that when something this little happens it just looks big.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"yeah same game on snes, playstation one, megadrive, pc and so one? you had to pay full price each time. physical copy costs money wasn't really an argument, pressing cd's cost companies pennys."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"this game came out 3 years ago. this is a money grab. so yes, this is the bare minimum"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"i was also pretty surprised, i here stories of how shitty corps are these days all the time. but this should be the way every company treats there customers, not just a sony w. see what i mean?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"granting a refund for a product you payed 700 of the value for, is the bare minimum in every universe, right?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"it's not the bare minimum, it's not their responsibility to check if you are having the game already or not it kinda is. if op had made a mistake idk why you can even do this when the upgrade path exists and sony didn't fix this because it's kinda an error on their part this is even possible i wouldn't be surprised if there could be some legal trouble. definitely would be a lot of backlash online at the least."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"they only said 1 new ip, im pretty sure the other game is tlou part 3"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,is that their strategy? milk their ip by redoing it ever 2 years? yikes. this whole tlou milking is insaneeeee. probably worst than skyrims cash grab
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"it's not a remaster of a very old game. it's basically a ps4 game being released on the ps5, but if they didn't remaster it, people would complain that it was the same game and a lazy port."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"four years ago. it's a ps5 port with enhanced graphics, dualsense integration, and new content."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,it's a small dlc and not just a remaster
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,they went into the settings and turned the graphics up
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"it didnt just come out, its almost 4 years old. either way its just a ps5 port basically. enhanced graphics and new content and ps4 owners get a 10 upgrade path."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,im going to assume you arent aware or at least thinking of the hbo show of the games? the upcoming second season is based on part 2. part 2 was released on ps4 so it makes perfect sense to have a ps5 version so show watchersps5 owners who never played it can play something current gen.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,thats a very decent thing to do indeed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,who would've thought that smart delivery was actually a feature worth advertising? i thought that was common sense
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,because you already paid for the game. sony changing up their hardware isnt the gamers problem. especially not considering they already spent hundreds of dollars on the new console
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,downvoted for saying the truth...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,why s though?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"still i've never seen someone say that, i used to work for a large online retailer and we would tell customers 5 days max"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"so? if the choice is so clear, go play on pc. why cry about it here?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,lol. shut up.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,but a pc that can play games in 4k 120fps is way more expensive than a 500 console

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"i think the point is in comparison to physical preorders, where you got some form of tangible, limited edition items that you'd only get if you preordered. there was also the part about not having enough copies of a game if you didn't preorder, so it used to be quite necessary if you were interested in playing on launch day. preordering digital games is a little unnecessary unless you care about preloading the game or ingame content that you might not get otherwise. it also sets a precedent for big game companies to make a shit product that's incomplete and unpolished because the idiots will just buy it anyway. otherwise, yeah, nobody should care how someone else spends their money. i don't preorder anymore and i rarely did in the past unless it was a game all my friends were also playing on launch day, but i'm not going to sit here and shame someone for preordering something if they're interested in it."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-02-29,"because other devs are smaller and do it because you're justifying paying 10 dollars for adjusted settings... that's it. that's like charging money for a pc graphics settings option. even worse, not even digital foundry can really notice any differences."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"steam sure. xbox policy is deliberately vague. they don't even have a set amount of time you're allowed to play, just whatever they consider to be a substantial amount of time is the limit. it's why their refunds are inconsistent. some times you can get a refund after a few hours of playing, other times you can't get a refund before having played at all. i'd almost prefer being told straight up that i'm not eligible for a refund as soon as i download it. that way i don't buy and download it expecting to be able to get a refund only to get bit in the ass by the weird, arbitrary, and vague refund policy xbox offers. steams is far better than xbox because they tell you exactly how long you're allowed to play and their own opinions aren't relevant to the equation. can put xbox on the same level when they clarify the exact amount of time you're allowed to play before refunding and there's no exceptions to the rule."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,xbox does not have a better refund policy and deny people all the time if they just download a game. you can check the xbox sub to see it happen all the time. they were even denying people refunds for cyberpunk when it released broken
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,lol on xbox they also give you the series x version free. oh you can also play on windows..

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"well i can only speak for myself here, but i downvoted him because he was being an asshole for no reason. like i have no problem being corrected if i'm mistaken about something, but there's no reason to start a comment with 'you're a fucking idiot' when i've not been uncivil in any way. as far as the actual point goes, if saying 60 days was a cya move than i would expect it to be more common. every major online retailer says something to the effect of 'it may take up to x days for your refund to appear on your balance' and that's understandable as bank processing time, but in most cases the number they give is like 5 or 7 days. if there was actually a chance of a bankcredit card taking two full months to process a refund i'd expect amazonmicrosoftetc. to give similar time frames in their warnings, but they don't."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,i run an online retail business and we say 35 business days. 60 is insane

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,they dont have a very good track record with this though. the playstation store will easily let you buy a deluxe version or a game you already own. they gave me a hard time when i bought nioh after i realized i had already purchased a different version of the game. they eventually gave me a refund but i had to really fight for it and they made it clear it was a one time thing they wouldnt do again.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,probably why they've waited so long for the pc releases. wouldn't want people changing the graphic settings for free.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,automatically granting a refund for something you have a planned sale for in the near future while retaining the bonuses the developer is offering for preordering the game is well above the bare minimum. the bare minimum is offering a refund when a customer requests it. the proactiveness of this action is above the bare minimum.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"can they check? yes. are they under any obligation to check? no. bare minimum is the obligations one haves. if it's not an obligation it cannot said to be the bare minimum. there cannot be any legal trouble. it's two different products. one is for ps4 platform and one is for ps5 platform. sony is under no legal obligation to make backwardsforwards compatible software, remember ps3 games did not work on ps4. you had to buy different version of same games. they did it this gen because well because it was possible and it made business sense but not because it was some legal requirement."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"mate you are confused. this is the same situation. you can take ps4 version of last of us 2, put it into ps5 and with a free patch get 60fps, haptic feedback and a small resolution bump. this new remaster version while not necessary is marketed as a ps5 version with a few new game modes. as someone mentioned earlier if you take a game from 2000 and play it on the latest pc its not going to suddenly look 4k 60. you would have to make a remaster. this is the same but they did it to a game thats relatively new."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"yeah but last of us 2 has a free upgrade from ps4 to ps5 adding 60fps and higher resolution. tlou2 remaster is marketed not as a ps5 upgrade but ps5 native remaster with higher resolution at higher frame rates to support 120hz and vrr, haptics, a new game mode, bunch of other extras, so it cant be free. but yes you can get a 60fps gameplay on ps5 for free with a ps4 game, which will still look stunning."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"that may be bc naughty dog hasnt launched a new game since tlou2, just been remasters after remasters."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"from what i've seen it's def worth it. people also forget not everyone has been into gaming all their life, some people are just now getting into it or maybe passed on it on ps4 and now they have a superior option to pick up on ps5. could be the terminology and how people got soured from so many remasters that are purely resolution bumps for the newest generation such as most of the ps2 games remastered for ps3. though even those were welcome imo but that's just me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,youre literally posting in a shill thread and wondering why people dislike the concept.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"a surprising number of people seem to think that games should ideally be free or cost 20 maximum and never include a season pass, micro transactions, paid remaster, or similar scammy components. at the same time these same people often demand that no staff once hired ever get laid off, that crunch should never be tolerated, people should get extensive sick and other leave, and make a salary which supports a family of four, a house and dog in the bay area. people seem to heavily believe in magic, not just their within games but also when it comes to game development."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,a large part is because this subreddit is filled with mostly 13 year olds that dont even know what money is.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,then why is it called a remaster and not a dlc lmao
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"they really didn't do much. look at witcher 3 free update. they literally made the game next gen with full rtao, rtgi, dlss 3.5, fg, ray reconstruction and an actual complete texture overhaul. do you know how hard it is to put in rtao properly? i don't think you do because if you did, you'd look at this tlou 'graphical update' a fucking joke. its sad af that you're being such an apologist and defending nd that doesn't even know your name. it's actually sad af. the game is still 1440p and has a bit more texture detail. you realize all they fucking did was increase the settings sliders to 'higher'? jfc you're such a schill. you paid for a rogue lite mode, not a fucking graphics update."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"except that im not saaying that i hate tlou2, i havent seen more then 5 minutes of gameplay about it even. my issue here is that somehow people like that they get to buy the same game twice"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,actually i find great difficulty in playing old pc games on modern pc's as someone who isn't very tech savvy? also any pc i've owned usually gets slower and slower over the years. consoles seem to hold up though for some reason?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,you completely missed my point. the trouble does not have to do with the offer of a 10 upgrade path. they can do whatever they want with that. the issue is that the op was able to buy the full game for 70 when they own the ps4 game. the price should have automatically been made 10 for op. i think it could be a legal issue because one could argue the storefront should give you the appropriate pricing.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i personally like it when old games are updated for new consoles. otherwise some games just get lost to time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"oh wow, they withheld some content so they could turn more profit. better spend 60 on the same game! do you usually defend douchebag megacorps that dont know nor care about your existence?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i cant stop anyone from making poor financial choices so dw about that. i also cant stop people from defending multibillion dollar companies who dont give af about anything but money basically. so go ahead bro buy the same game again
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"i dont know man. it feels like just hating for no good reason. the highest tier of ps subscription costs 150 a year. the ps5 digital edition costs 400. if you use it for 4 years, thats 1000 in total. this package gets you online play and a shitload of games from the ps1 era to the ps5, including some of the best console exclusives of all time some of the best games of all time imho. all that for 1000 spread across 4 years. of course, 1000 doesnt even come close to buying you a competent gaming pc, in most cases it doesnt even buy you the gpu. so hes not right at all, hes just whiny and sad."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,"i mean, nobody does. don't get me wrong, consoles are a great deal for the components they have apart from nintendo, that is a rip off, and there are other benefits to console gaming, but even when it was new, to match a ps5 you could buy a prebuild for roughly 1100. these days, you'd be looking at about 750 for an off the shelf equivelent pc. there are people who have built equivelent pc's for 500, but that involves knowing the market, where to find deals and self building, which the average user isn't going to bother with. you have to remember that pc's also offer more long term savings and are capable of a lot more overall, not to mention that if you're on a budget, you can have a perfectly good gaming experience for much less just by turning the graphics down. as for the hate of exclusives, that one's simple. it's a purely anti consumer practice that offers no benefit to the customer and forces people to either buy into their closed ecosystem of hardware and software or miss out."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"not even close, and paying for online was invented by the computer people, microsoft."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i'd pay triple the money to ensure i played online multiplayer games anywhere but pc lobbies. you could not be more wrong.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,most of those are ps4 games
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,maybe it's because they tried to recreate the magic of the first but failed and added an unnecessary 12 hours of uselessness with a character that no one cares about. i love how the only thing people say when someone else doesn't like tlou2 is just they're homophobic children! nah its just a very mediocre experience with a lot of unnecessary plot points and non paid off reviewers will say that as well.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,last of us 2 remaster is not a remake. if you use the first game as an example that would make more sense.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,if you have last of us 2 on ps4 you get it for free on ps5?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,but if you want to play the old game with better graphics on a new system. you dont have to pay for upgrade. just turn the settings up. download a restore pack. the extra content in these things is just vapid fluff for games that are already dozens of hours long.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"thats funny. because i can play halflife 2 at 4k 240 hz. its never had an hd remaster. but also. none of you idgits got a sense of humor. long story is that when a console game also comes out on pc, the pc version already can be made to look like what the console versions hd remake will look like in 2 years lol, not even remakes theyre just upscale and they use less compressed versions of already made textures. think about something like alan wake. there is no way a ps5 can make it look as good as pc and play it at as high of frame rates. much of the work is just them sliding sliders to the right. as one on pc would do. like i said, things like textures already have hires uncompressed versions, they just compressed a lowres copy for the console release. they can compress a lower res copy later. its why bethesda was so quick to release their own hd texture pack for pc, but as part of an hd upgrade for consoles almost immediately after the games initial release. however, you can save pc money and build a pc thats equivalent to a ps5 for not much more than a ps5 costs, while also gaining a very useful productivity machine. youll be able to play alan wake at ps5 fidelity. upgrade your pc and you can hd upgrade the graphics without buying the game again."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,did you get your refund? i remember like 2 weeks after launch when all the bad press was circulating about the bug ridden game and sony completely pulled the game for sale from the ps store cd project just said anyone who asks for a refund regardless of playtime or anything can have a no questions asked refund. applied to all digital and physical copies iirc

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,what are these arbitrary figures around pc? im calling bs on that. i bought my pc for roughly 1.8k in 2012 and only now am i just barely on the cusp of being denied games from the last year. a console has half that life cycle at best. oh and your ps1 era games? emulation exists. nah you are just a mark for sony. 1000 for 4 years is utter garbage value.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-23,"look, i'm not saying there's anything wrong with consoles, but just to correct a bit of misinformation, you can get a perfectly capable laptop with an nvmessd and enough computing power to run all but the most demanding games which aren't available on console anyway reasonably for 500 600. you don't need to spend 1000 to get a decent pc gaming experience. yes, consoles are a great deal and unless you know where to buy, you'll struggle to match a console in both price and performance in its launch year, but that doesn't mean you need to break the bank, and overall they can save you money due to no online service subscription, games being on average 10 cheaper, bigger and more frequent sales, epic giving away a free game every week, no need to buy games again if you upgrade to a new generation and of course modding. also games pass can be a steal of you like a few games on it, but that's not exclusive to pc. again, this isn't a pc better than console thing. it's just that this idea that getting into pc gaming has to be super expensive is often used to gatekeep pc gaming, and it's simply not true. and that doesn't mean it's for everyone, as there are benefits to a console like accessibility, exclusive games which should never be celebrated as it's a purely anti consumer practice and security."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-20,"dude whats with the attitude? if you had tlou2 on pc and this remaster was released on pc it still wouldnt be free. most people know what you are trying to say and a lot of people have both pc and ps but what youre saying does not make sense. just say its a cash grab or something and be done with it, most people would agree with you. you chose pc, great. are you on some crusade to convert people away from ps5? go get some fresh air. or go play last of us 2 on pc.oh wait its not on pc. just a few more months and im sure youll be able to play it in all its glory on your 4090 productivity machine."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,"quite a few did, it's essentially just backwards compatibility with a patch to make use of the better hardware, so not an actual ps5 version of the game. pretty common tbh, although tlou2 added haptic support as well which was pretty cool. a fair few games early on this gen offered free ps5 versions of games to people who owned ps4 versions  cyberpunk, ac valhalla, far cry 6, and horizon fw all did off the top of my head. the 10 upgrade thing started with ghost of tsushima iirc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-21,"ps4 and ps5 are basically mini pcs at this point with amd cpu and gpus. the ps5 has quite a bit of backwards compatibility with the ps4 because of it. and sony has done this type of stuff before... remember the ps2? it could play ps1 games. the ps3 could play ps1 and ps2 and at one point it was even hardware, before they moved to software emulation and eventually killed it. ps4 was where there was no longer that trend, but it has come back now they are on basically pc parts instead of custom ibm hardware and stuff... not sure why you think sony typically doesnt do this type of thing, since it really was the ps3 to ps4 era that was like a reset... the ps4 and ps4 pro systems also had the ability to have developers make extra stuff optimized for the pro to run smoother. this means that when you play some ps4 games on a ps5, the game can detect it as a pro or they may have released a patch for it to run better on the ps5. every single ps4 game i have runs on ps5 and they all run flawlessly and those with a ps4 pro update also treat the ps5 as a pro with the increased framerates."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,"the day before is a great example of wanting a refund because devs lied, they were preorders too so you cant exactly confirm anything untill anyone can actually play. and steam came to the party with that one and just started refunding everyone when they delisted it, granted they hadn't actually parted with any of the funds yet so it was easy for them to do."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,did you miss the part about the devs lied? or where i mentioned i couldn't get a game to run well? obviously i made sure my specs were sound. this industry is a nightmare of bullshit and outright scams. did anybody think cyberpunk was going to be the disaster it turned out to be at launch? were there actually any signs? or were all the trailers and demos they put out complete horseshit? these companies don't give a goddamn about actually putting out a good product. so if they pull that shit you should be able to throw the bag of trash they sold to you on a lie back in their faces.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-21,"youre so right about cyberpunk. i bought it the day it came out or the next day and i wasnt even having half the issues i saw others complaining about, but it was still enough to where i couldnt play the game on ps4 pro. you couldnt drive anywhere, the car bounced like you hit a speed bump full speed every few seconds. youd fall through the floor randomly, and there was like 3 times when the aim button or one of the important buttons would just straight up quit working and youd have to reload. it also crashed like once every 30min3 hours. there was more, but anyway i didnt play it for about a year after i bought it. i tried once after the second patch but it was still bad then so i waited. when i finally came back to it, it was a pretty good game. i was so hyped for it to come out though and it was such a disappointment. idk that id say the devs lied about cyberpunk, but they definitely hid some truth, and it was a really big let down at launch. it was definitely shady."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,good for you. then what are you complaining about? you ever buy bluray versions of old dvds? do you still have all your old media and never got something thats been digitally remastered? same concept. this is just 10 content drop and current gen features for a previous gen game. whats the issue again?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,huh? i have zero problem with someone saying they didnt like the game. but saying it was poorly received isnt an opinion and is just objectively wrong by all reasonable metrics.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,and you have to realize that a ton of games did. btw what does that have to do with tlou? i bet a good chunk of those games were released after ps5 launched this released before. you want people to crunch even more to provide an update that wasnt needed at launch? and this is what? 3 and a half years after launch?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-18,i think it had more to do with the game being released 3 times in less than 10 years rather than the backlash from part 2.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-19,you said it is the bare minimum. you're pretending like this is not an abnormal thing to do. people are happy that sony is doing what should be done. because doing what should be done is uncommon nowadays.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,great work! where is heroes of might and magic 3? should be in the top 10!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"good work and an interesting list. the big problem with it is the sourcing. during the period from 1989 to 2000, there were dozens of pc game magazines that comprehensively reviewed computer games. they were far more indepth and they were contemporaneous to the games being released, not a list put together after years of hindsight. consequently, the modern list providers are going back thirty or more years, looking at hindsight memory and sales. games that definitely should be on this list are left out largely because their genres didn't grow into industry leaders, even though sports and flight sims, and puzzle games, were much, much bigger back then. games i would've expected based on their rep at the time would've included earl weaver baseball from circa 198687 wolfenstein 3d from 1993 the secret of monkey island from 1991 ish falcon 3.0 from 1990 or thereabouts wing commander from 1993, fifa international soccer from 1994 descent freepspace from 1998ish. that's just off the top of my head. but all of those were considered genredefining at one point, and certainly were among the best reviewed games ever. reviewing also used to be much tougher. modern games that get an 80 would often have been a 50 or a 60 in equivalents of the time. so operating from hindsight sort of robs this of accuracy, to me. but it's a good list, nonetheless."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"maybe i missed it but it's weird not seeing heroes of might and magic iii anywhere, as this is still a cult game..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"awesome data! 1 question could you explain this part more? also gave a certain amount of extra points for simply being on the listotherwise games that ranked low would get basically no advantage over games that didn't rank at all. the amount differed based on whether the list was a top 50, top 100, top 200, and so on. making it onto more exclusive lists obviously granted more points. 1 maybe more of a comment than a question sorry did you control for date of release? as you've written it, any game released later than 2018 is disadvantaged by being excluded from evefifry previous list. what i mean is, hades or elden ring are excluded from lists before 2020 or 2022, respectively. i can see the justification here being that newer games should be disadvantaged in a best games of all time list to counteract the cultofthenew aspect, but i'd be intersted in how that was actually approached  dealt with, if at all. and finally, 2 comments  it's interesting that there aren't any vr games. beat saber is the biggest one that comes to mind. sports games in general are really underrepresented, i don't know if that's related.  pole position 1983 got robbed."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"is it just me or is this list just a tiny bit biased against pc games? world of warcraft completely redefined gaming, was the most popular game in the world for years, and isn't even in the top 30. same story for doom. and baldur's gate didn't even make the top100. and i could go on for a while. to be clear, not blaming op for that. they are just aggregating data. and it's a very interesting post. just speaking out about such lists in general."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i saw 1 and immediately stopped looking at the list. oot at 1 means we can close up shop and go home.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"interesting no skyrim, im not complaining i think the game is boring and overrated but interesting none the less. also noticed diablo 2, which i love but no d3 or d4. i also approve."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,here's my personal top 10 of all the games i've ever played in my 28 years of life 1. the mass effect trilogy if only one game then mass effect 2 2. fallout new vegas 3. the witcher 3 4. the last of us 5. baldur's gate 3 6. bloodborne 7. half life 2 8. left 4 dead 2 9. star wars battlefront 2 2005 10. elden ring as you can clearly tell i am not a nintendo or jrpg fan.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,not sure a gta after the ps2 would make my list.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"you say the bestselling game on this list is minecraft, but it's actually tetris."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,i downvoted becouse of no final fantasy tactics
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i feel less bad returning elden ring seeing it fall that far down the list. edit it not only wasn't compatible with the native resolution of my highend gaming monitor, but it also wasn't compatible with my highend soundcard. i could play it on my tv instead if i wanted... but fuckkkkk that. get your shit together fromsoftware"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"first of all kudos, superb job. second of all wtf... how is alien isolation best of 2014?!oo it competes with destiny, mario kart 8, dark souls ii, hearthstone, bayonetta 2, titanfall and it wins? with metascore average of 7883 across all platforms? i need to look into the data because something's off. edit ok, i am now even more interested in the raw data and calculations that were done by op. i've done some at a glance of 2014 and there's no way that alien isolation is higher than dark souls 2. we're talking 78 on metacritic vs 92. out of half a dozen publications that i've reviewed, ds2 is higher by 1015 in scores. what am i missing? edit2 alien isolation is not even listed on almost half of the lists that op mentioned that they used. it leads me to believe that their calculation method is not weighted i.e. being on 1 out 12 lists with high score, skewes the outcome. it would explain why it's so high. edit3 empire, slant, popular mechanics, gq, usa today? not sure if i'd count them as reasonable resources for best games of all time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,cod 4 should not be higher than halo 3
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"it's a terrible list imo d played some of them and 1. no cyberpunk 2077, which is my favorite game of all time 2. i didn't like zelda games 3. gta v is not even in my top 10 4. i don't like tetris"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,don't like that list at all.... how did you place prince of persia only on 188? are you joking? and where is here original prince persia game? it was a true masterpiece.... and you even didn't care to put this legendary classic game to this list  while some quite mediocre games like nier automata you put in top 100...are you serious?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"this list sucks no maplestory, world of warcraft, starcraft, diablo, or runescape tell me your a console gamer without telling me your a console gamer also counterstrike? really?"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,this is great
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,correction the most overrated list as people follow whatever marketers spew at them  peerinternet pressure to like the game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i've said it before, two things.... 1the modern game industry is shit. x200b 2 and the 90s and 2000s were the absolute peak of gaming, making up a tad bit over 60 percent of the greatest games off all time x200b and a lot of the 2010 games, were early 2010 games to boot lol. x200b cut and dry. that is it."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,elden ring is much better than both zelda. oot was ground breaking but it's not that good. even majors mask is much better
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,number of games with explicitly stated ingame lgbt protagonist what does lg bluetooth has to do with any of this?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,breath of the wild was so shit. why does everyone like that game so much? its obviously a me issue but christ is it over rated. its like 40 something spots ahead of starcraft?!?!? cmon man.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"lol. funny times im living in. seems to be very important now to mention if theres female or lbgt protagonist, for whatever pathetic reason. also those childish zelda games on rank 1 and 2, just lol. i played this so called masterpiece botw and at best its a cute adventurous kiddo game, a childfriendly peek into the openworld genre, but there were far better openworld games. and gta5 on rank 3, a game that encourages criminality and ruthless sociopathy. yet i dont wonder, humanity at its best."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,unpopular opinion but legend of zelda is absolute weibo boring game that doesnt deserve how popular it is. additionally i do not believe nintendo are selling that many games.. more than pc games. same counts for nintendo and all the mario games
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"so, out of the 200, i've only played 22 properly, tried a couple more for a few minutes, and 13 i've never even heard of and that's not counting a multitude of games within franchises i know of but wouldn't have been able to identify the specific game. some might say i have a lot of catching up to do, but i'm honestly fine with it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,wow. amazing work. curious as to how you chose the games that deserve a shout out but didnt make the list? are these just your personal favorites? did you use some other metric?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i'm honestly surprised elden ring is only 65th considering how much praise and adoration it garnered.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"cool post! as these lists are up to five years old, does it not skew towards older games as newer games will not have been released at the time a significant portion of the lists were made? if you used only lists made in 2023 for example, i wonder if something like elden ring would move up in the rankings"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,it sucks that even with all that effort and work. the fact that resident evil 4 is on the list higher than sm64 and metal gear solid is just factually wrong. re4 is nowhere near on the same tier but on your list it actually sits above them? no point reading the rest of the list when the top 10 is wrong lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,baldurs gate 3 will join the top 5. breath of the wild really is not as good as the other games that high in the ranks.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,gtav and tlou are good games but have no right to those places
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,blood absolutely deserves to be in top of all time lists. i didn't play it when it came out but went on a binge playing old games and it was one of the clear standouts alongside morrowind. i've played through it three times and the fanmade death wish campaign and it's just so damn fun.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"outer wilds being in top 100 makes me so happy, it's not as well known as most of the games on this list so it just shows how good it is also terraria deserves that 1 spot"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i think these lists are pretty pointless usually so much about them is based on nostalgia and the time in which the games were released mario64 and mario bros 3 arent even close to being the best 3d2d mario games yet they are at the top

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,nice post! bloodbourne beating out dark souls and elden ring is certainty a surprise result for me.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"very cool post. i'm honestly surprised not to see total war in there at all, not even the heavy hitters like rome 1, medieval ii, shogun 2, warhammer. in fact strategy seems to be rather underrepresented generally, probably due to being largely pc only. some other omissions which surprise me  no hitman, no elite, no homeworld, no wolfenstein. morrowind not being on there when oblivion is is objectively mad, but makes sense given how oblivion benefited from solid console presence. tomb raider is shockingly low on the list given how massive it was. i'm surprised that bioshock is higher than halo. one other observation  an awful lot of massive franchises are woefully represented  almost all sports and racing games, but also major series like call of duty, medal of honor, battlefield. goes to show that people don't necessarily rate games they play the most of as being their highest quality gaming experiences."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,wheres bully?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,for me the biggest surprise is resident evil4. the game is amazing but 6th best of all time with so many games that created or defined genres bellow it? could it be due to the context of the year it released? or i'm just not seeing how good that game is?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"there's a bias in your data against games released after some of the polls were released, so only games 5 years old have the highest ranking potential. there's also recency bias though which maybe cancels it out probably not though."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"unless i missed it, command and conquer missed the list which is shocking. wasn't expecting top 10 but not even in 200?! also counter strike missing is crazy."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"overall a decent list. but a game like starfox 64 being there instead of warcraft 3 is a bit funny. wc3 is one of the best games of all time. amazing campaign, amazing online competetive multiplayer, amazing as an esport, amazing custom games with tower defenses, footman frenzy and of course dota. basically contained one of the best games in the world, that spawned a genre in itself."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i find nostalgia makes these lists useless. like objectively i can't really support the idea that tetris is a best game of all time, like sure i get how important and influential the game was for the industry at the time, but i don't think that makes it among the best. something can be influential and groundbreaking, but still be replaced by objectively better games they inspired."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"glad to see your shout outs to zork and terraria. most of this seems to fit my perception of what people have enjoyed, though i'm a little surprised hollow knight isn't in the top 20 or so, and shocked it's as low as 101. seeing shadow of the colossus up there. damn i wish the ps4 remaster and the ico remaster from the ps3, and the last guardian were available on pc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i think what this shows is that to get a goty or similar has more to do with being easy for reviewers to play, aka narratively driven or relatively easy games as a whole. the list also heavily favour rpgs and fps games, we only have a handful of strategy games, a lot of which are civilization."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i think it mostly works, with a few notable exceptions. starcraft should probably be much higher, its a better game overall than say any gta entry by far. halo 2 should be way above dishonored 2 best mp halo hands down. fallout 3 is above portal and kotor. bg2, perhaps the best crpg of all time, should be smack dab next to chrono trigger. dos 2, oblivion way above that is silly. even da o righty above it is. deus ex maybe should be top 20 because it transcends just about every other game story by teaching you about how the real world works creeping centralization of power and authoritarianism. also no tribes 2"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"y'all need to stop trying to treat the list as a presentation of objective truth. the games are ranked as they are because the aggregated opinions of the reviewers and players work out that way. arguing about what is correct is pointless because everyone's enjoyment of a game is massively impacted by their own experiences and when in their life they play it. like 70 of the people you ask will tell you their favorite game was something they played as a kid. that's not because game develepment was objectively better then, they were just at a point in their life when it made a bigger impact."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,what i find interesting about this list is how it shows the goodness of a game is in part also its release date. eg. sim city probably doesnt make the list if it was released in 2020. so you could apply a further score mechanic that biases towards newer games and find the top ten games that anyone playing today should seriously consider playing. and of course on that list should be titanfall2

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"my issue with a lot of top game lists is it takes into account personal preference seemingly a lot more than game design or timeliness. oot being 1 is a hallmark of this tbh, that game does not hold as someone who didn't grow up with it. sm64 is a much better game to start playing now than ocarina is by far. even as a big fan of ffvii as i am, i probably would not put it in my top 25 best games of all time. it would be number one on my favorite games of all time or high on impactful games of all time up there with oot."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"the continual circlejerk around breath of the fucking wild is just completely beyond me. it is an utterly mediocre game at the absolute best. it does nothing new. it's fairly free of bugs is about the nicest thing i can say about it. the world is a massive empty field of nothingness. the physics simulation is incredibly limited compared to things like gmod we had 20 god damn years ago, the narrative is about as basic and poorly done as a narrative can be. can't even give it points for voice acting. they made a vanilla as fuck, empty, lifeless, collectathon game filled with 100 repetitive, identically themed dungeon puzzles that are simple enough for any 3rd grader to solve with little effort, and just the flatout most absurd weapon damage system i've ever encountered... and motherfuckers are insisting it's amongst the greatest games of all time. if that game had released as a new ip instead of a zelda sequel it wouldn't even have been in the top 20 games of the year it released, let alone of all time."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,a lot of great stuff on here. i'm in agreement with a lot of these games but i'm just glad that secret of monkey island is even on the list. it's foundational to the pc adventure game genre. and really funny to boot.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"this might be an unpopular opinion but i dont think the last of us 1 should be that high. on the one hand it is a highly influential title for narrative driven games. but it really only has the story going for it, the gameplay gets very boring and repetitive. i ended up enjoying tlou2 far more due to the gameplay i also really like the story of the 2nd one. there was a just a lot more to the encounters and freedom in how you approach them as well as the tools available. i would not replay tlou1, its kind of a slog to play through outside of the characters and narrative. i think it did a lot for the industry and it does tell a good story, but it is the awkward stepping stone, that has a lot of flaws that are especially noticeable after 10 years. i have similar feelings to gtav as well, have you tried replaying that game? it has hours of truly awful boring missions"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"so many great games not being on the list is mental. wow defined a genre and is relatively low. thousands of hours. games like bf3, mw2, runescape, hell even the fifa games are massive. aoe 2 being on it warms my heart. phenomenal work though, thanks."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"interesting post. however, these types of list always favor the older games. as time goes by, newer games will start facing more competition due to the need to compete with sheer quantity of games being released in addition to competing with the already established leader, i.e. ocarina of time. imho, elden ring should be far higher up the list and baldur's gate 3 is easily the best game of all time. these kinds of list also favor the english speaking world, hence why you can see countries like the canadaausuk dominating the lists while in reality i feel eastern and central europe make games that are favorably comparable to those countries. also japanese dominance is something noteworthy. they are one of the least english speaking countries in the world, yet their performance is superlative. i'd imagine if more of these greatest lists came from asian countries, the gap would be even greater. there is some truth in the saying that japanese games are better."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,bloodborne above rdr2 and god of war 2018 on average boggles my mind. not that it's a bad game but just wild that neither beat a souls like on a lot of people's lists.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"awesome work, op! after looking through the final 200 my main comment is that as a 90s kid the lack of sega is a wee bit heartbreaking for me  i think i counted 4 games developed by them and a couple more published but not developed by them, like persona 5 and alien isolation. i just feel like so many of their games helped pushed things forward so it's a bit of a shame they seem to be kind of forgotten nowadays. i also think it ties in with what another commenter above was saying about arcade games being underrepresented."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,some of those game not being on the list is criminal. also gtav on third place is really strange. that game is so repetive and boring.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"an interesting caveat with these lists is how exclusives and platform variations play into these lists. if platform has very important exclusives these will end up higher on the overall lists and more so if the platform has less choice  either games overall or in that genre  compared to competitors. maybe a flamebait example but would legends of zeldas be that high up in these lists if on one side the games themselves were multiplatform and on the other side, if the platform had more games? this is particularly interesting when comparing platforms that have many significant exclusives to pc but also in a less significant way across consoles and generations. metacritic top of al time lists are a good place to see that in action  check the multiplatform games starting maybe with gta or rdr2in most cases less targeted platforms get lower score for the same game and pc id usually lower than that. console differences vary by a lot but same game on pc pretty much universally gets lower score. with few examples of contrary  disco elysium is a notable one, i think. this is not to infer any of the games in the lists are bad, they are all extremely incredible. zeldas i used as an example are absolutely excellent."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"the last of us story and storytelling is a solid 10 out of 10, it's so gripping. the gameplay is more like 710, it's descent, but there is so many annoyances, like enemies spotting you through a wall, or shooting you when a micrometer of your head is visible in a window. also movement is sometimes janky, both from you and the ai. the ai is wobbling between clever and very stupid at times too. i've still played it through several times, though i'd never punish myself with the higher difficulties, the scrounging gets really old as you play, even on first play through, after several you begin rembering where stuff is, but it feels annoying to have to find all the trash to craft stuff."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,im so confused. arent i supposed to be telling op what his top 25 games says about him? what is this!?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,do they want us to discuss what the list says about them or something else? it's been so long i've forgotten what to do.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i really hate how badly arcade games get ignored on these lists. so many of the best and most influential games from the first half of gaming history were arcade titles. oh well!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,it just brought a smile to my face to see it. many great memories.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"it should be top 20 tbh, incredibly unique and groundbreaking game. truly nothing else like it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,really hoping restitched does a good job of bringing that style of game to the modern era
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"yep, too bad the studio doesnt want anymore lbp anymore"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"other than street fighter ii and cod modern warfare, every game above wow on this list appears to be focused on the single player experience. they may feature multiplayer, but they have very strong single player. maybe that's why wow is only 31? i agree it's genre defining and has a huge player base."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"there are a lot of games that could be considered the goat of their genre that are way down on the list. from blizzard alone diablo 2  starcraft are both down around the 50 mark despite beng arguably the most culturally influential releases for both genres. rts in general is hugely snubbed with aoe2 down at like 120 and warcraft 3 not even on the list, which is insane considering the impact it had on the whole gaming landscape i get that custom games are hard to include on these kinds of lists, but how does starcraft 2 make a list like this but not wc3?. these genres just haven't been that relevant for the last 10 or more years so even the influential titles are thought of much later, especially since this is only looking at lists from the last 5 years."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"san andreas is probably the best gta for its time. it deserves to be up higher. i feel that gtav is very good, but benefits from recency bias."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"also, world of warcraft. defined a genre for almost 20 years. but always seems to get shafted on lists like this. it's the typical live long enough to become the villain type of thing, i think. they had an extremely good track record  but they also had enough time to make a huge load of mistakes. and that obviously shifts the perspective on the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"thata because wow isn't a game, it's a lifestyle"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"gta 5 being so high in general seems really weird to me. gta 3 and gta san andreas both seem to be more cultural standouts, not sure what makes gta 5 so worthy that its listed this high on so many rankings?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"my first thought too, obviously i'm biased but the fact that every game in the same genre for the last 2 decades has had the goal to be the wow killer and failed really says something."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"for other series differentials, i was shocked to see such a big difference between fo3 and fonv. i think if you flipped their relative spots no one would really bat an eye. fo3 was better received on release but nv has aged a lot better in the eyes of fans"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,in what fucking universe is earning 31 out of 200 spots getting shafted? what a daft take.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"youre misinterpreting the data. lists like these just take an average of how people feel about a game, and its usually a recent feeling shortly after these games come out. stuff like wow defining a genre for 20 yearstrue wouldnt be included in these numbers, and the numbers reflect the fact that a lot of people simply dont enjoy that genre of games at all. if you polled 1 million gamers today asked them to select games from a list that were extremely influential, and wow was on that list, im sure it would rank very high. basically what im saying is that youre right, but the list is also right. its like, by definition right since its simply averaging out ratings. it cant however tell you the things youre talking aboutinfluence."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,man big ups on that warcraft comment fr so true and its still the standard pretty much
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"csgo isn't even on the list and starcraft ii isn't in the top 100. it's interesting to me that some of the most iconic games ever made are just completely absent, but the bias is pretty clear competitive rtsfps are not what these reviewers focus on."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"the fact that wow isn't a top 5 game on every list is laughable. it was a cultural phenomenon. it's still a good game 19 years later. it still dominates an entire genre. it is, in my opinion, the single greatest game ever made. it's timeless."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"the fundamental issue with lists like this and by no means is this the fault of op since they just aggregated other lists is that they seem to mix up the concepts of best game, and most influential game and throw them into one list. if this is a list of best games, tetris doesn't deserve to be anywhere near the top like it currently is. tetris can be an enjoyable way to pass time, but it's hard to argue that it's better than most of the 195 other games on the list... if this was an influential game list, then it absolutely deserves to be there. but if this is an influential game list gta5 as you said doesn't belong this high up when it is effectively just a derivative of all the other 3d gta games, with the addition of some cover shooter and weapon wheel mechanics from other games that did it first. perhaps you could argue that the multiplayer influenced a decade of horrible microtransactions and live service games... but i think usually these lists look for a positive influence..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,the fact that gtav is even in the top 20 is all i need to know about the quality of this ranking system.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"gta games have always been a big deal. gta3 changed video games, and pregtav, san andreas was nearly universally considered the best game in the franchise. had to be there, i guess."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,there's not a big number of pconly games on the list.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i think the issue with a game like wow or fortnite is the question of is the game actually good, or is it the community i.e playing it with friends because its so popular everyone plays it. ive played wow since vanilla, easily 100x more time put into it than any other game, but it would never crack my top 10 because it isnt the game itself thats good."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,its amusing to me because for me personally v is far and away the worst gta main game of the 3d era.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i will never understand why gta v is so highly praised. the campaign was incredibly boring, and the online mode is pay to win. it was technically impressive at the time, but the actual missions were largely forgettable and uninteresting outside of the handful of heists."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"gta v is at the 3 spot but the next gta is down at 60. if gta v was never made, would san andreas still be down there? the same happens with other franchises, imo. ffvi is quite down the list. ffix and ffx aged better than ffvii, and are further down. fft is even better and probably the best ff, but it gets shafted or forgotten frequently because it is not part of the main games so it gets even lower."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"to be fair, despite defining a genre it's bee riddled with questionable design choices that was only saved by the sheer number of players invested in the game. any new mmo making those same mistakes would not be nearly as big. wows current success would not likely be as intense if released today whereas all the other games on this list are static and stand the test of time"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"wow suffers from the same syndrome league of legends or path of exile do the fact that a gameplay loop is so addicting people are constantly playing like it's heroin doesn't necessarily mean the game is great, just that it scratches a certain itch nothing else can. in fact, with such rabid fanbases devoting so much time to the game, just one bad patch can ruin your perception of the entire experience and throw the game out of any top ten lists you could make. hell, i've played more than 15k lol matches and i wouldn't include it in my top 20 games of all time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"recency bias has to be one of the reason wow isn't there. it was a genre defining game, a global phenomenon referenced on countless occasions in many spheres of life. yet the game's glory is tarnished by the last few debacles from blizzard."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"maybe, but also gta s.a. might not be remembered nearly as much if gta v wasn't keeping gta so relevant. for wow, i think it's acknowledged that it's a very different type of game. it's closer to a social media platformsecond life esque object than a game, and i think a lot of people who like wow can acknowledge that it's a really different type of object. wow also has the issue that it's perpetually difficult to play in the form it's being recommended in. oot just as an example is the same game it was on release, and it's arguably better as its puzzle style feels more relatively unique and its themes of nostalgia resonate much more now that it looks like a fossil. anyone who recommends wow is recommending a game that'll be qualitatively different very soon after the recommendation."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i think gta v is a unique beast in itself, gta online is one of the games most of my friends and other kids would go play through middle and high school. i dont see san andreas being that."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"yeah that's why i hate lists like this, they are always bad. for me a greatest game of all time list should rank everything purely on individual merit, i do not care about it's iconic or it's legacy or what is done for gaming etc i understand tetris and pacman did a lot for gaming at the time and also at the time they were considered amazing but with the thousands of releases since they should not be anywhere near the top 500 let alone top 10. you're telling me games like skyrim, binding of isaac and slay the spire aren't as good as the original tetris? that's insane and hurts the integrity of the whole list imo. and i know this post is a compilation or other lists and all that but it's just the issue with these lists in general"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i think that's really simple. wow wasn't that great. and it definitely isn't great now. wow exploded because of, essentially, technical and environmental reasons. the game was just good enough to enable said explosion. saying wow got shafted is like saying beat saber got shafted. they are mount rushmore games in terms of importance to the industry and social climate of gaming, but they didn't get there because they were singularly great. they spearheaded movements of moments in time in the industry. gta v or minecraft or halo show what happens when a game is that, and also great isolated. gta v has the great single player, and online for the impact on gaming culture. halo is mostly both. minecraft does both at once. because if you get down to it, most people who would say they loved wow actually loved the environment it created or the idea of wow. obviously there are people who just actually straight love wow, but they're much much more of a minority in comparison to the split for games like minecraft. all that meaning wow's impact ran well ahead of both how people reacted to and remember the game itself, and ahead of critique's conclusions."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,agreed on wow. should be a top 10 game on any list for any number of reasons.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"these lists are heavy on the singleplayer bias. they should rename it to best singleplayer games of all time. multiplayer games, especially competitive multiplayer games, will always be ranked low on lists like these. you know the stereotype about game journalists. haha."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"also, world of warcraft. defined a genre for almost 20 years. but always seems to get shafted on lists like this. it defined the genre that's maximally inaccessible. eve online is, i think, the best game i've ever played, but it's so damn inaccessible it can't possibly make a list like this. i can't play as an adult despite it being my favourite game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"also, world of warcraft. defined a genre for almost 20 years. but always seems to get shafted on lists like this. indeed. also, starcraft became a legit sport in some countries still low. mortal kombat spawned 10 great games, plus movies, series, comics and whatnot not even in the top 10 of franchisings but somehow half life and portal with only 2 games are there. i love the work done here, still something seems a little off."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"funnily enough pokemon is the opposite, rb almost always top lists even though they are the worst games in the series, just because they kicked it off"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i can't believe gta6 didn't make the list
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"the fact wow isn't on this list just shows most people don't count mmos in these lists, they seems to only rank single player experiences."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"wow didnt just define the genre, wow is basically the only mmo that has ever actually mattered. every few years a wow killer comes out and is crippled within 6 months even if you hate it, indisputably the most influential game ever made. if youve played pc games youve probably played a wow expansion"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,wow is 31
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i failed physics in 4th year because of san andreas. damn.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,to be honest the list doesnt really mean much and there are genres that just get excluded such as mmos or crpgs . video game review is a different thing to other media so stuff like nostalgia gets an extra boost and my point is super mario bros 3 isnt the 12th best game of all time . lists like this would take years of playing video game consistently to get a lost that isnt riddled with bias and whats populariconic so take it with alot of salt .
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"im not sure about wow. i think its getting a fair shake. it wasnt the most innovative game, following the forumla of everquest and ultimata online. if you want to call a game genre defining i think uo takes it for mmorpgs. i lost a lot of years to wow, but i wouldnt say it was the best. if it hadnt had the blizzard name and existing ip to push it, im not sure it would have done as well. just my .02"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"gta v being so popular never makes any sense to me, can someone explain? is the online mode that good? i played the single player pretty extensively and it was alright. nothing incredible and the story got a little disjointed at times because it was possible to do missions out of order for some reason. i only played multiplayer a couple times, maybe 2 hours max, and every time i would get killed by someone cheating over and over. i just don't get what's so great about it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i think yes about gta. great game. top 60 is huge
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i mean this is just popular games that the masses like that's all it is it's not a list of the best games it's a list of the most popular and mainstream games. yes i get it what other metric do we have to measure something's quality then by how well it sells i've heard this argument a million times i still don't buy it all you have to do is look at the top selling musical artists of every year and you can clearly see that it's not about quality.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,wow players hate the game almost as much as they hate themselves for continuing to play it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,san andreas is better in every way except graphics. should be waaaaaay higher.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i was looking for wow myself, and also kind of surprised to see blizzard not in the dev list. sure they are a shell of their former selves, but still a titan in the industry none the less."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"also, world of warcraft. defined a genre for almost 20 years. i think games like wow which are drammatically different based on versionpatchexpansioncommunity always suck there."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"looking at the comments this might be an unpopular opinion, but i don't think wow did anything novel or genre defining. they definitely hit that mmo formula perfectly to capture player interest more than any other mmo, but i can't think of anything they did that wasn't done already before in one form or another across other mmo games. maybe no one mmo game had quite the mix and set of features wow had, but they were still tweaks of already existing gameplay elements that you could find in other games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i quit playing wow about 10 years ago, and i still somehow have over 10,000 hours played in it. i still get the itch to fire it up from time to time. don't feel that for any other game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"lists like these are better read as 200 most popular games of all time, rather than best. wow gets shafted because it's a pc exclusive with a high barrier of entry, ergo less popular among the general public. that's why over 70 of the list had a home console release."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,zelda always seems so over represented too.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,that's how it is for dota as well. way further down.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,open world games always have vast recency bias. hence why botw and gtav are so high up.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"sa should be higher but i can see why it isnt. certain parts of it have aged like shit. some of the controls like shooting suck and to be honest always sucked even back then but nobody cared because the rest of the game was insane. it is cool to go back and play it and see how much of its style, the loading screens, ui, writing etc still holds up today, just feels like im playing v in a shittier resolution on a small ass tv sometimes."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,it definitely is a weird sorting. resident evil 4 is only 6 because of the absolute bombshell it dropped when it first released and has nothing to do with how good it is now. yet wow sits at 31 even though its considered the best and is the most successful mmo of all time and held that title undeniably for about 67 years straight.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"is wow good, or just addictive?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"that's because lists like this don't matter. i've never owned a nintendo console, but i absolutely don't feel like i'm missing out on the best games of all time because i'm much more content with not owning nintendo products and getting my rpg fix from other games which are at least as good, but don't have a rabid fanbase of 11 year old trolls."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"also, world of warcraft. defined a genre for almost 20 years. but always seems to get shafted on lists like this. there's no denying that wow had one of the biggest impacts in the gaming industry. i think the reason why it isn't a 10best game is that it's too difficult to rate based on the total body of work. some expansions were bangers while others missed the mark. if individual expansions were included on this list, you'd probably see vanilla, tbc and wrath all inside the top 30, possibly inside the top 20."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,elden ring 65
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"world of warcraft has its players, its players will either always keep coming back to it in phases or will just play it all the time. there are too many people who have never played and will never play it for it to be where it should be on these lists."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,amen. this list is great but wow is the best game ever made so far. i havent played it for 45 years but the memories in that game outshine any other memories where i have with a mouse in my hand.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i'll put it like this is wow my favorite vanilla game ? one of them sure, i'm a oot fan so that's 1. do i think vanilla wow is the best game ever developed? yes, yes i do."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,runescape  wow
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"if you asked this same list 10 years ago, wow would have gotten first place no doubts. defined not just a genre but the entire mmo market and beyond. everyone wanted to be like wow, everyone wanted the money wow was making and everyone was playing wow. not only one of the biggest franchises ever made, but also responsible for modern blizzard as a whole."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"it's very important to acknowledge how these lists are made, what people's biases are etc. for example, many have pointed out how this list is absolutely dominated by single player games or games that mainly focus on it. this is understandable as with the notable exception of minecraft and a few other titles these games usually last the player between 20100 hours, most around 4060, and those hours are great. but looking at games like world of warcraft, league of legends, fortnite, destiny 2, etc. these are games that people often spend thousands of hours in. that has to count for something, right? in that time people often develop a... unique relationship with said game. there is the common saying that nobody hates game x more than x players. and still they play it day in and day out. these games are huge achievements and can provide good experiences a lot longer than any story game. but the first 60 hours you spend with a game like rdr2 are still incredible and unforgettable experiences, which is what these lists are biased towards. oh, and also nostalgia, that's a big one."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-12-01,i just cant believe 4 didnt make it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-10,i think mmos have to be excluded and categorized on their own

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"12100 and couple of those only few hours. made me realise how i have not played that many games, i just play same games long time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,125 here. didn't include ones i only played a few minutes. maybe 130 if i did. played everything in top 20 except last of us played a few minutes only.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"recent bias in action. certainly a product of reviews still being in traditional media and magazines at the time. no one is going back on metacritic to review games they played 20 years ago. warcraft 3 spawned an entire genre of mobas in its wake and underpinned the most successful mmo of all time. all while being super popular and revolutionary in its own right. features we take for granted today like automatic match making, ranked play, modding communities, etc. took giant leaps forward in that title. it is easily one of the top 10 if not top 5 most influential titles of all time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i played multiple hundreds of games in my life, warcraft 3 is still 1. it's just objectively such a fucking good game, from the campaign, to the sound design, music, atmosphere, story, competitive potential, responsiveness, character design, innovativity relative to its time, the custom games, replayability, the legacy it left, how well it holds up today. i'm sorry, but if a top 200 list doesn't include it, i can't take that list seriously. in no fucking universe 200 games are better than war3."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"league of legends and dota are on the list, both were spawned off warcraft 3. the spirit of w3 lives on."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"the big issue with judging warcraft 3, and by extension the frozen throne, is that most people didn't actually care about the game itself. warcraft 3 was seen by many as a game that existed solely for custom games. dota alone sold countless copies of warcraft 3, and dota had a much bigger presence in warcraft 3 than legitimate games of warcraft 3 did."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"because it's a critic bias. the best game of the year tends to be a contest on who made the best storyrpg console game. other genres tend to get completely overlooked. i wouldn't worry too much about it though, because it's honestly harder to rank games that tend to be somewhat more niche, or that have more cultural impact down the line. it's way easier to critique a game based on its story than it's gameplay."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"how many rts games are on the list? i saw aoeii, but for the most part it's not a very popular genre."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,this omission makes the entire list worthless
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,i'm more surprised overwatch is on the list even though it doesn't exist.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"hardly anyone played it, comparatively. there really weren't that many people playing on pc back then, just like now, as a percentage of the whole. i remember when i first played warcraft 2 on my friend's dad's pc. i got into pc gaming when my family first got a pc in maybe 1997ish. so lucky there, i got to play half life, homeworld, fallout 1 and 2, bg 1 and 2, warcraft, total annihilation, all when they were new. i used to love pc gamer magazine, and i remember that for years and years, the original half life was considered to be the best game out there. it was always 1. but what i remember more is that medal of honor took the top spot and stayed there for a really long time. i'm surprised it isn't in here at all, but it really isn't talked about now, at all. it's been forgotten, didn't age well and the franchise was beaten to death. same goes for deus ex invisible war was a disaster. talked about and talked about for years in pc spacespublications, but odds are most people playing games now wouldn't know it if they saw it barring the more recent additions. a lot of people maybe don't remember, but the expansions for warcraft 3 contained some eerily familiar twists on the rts system to make it play like an rpg, and it pretty much played like a precursor to wow. the wc3 mod scene spawned the concept of tower defense which was absolutely huge for a while, and the pvpve concept that became dota and all the other dotaalikes. same as arma pvpve mods  battle royale  pubgwarzone, dayz, etc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,i loved warcraft 2 and tides expansion. also diablo 1 was fire when it came out.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,its probably because fallout 3 mostly worked at launch so its easier to review higher. fallout new vegas was a disaster at launch.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"everyone says nv is better, and i don't doubt that, but i could never get into it as much as 3. i tried twice, about 10 years apart, and didn't get far. fallout 3 on the other hand, i played that so much that it largely contributed to two red ringed xboxes. i also played it within the last few years, and got all the way through all dlcs and got most achievements again."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"new vegas grew in popularity over time. pretty much everyone i knew didnt like it much when it came out, including me. but, a couple of years later i picked it up and tried again and fell in love and is now one of my favorites ever. i think fallout 3 is very bethesda, immediately addicting and awesome and super fun world to just be in. new vegas is one that takes time to get into but i think is so much more rewarding once you do."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i agree with the placement but also agree that you would not have thought it would be that way round considering comments on many forums.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"fallout 3 was honestly a much more memorable experience for me. i remember most of the possible companions in fo3 and several notable npc's, the most memorable thing i remember about fonv was the start, the ranger base i spoke to three npc's using the same voice actor within two minutes of each other and then the ending i got. people love new vegas because it was obsidian returning to the franchise to fix bethesda's shortcomings. it fell flat for me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"perfect dark was better than goldeneye in all areas, yet goldeneye is top 4p and perfect dark isnt listed. perfect dark added the ability to play against bots which i thought was huge at the time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i, like most, agree nv is far superior but its not too difficult to see why many rank 3 higher. the bugs and lack of polish in nv made it so much harder to enjoy. yeah 3 was still a bethesda game with all its warts but at least it functions. even to this day, i reinstall nv sometimes with a bunch of stability mods and it still crashes every 2 seconds."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"at the time, fallout 3 was insane. fallout nv came late in the console lifespan, was seen as dlc by some, was a buggy mess at launch, and to the laymen wasnt wow enough after fallout 3. it also didnt have the same marketing and hype around it. all that said nv is a way better game than 3 without a doubt in my mind"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"3 sold way, way more and was a flagship title for a new generation of consoles. nv is basically a great expansion for 3. its better for sure but was built so heavily on fo3 that it pales in comparison"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"new vegas may be be the better game, but its still fundamentally a derivative sequel to fallout 3, which meant that it was never in a position to be as disruptive to the industry as fo3. its harder to appreciate now that open world actionrpgs are so ubiquitous that the success of a traditional crpg like baldur's gate iii is considered newsworthy, but there was a time when the shift from traditional rpg combat as poorly defined as that is to action combat was deeply controversial. some of it comes down to timing, but between the weirdass vats system tricking rpg players into playing an fps and the physicsbased gore vanity cam tricking dudebros into playing an rpg, fallout 3 is arguably the game most responsible for the industry shifting towards arpgs and away from traditional rpgs."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"not me, i thought 3 was way better but i agree it seems to be an unpopular opinion these days. my reason is that 3 has a more emotional and cohesive story where as new vegas has a really strong opening and then it seems like the main story quickly unravels into a bunch of side quests."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,new vegas had poorer ratings on release because of how buggy it was and the poor performance. once the patches fixed it however it was vastly superior to fallout 3 in every way.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,pc gaming is less accessible. the reach of nintendo consoles is insane. people who haven't played a game won't vote for it no matter how good it is. pcexclusives also include the more complex games that were too hard to develop for console as well as indie games that benefitted from pc being a more open platform. having a smaller audience is inherent to both.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i honestly don't get it. i never played a zelda game and felt like i was missing out. i then finally played botw a year ago. it wasn't bad, but i wasn't overly impressed either. the world is fairly atmospheric, but also relatively empty and at times even lifeless. the shrines are kind of fun, but get repetitive quite fast. they are mostly rather similar. the weapon degradation mechanic is incredibly overbearing. the story isn't bad, but felt rather minimal. the combat and playing around with the physics was fun though. still, to have botw as top 2 best games of alltime just isn't even close to my taste. i seriously don't get it. decent game, nothing revolutionary or extraordinary in my opinion. same for a lot of the rest of the list to be honest, none of the games i have in my top 10 got near the top 10."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"super metroid is wayyyyyy to low. that is an almost perfect game. just completed it last year, never gotten to play it during the snes age, so did it in switch online and loved every single minute of it. dread gets close but is too linear."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i'm not the biggest fan of rpgs, and if i like them, it's usually the other stuff they bring to the table, like divinity os 2, which is my favorite game. i finally got around to chrono trigger in 2020. that game is insane. it took a couple hours to get used to the older mechanics, but once i did, the game is a solid 1010. the music, the story, the characters, the sidequests, the alternate endings. the gameplay was great too. i sat through 2 12 playthroughs before i touched another game, and i plan on going back eventually."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,i am unhappy that symphony of the night is as low as it is but i honestly could only make a legitimate case for a very small number of games above it that it is better than.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,braid blew my mind. and then to add a great twist on top of that was just so darkly perfect.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,whats braid about?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,do it! its good
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,it is
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"yes yes yes !!!!! seriously these games are fun as hell and the switch has a pretty good selection of games. you have the modern open world zeldas in breath of the wild and tears of the kingdom, you have the hd version of skyward sword traditional 3d zelda and you have the remake of links awakening 2d zelda. you can also play ocarina of time, majoras mask, the oracle games and minish cap through the premium nintendo online subscription and a link to the past, the original zelda and zelda 2 with the base subscription. pretty much the only noteworthy games you cant play on the switch are twilight princess and wind waker."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,just gonna add my 2 cents that i personally find my self motivated by narratives in video games and ive tried to play every zelda and never made it more than 6 hours in besides ocarina as a kid. they arent for everyone imo.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"it wasn't out yet for 25 of the media rankings sample op used, so it can be partially explained by that. for elden ring it's even more than that."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"sekiro is a must play game imo because it shows you how much you can improve. you don't need to finish it in a set time , just don't give up on it and keep trying. you will eventually beat that boss . and when you do , and then eventually replay the game, you realize that you can now beat the boss that took you 50 tries to beat on the first time on the first try."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"if you asked me to name the best game, i would think of sekiro before anything except maybe tetris."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,the original counter strike is number 120 and team fortress 2 is at 117
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,its such a mainstream list. everything is what was popular at the time. i get that it is popular because stuffs good but the flaw is good stuff that is not popular wont make a list like this
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,wc3 not being listed is really absurd. but speaking of rts erm... where is dune 2?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"sorry for being pedantic, but tower defense and the precursors to mobas existed in starcraft ums maps before wc3 was ever released."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"bunch of highly rated pc indie games not on the list. no mount and blade, kerbal space program, project zomboid, rimworld, ftl or factorio among others i've probably missed."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"binding of isaac not being here is probably my only gripe. especially seeing so many other indie games present. boi is the best roguelike, paved the way for others that are present on the list like hades. i understand that the approach is data driven, so i think this says more about games media not including it than it does about any of ops rationale"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i get what you're saying, but v has a lot more cultural impact and is the 2nd best selling game of all time. and even though san andreas aged really well in some ways, it aged really poorly in others."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"the same can be said about pokemon. as iconic as red and blue are, those games are broken as shit and later iterations are so much more polished. hell even leaf green and fire red are a huge improvement on the originals. but nostalgia be a hell of a drug"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,then what about metal gear solid at 7? mario 64 at 9? have those aged all that well?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i was looking for this. super mario kart 1992 wasn't that popular at all and isn't very good. mario kart 64 1996 was incredible and somehow not on the list at all? i will also accept double dash i can only imagine people think mario kart 64 is actually super mario kart since that is the first one they know in the series. otherwise i feel like i'm taking crazy pills. super mario kart 1992 is garbage to mediocre. no game deserves to be on a list if it's sequel made the original completely obsolete or at least higher than the more popular sequel, like how portal 2 is higher than portal..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"because games age differently than movies . old games usually miss a lot of qol stuff we take for granted today , like fast travel , no durabilityinventory limit, minimaps and many other things you just don't think about because every game usually has them movies don't suffer from that . aside from cgi and visual quality, a movie filmed and edited on 30 year old hardware wouldn't be so different from the same movie filmed and edited on modern hardware."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"the bioshock love is utterly baffling to me. i played it on release and had a good time, but forgot it very quickly. i can think of a bunch of similar first person games that were better to play and more memorable."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i think it would be nearly impossible to get an agreed upon top 10. games never age well. even the best ones are worse now than on release. but, given that, botw seems like a fairly safe pick. and i mean that literally. it's extremely polished in basically every area, from gameplay to story to visuals. it's one of the few games where it's really hard to find generally objective critiques. that's why it's here lots of other games have flaws that will push them out of the top 10 on various lists, whereas botw is a safe inclusion on all of them. also it did all that on the wii u, so given that handicap i think 2 is justifiable."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,maybe swap it with mario 64.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,and here come the zelda haters botw made the wife if my best buddy into a game at her late 30s and she even started going to graphic design school afterwards quitting her job i really understand that botw fails to make a few hardcore gamers online happy and its ok  no game wins everyone over  but i read so many comments here slandering the game by people who do not understand its game design philosophy and that makes me sad
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,i actually laughed out loud when i saw it
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,2 is too high but you cant deny what it started in the industry. its a top 25 in the all time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,and this comment was right here is why internet opinions should be discarded. you have no understanding of why it deserves that spot.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"agreed. combined with ftl, they are the best example showing that you can create the feeling of exploration while being the opposite of an open world game. on top of that, sts is mechanically distinct and fun enough that it spawned an entire ecosystem of stslikes. and even though it was released almost 5 years ago, i still think it is the best of its kind."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"oot is like citizen kane. we all just collectively agreed it's the best and we just don't question it. it's not my favorite game, but if i saw the witcher 3 above it, i would think that's not right."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,gta 5 at 3rd is weird to me.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"the weapon break feature nearly ruined the game for me. botw and oot are awesome games, for sure, but the greatness of zelda started with a link to the past for me. man, what a game!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i feel like elden ring would be much higher but it released after half of these articles came out so the fact its at the 60 spot is pretty crazy
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,this is the problem i have with greatest game ever lists  they're scored on how good they were for their era and also just nostalgia. like is zelda oot still the best game we have in 2023? it would be interesting to see the top 100 lists of the younger generations in comparison to millennials.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"don't worry , as long as you are having fun you are doing it right"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,compared to most other games on this list it's quite obscure. the fact it's in here speaks for it's quality i think.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,same. i play suikoden i and ii every couple years. the nostalgia just hits different.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i wasn't expecting top 10, but not seeing terraria on this list at all is surprising."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"no terraria was incredibly surprising, i feel like nowadays its even more popular than a lot of games on there or at least it has a very active and dedicated fan base"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"for real, i'm not really a fan of the xenoblade games, xenogears is one of the greatest though."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,making good games makes people believe you make good games. this and other news at 11.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"is it really that biased? zelda has always been the benchmark for single player dungeon crawling and puzzle solving, and mario basically invented the modern day 3d platformer. skyward sword is considered one of the worst 3d zelda's and i agree with that statement, yet i still can't think of a single adventure title from that console generation with better designed dungeon and puzzle mechanics than that one outside of okami. if that title is considered a low point for a franchise, then i don't really understand how people can think that it's overhyped or biased."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"what is up with rgaming's heavy antinintendo slant? i've seen like several posts on this thread wondering why nintendo has so many highly rated games. a lot of these games are just obviously good. i have heard people love and consider ocarina of time and majora's mask their favorites for decades. same with games like super mario 64, galaxy, odyssey. same with metroid and metroid prime. anyone who grew up gaming throughout the 90s, 2000s, and 2010s just... shouldn't be surprised that nintendo dominates a large part of this list."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,it's because these all time lists are heavily swayed by nostalgia and nintendo ruled the community for a long time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i mean, honestly, the fact that basic games like that make it so high is a testament to how important they are in the grand schemes of things. is tetris a graphically impressive game? is it the most techinically challenging game of its time? probably not in both cases, but its impact on gaming as a whole gets it so much credit. its a game that everyone and their mothers have played. its has world wide recognition. it is a game that has inspired other newer puzzle games. in the micro is tetris the 5 game of all time. no. in the macro? does it deserve top billing, hell to the yes."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,tetris is amazing
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"completely agree with you. just played through the remake actually, and while i enjoyed a lot about it, the gameplay and map design was ridiculously simple and not really worthy of top 25 of all time considering some of the games with both amazing gameplay and other aspects as well."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"gameplay wise, sure. but writing and design?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,there is a remaster with improved controls if thats whats bothering you.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,the hate around the sequel is because of the poor story direction
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"thought the same thing until i saw someone mention this takes in user reviews, part 2 got raided with bad reviews because it was woke"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"masterpiece, think i've actually played it 50 times over."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"absolutely, i was just thinking the same thing! the first one has a very classic buttonmashy vibe but the second is an actual game with a lot of interesting mechanisms and tons of replayability"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,same dude! and i don't say that lightly!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"no fps would be on this list were not for halflife uh.. doom existed before halflife did. i'm not arguing that halflife wasn't a revolutionary game, but even halflife has to give credit to games that which came before it, and inspired it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"deus ex is 74, this list is criminal... still interesting though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"most games are recent but not so recent as to not have had time to be on lists, they overlookunderrate most old greats."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"ita say best game not most influential or most popular game, but it is clear that those distinctions are not well defined at all across the sources."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"sources are biased mostly by being recent. wildly disagree. doom, halflife, etc. whenever they list alltime they are biased towards nostalgia, ie age or at least age of series zelda, mario."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,yeah hl1 being that low is really surprising. hl2 should even be a bit higher. there's no way biohock if better than hl2
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"not deniyng recency bias here, that certainly exists. but a game can be a genre definercreator or popularizer, and still not hold the test of time. whatever half life holds upthe original, not black mesa is up to you, i personally dont think it holds up to well. and a game of all times needs to at least partially account for what if its played today. you can give older games leeway in graphics and presentation, but if otheraspects that are not explained by its old are worse then contemporary today then thats that."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,botw  yes ocarina of time  no
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,lmao said like a true redditor.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"by that logic, 99 of these games will be dogshit because vg are an evolving art form. you have no understanding of how these lists are made."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,the problem with a lot of these lists is that it factors its impact by the time it was released. was it the best game in 1998? it probably is. is the the best game in 2023? highly doubt it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,ignorance.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,give it 5 years. it will be very high on these lists
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,it was probably compiled from lists that don't have it yet listed as it's brand new and hasn't received goty yet

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i thought i was the only one. i get massively downvoted for saying this but im glad to see im not the only one with this opinion. i dont even think its a bad game, its just mid."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"definitely not above ds1 in my opinion. i don't know why there is such a spread there, let alone how it got above."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,recency bias. lmao.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,yep it's now my 1 personally.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i have it ahead of botw easily at 2 but not ocarina of time, that game deserves it's crown."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,it's almost as if don't hold your breath a game's popularity is correlated with its quality.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,we're blood brothers.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"nah it aint  the fact that it is basically okay for all ages, is a quintessential adventure with fully open world and exploration unseen in a game before it, that games like genshin impact ripped off because it was so great and groundbreaking at the time is what makes it such a great game. if its not your particular favorite, at least get your insult right. zelda isnt just for kids. and breath of the wild is not very overrated."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,lmao brain rot comment.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,stop being afraid of fun.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i'd go further and say it wasn't a good story. it has great dialogue, and amazing performances. but the story overall isn't that good."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i have played a lot of zelda and i know i am in the minority of people in the same situation as me, but botw is just more fun to play than any of the other zeldas. i absolutely loved the stories of like oot and majora's mask, but even as a kid when they were all i had, the puzzles felt nonsensical and the back and forth felt frustrating"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,lmao its literally the best zelds game and its not even close. you are in such a tiny minority but you think youre loud because youre screeching.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"by this logic, all these games will mage outdated in like 30 years. this is an evolving art form. nostalgia is part of the bias but also these games are good in general."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i completely agree about the talos principle. im almost finished with ttp2, and its different but equally magnificent."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"well yes, youre free to take these rankings with a grain of salt. this is just an interesting exercise meant to show what patterns exist across these types of rankings, its not a definitive list nor is it meant to be viewed as objective."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"still too recent, released after many of these lists were written."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i started gaming back in the commodore 64 days. i cant believe how much i keep enjoying games as they get released each year. i personally find my gaming experience so fulfilling, especially the past couple of years. most recently have fallen in love with cyberpunk and elden ring. theres no doubt that the classics were great in their day but more modern gaming absolutely rocks  to me at least."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"nostalgia plays a huge part. modern games have never been better, especially this year."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"man that's wild. i can still play oot it holds up so well. yes it's showing its age but when i played it on release it was life changing. gaming was never the same and it shaped the genre. when i played elden ring i beat godrick or we his name was and lost interest.  although great, i do agree that botw is a bit overrated."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,yeah 28 is ridiculously low. i believe ign or some other major game site had a top 100 or 200 recently and mario world was 1. that must have not been included in this dataset for some reason.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"you're assuming that the only valid critique of a game is its gameplay. not the art style, story, music, animation, community features... runescape, for example, is one of the worst looking games you've ever seen with almost no gameplay to speak of, and yet still supports millions of players who undoubtedly get more enjoyment from that one game than basically anything released in the last two decades."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"as far as i can tell, he has good taste and no job."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"its not a perfect comparison at all, but its like silent film and movies with sound. the arcade experience was undoubtedly hugely influential to all of gaming as we know it, but the last two cultural generations dont really even have a reference point for it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"not super shocking. they had a huge influence, but i'd rather play just about any game on the snes than most classic arcade games, and i love arcades. i worked at one when i was 1620, and a common sight was a 50 yearold getting excited to see the old games, head over, sit down for 15 minutes, then look bored, get up and leave. outside of breakout, centipede, and a few others which hold up and are still just extremely fun in 2023. those games were always taken and had a few extra people watching."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"just out of curiosity, which games are you referring to? funny enough, i went the largest arcade in america last week galloping ghost and played a couple of these games. i was pretty upset i couldn't find marvel vs. capcom 2. maybe it was out of service."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"we are addicted to lists for some reason, but if there's something that's really not fit to be ranked, it's video games as such. which is better, last of us or tetris? is a nonsense question to start with. it's like asking which is better, sushi, albert einstein, or the color green? completely different categories. then again video games don't restrain themselves to genres, either, there's a reason the steam catalogue is mostly tagbased nowadays and some award categories continue to be absolute jokes due to the games they mix together looking at you, crusader kings not winning best strategy because of ms flight sim being in the category, too."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,absolutely. fired up my ps3 the other day to play it again. its still amazing. an updated version with crisp resolution and better frame rate is at the top of my wishing list
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"unique, yes. i wouldn't say groundbreaking. couch coop just got a little funky after it came out but i always found it a bit boring. i'm glad others like it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i think most of these lists kinda ignore mmorpgs in favor of single player story based games. with special exceptions for shooters and fighting games. but i think the reason is because most of compelling nature of mmorpgs and the motivation to continue to play is dependent on the social circle you engage with. someone who plays wow or eve online probably wont play long if they dont get involved in a solid clan or corp or group. mmorpgs, when you take away the mmo part dont always hold up against the others on the list. they are a different breed."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i feel it's really hard to quantify how good a multiplayer game is, since it's so intrinsically linked to each one's own personal experience that's going to vary wildly depending on when they started to play it, how good the servers were, how toxic other players were in their servers, how many mods and customization options were availableallowed on those servers and probably other factors that haven't even crossed my mind. wow has an even greater variable considering how long it's running, player experiences in each time and expansion is going to be very different."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"the tricky thing with live service gamesmmosmultiplayer games in general is that they tend to make decisions that result in them getting worse over time see recently diablo 4, which everyone seemed to dig at first"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,definitely a hard game to compare others to
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,tetris is repping hard for the ever popular puzzle genre though
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,the real crime is that brood war isn't on the list
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"gta3 was the landmark game that changed the series and revolutionized the open world genre. it's the most significant gta game, albeit no longer the absolute best. kind of like debating breath of the wild vs. tears of the kingdom. totk is the better game, but there's no totk without botw. gta3 is the definitive gta game. everything else is built on that foundation."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i feel like v has been on the radar for so long almost only because of online multiplayer. it really increases replayability. nothing against that, but i played single player v once and never went back. and i wasn't nearly as engaged and immersed as i was in san andreas."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"gtas specifically seem to hit very differently for people from other times and places. i grew up in the 80s, so the soundtrack and ambiance of vice city made it for me the best gta of them all. san andreas on the other hand, since i grew up somewhere where the rap and hip hop culture had zero impact, i had a really hard time identifying with it plus the mc is a little bitch being pushed around by everybody lol"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,deleted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"wow was definitely the most mainstream mmo but that's a double edged sword since we're talking about a genre whose roots are quite niche. it's easy for familiarity to become contempt when quite a few of your most hardcore guildies would probably rather be playing guild wars or runescape or everquest or even their old mud but they feel stuck with wow because that's where their buddies migrated to. ultimately though i actually think 31st is fine and if anything command  conquer, warcraft iiiii  starcraft got shafted worse."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,gta v got nothing on gta sa story.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,the amount of money it made
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,it's been relevant for over a decade at this point. that sticks in people's minds.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,gta 3 and sa were great games but not relevant for a decade games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,the only wow killer was blizzard itself.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,people really forget how absolutely dogshit new vegas was on release for performance and bug reasons. a door could take as long as a saturday morning cartoon. regularly.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,competitive rtsfps are not what these reviewers focus on. or strategy games. the highest civ game being at 87 is a fucking joke.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"not sure why people say online is play to win. recently restarted a new character on my ps5 and had millions in a week or so. its obviously easier if you throw money at it, but it is by no means play to win."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,it was also built off of an already massively popular universe.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,being genre defining and a global phenomenon aren't the only criteria or roblox would be on the list.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,tetris would like to have a word with you
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"idk why you're being downvoted for this. i think the wording was slightly aggressive, but you absolutely nailed my own thoughts on the matter. lists are cool to read, and finding similarities or general good qualities for games to have is always fun. ultimately, though, everyone has experienced games differently. i've never played wow, so i have no idea what it has defined for the genre. i have played er, botw, dmc games, etc. it is cool to see these, but it is ultimately the individual who decides how important or good the game is."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i would much rather play tetris than the glitchy, boring mess that is skyrim, but i think your optics are off even further than you realise. i had 8 people in my apartment last night and i showed off my mame arcade cabinet. people wanted to play pacman, donkey kong, and street fighter 2. they had the option to play anything up to the end of the dreamcast era. people love the classics for good reason."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i mean, tetris is 5. thats ok though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"youre right, but thats why wow is revered. mmos were clunky messes until blizzard came along and polished and streamlined it. and i think thats what mmos needed into order to fully come into their own."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"it is addictive. but all mmos by design are addictive. i feel like people dont consider mmos to be a serious genre, but wow is legitimately good for an mmo"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"im not a nintendo fanboy, but they do make solid games. youre doing yourself a disservice by never trying them because some of them, like mario odyssey, are legitimately good"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"lmao, you think more people have played portal 2 or shadow of the colossus than wow? the game literally defined the genre for 19 years and you think not enough people have played it to warrant a higher spot on the list?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-01-10,are mmos not games?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"yeah, shit, recency. no one under 30 remembers myst, but it was the killer app for cd gaming. a beautiful immersive 3d chess adventure game the world has never really known before. after it sold like crazy, could even get this junky parody game called pyst in stores. there's 170 other games above myst on this list"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,100. the world of games has changed monumentally since the likes of warcraft 3 and many other old genre defining games. many of which are ignored or put so low on the list to be a little insulting. botw is maybe a top 50 game while halflife somehow doesn't make top 50.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"wc3 deserves top 10 at least for the impact it had on gaming, people still play dota, lol and wow to this day. and also it's like a top 10 game based on its on merit."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"and the custom games scene was just so perfect. i spent way too much time playing stuff like tree tag, wintermaul one, battleships..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,warcraft 3 was for a while the biggest esport in the world behind only cs 1.6.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"dota had a much bigger presence in warcraft 3 than legitimate games of warcraft 3 did. i don't think that's true at all. dota was the most popular custom map at the time but there were other custom maps with an active player base as well. even all custom maps combined weren't anywhere near as popular as classic wc3 was though. that being said, today wc3 is mostly known for it's esport scene and custom maps but back then it was primarly known for it's excellent campaign. the moba genre only became mainstream popular around 2010 when games like lol and heroes of newearth came out."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i may misremember but i feel like you are overselling dota here, warcraft iii was pretty big."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,what? wasn't it famous for its campaign first?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,warcraft 3 esports was huge for a while and i've seen several people say it has the best campaign of any real time strategy game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"my personal experience with warcraft 3 was the inverse i only ever played the single player, touched a few mods, and to this day couldnt tell you what dota is."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,dota had a much bigger presence in warcraft 3 than legitimate games of warcraft 3 did. lol youre out of your mind. you clearly werent around in wc3 prime days.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"this is completely false. warcraft 3 was an absolute milestone and was extremely popular online too. dota came much, much earlier. you know which game actually sold millions of copies and never got played original half life. i remember at the times of counter strike 1.6 asking my clan mates who of them played hl, none did, i only got to the room with the lasers and got bored. that's not to say that hl hasn't had millions of fans and people that played it, but i'm quite sure more of the keys sold where for the mods. i really don't think that was the case with dota."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,that shouldn't be a negative against it and anyways the campaign was great and everyone was raving over it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,this. i got it the year it came out and never once played the storyline.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,how do you think dota became so popular? it's because a lot of people were playing wc3 in the first place. just because dota eventually took over as the bigger reason people played doesn't mean it wasn't immensely popular in the first place.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,this is just insanely wrong.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"some pretty weird takes here honestly. warcraft 3 sold over a million copies in the first month. im not sure how you could argue that hardly anyone played it, it was a massively popular game. also your history of the games spawned from it is pretty flawed. tower defense games and dota precursors both existed in starcraft before warcraft 3 existed."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"quick question, might this be geographical? almost everyone i knew growing up in the 90s were pc gamers, warcraft, starcraft, cs, quake, diablo were the go to games in denmark. there might be a console bias for the us and a fair few other countries."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i think not including wc3 runs into the issue of it being a game with staying power. it still has esports tournaments and pro players. few games have lasted as long as it has in the pvp genre without being replaced by the new thing. i will agree it is more famous for its custom games and that they sold more copies than the base game. that should count as part of its strength and not detract from it. there was more content there than in any other game until roblox or modern sandbox games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"industry wide collapse caused by et, maybe? that or just forgot by the author."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"um, if you didnt know, bioshock 4 is in development. whether itll be good or not with a completely new team at the helm is anyones guess."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,honestly as ive gotten older i feel like infinite showshas way more problems than 2 whereas the only issue with 2 i have these days is that sometimes it can feel a bit too safe. infinite tried to do too much without really achieving any of their goals aside from elizabeth really innovating in the gaming industry and porn
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,i have never in my life heard someone say that infinite is better then 2.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,its not dead httpsen.m.wikipedia.orgwikicloudchambercompany year title  platforms tba  untitled bioshock game  tba
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,things that are good don't need to get milked until they lose all relevance they once had. let bioshock be good and let it inspire new things or let the studio make a new good ip.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"2 was fine, it was an extension of one which made it tolerable. infinite was like playing a different franchise. i was shooting rocket launchers and was recharging halo shields before the first set piece. no tension, no drama, no mystery just explosions."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"infinite had problems, but was vastly better than bioshock 2 i don't think i could disagree with a gaming opinion any harder. infinite has absolute dogshit gameplay compared to 2. like the design decisons in infinite just had me angry the whole time i was playing it. maybe the worst game i have ever played to completion."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"which game, bioshock? i mean, it depends on the time youre viewing it from. sure, now its gameplay might not be considered something special, but 2007 was a different time"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"going back now, bioshock 2 is much more playable by modern standards as it refined on all the aspects of the original. it might not have the twist of the first game but imo it's the better of the trilogy"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,the first bioshock's gameplay was definitely innovative when it came out. no other game before it did special abilities  fps as well.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"wow you're right, i'm also shocked titanfall 2 isn't up there! one of the best fps campaigns ever"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"sekiro not making the list surprises me most of that set. terraria and titanfall 2 i'm not terribly surprised missed the cut because they're both more grassroots fan favorites than they were super notable critical darlings, but sekiro i feel like was both a critical darling and had a big community around it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,terraria is literally one of the best selling games of all time and is famous for all the free updates it's released.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,terraria not making the list is a crime. blows my mind that it's not here.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i was so glad outer wilds was on here, just finished it and its definitely one of my favourites"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,agreed. i went in with the only thing i knew being that it took place underwater. best single player gaming experience i think i've ever had.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,playing a puzzle game with a strategy kind is ruinous.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,it's true. i bought it and stopped playing right away cause i thought it was a buggy mess. then i came back later and it became my favorite fallout and one of my favorite games of all time. i'm still waiting for something similar to appear again.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i'm with you, and i love both. but 3 was a way cooler area to explore and i had a lot more fun with it than i did nv. nv had a better story but felt like nothingness to me in between plot points. can't wait to get flamed for this comment."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"exploration is much better in fallout 3. everyone makes a big deal about choices in nv, but they arent as earth shattering as everyone makes them out to be."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,fallout 3 has less rpg elements than nv
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"fallout 3 does a great job of slowly showing you how the game works and opening up at the right times and guiding you to be in the places you should be without overwhelming the player whereas, new vegas just kind of throws you out there and hands you a lot of different systems and elements pretty quickly, which i think makes it a little too complicated for the average gamer."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"yeah, it's funny nobody ever talks about that. i wasn't high on fo3, but immediately enjoyed nv. some of my friends and people i know irl didn't like it though, and i saw that sentiment echoed a lot online. flash forward to now and it's considered the definitive fo experience to the point where people are begging obsidian or bethesda somebody to make a worthy spiritual successor."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"seconded. whenever people praise nv like it was an instant classic, i have to wonder if i slipped into bizarro world, because back when it came out, i remember both the outlets and the online discourse loathing it as a cheap, rushed cashgrab dlc sold at full price. among all my friends, both online and offline, i was pretty much the only one who liked it, warts and all, and seeing it getting unanimous praise nowadays and everyone pretending they always loved the game is just baffling."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,it still is massive. hundreds of thousands of people have been playing it every day for more than 2 decades. how many other games can say that?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"paradox strategy games are a very niche market. they have a very solid fanbase, but they were never truly big enough to be featured on lists like this and i say this as a fan."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,the rts genre just didn't continue with the steam it had. i think only age of empires ii is the only rts game i recognized on the list
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,right? or dune ii!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"specifically red alert, right? i never played any of them but that one i would hear about all the time back then."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"this is going to be countered at least somewhat by the other flaw in the methodology. points are given solely by ranking regardless of year. therefore newer games are going to get fewer points because they didn't exist when several of the polls used were created. a game in 2023 could be 1 on every list created after the game was released, and still get fewer points than an older game that scores even moderately on every source used, because they get 10 extra scores to add to their total."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i would have at least accepted tie fighter as a consolation option, but yea wing commander was such an immersive pioneer in the space combat simulation genre."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,it absolutely does. hard to imagine mario 64 and quake as the first larger level fully 3d games were less than 2 years old when oot came along
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"nintendo has a huge fanbase who will defend the company to the death and only play nintendo games. it's actually quite unlike anything any other developerpublisher has, which i think should be taken into account. nintendo games routinely place higher than they should purely because nintendo fans are so diehard, to the point i genuinely think the nintendo community is separate from the wider gaming community as a whole."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,but only some and they ignored user reviews from sources they used for critic reviews...

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,yup
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i understand and agree with the love for ocarina, but other than its physics, breath of the wild was just a shallow shell of what it could have been. the world itself lacked any depth beyond the surface dungeons were incredibly short, incredibly easy, and never gave the feeling of, well, now how do i get out of here because i honestly dont know how i got in? and the story itself is a full hour less than what you get in ocarina despite having at least five times the amount of gameplay. lets not even talk about that final boss fight for reference, i sank a few hundred hours into both my wii u and my switch hoping to feel the magic. it never came. tears is such an improvement over breath i hope fans can recognize just how empty the latter is and stop looking at it with such blind praise."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i hadn't either until my friend talked me into buying a switch, and since i've put over 700 hours in between botw and totk. i didn't think i was a zelda fan until i somehow was."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"why, when emulation is so easy?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,theyre really great and also overrated. theres a lot of games in the series so id check some out.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,skyward sword and phantom hourglass are both absolute bangers in my opinion. spirit tracks though... boy that game is rough.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"they're good games, but a more important reason is that they're very casual friendly while still offering an actual gameplay experience, rather than something arcadey. very few casual games manage to get anyone invested in them, and zelda has built it entire legacy on it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,botw is very different from most zelda games. i wouldn't write off the series as a whole just cause you didn't like botw
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"between breath and tears, i think tears is a better game overall, although it does get a lot of criticism for being botw 2.0. the building mechanics alone make it much more interesting and fun to experiment with, and there's a wider variety of enemies. weapon degradation is still there, but the fusion mechanic more than makes up for it there's also an enemy in the game that allows you to restore weapons, although i'm not sure if that was intentional on nintendo's part. both games are also very different in the franchise for not relying on linear story progression. ocarina is probably the most nostalgic out of all of them. it introduced many musical motifs that have since become a mainstay in the franchise, and it has so many memorable characters and moments. that said, the gameplay and camera do suffer from that early 3d jank like many games in that era. if you ask individual zelda fans what there favorite game is, you're likely to get wildly different answers, but i think that's a testament to the franchise as a whole that you can have so many different experiences depending on the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,tears of the kingdom isnt up there. its ocarina of time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"huge same. i played zelda oot when i was a kid and it was by far the greatest gaming experience of my life. then majoras mask, which was amazing but not as revolutionary. then sort of lost interest, tried twilight princess and didn't like it. fast forward to last year i pick up botw to play with my son. he loves it, similar magic to oot i experienced, but for me...not so much. it's really just uninteresting, feels very flat and procedurally generated. fun to see it through his eyes though, i just pretend to be having more fun than i am. honestly zelda fans will just give their games a 12 point bump for nostalgia, which pushes it into overrated terrority."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"try a link to the past. different game from a different age, but i think it still stands strong. the world is much, much smaller than botw but is much more dense. the dungeon design is top notch. you will get lost, you will get confused, and you will die. but that's all a part of the adventure. i'm curious what is in your top 10 if they didn't get near what you see in the top 10 here."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"by far, still has some gems though but it was better before breath of the wild. does my head in when people claim it's the best game of all time. it's just an open world rpg, but 10 years after everyone else started doing them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"the games appeal to a very broad, general audience. fantastic for true casual gamers, but often pretty boring for people that want more than that. so yeah, overrated is probably a good way to describe them? they're solidly good games almost all of them, but nothing particularly exceptional. but they appeal to a wide audience so they do extremely well on ratingpolls like this, as they should tbh."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"this basically, don't get me wrong i myself love most zelda games and several are amongst my fav of all time but there is no denying just putting the name zelda on the box bumps the rating by about 10"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"great comparison, nintendo to pop music. definitely both are made by talented individuals, but the actual product is nothing special or innovative. frankly every game has been the same for like 20 years. like how do you even rank one super smash over the other? theyre all the same."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"they're scored on how good they were for their era if we rated games by current play ability, then the entire list would be games released within the last 1015 years."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"the problem with judging the best video games of all time based on just purely on how good they are is that no game made before the ps4 era would make the list, due to things such as graphics, sound quality, and the fact that later games have more information about what works or not. it would be a pretty dumb list that would have a lot of games not largely seen as the best of the best."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,absolutely! plus i remember as a kid my mind being blown by the fact you could recruit 108 different characters. it makes the replay value so much better experimenting with different parties each play through.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,yeah problem is there are too many people that these rankings are overly important. i love a lot of games that have good rankings and reviews but a few of my all time fav games are also games that arent as highly reviewed.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i couldn't disagree more, baldur's gate 3 was the proof that it wasn't me getting older and more grumpy, it showed that i still could enjoy games like i did 25 years ago. high budget games are being made for the lowest common denominator, maximizing profits over innovation, depth and fun. and it has all to do with how the industry is set up at that level, where games are made with investors putting money in with the guarantee they get more money out. stopping devs from taking any risks. a game like bg3 isn't perfect, but it shows what's possible if you don't have to stop development when market research tells your return on investment will only decrease by allocating more dev time. when was the last time a aaa studio surprised you with something new and interesting? and we're not talking here about better graphics or executing a proven genre to perfection."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"nah this has been a shit year for gaming . aside from totk and, alan wake 2 and bg3 nothing good came out and we also got gollum , redfall , rise of kong , forspoken , hogwarts legacy and the new walking dead game ."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"naw, these are a collection of review scores from multiple sources at the time the games were released, so there was literally no nostalgia. none. they were reviewed in era. x200b i don't think so. but whatever, 2023 was just slightly less lame than 2020 or 2021 or 2022. but if you took 2023 and transplanted in back in the 2000s.... x200b it would be the worst year of that decade for gaming. x200b that's how low the bar is."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,this post makes me wish i could organize my saved posts easier.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,a pretty good comparison. i also think that a big part of it is that arcade games were much better enjoyed in the arcade environment competing with friends for high scores. i feel like most people who try an arcade game for the first time today will play maybe four or five rounds and then never touch it again.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i would say that neither space invaders nor galaga not being on the list is outrageous. frogger, asteroids, centipede, missile defense and many other arcade classics i would expect to see at least one or two of these on here."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,im guessing you never spent a fair amount of time creating levels or playing user created levels. the amount of things you could do with a little creativity was astonishing. idk how anyone could get bored with it as a platformer honestly.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"mmorpgs are also notoriously difficult to review. reviewers don't have the time to invest, and people looking for a new mmorpg will use word of mouth to find it  they'll play what their friends are already playing."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"yeah my wording could be better but ranking tetris over thousands of other titles is crazy, it's fun but there's hundreds of mobile games people would call crappy that are more fun, it simply can't compete with modern games. also the other commenter who mentioned gta v is number 3 but san andreas is down at like 60. if rockstar shut down for whatever reason and san andreas was the last gta game ever then it would shoot up to like 7ish on lists like this because you would need to represent an iconic franchise near the top as opposed to it just being ranked on its own merit."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"that may be but for how long would they play those games? i mean, i had a ton of fun with lemmings, worms, wolfenstein or duke nukem as a kid but i surely would not have a long time of fun with those games. when i fire up a newer game wich is not on that list i would most likely get hours of fun out of them. thats not because the old games were bad, but games as a whole evolved. there are for sure some outlierlike the og pomemon, old zelda games, evergreens basicaly but the majority of newer games is superior to the majority of older games imo."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i think you misunderstood what i meant and thought i think wow should be at 31. more people will look upon those games more favorably than they would wow. wow in my opinion should be easily regarded as the best video game of all time, its longevity and amount of users over those years surpasses anything we probably will ever see online. wow easily should be 1 on every best video game of all time list, but like i said, there are too many people who make a point of never playing wow for it to be placed higher on opinion lists."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,and how much of the warcraft 3 population bought the game for competitive reasons? just because something's a popular esport that doesn't mean that much of the player base is engaging in any sort of activity involving esports.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,damn didnt think i'd ever heard of hon again. good times.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i don't think that's true at all. dota was the most popular custom map at the time but there were other custom maps with an active player base as well not ones with player counts in the millions, like dota had."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i would have thought so. it looks like rts games were pretty much skipped over on this list. the ccred alert games were hugely popular and definitely should have a spot on the list, but they missed out too."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"warcraft 3 was an absolute milestone and was extremely popular online too. dota came much, much earlier.   ?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"hardly anyone played it, comparatively, is what i said. if you were to go around asking people who played computer games in 2002 have you played warcraft 3?, i think you'd find that the vast majority of them had a ps2 or some older console and didn't know what warcraft was. nearly 20 million people bought ps2s in 2002. that was also around when vice city came out, which was a ps2 game first and foremost same as san andreas. people on this specific website might be more inclined to think otherwise, but there's a selection bias at work there because people on this site are more likely to have grown up with pcs. you're right about starcraft, i'd forgotten about that. back then regular internet access was not common. i didn't play starcraft, didn't know anyone who did at the time, slipped my mind. the ones that took were derived from wc3, is what i should have said."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"yep, same experience here. '96 kid. everyone and their father not even figuratively played war3, diablo 2, age of empires, cs, metin 2, gta sa, or cod 2. not a single kid in my school had a console. we all played on pc. i think the more you go east in europe, the more prevalent it becomes."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"not in terms of country, but maybe by wealth. you had to have a pc in the house. internet access was another thing entirely. the console 'bias' is and was universal. there's also the fact that having a pc and being a pc gamer meant that you'd naturally gravitate to other people like you i did. pc wasis a tiny industry compared to consoles. it might just be that you were from the right kind of place where people had and could afford pcs. out of the people i knew back then, same time, only a few of us played pc. most people had playstations. statistically, i think you'd find that by the time wc3 came out, the console market was 30x larger mostly ps2 than the pc market. that's why the 2000s was so shit for pc gaming, lot of big releases were halfbaked console ports for over a decade. remember you're on reddit, not out in the world. good chance you're a technologically literate 30something year old male who grew up in a reasonably wealthy household and you knew other people like you."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,i feel the same. 2 might even be my favourite.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"and the gameplay isn't bad, by any means."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,correct. 2 gets a bad rap but was my favorite then and now
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i wouldn't call bioshock innovative. bioshock was the spiritual successor to system shock 2 hence the name, which introduced pretty much all of the gameplay concepts in bioshock also the plot was very similiar, with the same basic story and twists just in a different setting. what bioshock did was perfect the formula. ss2 was a great game but had serious balancing problems with the tech tree."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"dark souls, elden ring and bloodborne being here but not sekiro is a sham. sekiro deserves a spot here just as much. as praised as it can get, its still underrated because its such an amazing game"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"look at the bright side, you only did it once!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"those are basically the words i was looking for! i just made a comment about how fallout 3 places just seemed to have more personality. i can't put it into words very well, but i just had more fun exploring. there was something silly and quirky around every corner, like a teddy bear and a gnome playing chess on a toilet. the dumb themes that kept popping up just gave the capital wasteland so much more flair."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"in fallout 3, the main plot doesn't take you to much of the map at all, when you look at it. fnv takes you all over the place. and sidequests are often triggered in places where the main plot takes you. so fallout 3 rewarded exploration more. all sorts of side quests hidden where you actually had to go and search them out. plus the encounters in the wasteland were completely different. in fnv, you could say now a gecko will run in from the left, whereas in fo3, the best you could say is something will happen in this place, when i come up to it for the first time. here's jon, from many a true nerd, with 2 hours on why fo3 is good. httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v5z8xhe2noae"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i'm so glad this thread has allowed me to finally find the words i need to properly express how i feel about the games. it also makes me realise that baldur's gate 3 has most of the things about both that i like most, and lacks many of the elements i don't. as much as i loved oblivion, fallout 3 was probably the first game that made me fall in love with open world exploration and side quests."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"which is funny, because i love rpgs."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,and that automatically makes it better because? fallout 3 is a better wasteland exploration game but nv is better written. i much preferred the setting of fo3 couldn't give a shit about the mojave too much pandering to us folklore.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i don't know how to put it into words, but i feel like fallout 3's places just have more personality. teddies and gnomes. silly giant tricycles. massive bomb in the middle of a city."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,you don't recognize starcraft?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i don't really care for nintendo. i always skipped their conferences at e3. just not my typical kind of games. i did play a couple pokemon and zelda games on gameboy when i was a kid though. i did also buy a switch just for botw. i now own 2 games on the switch. botw and totk.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,y'all should bone
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"to be fair those are very different than previous zelda games. the traditional zelda formula has never really hooked me, but i loved botw and totk."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i haven't played the other zelda games. so i can't comment on them. i do believe you that for example ocarina of time is very different though and it perhaps it was revolutionary at the time of its release. i didn't play it back then though, so it can't have an educated opinion on that game. it's difficult to revisit games that old and adequately judge them. same with a game like morrowind. i think that game was mindblowing at the time of release, now it feels rather dated. my problem is that zelda fans absolutely rave about botw and i personally found it a very middling game. so i'm just very skeptical about what those same people have to say about games in general. simply based on how a lot of people go crazy for botw, i've always just assumed that there are a lot of zelda fans who are dedicated nintendo gamers and who have not played openworld games with actual qualitative content like rdr2 or the witcher 3. maybe that's an unfair assumption though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,tears is 1000 a better game in every aspect. its does everything better and is easily one of the best games ever made
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"yeah they're still good but they're not top of all time, breath of the wild was so popular because of the switch and nintendo gamers wanting an open world like other franchises that have been popular, even halo eventually jumped on that train. neither infinite or botw are revolutionary or of spectacular quality lol but thoughts like these bring haters"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"botw is really good but god did it not feel like a zelda game to me. what i love the most about zelda is that you know youre in for a grand, epic adventure with ancient magic, ruined temples, etc and a straightforward but cool story and lore. but botw felt more like a theme park than an epic adventure to me, a lot of time because i felt thrown from gimmicky mini game to mini game for hundred of hours. great fun to be had but not what i sought when i played it. i found that more in elden ring, funnily enough. the darksiders game are also amazing zelda like with a bit tougher gameplay and a not very cheery universe"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,it's because nintendo gamers are a completely different set of people and target audience. it's kinda wild how disconnected they are from the rest of the games industry.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"minmaxers sometimes think that because an exploit exists, that they must use it, and then complain that the game is trivialized because of its existence that they chose to use."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"ironically that sounds like my experience with breath of the wild! i found it a total bore to play. i don't think outer wilds is about a 'big reveal' at all. certainly it has some, but it's more a series of smaller discoveries on the way. anyway, as they say the less said about the game the better as discovery is pretty much its main selling point, but if it's not doing it for you so far then too bad. it probably doesn't help that it's been hyped up beyond belief."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"yes, but collectors aren't ranking their collection based on best of all time. most influential, maybe, but not best. it's an entirely different metric. because the best cars of all time list if aging is removed from the equation would be dominated by modern cars, which have infinitely better safety, faster speeds, better suspension, softer seats, etc, etc. video games aren't quite as bad as cars for that, but both graphics and gameplay are features that age extremely poorly. every generation gives much better graphics, so every game aiming for top tier graphical fidelity is going to look bad in hindsight. gameplay of popular games also gets ripped off and refined, so what was once revolutionary gameplay becomes modern day cliche gameplay. it's impossible to separate such things when talking about best. each person has their own metrics for determining how much gameplay and graphics aging affects them. for some people, what might matter is just how they felt when it first released for others, it might matter how well it holds up if it were first played today. basically, you can't dismiss aging when talking about the quality of games its intrinsically tied to them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i've been a gamer since the early 80s, and i can totally get ocarina being 1, but the one game that just mesmerized everyone i knew when it came out was mario 64. you don't often have dudes sitting around watching another dude play a 1player game, but that went on for months and months as my friends and i took turns playing it. goldeneye could be higher too since it's one of the most fun console multiplayer games of all time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"yea i really do not understand this narrative that botw started or revolutionized open world games like ... it really did not look at horizon which came out at a very similar time and that games open world is so much more beautiful and lively with more interesting and more diverse enemies, better combat, better gear progression etc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"if anything nintendo was 10 years late, and then people tried to give them credit as if they had just done something special, mental."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"as far as i can tell, the thing it did was not put icons on the map. that makes the exploration more rewarding. but like, there's not much to find beyond korok seeds."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-29,httpsyoutu.beavpxkdsegnq?si0xoeo3mbgruuypss i think we take for granted a lot of things that botw innovated on.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,not sure what you mean by collectathon. you can literally just go directly to the main quests. everything collectible is just optional content. it's really not so dissimilar to the earlier zelda games in that regard.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,ocarina of time wasn't the same thing in that regard?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"yes ive had a couple of replies that sound like they think i think botw was the start of open world wilderness games. what i actually noticed in the wake of botw was a very particular tone of exploration. small things like the style of soundtrack, the cooking, having a glider and freeclimb abilities. and again, im not saying botw invented any of these, it just feels like the progenitor to a wave of similarplaying titles like genshin impact, tchia and immortals fenyx rising."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i would also like to hear why. i generally liked it but there was nothing earth shattering about it. the only thing the game did that i cant remember being done before was the environmental impact on certain things like dropping some food in a cold area to make it icy. the enemies were recycled to death. exploration wasnt that great. sure you can climb anything but for what? to find the millionth korok seed. assasins creed style towers everywhere, etc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"always i mean, it definitely wasn't overrated in 1998 lol. how to account for tech advance in games will forever be a subject of debate. but i agree that nothing in this world can forever stay the best."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"eh id say its maybe slightly overrated at most. replaying it again on the 3ds and it still has an amazing adventure to it. it controls well, the puzzles and dungeons are still great, most of it still holds up imo. botw is the massively overrated one in my opinion"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,if you're playing a game you absolutely shouldn't hold age against it within reason but when you're having a discussion about the greatest of all time i think it's fair that it has to stand up against all time to get the title without adjusting for nostalgia or historical impact.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,all i'm saying is nostalgia and history shouldn't trump gameplay.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"it holds up well but the problem is that halflife 2 exists. i heard a comment somewhere that basically summed it up as if hl1 was the greatest fps ever, then hl2 is the greatest game ever so if your goal is to make a list of the best games ever, it would be weird to put hl1 over hl2 just because hl1 was an original when hl2 is a better game same reason why world of warcraft frequently makes these sorts of lists but everquest doesn't. everquest was certainly a pioneer, but that doesn't make it better. if we gave extra weight simply for being first, these lists would just be like pong, breakout, galaga"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"youre grossly exaggerating how niche computer gaming was at that time, just because its grown so much doesnt mean it was some obscure thing. i knew plenty of people at that time who played starcraft and then warcraft 3 on the computer. it set the record for fastest selling computer game at the time. comparing it to the ps2s numbers is really misleading too. the ps2 is the best selling console of all time, nothing matched its numbers. it doesnt invalidate every other form of gaming as being niche. besides the numbers are vastly inflated in terms of how many people were gaming because it was one of the cheapest dvd players at the time which was a big part of how much it sold. beyond that there are several games on the list that had much smaller player bases. i mean even oregon trail is on there, computer gaming was even less at that time. im amazed anyones ever heard of such a niche game. there were only like 3 people playing computer games then right?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i'm a 38 year old techliterate male on reddit, correct, but i grew up in a bottom 10 income household single mother with low paying job living in the middle of nowhere, late access to internet, so wrong there. also, pc gaming was to a fair few people the cheaper option due to, well, piracy burned cdslan sharing, not online. throughout all of my education, the pattern of pc gaming as being predominant has been constant, usually 68 people in a class were gaming, a few also had consoles, but most were pc gaming. usually, the people with consoles were the wealthier kids who had both a pc and a console, so there's that. again, i think it might be based on countries. the us and uk has been mainly console dominated, and most international game journalism stems from those countries for obvious reasons. they're also quite large countries, so it might be correct when representing a western audience, but it'd still be interesting to see whether or not there's a geographical tie here."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i played all 3 for the first time this year, back to back. when i think bioshock, i definitely think of 1 and 2. infinite was fine, but it was so different that it doesn't really feel like part of the series"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"interestingly, infinite is one of my favorite games of all time"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,nv pandering toward us folklore over...fallout 3 set in dc? what?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-29,yup. some games are just too popular to be any good.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,what's really amazing to me is that they feel the need to cope with it in the first place.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"wouldnt surprise me if its just latent console fanboyism. my one buddy has been a day hard sony fan since the late 90s. always shit talked mario and zelda throughout our lives growing up since they were nintendo games. even though we are well into our 30s, can afford any console we want, hes still doing it. old habits die hard."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,i think a lot of people are upset that they only come out on nintendo systems and try to find a way to cope with that
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,what's amazing to me is how many people just refuse to accept they're buying nintendo games for the nostalgia hit and not because they're ground breaking games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"theres a hate boner for zelda in this subreddit that i havent seen in previous years, and it seems to originate from baldurs gate 3 fanboyism since theres stiff competition for goty between the two. you can actually like both games, though. i do. zelda is better though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"it doesn't even make sense. nintendo games get rated highly because of the diehard fanbase ok, and tell me why exactly nintendo has this diehard fanbase in the first place? did people just randomly decide to support them? or could it be that nintendo has an incredibly loyal fanbase because they make some of the best games in the world?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-12-13,1000 reasons to dislike nintendo as a company but you cant deny that they make damn good video games.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"if you took the source code for breath of the wild, replaced all the references to the zelda franchise with anything else you came up with, and then jumped in a time machine and released it before the actual breath of the wild was released, with a big marketing campaign and everything... nobody would care. it wouldn't be a contender for game of the year, let alone listed amongst the best games of all time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,or its both. but you aint ready for that convo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"this.. i despise a lot of nintendo practises and even game decisions.... but even the worst decisions for me as a fan, usualy still makes me end up with either no gamewhich.. you cant rate.. a game that dosnt exist wont have a user or critic score or a game that is still actually fantastic even if its not what i wanted from the franchisebotw and totk being the most recent example x200b i actually have to think hard of a first or even second party nintendo game, that isnt pokemon that i genuinly say was bad as a game, not bad as a game of franchise x but bad period. even the worst nintendo game is good with so few exceptions its comical at times"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,okay.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,the fact that's your reaction really just proves my point. i didn't even say nintendo makes bad games lmao i enjoy nintendo.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"nintendo games are using a different language, that i and others like me don't seem to speak. i've made my peace with that. but seriously, 10 marios and 7 zeldas on this list, all ahead of little big planet or ftl  that is just cultish."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,like why is mario bros 3 even in the top 100? let alone so close to the top it's absolutely one of the best games ever made
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i'll go down in flames with you. my example is that pokmon redblue is listed very high and those could be argued to be the absolute worst of the series. yes, it jumpstarted the largest media franchise in the world, but they're a coding mess full of glitches and poor balancing. every pokmon game after is better...by far. these lists are flawed as hell. and yeah, nintendo fans are fanatical, content with playing the 319th mario game, 53rd metroid, a 74th zelda, or whatever the next pokmon game is with unbridled joy. and even when it's not that good, they'll sell 20 million copies for some reason. nintendo's current console is basically 2 gaming generations behind in power and processing and they get no hate for it. that's how fanatic their fans are. their fans will settle for anything. source i play pokmon games religiously as in, i'm within 100 'mons from having a full living shiny pokedex. i'll buy any 'version' game even if it's a potato. i have probably have over 10,000 hours played in my lifetime of just pokmon games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,not to mention purchasing the game twice on two different platforms lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"right?! a game that i spent 200 hours on just didnt grab me. like come on, theres not even 10 hours worth of content in botw if you dont like the core exploration loopmessing with the physics."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,people actually spend alot of timemoney on things and in the end dont view those things as great or amazing this isnt the gotcha moment u think it is
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,this is actually a feature of game design now. there are psychological tricks used to incentivize people to keep playing games. skinner box is the most common.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-29,"it wasn't a hollow shell of a game. it was a shallow shell of what it could have been. it was still fun as hell, but it's not a top 2 or even 200 of all time game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i did play it at the time and if you read my post i do give it the credit for paving the way for many games to come. but that doesn't make it impervious to criticism, especially in a thread about the best game of all time. ocarina of time has  very obvious  flaws, which imho makes it a worse game than others on the list, including a link to the past. but since it is is the golden child of many zelda fanboys which i consider myself, too, btw, you'll get crucified the second you aren't praising it to high heavens. is it still a brilliant game in many ways? yes. is it the best game of all time? i'd reckon it's not even the best game in its own series."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"no, i don't see the point of trying zelda as pc gamer coz jrpgs  to my experience  have about as organic a mkb control scheme as dragon age  inquisition. and i hate dai obviously for awful player inputs. felt like a console port."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,horizon came out the same week as botw and was a much better game imo.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-29,you mean this game? httpsyoutu.beavpxkdsegnq?si0xoeo3mbgruuypss
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"you can beat the story in like 5 hours but the collectible stuff can keep you busy for 60 hours. thats a collectathon. yes the story is there, but its like 5 quests including the tutorial, then ganon if you strictly did the story. the games entire focus is exploration. which is fine, but when you design a game around exploration, there needs to be variety and fulfillment. but there isnt. its just a repetitive loop. you search and find weapons only for them to break so you have to look for more. or its collect the seeds, kill the assassins, or complete the shrines. which are all extremely similar or actual reskins of previous ones. on top of the complete lack of enemy variety. its an ubisoft game with a zelda skin. the game is fine, but its entirely overrated."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,it was puzzle based dungeon crawler. the games replayability wasnt built around collecting like botw 900 seeds are you kidding me??. botw story can be completed in like 5 hours. collectibles will keep you busy for 60 hours. botw is much closer to mario 64 in terms of collecting than oot. even oot has more enemy variety despite being 30 years older.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-29,"the environment impact was a lot of what made the game special. you can burn grass and paraglide on the updraft, cut down trees and float on the log down the river, things like that. use bombs to propel minecarts. electricity actually conducts through metal items and does area of effect damage in waterrain. there's actually a lot of mechanics to this game, i think a lot of people underestimate it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"the overworld in oot was a joke in 1998, too."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"definitely agree on majora's mask, but wind waker seriously dropped the ball when it came to dungeons."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"probably because it inventedcreated a ton of systems that games red dead redemption 2 uses to this day. ztargeting? the concept that you can lock the camera onto an enemy and swivel it around them on an axis? ocarina of time pioneered that. it was a groundbreaking mechanic. no one had thought of it before nintendo did. virtually every developer who has developed a modern 3rd person actionadventureshooter has used that mechanic to some degree. from rockstar's grand theft auto and red dead series, to horizon, to god of war, to the witcher 3, to metroid prime, to middle earth, to assassin's creed, to the batman arkham and modern spiderman titles, to kingdom hearts, to devil may cry. they all owe a massive amount of their gameplay design to that one single mechanic. id software's john cormack basically the godfather of the modern day first person shooter is on record stating that super mario 64 and ocarina of time are easily the most influential 3d video games ever, and that every developer who has developed a big 3d blockbuster ever since owes a lot to the mechanics nintendo basically invented for the genre. does ocarina of time hold up now, nearly 30 years later? not really. but i don't think there has been such a consensus this is without a doubt the greatest video game ever made sort of title released since. and that means an awful lot."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"this is more or less how i feel. tetris is apparently the fifth best game humanity has created, it's still better than almost every single modern release? being historically significant doesn't make it an objectively good game in 2023."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,ok well then i'll talk about the 3ds version which has sufficient polygons and better controls. it's still better than almost anything else imo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"he used metacritic top scoring games of all time. they were all reviewed in era. i mean, this isn't that hard to grasp. ocarina of time wasn't reviewed this year dummy... it was reviewed in 1998 and metacritic actually has the links of those reviews in their score. come on now. you can't be that glib. he used read polls of this year.... so, in fact, you would think new games would actually score better... but... they didn't. cause they're not as good. it's not hard to grasp."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,yes. x200b you're telling me.. lets take.... 2007. x200b that those games would replace... get ready to get rocked x200b mass effect bioshock call of duty 4 modern warfare halo 3 the orange box unreal tournament 3 super mario galaxy uncharted god of war 2 crysis x200b x200b boom. your modern games just got rekt. x200b and it doesn't end. the 2000s has every year like this good or near this good.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i play old games all the time. they're better. i was playing fallout 3 recently and it's better than any game releases in the last 5 years. sorry but it's true. i was playing ut99 yesterday for four hours, and it's better than any comp fps released in the last 10 years. it is what it is man. i play games all the time, new games are shit. they're just simply not as good."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"agreed, even fortnite is a bit hard to nail down because the gameplay has changed so significantly since the start. sure, same overarching goal, battle royale, but the mechanics and features have varied pretty drastically between 2018 and 2023. wow has a pretty good spot, but these lists are games that you want to play, not games that had a big impact on the genre"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"do you have to evaluate the experiences that a new player would have during each of those moments, or someone who's always been there the whole time? yes. and if they don't, they are a dirty casual and shouldn't review it. and if they disagree with my assessment they are dumb and wrong."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"what you haven't considered is, while gta sa and vice city made lots of improvements, gta 3 is what set the foundation and is therefore the most revolutionary and important game of the franchise"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,oh i'm right there with you. played from vanilla until the first tier of shadowlands andjuay couldn't keep up as a raider anymore. certain design decisions also rubbed me the wrong wa enough times as well as the rising just going in a word direction
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,but does that make the game better? or suits this game just better in your lifestyle?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,holy thats a throwback. the cover art for blue dragon is still implanted in my brain
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,thats me and ff13. i get why most people call it mediocre but something about that game just vibed with me.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"notably, its boss themehttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vhblsgxkhps0 is sung by the lead singer of deep purple. which is just a bizarre crossover."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"it clearly was just an immensely popular game all around, fully contradicting your first comment. that doesn't contradict it at all. people were buying warcraft 3 just to play dota, it was huge  especially in the philippines and china. the dotaallstars website was getting over a million unique hits monthly until riot games bought the website out from its owner. it had over a million registered members on its forums and this is just the presence it had in english speaking communities. most dota players didn't care about warcraft 3's ladder experience, they wanted to play dota."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"dota 1 and the frozen throne came out the same year, it wasn't something that came out much, much later. tft only came out in the second half of 2003."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i'm not saying anything is invalid, i don't know what you're getting at. what i'm saying is that if you spoke to someone who played computer games in general at that time, most of them wouldn't know what wc3 was, and it's unlikely many of them had internet access either or played online games. as a result, it's not nearly as likely to end up on lists made by people today who didn't grow up playing pc games in the late 90searly 00s like you or i did. no need to get your nose out of joint about it, it's not a personal attack."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,did you play the dlc for infinite?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"would you rank it top ten? i tried to play it for the first time this year too. xbox had the bundle on sale, got a few hours into the first one and it just wasn't doing it for me. maybe i'll try again, maybe there were just some other games i was more interested in at the time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"yeah man i agree. dozen, if not hundreds, of millions of people around the world are experiencing mass psychosis and are buying, playing, and complimenting games they don't actually like because.... nostalgia. including children. nostalgia. nostalgic children. yeah dude my 6 year old nephew is definitely nostalgic for mario kart and pokemon from playing them back in the 90s  why would you expose yourself as a weird coping console warrior like this in public lmao i can practically hear the coping and seething from your comment."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i'm on zelda subreddits and the bg3 and dos subreddits, and i don't think there's any statistically relevant correlation between bg3 love and zelda hate. besides, bg3 if anything made me appreciate zelda more. they're very simple, fun games."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,yes rehashing games is definitely better
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i have played a large amount of games from all sorts of publishers and nintendo games would still dominate my top 100, they just make good games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"people don't become die hards for a franchise for no reason. you know how nintendo got that fan base? by making great games in the first place, and keeping up that quality in an era where triple aaa garbage filled with micro transactions and pointless grinding is more and more prevalent."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,if they had a point to make it'd include a criticism of the game instead of criticisms of the fans.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"all i have to do is turn on my switch and look up my hours played. yeah i have crazy hours on rocket league, league of legends, csgo, warcraft and diablo too, im not discounting other games at all. nintendo games in my opinion are legit. i love them and can always just power on and play for hours on end. im not doing that to defend a company brother i dont have the time to play a game i dont enjoy playing, its not that hard really. also with nintendo prices im the first one to let others know when theyve dropped the ball mario party, tennis, strikers were all kinda meh."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,the unbiased take would be people are all welcome to their opinions. but we shouldn't take someone's opinion in good faith if they're not willing to do it for others.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"nintendo publisherdeveloper has a huge fanbase who will defend the company to the death and only play nintendo their games yeah dude, he really has a point. bro is onto nothing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,this whole comment is useless. here's this random scenerio i came up with and here is definitely how it would play out breath of the wild would still be a fantastic game without the zelda ip behind it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"this doesn't even make sense if you think about it for a second. the game sold 10 times more copies than previous zelda games. if being a zelda game is the main factor than it should've only sold a couple of million copies like the previous games. it doesn't explain why it sold that much better. also because it sold way more copies than previous zelda games, that means that this was probably the first zelda game for a lot of ppl. so there couldn't have been any nostalgia involved for those ppl."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"not everything is to everyone's tastes, of course many people will just not care about the types of games they make. but cultish? you're really just proving my point. their games are typically very good and extremely consistent, and the rabid following that people make fun of is quite simply people who are used to that and expect it from them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,it is very very far from it lol its not even the best 2d mario game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,thank you i am in the same boat i sunk alot of time into pokemon games and still do but apart from starting the series the redbluegreen games are just horrible games by todays standards and apart from nostalgia there is 0 reason to play them over any of the other mainline games dont even get me started on metriod man. the first metroid game is just not a good game. it was totally passable for the time lets be real. basically all the nes games are hot garbage but literally every other metroid game is far better like this is a best games of all time list. not a biggest impact at the time list but in the gaming subs on reddit there is such a ton of nostalgia drooling for the old pokemon games its insane. i recently saw a screenshot of gen 2not the remakes and people talked about how great and atmospheric it looks like ... cmon how can you be so delusional. gen2 is already really bad but hyping it for its looks is just ...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"generations behind in power and processing and they get no hate seriously? that's the goto meme about nintendo. if you're not seeing that, you're likely upset about something else."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,it's pretty much the same reason people keep up addictions well past the point they're enjoyable.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i'm saying it's not on these lists for its technicalgraphical merits or to stroke the nostalgia feels. it has plenty of quirks, features, and other minutiae which makes it so much worse than many games just like on a list of best scifi movies of all time, you might find 2001 towards the top of every time. but you also wouldn't have to try very hard to name a scifi movie that has a better story, better effects, and aligns more closely to a modern audience. but 2001 is there. why? it did so many things first. things we take for granted in modern cinematography. and frankly it's as simple as that. you get bonus points for really being the first to do something, moreover something that set the standard for almost every 3d game we play today."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,not the best zelda game and not the best open world 3d game of its time. mario 64 was just better.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"well pc gamers are a small minority of gamers, and zelda isnt a jrpg anyway."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,wouldnt say its necessarily much better overall since horizon does have quite a few flaws imo but the open world in horizon just feels so much better and botw is really bland and empty in comparison

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"puzzles are things you have to think about, push the block is not a puzzle. zelda games barely had anything that could be considered a puzzle before the water temple. alttp has nothing that could be considered a puzzle in it. the only thing that i can think of that is a puzzle from link's awakening is the maze at the end of the game which is less of a puzzle you have to think about and more so just a hard requirement to make you do the trade side quest."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,you literally picked one of the best years in gaming. that specific year would beat almost any other year in history. not exactly fair since the original argument was the 2000s as a whole. to say no game this year would be a contender in any year in the 2000s is genuinely a brain dead take. baldur's gate 3 is probably one of the best video games ever made. and that's not even a hot take. it would probably win game of the year in 2007 if it came out at that time. yes over all the games you listed. the 2000s has every year like this good or near this good. i grew up in the 2000s. it absolutely does not have every year as good as 2007. 2023 beats out multiple years in the 2000s.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,... you took the best year ever in gaming. that isn't really fair
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i also played fallout 3 recently and no, it's not even close to being better than any game release in the last 5 years. if fallout 3 released this year it wouldn't even crack top 15 games this year. let's not even count the last 5 years of games like rdr2, gowragnarok, returnal, elden ring, sekiro, ghost of tsushima, zelda botw  totk etc... that blow it out of the water."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"yeah, sl was absolute ass i think pretty much everyone agrees there. dragonflight has been pretty refreshing though, and i was unexpectedly encouraged by this year's blizzcon presentation. with metzen back, it really looks like they're putting in the effort to clean up the story and tie up a lot of loose ends."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"obviously it's lifestyle, but i'd wager the general population will align with this experience."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"yeah dude my 6 year old nephew is definitely nostalgic for mario kart and pokemon from playing them back in the 90s bro, i said that's why you like them. your nephew likes them because they're simplistic games that 6 year olds can play and feel good at. why would you expose yourself as a weird coping console warrior cause i'm not? i don't have a problem with nintendo. i have a problem with ranking a game so utterly basic it comes wrapped in a scarf with a pair of ugg boots and a coupon for a pumpkin spice latte from starbucks among the best of all time. i've got zero issues with ocarina of time at the top. it was absolutely a ground breaking game at the time. breath of the wild could have come out a decade earlier and it still wouldn't have been groundbreaking. the only interesting about it is that it's a relatively bug free experience. that's it. that's the only interesting thing about the entire fucking game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"because they're basic ass games that little kids can play. same reason you liked them when you were a little kid, they've just got updated graphics. the question isn't why does your kid like them. it's why do you."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,yeah this isn't like the market niche that apple controls. nintendo is out there competing at the same price and yet maintains this supposedly rabid fanbase for no apparent reason? without any other justification like oh the product costs 5x as much so of course the fan base defends it more vigilantly or only nintendo makes these kinds of games what you have is just the free market speaking.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"people don't become die hards for a franchise for no reason lmao yes they 100 do, all the time. nostalgia, peer pressure, how things get covered, the time in which someone played something, and a ton of other factors can make someone a diehard fan of a franchise. none of which have anything to do with the quality of the game. most of this list is nostalgia."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"people don't become die hards for a franchise for no reason. yeah, they do. there's people defending no man's sky to the hilt in every thread concerning any game getting patched."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,i'm confused as to what about that you think isn't answered by the massive increase in the number of people enjoying videogames year over year or by the massive marketing campaigns that target nostalgia and fomo via social media and regular videogame journalists popular and 2nd best game of all time aren't synonyms.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"to each their own, your opinion is just unpopular is all."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,yea its a running meme but its also something that people defend all the time. x nintendo game never had amazing graphics the games are still fun not everything needs to be super realistic etc. while there is some truth to this. its also a terrible excuse that still appeaers way too often
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"from my own experience sometimes the hype really gets to you and for some reason you decide to keep playing only to find out what others see in a particular game, until you finally realize that that moment won't ever happen. sometimes the sunkencost fallacy makes you keep playing till the end since you already got so far. alternatively, a game may have some good aspects or moments that you keep playing for, even if the cons outweigh the pros."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,different reasons why but thats not the point here
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-29,because sometimes things are just entertaining and good fun without ever being great or amazing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-30,so they are mkb feasts?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,if you want to do a thousand very basic puzzles called dungeons then botw is right up your alley. personally i found horizon's gameplay had way more depth to it. much more innovative enemy design. more diverse set of content and absolutely stunning designed world. botw felt barren and empty.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"the best way i can explain it is that playing botw and horizon at the same time recently btw, i come to games late is that there are mechanics in botw that weren't there in horizon and that i was a bit spoiled on. the oftmentioned you're genuinely free in botw, you can go anywhere mechanic is true to an extent. but i wanted to explore horizon more, and i wanted to see where its story went more."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-29,if you actually play both games it's a rather easy conclusion to come to. the combat system is way more complex and engaging. one has a very detailed and great story and the other not so much. horizons world is detailed and feels alive while botw is just void and barren. you travel for ages and see nothing. the graphics aren't even comparable. horizon is still one of the best looking games ever created. horizon did a great job with enemy design. really good variety with unique mechanics to each of them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-29,"it's from six years ago, but for me it shows a lot of why botw was game of the year. it was more interactive with it's environment than similar games that came out then."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"its not about expectation, its about the games sustenance. most games are split nearly 5050 between main story and side content. if a game takes 50 hours to 100, then 2030hours of that is main story and the rest is side content. botw is split 1090. its built around exploring and doing side stuff. thats what gives the game playability. it sustains itself with its collectibles. and a puzzle is a puzzle despite simplicity. the games are made for children, they shouldnt be difficult for a full grown adult."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,ah yes because the ability to wind bomb over many of the shrines in botw is what youd consider a puzzle.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,the forest temple is one of the best dungeons in the series wut
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"nah i understand loving it regardless, the sea exploration is fantastic. just depends on how much you value having challenging dungeons, which i do personally."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"with a space that has evolved as much as video games, you have to take the age of the game into account. like, if you're talking about greatest cars ever, you're probably gonna see a bunch of 60s models, even though a new toyota corolla is objectively superior in most ways."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"i've played oot like 3 times to completion, i got bored of red dead in like 20 minutes. oot for me is both the more influential game and a simply superior game today, in 2023."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"lol, whatever. i mean, like you can have the opinion. it's wrong. but i'm not going to convince you. x200b and for fucks sake, one great game does not make a year great you need at least 5 truly great games for a year to be considered great. bg3 is the only really good game this year. i don't think it's great. if it were great i wouldn't have gotten so bored with it. x200b because i'm still playing ut99 or..... fallout 3 or... mass effect 2.... or counter strike, or re4.... years and years and decades later. x200b no one will be playing any of these new games in 5 years... let alone 10, 15, 20. x200b i mean half life just had it's 25th anniversary and it's one of steams most played games lol. because it's great. it has a legacy. these modern games do not, and will not. x200b but cheers man. go play the bg3 if it's so great. don't waste your time with me. shit i know in 2007 i didn't have to convince anyone that cod4 was an all timer or than ut3 waas great or that bioshock was off the hook. everyone just kinda knew they were. we took it for granted. we didn't know how great we had it. but.... you now. casuals and mega corps ruin everything eventually gaming is just the latest, and coolest, thing they've ruined. x200b and i'm not saying that bg3 isn't good. it is good. i mean, the fact that it doesn't try to game the player and has actual engaging content, for 2023... that's a big deal."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i dont know. million hours played on a release weekend like recently with bg3 seems like people have enough time to play. but each on their own! if you have fun playing tetrisand who wouldnt? thats totaly fine.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"mine too! i was obsessed with that game and lost odyssey. omg, you just brought back a memory i didn't know i had when you said lost odyssey my buddies, and i loved that game till we found resident evil"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-29,"i think my issue is that you keep saying ground breaking. that's not the same as a game being good. botw didn't invent the open world game, it perfected it."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"i did that in dos2, and it burns you out, but i got over it because i didn't want to dislike my favorite game. going into bg3, it's really easy for me to loot highvalue enemies or chests, and ignore everything else. that being said, i still like dos2 more, if for no other reason than it has a smaller scope and it helped them make the game much more focused and refined. i could speedrun dos2 if i wanted. i would rather die than speedrun bg3."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"a lot of nintendo's continued success and the rabidness of the fan base is due to nostalgia. if another company came into the market and tried to make the same types of games without the benefit of these beloved franchises and characters, they would be absolutely eviscerated. that doesn't mean nintendo makes bad games, or that they are a bad company, but they are in a rather unique spot compared to most other game companies. they need to maintain their brand loyalty and they need to maintain the value of their franchises to succeed. if they started dumping out microtransaction filled garbage games, they would be done within decade."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,no man's sky started off atrocious but it's worked itself back into being a fantastic game? that's a pretty terrible example you're using.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"campaigns that target nostalgia you can't target nostalgia if someone never played a zelda game before, which was probably the case for many ppl considering how many copies botw sold.  popular and 2nd best game of all time aren't synonyms what does this have to do with anything? you said nobody would care."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i mean how good a game is goes beyond whether you personally enjoyed playing it or not i did enjoy alot of games when i was younger that i would not call very good games even if i had fun with them maybe my opinion is unpopular amongst the very small minority of people that voted on this list. which wouldnt surprise me at all because the average person who voted on this seems to be atleast 10 years older than me if we look at the games on here doesnt really mean anything. dont think there is any real argument that mario bros 3 is better than like ... mario wonder apart from i had more fun with it 25 years ago when i was 8yo

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,storyline was 10x better than botw
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-29,"just the fact that you talk about the world feeling more alive in horizon shows how much your opinion is purely subjective, as npcs in botw have objectively a shit ton more different routines and behaviors, that change depending on hour and weather, and interactivity and physics system that are on another level. between all the good and bad sides of both games for example the plot, that is weaker in zelda you chose the worst possibile comparison and still you said the clear loser in that aspect horizon is the better one, for you. so it's not easy at all to come to your conclusion. there's a reason if one is regarded as a masterpiece and the other is not even in the top 3 of 2017."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,i wouldn't consider either to be puzzle based dungeon crawler games. i don't know how you got me saying that from what i wrote.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"no, no you do not. people do take it into account yeah, but that's exactly what my argument is lol. stop taking it into account. when i ask what the greatest game of all time is i want to hear what the greatest game is, not the game that invented and evolved the most. i loved super mario 64 as a kid. i bought 3d all stars and have only played through the first level. it's outdated and just not as fun compared to today's standard. i personally wouldn't call that great. it was great for its time, but it's worse than games from the current time. greatest game of all time literally implies it needs to be better than games from the current time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"that's just preference. i dislike the gameplay of baldur's gate 3 and my favorite video game this year is tears of the kingdom, but there's no doubt in my mind that baldur's gate doesn't get game of the year. i prefer tears of the kingdom, but baldur's gate 3 is objectively the better game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,metacritic didn't even exist in 1998. its reviews from prior to 2001 were either done retrospectively most of them or taken from older publications that shared their data.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-29,"botw didn't invent the open world game, it perfected it. i was unaware empty world maps and identically themed dungeons which people raked skyrim over the coals for that don't even make ludonarrative sense were perfection. i can tell the weapon degradation system was perfection because of how many games have copied it since which is 0, cause it's trash. i was unaware that a completely forgettable narrative that rarely makes any sense at all and most of which is hidden behind the super perfect activity of... running all over the empty, lifeless map to stand still but excitingly! and watch a cutscene of something that happened earlier in the story... is open world gameplay and narrative perfection. but it's okay, they had the 4 boss dungeons that... were laughable and barely worth the effort to complete. perfection! or maybe you enjoyed the perfect inventory system that required you to... pick up random rocks and hope there was a seed underneath so you could turn it in to an npc who then, for absolutely no actual reason, would give you more inventory space. cause i know when someone gives me my favorite, apparently very easily found food, i sew them a couple extra pockets on their invisible backpack. the game design is actual trash. i hear some of the stuff under the hood is actually quite impressive because it needed to be in order to run on such an underpowered system, but the actual game design is laughably bad. any new ip from any other publisher that tried to release like that would end up ignored and forgotten within a week of release."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,a fantastic game this is the delusion and dogpiling i'm talking about. every single time. increasingly convinced the overwhelming majority of people defending the game have never played it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,what does this have to do with anything? you said nobody would care. it's literally listed as the 2nd best game of all time in the op and you're using it's popularity as proof that it's a great game. i don't get what you're confused about here. everybody knows what zelda is whether or not they've ever played a zelda game. it is a cultural touchstone for a large portion of the world. it's cool to like zelda. people like zelda because they've been told to like zelda.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,i mean how good a game is goes beyond whether you personally enjoyed playing it or not no it doesn't. video games are an artform. there is no objectively right or wrong when it comes to good. it's literally all subjective. i think elden ring is a bad game but everyone else would tell you otherwise. i'm not wrong and neither are they. maybe my opinion is unpopular amongst the very small minority of people that voted on this list. your opinion is unpopular against the majority of people who play video games. it's an extremely popular opinion that super mario bros 3 is one of the best video games ever made. doesnt really mean anything. dont think there is any real argument that mario bros 3 is better than like ... mario wonder apart from i had more fun with it 25 years ago when i was 8yo this is an extremely short sighted way of looking at things
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,because it was just about the fact that you can spend alot of time on something in this case botw and still do not like it as much in the end not sure whats so special about this tbh. people spend huge parts of their lives on lots of things and those are definitly not always their favourites. no matter what hobby

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"so you're saying the majority of the people who have spent hard earned money on the game and logged hundreds of hours on it have never played it? should i assume every single one of the 20k reviews on the steam page, as well as 850k people on the subreddit, are just bots?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,"it's literally listed as the 2nd best game of all time in the op and you're using it's popularity as proof that it's a great game. i don't get what you're confused about here. that isn't what i said. i said its success cannot be explained by simply being a zelda game, because it sold exceptionally well even for a zelda game. your argument was that nobody would care about this game if it weren't a zelda game. i never commented on whether or not it deserves the 2cnd place in the list.  everybody knows what zelda is whether or not they've ever played a zelda game. and pokemon and mario are even more popular than zelda, but their latests games sold less copies than botw. which also fits my argument that franchise popularity isn't the deciding factor why botw sold as well as it did."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-27,uhm yes it very much does there are also objective markers about other art forms. not everything is a stylistic choice. there a drawings that have alot of anatomic inaccuracies. there are books that have terrible writing. just because the person who did it isnt as good at their art form. that doesnt mean those pieces of art have 0 fans same is true for video games. and yes saying elden ring is a bad game is a horribly wrong and bad take. elden ring is in no way a bad game. you can say that you personally dont like which i would even agree with because i am not a fan of the type of combat and equipment system that all the souls like games have but that doesnt make it a bad game i think you are living too much in a bubble of older people when it comes to games i am 99 sure that a large majority of people who play games nowadays have never touched mario bros 3. even just other 2d mario titles are much more popular let alone any of the big multiplayer games care to explain why its short sighted? im pretty sure that you cant make a compelling argument on why mario bros 3 is supposedly a better game than mario wonder. yes you can talk about how good it was at the time but that is a totally different topic than best games of alm time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-11-26,"who considers zelda a puzzle game? most games in the series don't have puzzles. ocarina of time is the first game in the whole series to have anything that could even remotely be considered a puzzle in the water temple, and that's one out of the twelve dungeons in the game. push the block onto the switch is not a puzzle. reflect the light onto the face is not a puzzle. pulling a lever is not a puzzle. zelda 1, 2, link's awakening, and a link to the past don't have anything that could be considered puzzle like about their dungeon designs."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-04-11,i'm not talking about gamers. i'm talking about consolegame developers. it's true and obvious. you make minimal sense. sony having better exclusives will drive microsoft to make games other than halo and forza.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-04-11,exactly. now you're getting it. if we have no exclusives then we have no need of multiple consoles. if we don't have multiple consoles then we are stuck with one company who has no need to keep pushing our hobby forward.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-04-11,then there's be a monopoly controlling pricing and the price of everything would skyrocket. you need healthy competition in a market to maintain healthy growth and innovation. you do not want a single company running the show. this is simple business studies.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-04-11,"and are usually better than exclusives i know it's all subjective but a huge portion of my favorite games ever are sony exclusive. persona 3 and 5, jak 1 and 3, sly 2, infamous 2, kh2, ffx, we love katamari, okami, the last of us, uncharted 3, etc etc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-04-11,"you're telling me if sony and microsoft dropped their consoles, then there'd be a monopoly on pc gaming and the prices would skyrocket? that's bullshit, on top of that, you'd need a single company to be making games for it to be a monopoly."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-04-11,is it because your system of choice are playstations or you have access to all the systems yet your favorite games are mainly sony exclusives?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2017-04-11,"not at all! you seem to have misinterpreted the direction of the discussion. i was referring to the removal of exclusives on consoles, as per the previous discussions. if exclusives were removed and one company was to gain a monopolistic majority of consumers, they'd have free range on pricing and the ability to set the bar where they'd like. microsoft would, almost definately, avail of this opportunity if it were presented."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"150gb, jesus christ"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,but is the game going to be playable at launch.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"considering what a mess the first one was, this one will be interesting. the requirements seems too low lol"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-20,basically vram is important
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"honestly curious to see the reaction from the pc playerbase and, even more so, the tv show audience. last of us 2 is divisive to say the least. as for the requirements, as usual, a bit exaggerated. a ps4 game demanding a rx 7900 xt to be playable at 4k, c'mon now"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-20,phenomenal game. pc players don't listen to the whiny gamers about whatever the new thing the haters are complaining about today. the combat and stealth are improved 10 fold with a lot of environment specific animations and takedowns and weapons. both ellie and abby play very differently and it's a nice mix switching between them throughout the chapters. story gets really dark at moments. the semi open world for a couple areas was a nice change from the strict linear gameplay from the first game. plus abby is a muscle mommy who likes burritos
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-20,ill blow my pc up to play it on very high.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,150gb and people thought i was crazy for upgrading to a 1tb os drive with 4tb of pure game storage
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,this is a game i want to play again but i dont think my soul can take the trauma of the story a second time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-20,can't wait to play 4 free
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-20,so if i have a 4070 ti super playing on a 34 ultrawide am i considered in the high or very high?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,damn my 2070 wont even hit medium apparently.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"will a xeon kit run?  in morality, a sincere question"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,why is half of this image taken up by ellie instead of using the entire space for the spec list lmao
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"this is native of course, so 99 of ppl won't have these specs even apply to them. i guarantee you don't need a 4080 to play this game at 4k 60fps. i would bet 1000 dollars on it. i'm gonna get it on steam and run it for an 150 minutes with a 4070 ti super before returning it just because i'm curious now. still bet tho ."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,whyd it take 5 years again?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,reference rx 6800 aging fine!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,nice to see nixxes involved. how iron galaxy continues to get work is mindblowing to me.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,not as bad as i thought it'd be. here's hoping it releases in a better state than pt.1
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,does it have dunevo?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,i had no idea this was even coming. it's one thing that playstation intentionally waits 3 years to make pc ports but the way they basically don't do any marketing for them at all is weird.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,150 gb. fuckin hell. look like another big boi is about to join my long list of back log of games that i will probably not be finishing any time soon hahahaha.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,150gb is fucking insane
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,who cares about this hot garbage game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,kinda what you get for downloading garbage
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,150gb you could spend on something better
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,will it work on steam deck? that's what i need to know.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,150gb? lmao
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-20,any pc can run this unless it's on fire.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,ac shadows is the same. frame gen is a must for 99 of the people and it feels awful to play with it
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-20,no damn way the game is 150gb unless you're forced to download 4k assets you aren't even using.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-20,it's sad how 150 gb has kinda become the standard for most story driven games
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"imagine gta 6 size, probably 200 gigs lol"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"what's the problem with 150 gb? storage is quite cheap, and you don't need to have 20 aaa games installed at the same time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,those are some super high res textures and audio alright
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,unfortunately that's pretty standard nowadays.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,about the same space as stalker 2.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,pretty much.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,why in the world would this have downvotes? extremely valid review of the game lmao
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,cope
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"agreed. i blindly disliked it without ever playing it, now it's my 2nd favorite game ever. if you have the proper build to run the game, absolutely do. it's a better version of one of the best games of all time"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,i will agree the gameplay in 2 is better than 1 but thats not saying much. its still a pretty bad stealth game that turns into a cover shooter if you get spotted.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,doubles as a heater a really expensive heater.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,below is a list of people who actually thought you were crazy and not imaginary for the sake of your comment
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"neither, somewhere inbetween. no one includes 1440p ultrawide in these specification posts."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"if you have a 4070 ti super, you could play it in 4k 60 very high guaranteed unless it's a shitty port on release day. why? cause less than 1 of ppl are gonna play it on native resolution. they're gonna use dlss. you have 16gb of vram, and using dlss, you would be fine. 1440p uw will be very high if you use dlss which you will because everyone does lol. i have the same card with an i7k 14th gen, and i play all new games at 4k 60 at the bare minimum. most at 120. i just pick balanced or quality. i have had to pick performance on 1 ue5 game, but the framerate was fine on quality and balanced it just made my pc run warmer than i wanted and performance kept my gpu about 5 degrees cooler along with my cpu."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,why does the physical size of your monitor matter? what's the resolution?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,your rtx 2070 would do great if nixxes didn't drop the ball here. it's hilarious that a playstation 4 game has such requirements.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"last game ran ran on my 4th gen xeon  gtx 1060 6 gb at 1080p medium settings with 3040 fps with fsr, hopefully this one will do the same since requirements are pretty similar"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,game was done a while ago but held for the hbo release
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"it is bad considering that this is a playstation 4 game, and don't come to me with the it's remastered version bullshit, this shit is not a remaster, they literally only increased the resolution and settings a little bit and decided to call this a remaster."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,no
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"the game is coming out around the same time as season 2 of the tv show. very deliberately i imagine. they market the show, and the show will do most of the marketing the game for them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,because they already have enough hype behind them . spiderman 2 was so abruptly dropped too but it sold really well
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,my intel i3 8th gen with integrated graphics is sweating at the very thought of running this.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"really? because the first one was a complete cluster fuck of bugs and massive performance issues. even with a 4090 i was having ridiculous frame drops and ended up refunding it. apparently they made some improvement, but if this is anything like the first one i am highly suspicious of these requirements."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"it's likely a case of uncompressed textures. that stuff eats storage, but it allows the game to stream in assets really quickly from the ssd. you can just pull in the texture you need, when you need it. no time wasted decompressing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"eh if it's because of better textures, i'm willing to make that trade. storage is cheap. i'm a big fan of it being optional though, downloadable 4k texture packs and the like."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-20,150 gb is not normal
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,i just prefer smaller games. i made an exception for ark because it seemed so much bigger than anything else i'd played.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"this is easy to say for someone who has fast internet lol, the time it would take for me to download this game alone would probably be enough of a reason for me to skip it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,it is also pretty long for a linear single player game. my first playthrough on the hardest difficulty available from the start was 29 hours.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,because little fruitcakes cannot handle that somebody likes the game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,culture war same happened with the series.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,go check out the sub for the game and i apologize in advance on behalf of humanity.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,i'm trying to think of something more dumb than calling tlou2 a cover shooter but am drawing a blank.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,lol what? its the only game other than metal gear solid 5 that has a lot variety in its gameplay. you can cover shoot or use your weapons like the bombs and molotovs to flank and kill the enemy or use them as distractions to hide again. then theres the ai thats pretty good at what it does
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,that's been how i've been joking about my pcs since i started building them. winter is a bit chilly? time to run that benchmark!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,i tend to enjoy my games at the highest settings possible but if end up going with a 4k monitor hopefully ill still be able to play with high settings. i have mine paired with a 12th gen i7 with 64gb of ram so hopefully its a good port unlike the first one it had some issues
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,3440x1440p
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,they don't sell well though and that's been well documented. spiderman 2 only would've been an exception due to its unique brand recognition which doesn't appear the case as it supposedly sold way worse than the first game on pc.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,tlou 2 has some blue crystal smooth art and animations it's not being used for nothing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"for the type of game, yes it is what are you saying"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,it is for a cinematic 3040 hour modern game known for its amazing graphics fidelity
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"without going too much into my personal feelings on the game. the game is too long for what it is and isn't particularly well paced to put it politely. but it is a long, very very attractive game with some of the best audio and visual assets in gaming. the ps4 and ps5 games have pretty high storage capacity requirements also. it's not surprising that the pc version will have the best possible uncompressed assets."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,yeah it's nuts you can't express your satisfaction for a certain game on this site anymore without getting sodomized for it. people sent me reddit care messages basically reported me to reddit that i said i was going to hurt myself because i said i was going to buy and play assassin's creed shadows.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,how about getting rid of the department of education?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,i mean the 2nd game is considered worse than the 1st game plus the pc version has optimisation issues as well. i still think that they sell really well tho
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"this game definitely created some of the most visceral reactions ive ever had gaming, for better or worse. the audio visual fidelity and sheer technical achievement dialed those feelings up to 11."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,i actually wish it were longer funny enough. story felt too short for the side characters and i can't get enough of the amazing combat system naughtydog created

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,all mainly single player games. this is what xbox doesnt understand. you cannot force a multiplayer game to make money. placing your bets on only having live services is a losing mans game. make good games. establish franchises. then try to make a multiplayer experience from those games that people actually want.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i've always said the ps4 gen was the best simply for their exclusives. glad they're hitting pc and a whole new audience can enjoy them.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"bloodborne was fine. not even a top 5 souls game anymore, but a solid concept. god of war ill get to eventually i guess. the rest i have barely even heard of. im sure theyre fine but playstation isnt king because of anything that happened in the last three generations"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,someone help me find what's interesting about death stranding. i played it a lot and got so bored being postman.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"ghost of tsushima was robbed for goty, even after winning the popular vote"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i don't see days gone or rdr2 up there..
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,days gone?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"cool opinion. why do people look at exclusives and think they are just the best? you are being forced to buy an expensive piece of equipment, they produce for a loss, just to be able to play a game. 100 would prefer playing what games i want on whatever i want."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"death stranding was legit an f tier game. after the first 30 minutes of whoah what the heck is happening wears off, there is nothing redeemable"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,the exclusivity for consoles is so stupid.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,sick of all the lame unimaginative open world schlock
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,are these supposed to be the most memorable games on playstation or something? if so i would remove returnal thats a epically lack luster game and shouldnt be mixed with those other great games that have beautiful stories and great character progression. also i would add days gone to that list.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,3 of those games are good
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,never really heard of returnal other than their announcement.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,death stranding?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,bloodborne only one i really care about tbh
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,definitely forspoken or wolverine
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i need and i mean i neeeeeed a lollypop chainsaw remake.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,list needs days gone
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i don't care about exclusives. i only buy playstation and nintendo consoles for my inexistent digital library.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i have not beaten a single one of those games lol.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"my favorite exclusive is going to be from the short list that i got to play on a platform good enough to give me a flat 4k60 or 4k120. and tied to my steam account for that matter. the rest, i'll wait on sony's pcbased gamepass or emulators. definitely not hurting for games to play in the meantime."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,is anyone else bothered that these banners all have nearly identical designs?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,should just be gtav over and over
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,ghost of sushi nia was great
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,gravity rush keeps getting robbed.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,uncharted was the best
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,xbox the last 10 years absolute garbage
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,now do one for micro soft
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"meanwhile xbox has gamepass that gives instant access to hundreds of high quality titles, all for a very very cheap subscription price. idk how you can look at playstation with their 70 games and somehow think that's better than getting so many gamepass games essentially for free."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,absolute bangers
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,ive been out for the gaming loop for awhile but star wars bought me back. why would anyone buy a xbox? is it just halo?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"meanwhile xbox look, we have redfall."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i only see 1, maybe 2 good games here."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,this should have just had the last of us on it three times with their reliance on it lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,ragnarok was fucking boring as shit
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"several of these are not sony games unless you consider dragon quest xis to be a nintendo game, or even octopath travellers and tons of switch games published ww except japan by nintendo. and then those are not exclusives. it actually just feels like obnoxious astroturfing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"the fact horizon zero dawn is here, but not forbidden west is absolutely perfect! nothing to do with the recent controversy, just bad game lol edit this is just a joke for my own amusement because im still upset with how hfw turned out. no shade intended to anyone who enjoys the game!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,xbox will do exclusives reeeeeeee
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,yup. xbox has nothing. edit xbox fan boys extra salty today
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,there really is no comparison when it comes to exclusives in terms of quality and quantity. sure xbox has original halo and nintendo has its few but sony has so many games
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,get death stranding off of there and that's a solid list.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,ive only played 2 on that list. uncharted 4 was just way too long and ghost of tsushima should of been game of the year!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,all bangers! except for that one.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,would be kind of interesting to compare nintendo sony and microsoft big releases like this. its just that it seems like a lot of games but i see 10 years and i suddenly feel like thats not very many and not very frequently. but im honestly not sure.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,4 great games
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,just got a ps4 today and bought ps so ill be making my way through all the games here that are included that ive missed on xbox
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"i don't know why but i had almost all these games but barely touched them because they are on playstation. the ps5 user experience isn't very welcoming. as good as these games are, i just missed the xbox user experience everytime i booted the console. sold it to a coworker recently because it was mostly gathering dust for the past 2 years. having good games is not everything. the experience matters."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,now do xbox
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"ive been an xbox guy my whole life but will always say that ps5 has the better exclusives. spider man, got, and gowgowr are some of the best games ive ever played."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,got is the goat
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,microsoft crying in the corner.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,pclaystation
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"damn, it's crazy only 2 of these were good games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,two of these are good games. the rest are not.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,and here xbox can't put out anything even remotely on the same level. seems like something always goes wrong. and now the cma blocked the activisionblizzard acquisition. xbox seems to be fucking cursed at this point.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,only played god of war blood born and horizon the rest not worth the time
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,sub par at best
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i see this and i all i can think is how i got out of console land while it was good. only downhill after ps2. pc gamer 4 rife.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"honestly only had two 1010 games and they were both last of us games. close seconds were gowr, ghost of tsushima, horizonfw in no particular order."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"oh good, a list of games i've never played because i didn't pay for a console i don't need! i assume they're all good, might emulate them on pc and play with my bluetooth controller."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"bleh, no deathloop ? come on...."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,death stranding isnt a sony gameits on game pass pc returnal was mid at best and all horizon games are in weird limbo between shit and mid. the rest is actually good
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,death stranding was soooooooooo boring
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,what a boring list for mainstream gamers
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"2 games on this pic are interesting with exception of returnal, dont know it"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,all those games and only 4 good ones smh
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,what is returnal?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,510. all of them
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,only 6 of these are even any good.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,death stranding is a big laugh out loud. other than that definitely a solid line up.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"if i had to pick one, i'd pick up bloodborne but these games are all so damn underwhelming compared to ps1ps2 era. i don't think i'd waste my free time on any of these cheesy soulless cinematic experiences falsely marketed as games even if they released for free on my console of choice."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,too bad. these a great titles but there has been a massive amount of solid indie games that has had me bury more hours than these.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"how does death stranding make the cut ? you missed heavy rain, resistance, pain, little big planet, gt, forspoken, rachet, got."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"lots of really mediocre overrated games. i played hzd, spiderman, gow and days gone on pc and all were mediocre except days gone. uncharted is literal garbage and i have no clue how people like that trashy bmovie story interrupted by bad gamplay."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,returnable doesn't belong on this list. the game doesn't have a coherent story.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,death stranding on this list lmao!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,last of us and gow. the rest i could take or leave.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,all of these games suck except bloodborne.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,what wolverine game are you referring to?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,xbox had scalebound... oh wait.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,if there was ever a way to transfer games i would in a heartbeat. xbox has gotten so bad the last few years
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,why is returnal even on here it's a shitty demo of a game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,this is really sad. the state of playstation in terms of games is at its lowest. there are no iconic seireses anymore. only those nobody will remember in a couple of years and sequels of previously popular titles. and bloodborne.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,all the same thirdperson cinematic action adventure game with no a single multiplayer game. theyve been basically milking the same genre for a generation
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,ahh so this sub is just a playstation circle jerk now. nice
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,so basically mostly terrible?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"the only one i really enjoyed was bloodborne, i don't mind the others to much but they play more like set pieces or films than games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,bloodborne. what are the rest of these games? never heard of them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,honestly only good one was the last of us
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,and spider man is the only good game on this list. 10 years wasted.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,deleted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,9 years of masterpieces plus death stranding
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,infamous was good but the rest is pretty but shallow and mediocre.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"man, i wish ps would release a ps5 version of bloodbourne and a pc version. i'd even just settle for a 60fps version too ... but unfortunately, we are stuck with a 30fps version that is showing its age in comparison to other fromsoft games elden ring, demon souls etc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,what about dbfz
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,what i'd do for a new sly or jax game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"returnal was honestly such a surprise joy for me. the vibe the games marketing images presented was so interesting, but i barely knew anything about the game, and going in mostly blind, its stuck with me as one of the most fun and interesting games ive played in a long time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,lots of good memories and games yet to play!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,jnen hayainda yo! never forget virtua fighter

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i cant wait for the gow amazon show! the norse mythology storyline is pretty good and i bet liveaction kratos will be portrayed by a pretty good actor.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,exactly why i moved on to pc. i love my xbox but i'm tired of the disappointment.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,how can my answer be anything else but bloodborne? what a master piece! really hoping they can remaster for that sweet sweet 4k 60fps. d
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,what's returnal like? it's the only one there i don't own.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,how is returnal? is it spacehorror? action and fighting?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,ive had people tell me that consoles dont count as gaming. i guess theyre wrong.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,don't ask if they got any more good games in that 10 years what you see infront of you is it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,killzone and resistance need to be revived

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,so um... when they porting horizon forbidden west to pc?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i've waited so long for a sequel to second sons the infamous universe. i've lost hope.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,when i bought my ps4 in 2015 it came with the last of us but i have yet to play it. i played horizon dawn and got close to the ending but never finished it and i have the new one that came with the ps5 which i haven't played yet. bloodborne was free on ps plus but i didn't like it and couldn't pass the first level and quickly uninstalled haven't played any of the rest on the list
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,returnal doesnt belong in this list imo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,most of the games you listed aren't exclusives.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,just bangers
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"the best of playstation studios was during the ps2 and ps3 days. jak, sly, ratchet, uncharted 13, tlou, infamous where all big favorites of mine. nowadays ps studios just doesn't pull me in with their exclusives. exception being the insomniac games"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,some real bangers there. and infamous second son.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,they should release bloodborne for pc

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,ghosts and bloodborne are my favourite of all them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,only good games on here are the first 4 and maybe death stranding if we're being generous
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,oh how i wish sony will make another infamous game for the ps5 this time.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,infamous should definitely have another instalment
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,am i right in stating that death stranding has the most mixed reviews out of all of these? i want to play it but every review makes it seem like a walking simulator with a hardtofollow story.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,how is gran turismo not on here?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,now do the same for xbox... lol

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,you'll have to update the list and take sifu off. it isn't a playstation exclusive and you're missing some of the bangers others have stated.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"infamous and death stranding are really not that good especially death stranding, goddamn this game can be horrendous sometimes, but everything else is pretty good. sony yet again with the best new ip from the generation, horizon for the ps4, last of us for the ps3, etc.. sony, similar to nintendo, have that pedigree. xbox desperately needs to reach that level, the really popular triple a. halo and gears of war became zombies, forza is niched... i think psychonauts is at this level, sadly the game is not really popular"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,ghost of tsushima is the only one i actually finished and thats more of my interest in the time period then actual gameplay. the interactive movie experience of these sony exclusives just kills my enthusiasm. glad they did well but gameplay is not up my alley with the lack of variety and control.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"what about killzone? i will say, i always thought the games were solid and looked great even though the majority of the color scheme was dark"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,the 3rd and last one are really the only bad ones
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,give us more infamous god damn it!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,where is rift apart?!?!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"need another infamous game and remasters of them all, also spiderman 2 coming this year"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,why give the last of us so many rereleases and yet not infamous second son or blood borne
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,still waiting for a new infamous game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"haha very funny, infamous second son did come out nin wait it's been nine years?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,give me bloodborne and sushi boy on pc ffs!! all of these are bangers
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"fine i'll say it, second son wasn't very good. i want a genuine remake of infamous 1  2. especially 1 as it did not age well."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,can't say the same for xbox? i'm no console gamer though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"withh there be a got 2 coming within the next decade? i am willing to wait 10 years for a polished epic tale, i just want another fantastic game that feels as amazing as the original."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,would love to see second son come to the pc. same with more of the uncharted franchise or the older god of war games. would fit great along side devil may cry and the like.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,everybody's hone to the rapture?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,bro your just making a chart of the most realistic games
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,when the heck is the next infamous?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,"all these games are dogshit the games in the image specifically, not sure about the entire list."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,i really need a new infamous
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,"seriously, more infamous"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,"jeez i just realized i've only played uncharted, last of us, and returnal. not a fan of the rest. can't wait for sh2, though. silent hill is my favorite series, hands down."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-07,i've only played 2 of those. that's all i've had interest in. they were good though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-08,"just as i am about to purchase a xbox for the first time because of the superiority of gamepass vs ps prime, i see this and get more confused"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-08,i don't think it was the best game but i think i'd put days gone over death stranding
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-09,ghost of tsushima was the only one i had interest in playing. i played it i loved it!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"and resistance! a resistance 1 and 2 remake along the lines of the demons souls remake would be amazing. id accept 3, too."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i don't want a remaster i want a new game in the series.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,suckerpunch has killed infamous remastercontinuation iirc
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i'd love to see a remake and port of the infamous trilogy why not all three games, come on sony! also wouldn't mind getting the first three uncharted games on pc, the 4th is good, but... well where's the rest of the story? bloodborne as a port would be obvious, but sony hates money.. and i say this as someone who owns all those games on their platforms, but getting them on steam would be huge for both preservation and enjoyment."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i would settle for a 60fps mode
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,hell i'd like them to remaster all three infamous games. i played second son again for the first time in a while and it definitely is showing its age gameplay wise
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i found second son on the playstation hits section of the ps plus stuff and i decided to pick it up. i fucking love that game. i really wanna know what happened in the previous games, so yes please make that remake."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i'm just hoping for a dino crisis remake
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,no.... we need a legend of dragoon remake first bro.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i absolutely loved the first 2 infamous games. i haven't bought a new game in a couple years cause they're so expensive now but i would buy a remaster at full price day one of infamous
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i'm waiting for a legacy of kain amd a darkwatch remaster.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,you'll get a remake of the last of us part 2... and you will like it!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"as somebody who absolutely loves bloodborne i don't understand why people want a remaster at all. the graphics of bloodborne and dark souls 3 hold up just fine to where i don't think a remaster would be that noticeably different, and i never had technical issues with frames or anything. if they were going to do a total graphical update demon souls style i'd much rather dark souls 1 i know it got a remaster but the graphics are still pretty ass to get the update, hell as much as people shit on the game dark souls 2 has some of the most stunning scenery which would be absolutely glorious if it had the kind of treatment demon souls got."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,do we need more than 30 frames per second for bloodborne.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i mean.bloodborne and infamous dont belong in the same sentence. infamous is just an ok game. bloodborne is a masterpiece
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i wouldnt say everyone that doesnt include me
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i just want a remake or reboot of socom
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,honestly i think we're due for a bloodborne sequel.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,remake...remaster...sequel...i want the lot for infamous
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,man i really tried to like second son but it just felt like the powers lacked something and the end game power felt useless once you obtained it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"id personally prefer a bloodborne sequel tbh. i want new areas and new bosses and new enemies and new weapons and, of course, new drip from that world. its hands down one of my favorite games of all time. but a remakeremaster would still make me so happy. the game can be a slog to go back to with the 1080p 30fps limitations. but i still play it regularly."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i don't know why you'd want a remaster of an old game over a new game in the series.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,infamous was such a good series from my childhood.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i just want 60fps console unlock. keep everything else, ps5 can handle it"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,were also getting max payne 12 remakes
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,at this point i could see a bloodborne remake being a ps6 launch title.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,prototype was dope too.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,there's no need to remaster bloodborne.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"god that would be amazing, that black lightning from infamous 1 was the best villian protagonist vibe i ever got, somehow even more so than literally eating people in prototype"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i miss the infamous games so much. my favorite superpower has, is, and always will be electricity so those games enabled my ultimate power fantasy"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i would love a remake of resistance 1 2 also a little game called warhawk! my friends and i loved a night of resistance and warhawk!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i know they wont but i would love a 12 bundle. i never played with good karma so i would definitely go that route
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"if theres 1 franchise from sucker punch that truly needs a remasterreboot, then its sly. it seems like all gamers and the entirety of sucker punch have forgotten about this legendary franchise, but the streets havent."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,the only remake i want is dragon age origins so i can play in fucking denerim without having it crash every 2 steps.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i've been wanting an infamous games remaster for as long as i can remember, everytime i hear abt some game getting a remaster, especially for playstation i just think. i need infamous. the things i'd do for a remaster"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,infamous 1 was some of the most fun ive had with a video game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,bloodbourne 2 is what i really want. who needs a remakeremaster when i still have the game on last gen?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i'd like to see mag 2 or remake especially with all the bad shooters out there nowadays.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,and little big planet? please
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i'm just really hyped they're finally doing dragonball z budokai tenkaichi 4
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i wish they would do something with infamous, i have never heard another human outside of my house talk of this game until a couple days ago on here, glad to see that i'm not the only person who enjoyed electrocuting people."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,at least with infamous its a possibility unlike bloodborne. it makes 0 sense to me that we got a remake of the last of us which was already on ps4 but with infamous your stuck going back to the ps3 if you wanna play it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,give. me. metal. gear.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,long overdue
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,no joke. one of the most satisfying combat systems in gaming if you can master it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"it's one of those strange games where like 70 of people who played it are like this is one of the most incredible games i've ever played and then the other 30 are like this game is so over hyped idk what everyone else is talking about it was mid i think it just does 34 things incredibly well, so if those things are thing you happen to really value in video games, it's amazing, but if not you just don't see the appeal. personally, i have almost 300 hours in it and it's genuinely my favorite single player game in the last decade at least."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"beautiful game, super satisfying combat. which ending?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,man with sony releasing so many games on pc that's the one i'm most anticipating coming to pc hopefully soon. i really hope the disaster of the last of us launched didn't ruin the chance of that.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i really hope they release it on pc soon. i can't justify the money for a new console when i hardly play games anymore.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,12 way through. finally bought a ps5.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i really wanted to check it out but various reviews criticized it for repetitiveness. go here, liberate a village, go there, do something else, etc. repetitive in the same way as recent far cry games. did you feel that way at all or was it a pretty good experience the whole way?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,now try legends. i put like 70 of my whole got time in legends and i platinumed the campaign.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,too bad some bugs made it unplayable for me
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"poor gameplay imo. beautiful looking, but the combat is so bloody easy and repetitive. also the kuroswa mode is full on cringe, reduces kurosawa to black and white samurai action shots, nothing else."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i'm currently on my first playthrough. this may be the best game i've played in years.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"one of the only games i've ever finished and then went straight into ng. such a mesmerising, beautiful, flawless experience."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,auuuhhh i really want to play this game but im waiting for the pc release
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i agree to you. i got my first platin trophy in ghost of tsushima
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,literally just impulsepurchased it because of this comment. fucking loved the last of us remake.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"god, i loved this game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i am patiently waiting for it to be ported to pc
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i played and beat it when it was released, and i barely remember any of it now. i remember it becoming a bit of a slog in the 3rd region, though, but that's because i'm the type that has to visit every area and collect everything. by forgetting about it, i can replay it again, mostly like new though!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,beat it for the eighth time. what a stunning game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i think i'm going to replay this game on ng, on my ps5 in 4k, and entirely in the bw mode akira kurosawa. it was so much fun the first go around, and i can't wait to see it in 4k!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,its so fucking sad us pc players havent got a chance to play it yet
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,"so i just started horizon zero dawn with ghost of tsushima next on the list. i was expecting to dislike horizon given all the bad rep it seems to get, and then to move straight onto this. so far im actually really enjoying it so ghost will have to wait. but i am looking forward to it"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i do too, but that isn't a playstation exclusive series"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,activision has the ip hostage. for prototype 3 to happen microsoft would need to complete the acquisition
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i felt this.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"you know, i haven't seen people talk about second son. i've heard talk about the others, but for some reason ss just didn't have the same impact"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,same. word through the grapevine is we may be in luck.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,me too. loved all those games.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,knack 2 is actually a great game lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,a knackstapiece!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,at least people like you who know about the games other than me exist so there is still hope
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,do you need to play gravity rush 1 to follow 2?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"what i'd give for a third on ps5... gr, grr, and gr2 were all just an amazing time flying around, exploring, listening to the music. man i love those games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i honestly feel like the games have a lot of weaknesses but i love them anyway
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,yeah. i played through gr1 and gr2 right before the latter had its servers axed. one of the few times i used the ps4's community thingy to help people with dusty tokens. both were flawed but really charming and fun games. i've been holding off on a ps5 but if gr3 was somehow announced and a thing i'd go buy one today.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"the only game in this list that i actually want and hasn't come to pc, yet..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,the only word that needs to be said here
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,on pc already pls
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,theyre concentrating on killing halo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,redfall is just such an anemic game. sonys latest is god of war and nintendo is set to release tears of the kingdom. redfall does not look good with that competition.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"xbox has been fumbling the bag hard. halo infinite was super promising, but it didn't launch with enough and couldn't get the content flow needed to let it be a truly great."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"xbox isn't really about exclusives anymore, it's now a xbox and pc thing"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,deleted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,id actually argue that nintendo makes better exclusives all together
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,although not a complete exclusive ive comtemplated buying an xbox just to play hifi rush and high on life
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i really wish microsoft would make it harder for me to choose a console.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"exclusives are anti consumer, but thats what the people want apparently"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"come on man nintendo clearly puts out the best exclusives, it's not even close. playstation just beats xbox for exclusives."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"looking at it from a business perspective, the problem with xbox is that they dont have exclusives at all. there is no incentive for customers to buy an xbox console when they can play those same games on pc. if i can do that, then why would i want to sell my playstation console to buy an xbox? people dont like sonys approach to keeping games exclusive to their consoles, but thats how they managed to outsell xbox pretty much every generation. i built a pc to play crossplatform titles and bought a ps5 for the exclusives. there is no incentive to getting an xbox console cause i can play whatever they launch on pc anyways."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i can agree to an extent sony knows how to cater to its fans. they are objectively quality titles and they are killing it. my very personal problem comes from that i don't really enjoy 3rd person, largely linear story driven games which makes my interest in psx these days very low. i generally enjoy first person view and more open worlds. xbox seems to cater to this, tho i do wish they'd connect a little better on some of them. here's to hoping starfield lives up to my expectations!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"xbox studios are just smaller than playstation studios. sony has a lot of big studios like santa monica, guerrilla, insomnia, and naughty dog. each with 400600 employees each. xbox studios are often half the size as sony's with the only real competitor in terms of size being bethesda. additionally a lot of xbox studios aren't working on one project. arkane has 150 employees according to wikipedia, and those are split between two studios working on two games. obsidian has 200 employees and as of last year they had 4 ongoing projects grounded, pentiment, avowed, and outer worlds 2. xbox is lacking in those big development studios that sony has, which definitely explains why they wanted abk so bad. they've generally taken a hands off approach to managing their studios, but with the abk deal unlikely, they may start to crack the whip on studios, cut off side and passion projects, and make them march single file to develop singular bigger games, because that's what gamers are saying they want. or they might throw fat stacks at cdpr or something who knows."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,deleted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,xbox doesn't really have a good sell. gears and halo are very basic shooters. ori is a great platformer but it's also on switch. fable doesn't exist. bethesda hasn't released a functional good game in ages and are years away from elder scrolls or fallout. i wish my friends were in the ps5 ecosystem. they're the only reason i'm still stuck on xbox.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"microsoft is completely fumbling the ball, theyre dumping time money and energy into aquiring studios. they have no business aquiring studios when even their first party ip's are falling apart. also, i have a thoery that og xbox ones are ruining new releases cause microsoft is promising universal experience accross all its hardware. hopefully once microsoft realizes thats not feasible. we can actually get next gen games. maybe people on og xbox one could stream new games but it doesnt put out anything higher than 60fps and 1080p anyways."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,redfall slaps though s
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"well, at least they got redfall... oh. uh, starfield?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,forza horizon 5
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,forza horizon 5 is great!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"yeah! the only exclusive that xbox had other than halo that i wanted was medium, and thats on the ps5 now so..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,playstation puts out the best exclusives for sure. did i miss nintendo go bankrupt today?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,the largest multiplayer games probably makes more money than all these combined though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"microsoft understands it. theyre not dumb. they just dont care enough to adapt to it. instead, they are focusing efforts on expansion and acquisition rather than invest in their own brand to increase the quality of xbox titles. ive been an xb owner since the original and long for the days of an exciting console launch with a sizable library of new completely working games to push the hardware to its limit."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i mean technically death stranding in an online game..
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,isn't sony working on multiple online games?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,seems like playstation is playing all their bets on live service going forward. theyre touting what? 12 live service games in development already?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"you mean like fallout 76 and metal gear survive? maybe they should just make good games, whether they're multiplayer or not."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,returnal has some of the tightest most frustrating gameplay ive ever experienced. the game rocks though.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i'm playing it now and was going to comment that i was glad it was on this list. it's so much better than the attention it got. i'm getting my ass handed to me, but it's good at not feeling repetitive. every run is different."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,best example of a game starting you as low as dirt then by the mid to end game you are a freaking pro gamer with twitch skills and get mad at yourself for being hit once lol i love this game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"the roguelike aspects of it probably make it a niche game. i love the story, but with how punishing it is to fail, i finally gave up after reaching the last area of second chapter and dying to the boss. it took me a solid 3 days to beat the first chapter."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"if it wasn't a roguelike i think it would be incredible. having to replay a bunch of shit for hours to get back to where you died is just too much, especially with how little progression is made each run."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,it is yes very much so.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i did too though second son was on the short side and didn't offer much on the campaign side of things from what i remembered.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"sucker punch has created a pattern of creating iconic playstation franchises, taking them to a point of where they've done what they think is interesting or exciting with it, and then switching gears to something drastically new. first sly cooper, then infamous, and now ghost of tsushima which i feel is incredibly likely to have a sequel announced within the next year. and after one or two more games following the world of jin sakai, i wouldn't be surprised to see them move onto something completely different."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,our friend aloy is still on the list!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"no need to cry, friend. it's a phenomenal game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,its on the written list in the description. i could never miss it!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,it had a good concept. it just the heart wasn't there.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,sad aloy noises
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"there was a leak about two years ago where many stuff leaked turned out to be correct, ghost of tsushima on pc was part of the leak, so i guess its a matter of time before they confirm it, likely around the movies release"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i've recently tried the ps cloud streaming that has ghost of tsushima on it including many other games and it runs very well on pc with an internet connection of at least 25 mbps. if you want to play the game now and don't want to wait for the pc port, i can recommend getting the ps cloud streaming for a month or so. it's about 18"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"4? serious question, if you have a pc capable of playing modern games, why would you need an xbox? as i understand it, arent the xbox exclusives also playable on pc. forgive my ignorance if im wrong as im not really interested in any xbox exclusives so ive never been in a position to test that."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,buy a pc
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,just buy a playsdstation and youll get great games and multi plat games. then get a swtich for the family
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,pc can play xbox and switch games and most of the games on this list are already on pc or coming to it so yeah im not complaining
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"it is not a console war. none of these games are essential. stop sucking up propaganda marketing bullshit. they are just digital products for fucks sake, you people are embarrassing. downvote me all you want losers."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"nah, just a 'content creator', probably trying to get some people to follow him or something. whether that's better, i'll leave it up to you."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,wait are we supposed to put xbox games in a sony games list so they wont be upset?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,im starting to wonder. there have been a lot of antimicrosoft posts lately and a bunch of antinintendo posts before that.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"its one of my most favorite games of all time. i gotta tell you its different, it may not be for everyone, but if youre willing to try it and be open to it, youre gonna love it. it does so many things right"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"xbox and pc player here, we've barely got any good games that are xbox exclusive. sucks!"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"it's not only this, you also have to look at the global market. while the ps5 and xbox are neck and neck in the us, the ps5 outsells xbox probably close to 101 in japan and i'd guess they also sell more in a decent part of asia as well. they've got that brand loyalty thing going on i'm sure the state of the exclusives does play a pretty decent role as well, but i'm not sure that xbox having better exclusives would bring them up that much overseas."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,it's probably because their parents bought them a ps2 decades ago and just never saw the light.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i have an xbox, never really been interesting in playstation and these games dont change that. ragnarok looks good though, but i can just rewatch the vikings series or something for that kind of fix. i played bloodborne and loved it however, nothing else interests me. there are more than enough on my xbox to keep me bust for a lifetime. i know people will downvote me, but its fine. i get what the deal is on here with bias."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"the first two infamous games were great and i would give anything for a remake of them finally. second son wasn't bad, but it wasn't as memorable for me. never played the fourth one they dropped, and if they dropped any more i haven't heard of them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"yes, i just finished the game and it was such a great experience, the plot, the combat, all great.. the game is a bit difficult tho"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"imo its story and atmosphere are great but if you've ever played an actually good rogue like with loads of builds and variety in the combat and enemies then it will disappoint you. starting new runs should be exciting, an opportunity to try new things but it quickly becomes dull as theres little new to try or see."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"it's hard, so it doesn't have as broad of an appeal as some of the others. but it's definitely a great console exclusive."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,returnal is burned into my brain. amazing gameplay and amazing story.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,absolutely. it's really hard to put down.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,its fucking fantastic. one of my favorite games ever. extremely difficult but so tight gameplay wise and so well done that you power through and get better.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,yes. its an exceptionally great game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"yeah, i wish bb is in pc right now."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,that's because it literally is a mail delivery simulator
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"it's a aaa mail delivery simulator  management game with an amazing story and setting. if you are into those type of games it's the best thing since sliced bread, if you are not it's just boring as fuck. depends on the person, there are loads of people that love playing job simulators, i'm just not one of them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"i actually love it, literally currently playing it. but i can also 100 understand that this isnt for everyone lol."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"for me, death stranding was a fantastic exploration game. im always excited about what might be over the next hill. and then building the highway system and zip line system so backtracking is a breeze was uber satisfying."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,it was hands down game of its year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"i loved death stranding, its basically an interactive movie."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,my most hyped game alongside pragmata and final fantasy xvi! cant wait
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"it was literally goty and they made a movie about it, it was hardly unappreciated lol edit it also had a 93 metacritic score edit2 apologies overwatch won, which is bs but uc4 was nominated and amazing"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i mean the gamepass is great, i play a lot of games i normally would never risk paying full price for. but we do miss out on absolute gold when you see these lists. xbox exclusives pale in comparison. i sometimes borrow my brothers playstation just to play some of these they are that good."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,im. one of these ps3 mgs ppl with my first salary as an adult
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"its a storydriven action adventure roguelike game with cosmic horror and psychological horror vibes. the gameplay is challenging with no savingcheckpoints except for one mid game, so you die you repeat and the areas shuffle, so yeah its challenging and not for everyone. i had it on launch, played it for a while, hated it, left it for a month or so then came back and i grew to love it, finished it and platinumed it so for me, i recommend it, but it depends on how much youre familiar with the genre i wasnt. i didnt even know roguelike was a thing and went completely blind in the game, save for the announcement trailer and how much youre willing to toleratemaster it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,preach!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,even better

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i do, they're the best type"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,beacuse it pretty darn good i should think.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i would have thought gran turismo would be in here.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"the common thread between most shit ports is that they are current gen only, considering got is on last gen it should be fine"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"horizon's story and aloy aren't really what interested me about the game. i really enjoyed the worldbuilding and i thought the combat was pretty fun, even if the crafting system it was built off of was pretty mid. the robodinos definetly helped though"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"if that's what u got out of the game, then by all means, drop it. the story, concept and characters don't interest u prob already a turn off. it would be to most thinking all that was boring. was great imo, has typical ubisoftlike formula but the characters and robot apocalypse stuff got me excited. unique compared to other postapocalyptic or ai robot genre things, lol. plenty of games have crafting which is sometimes shoehorned into a game. makes sense in this. the open world rpg repetitive back and forth has likely existed in mostall games like this since the 1st ever, typical, tbh to be clear, some trends u see aren't nearly as bad as what we see right now ahem live service, battle pass, unfinished releases, post launch major patches.."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"how far did you get into the game? because the farther you go, the more challenging the enemies get and the more specified and intentional your combat builds need to become. the game has some of the most unique weapons and combat of any game ive ever played and it becomes so rewarding when you take down these massive leviathan robots through your cunning and strategizing. also the plot starts off pretty barebones at the beginning but it eventually becomes mind blowing, with some truly insane revelations about the world youre in that make this product quite impressive."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"same conclusion when i tried horizon, a terribly boring game that reminded me of the worst that ubisoft can produce"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,more of a fan of pixel art farming simulators?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,have you considered not unplugging your console while it's in sleep mode...?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"bro you literally proved why console exclusives work, you bought a system for three games, you did what they wanted you to do"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,as a pc using consolehater i've seen playstation fanboys shit on xbox fanboys for like a decade and completely defend console exclusives. so when microsoft bought bethesda it was so humorous to see all the ps kids start whining about it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"they clowned on xbox for bringing their games to pc, but when playstation does it they praise them. they clown on xbox for paid multiplayer access, when playstation does it it's praiseworthy even when they get hacked. they clown on xbox for supporting last gen hardware into this gen, but when playstation does it they don't say a word. they clown on xbox for the marketing term smart delivery, when sony charges 10 for the same nobody cares. it's honestly an integral part of that community to be a hypocrite at this point."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"exclusives really do suck. now i just don't play the games that don't come onto the pc. sucks for me, sucks for the studio trying to get their craft out there to gamers. at least there's more than enough to play. i got tired of buying consoles solely for a handful of games, only to let them collect dust afterwards, until a new generation comes out, so i can repeat the cycle again. i figured it was time to stop once the ps5 and x1x's came out. but funnily enough, i might actually have to thank scalpers for helping me out of this cycle, heh. though i think the exclusivity thing is slowly winding down a bit. even sony is putting more titles onto the pc, which i greatly appreciate."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"agree to some extent. when it's your own studio, fine, it makes sense that you don't want to spend resources developing for another platform. when it's a third party studio and you pay them specifically to not go to other consoles, that's shitty as fuck. like it was recently revealed sony did with ffxvi wish it was more widely frowned upon."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,ragnarok? its there. or are you talking about forbidden west? i prefer the original game tbh
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"yeah, the problem with xbox is that their game are on pc too and run better on ps5 when multi platform. they really need starfield to be incredible, but knowing bethesda i dont think it will save this generation for xbox, especially with it beeing on pc too."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"grab one, my friend. theres already a huge catalogue that youre going to enjoy, many of which is on playstation plus, if you dont wanna get them all full priced, theres also game trials and quite the amazing offers every now and then, and of course, a huge lineup ahead."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"honestly, im a playstation player since day one and i wanted to get an xbox series x to play fable, project mara, hellblade, starfield and the elder scrolls vi, but i thought id wait because back in the day, i got an xbox one to play quantum break and ryse, and ended up not playing much on it after that, everything was on ps4 for me. so in this generation, im just really hoping that they get it together and deliver superb experiences with those title. i cant wait for kojimas xbox project as much as im hyped for ds2"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,did you ...play bloodborne???
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,there are some good ones on the list but i kinda feel you. a lot of the 'big hitters' back on ps4 that garnered praise from critics and friends didn't click with me.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,opinions is a crazy concept
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"playstation has had much more input in aaa gaming than any other platform out there, and claiming that theyre all the same shows how little youve seen of those games to make such judgement. im curious to know based on what metric are god of war, ghost of tsushima, the last of us, returnal, nioh or final fantasy vii are in any way the same or similar to your average ubisoft game. is it the mere camera perspective? the fact that its action and adventure? both of those are quite broad umbrella descriptions for games with a wide variety of genre. if anything, its bloodborne that looks two generations behind and recycled gameplay from every souls game. also game development cycles take far more time and money than they did during the ps2 era and same for the price of each game, so dont be surprised if there arent as many games, as there used to be, but even then, no other publisher is putting out as much original game that are both successful critically and commercially like ps studios and the third party studios they collaborate with."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"this so much this. idk how anyone enjoys playstation because they regurgitate the same game over and over again. sure go ahead buy a ps5 if you enjoy playing different skins of uncharted forever. xbox has a ton of variety. forza, flight sim, hifi rush, aoe, halo, all different genres and wildly different experiences. i'll take xbox over generic sony any day."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"it definitely needed a little more depth, but i loved every bit of it still."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,bloodborne is surprising considering the fromsoft fanbase has been foaming at the mouth for a remake for years. i just wish we got a pc port for the base game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"the thing is this formula works in terms of selling 1020m copies for their big titles and it brings in people into the platform. besides, with gamepass on xbox, most xbox players feel far less incentivized to buy when they know a game is gonna end up on gamepass, eventually. that model doesnt work for sony given how much having the game on playstation benefits both hardware and software sales, not to mention pure full priced sales are needed to cover for the massive budget allocated for each game. nintendo for example relies on exclusives to sell their consoles, because theres literally nothing motivating people to buy their consoles beside their exclusives. microsoft has gamepass as a selling point, not much new aaa games but gamepass itself is a selling point and its shared with pccloud. playstation has their exclusives and their performance and ssd instant loading times to sell. you might see more playstation games going to pc, as they are now, especially the upcoming live service games, but to see them become multiplatform titles, i dont think so, since that would not defeat the purpose of their existence, but also affects development to focus on more than one platform to optimize for, which requires extra time and budget."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,lets be real here sony dont get nintendo and xbox games toodont start with games like minecraft that was acquired way later
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"horizon was 17, spiderman was 18"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,absolutely
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,you can if you dont ignore details that dont meet your narrative.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i prefer sony but gamepass is such a good value if you have varied tastes in video games. there have been a handful of games released day 1 that are super fun that i wished i still had a gamepass subscription.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,whats considered trash games is totally subjective. i have friends who think bloodborne sucks. they wrong as hell but thats opinions for ya lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,gamepass literally has exponentially more quality titles for no extra charge than sony has for their entire ps5 lineup. plus ps5 games cost 70. idk how anyone considers playstation a good deal.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"yeah, the last of us is exactly like death stranding and bloodborne and those are exact clones of nioh, horizon and returnal, oh and ratchet and clank? thats literally a reskin or gran turismo which in itself could very well be a clone of god of war. they literally reskinned the same game over and over and ironically, many of them sold 1020 million copies, and some 33 million. sounds like so many people couldnt tell them apart and confused them enough to buy them over and over"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,no multiplayer games cause i love them  pointless console
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"this wasnt a competition. these games were made by playstation studios or original ips funded by sony and made by third party devs that launched first and foremost on ps, and them going to pc doesnt really take away anything from them. on the contrary, they help bring more people into the playstation universe."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,what do you mean thats it?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"its still better than the endless halo, forza and gears game from microsoft, i hope they really wake up next generation, or they will fall even more behind."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"the post says playstation the last 10 years. it doesnt say the eternal exclusives of playstation. these games are either developed by playstation studios or in collaboration with third party studios where sony paid for and published them, and there by owns the ip. some of the games had permanent exclusivity and others have timed exclusivity. in either case, they remain a sony ip released for playstation first and foremost."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"its a sony ip and it sold 10 million copies and got 119 game of the year awards, along with hundreds of others in many categories, and a sequel is coming exclusively to ps5. of course i gotta include it"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,that why xbox is pushing gamepass they win by been your second choice with gamepass. not everyone want 4 consoles to play games so they pick two or even just one ms will win long term.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"its okay, we have bloodborne kart"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"death stranding is amazing. its not for everyone but its quite unique in terms of focusing on terrain and traversal being the main challenge. as for other games, it depends on what genre you like god of war 2018 and ragnark are amazing, returnal is challenging, in a similar way to demons souls, horizon zero dawn and forbidden west are fun open world games with a post apocalyptic scifi storyline. theres ffxvi coming in june, theres also uncharted, all of them are playable on ps4 and 5 so you can get uncharted nathan drake collection and legacy of thieves collection and you got the whole series so far"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,these are only exclusives for playstation
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,its an amazing game that i couldnt in good conscience recommend to anybody.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,then you are in for an amazing journey! haha
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"its there, 2nd image"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,someone has never heard of ps
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"eh, i wouldn't say hundreds of high quality games, barley a hundred imo. playstation also has ps plus, it's top tier being just 2 more than gamepass so not much more than gamepass. also xbox is starting to charge 70 for their games too."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"thankfully there are two different options for people to choose what suits them best. for me, i prefer those titles even though theyre expensive. i feel i get my moneys worth from them, and im happy that others have an option that suits them better."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"theyre all either first or third party exclusives. either sony owns the studio and developed the games inhouse or xdev, the sony studio that is responsible for collaborations with third party studios commissioned them and sony paid and published them and thereby owning the ip."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,the fact that horizon zero dawn is here and not forbidden west and god of war ragnark is here and not god of war 2018 and the last of us is here and not part ii or part i the remake is because i included each ip once and the rest is written beneath the post. maybe try to see people outside of the scope of the accusatory lenses.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,sony didnt buy these ips to make them exclusive like ms is trying to do to
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,lol psimps downvoting me.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,if uc4 is too long what games do you even play?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"thats well , if you get consoles for the ui, you do you."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,apart from the fact that most of those games are too old forspoken is both a bad game and not a sony game.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,nothings stopping them from investing in all the talented studios they bought
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,skillup gives a solid review of what returnal is and what to expect. its a good game. its personally in park for what i i thought control was in terms of quality of game. i thought control was a very solid game and just behind sekiro in goty
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"i feel like reddit tends to really sugar coat this game, actually. the gameplay is pretty smooth and fun, but the story is weak and the level and enemy designs arent that interesting in my opinion. id say its a solid 810 but i didnt really think anything about it was mind blowing like a lot of other people seem to."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"its a roguelike, so basically you start the game, you explore and fight, you die and repeat from the beginning and the areas get shuffled, you dont keep anything but a few upgrades for the randomized weapons you get. it has amazing action and challenge, beautiful world design and storywise, its ambiguous and mentally twisted, almost like a hybrid between silent hill and lovecraftian horror in terms of psychological horror"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,it's a thirdperson actionroguelite
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,its not a first or third party playstation exclusive
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i have put many hours in death stranding, the whole good aspect for f it really depends on the person playing. i found it to tickle my fancy as far as how the traversal is done. many will say it's bad but haven't got past the 2 hr mark. it doesn't really pick up until a little later and even then it can feel more tedious than it's worth to some people. i enjoy it for the satisfaction and i thought the story was interesting even though it's confusing as hell."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i wish they give us a new one, yes. perhaps after ghost of tsushima 2. i just hope they find a unique way to execute it, because as good as the three games were, there was something missing, not sure what it was, but sometimes it felt repetitive and thematically, it felt like it couldnt tell whether it wants to be dark and brutal or fun and lighthearted, especially the third game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"its an amazing game if youre willing to try a new type of gameplay. i loved the fact that it made traversal as the main challenge, instead of combat or bosses. it was a different genre of open world. i guess it depends on what youre into"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,the only games worth a damn on this list are bloodborne and death stranding. the nioh games are good too if you're into that sort of thing. pretty much everything else is bogstandard open world action game or third person shooter
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,thats not a playstation exclusive
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i dont get it either. its not my most favorite game or anything, but theres just so much love for it. the comments here are just one example of how loved it is, yet somehow sony never even updated its sales figures beyond the 2 million after a few months or so. no 60fps patch, no ps5 upgrade, no remaster, no remake or sequel. id say the game either didnt sell as well as they hoped or from software wants to make new ips for the time being."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,maybe even get the developers who made the demon souls remake to helm it
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i mean its a playstation studios game eh?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"probably because the last of us crossed the 10 million mark in a little over a year, with the remaster selling 1m copies in 24 hours and eventually the whole franchise sold 37m, if you subtract the 10m of tlou2 sales, the first game in its different versions youd see it sold about 27m copies. the game also launched on ps3, few months away from ps4 launch, so a remaster for such a hit was to be expected, and the graphics were already ahead of the generation. as for the remake, as unnecessary as it was to players, they had a tv show coming and the show pushed the sales od the remaster and the remake by 320 and 250 respectively. meanwhile, bloodbornes last officially confirmed sales number was 2m it surely got way higher now, but for some reason sony hasnt updated us yet and infamous second son sold 6m, which isnt bad, but also isnt as impressive as say the last of us or god of war. that said, i really do want remasters for infamous, and new games even"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,is it too much to ask for both?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,a new bloodborneremaster would be enough for me to buy a ps5. bloodborne and demons souls are the only two souls games i havent played because theyre locked to sony

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,man i would do anything for an infamous 12 remaster
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,all we know is that suckerpunch is not working on an infamous or sly title but sony owns suckerpunch so they could for example but bluepoint on that project if they wanted. still as much as i want it i can't deny the prospects don't look great.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"how? i've never heard about that, i wanna read on it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i wouldn't hate that either but i'm mostly excited on getting a library that moves forward. ps6 will almost certainly have bc for 5 and 4 and bc for 13 just seems to not be on the table so remasters for the best titles at high quality is a nice alternative. infamous 2nd sun can still be played on the modern gen but i have to dig out my ps3 if i want infamous 12.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,infamous 2 is generally considered the best of the 3 titles too. and infamous 1 blindsides almost everyone with its superbly excellent ending. they really do deserve an update.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"bloodborne is a masterpiece but that doesn't mean its without flaw. its glaring especially after elden ring. the artistic style is fantastic but the actual modeling and resolution are pretty dated and neither is its frame rate good. even creating a 11 replication that simply has higher quality textures, higher resolution, and 60fps would be an enormous improvement that the title 100 deserves. however i'd argue they should go farther. the character creator is genuinely awful. taking the system used in demon souls and implementing it here would massively improve the creation experience for people who want to make good looking characters without taking anything away from anyone. bloodborne lamps act as a 1 way travel point that only goes to the hunters dream this mechanic could be updated to reflect how the system works in later releases allowing for point to point travel and greatly simplify the tombstone system. they could even go so far as to add unique visceral animations for each weapon like they did in demon souls and improve the existing animations and effects like blood splattering to better reflect modern capabilities while remaining completely faithful to the original. there are many of these tiny quality of life changes they could make that would make the title really spectacular and they could port it to pc as well though ideally without all the performance and breaking issues recent ports have had. the reason why the other titles are off the table is because they aren't owned by sony. they would require other companies to get involved for a remakeremaster. not impossible but i think its less likely. sony seems to be pretty big on remakes."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i just want it in 60fps on pc
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,im sorry but as someone who just went thru the souls games its very jarring trying to play blood borne at 30fps. 60fps version is the least i want. yeah ds3 holds beautifully.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"when it came out, nothing else looked as good or played as fluid as infamous second son. it was a strong ps4 launch title. the dlc was also notable."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,syphon filter plz
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,mostly because i think getting a good sequel is unrealistic. i don't see from returning to bloodborne and i don't trust anyone else to do it right. the makers of infamous have straight up said they aren't working on one. a remakeremaster isn't actually hard if you put any effort into it and could be handled by many teams. bluepoint has proven they have the chops for it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,from is almost 100 not going to make bloodborne 2 and who besides them could really capture that magic? i certainly don't trust anyone else. a remasterremake can use original code and design and just enhance it no need for magic sauce. bloodborne 2 by anyone else would probably be a huge failuredisappointment.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"by the end you have all these awesome ghost moves, but i was having way too much fun just walking into an enemy area playing my storm flute and then fighting everyone head on while the storm rages. the combat is perfect. just a beautifully atmospheric, amazing, fun game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,if you play on lethal it gets even more intense. perfect parry or dodge followed by a one hit kill. on the flipside jin is dead after 3 hits. it's a ride on the razor blade.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"seriously, pretty much every melee combat system ive played since got has felt clunky as hell in comparison. i could see how sekiro might be better but it just never fully clicked for me, probably about time to try again lol."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i love the game because it delivered as stated and shown from day 1...

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i kinda wish i had just concentrated on the main quest instead of going after every little side quest, i quit the game half way due to the repetition. beautiful game though and the fighting system feels good."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i did every village and did every side quest and while the story was good, i got super burnt out right before the end of the game because every village was the same after awhile. imo it was a great game but i wish i didnt want to leave no stone unturned. if i were to do it again, i would just do villages that are on the way to my destination instead of all of them"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"it very much fits the ubisoft collectable grind set of having 29 different collectibles in addition to base clearing, etc. the presentation is phenomenal, but there is no denying that the gameplay does get stale after a while. luckily, the game tries a lot to keep you engaged by giving you so many different ninja tools that you can play 5 different bases with a different playstyle if you wanted."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i felt it was good the whole way. i think people who criticized it for repetitiveness didnt delve enough into side quests, explore technique points and the combat system, etc. its certainly a full game, with a massive map and lots to do. if youre finding yourself repeating a lot of the same steps in the main story, my advice is to step back and go do something else in the game, as theres really a lot of opportunities for what to do on your path."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"on the surface, it is a openworld crafting stealty sandboxy game like a lot of others, but it's polished to such a mirror shine you almost don't notice. it's an incredibly beautiful and engaging game, with more heart and soul than most than i've seen in the previous decade. while it can get a little repetitive if you play it for long stretches at a time, but naughty dog made a very strong effort to make each location feel at least somewhat unique, with little stories peppered here and there to give you episodes to focus on while you progress through the main story. there's enough to do to keep you interested without feeling overwhelmed. the way i've always described it is breath of the wild meets red dead redemption, with a side of assassin's creed, and directed by akira kurosawa. if you think you'd like that kind of game at all, you owe it to yourself to at least try. maybe see if a friend has a copy you can borrow so you can try it out?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i say its like a really good burger. its not really that unique and you can find others doing the same thing everywhere, but what it does do, it does better than most. i thought it was a good game. fun, but not the masterpiece i see people touting it as."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"because it has a lighter vibe which kinda kills one of the best points of infamous. it's mad fun to play and it's still so fucking stunning to look at, but people associate infamous with darker themes i think which made the game feel a bit too lighthearted. plus, i think the whole different powers is really cool visually but feels a bit flat when you realise that there is little difference still mad you don't have a concrete ultimate btw."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i liked the infamous series, but i always preferred prototype over it. from what i recall, the first game was fun but a lot of stuff was copypasted and enemies could hit you offmap  not to mention there were like 500 collectable and if you didn't follow a guide you'd be pinging constantly and it was a real bitch to find. i remember really hating that. the second game, you lose your powers to the big bad and the story is 'gaining new power to defeat him' but at the end of the game, you...had the same powers? or something lol second son i remember less of, so i guess it didn't leave as much of an impact. i cannot remember the story at all but it was fun and wasn't there a dlc with a purple chick or something?"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,nintendo re hashes ips and has succeeded on doing that for years. they release games that could very literally run on your phone fine and charge 6070 for them. i have a switch and buy the games that interest me but the comparison between console exclusives id put nintendo at the bottom.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,there's a few points where high on life is legitimately funny but i think i was entertained most by the fact that the developers and red letter media put an entire movie and commentary track in the game that you can sit in a theater and watch with them as they do the commentary mystery science theater 3000 style
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,with all the money and talent they got youd think there would be some temptation right? all im seeing is old ips and scuffed releases. i have a pc and im still more excited for ps drops.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"honestly when xbox release something interesting ill just get a steam deck, not buying another console for one or two games, but the steam deck has the extra novelty of being a handheld i pretty much exclusively play the switch in handheld, usually while my wife catches up on ps5 games"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i think you got the situation wrong on forcing sony to release exclusives to steam theyre releasing games that came out years ago and making money on it. games playstation owners have played and forgot about. games like god of war made people buy playstations and now theyre locked in but they didnt get everybody so let me let you play god of war on pc five years later just to announce the new gow coming out but hey its a ps exclusive so if you want to play it gonna need a playstation. what theyre doing is smart as hell because they know their products are worth it.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"grounded is a phenomenal game and, i think, was overlooked in the awards run. but it wasnt a hit, despite being maybe the best survival game ive ever played. hifi rush is a solid game too. all eyes were on redfall though and it definitely failed so yeah, theyve gotta nail starfield or theyre in big trouble."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,and it's still somehow amazing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,just the fact that it can take a game that long to be engaging can really kill a title for some people. i need at least a good piece of cheese by 2 hours in or i'll go find another mousetrap.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,redfall is 70  i used t defend gamepass but lack of exclusives is ridiculous. might as well junp to the fanstastic ps plus extra and buy the occasional ps exclusive.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"rfom is still one of the best shooters ive ever played, and had one of the most interesting stories ever in a shooter. never seen a series drop off so hard. hell, imo even resistance 2 was a big step down, and that one is still pretty universally liked."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"i'd argue yes. development teams have finite resources, so it seems to me that to target a release date as soon as possible, it's best to focus on one or the other. given that choice, i'd prefer something new."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i'd take quick and dirty ports at this point. infamous 1  2 at 60 fps 1080p for 20 smackers each on ps4pc and boom! wallets 40 lighter.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,as much as i absolutely love the infamous series what they did with ghost of tsushima was incredible and if suckerpunch wants to leave infamous behind to continue putting out new and interesting bangers im all for it. i love the remake era we are living in but id hate to see gaming get reduced to just tons of remakes a year with little to no new ips or even sequels.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"suckerpunch tweeted something a few months ago saying they weren't working on it but weren't closed off to it or a sequel, just not in current works as they were focused on 2 unnamed other projects. no idea how to pull it up but i remember reading it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"well said friend! bb is hands down my favorite game, but everything you mentioned would be a welcome improvement in my opinion. i personally think 60fps should be priority 1."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"fromsoft made the bonfires in ds2 go from point to point. in ds1, they were more limited with only select bonfires beign available, but its more flexible than bb. all lamps going just to the hunter's dream was a stylistic choice. that's not a mistake. maybe you don't like it, that's fine, but you're talking as though it was a mistake or that they didn't know better"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,its crazy you went on this tangent about its negatives but dont bring up the most unanimous problems the game has which is the blood vial farming and the inability to respec. they dont hurt the game overall but they are very annoying to deal with. i disagree with pretty much everything you said outside of the fps. the game is for sure a masterpiece and still the best game from software has made
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,im playing it now and this comment hits so hard haha thats basically how i play
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"yeah, i refused to use the dishonorable stealth tactics or cheap tricks. just straight sword fighting. always felt awesome to dispatch a huge group solely through regular combat. felt like a kurosawa flick."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,there you get the charm that has a chance to strike lightning incredible
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,"as someone who knows nothing whatsoever about ghost of tsushima, that first sentence is about the best recommendation for a game that i've ever read. sounds insane. if they port it to pc, i'll buy immediately. currently only have a switch and a steam deck."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"cannot recommend sekiro enough, you should absolutely give it another try. my god, when it does click for you, it is absolutely unreal i think im pretty good at games in general, but i have never gone from being so bad at the beginning of a game to being so good by the end as i have in sekiro. you cant really grind your stats to make it easier, you just have to learn the systems and it is so rewarding when you start mastering everything hope you give it another shot someday"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"because the core gameplay is so damn satisfying  you really feel like the ghost of tsushima. i was excited about every mongo encounter until the end. the fighting mechanics, animations, special skills, enemy telegraphing, etc are all spot on. when you die, you always know what you couldve done better."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"yeah that's kinda my point haha. it just depends your priorities. i agree that the witcher has a much more in depth open world, but it doesn't really matter to me because i just don't particularly enjoy the combat and core gameplay loop, and i'm not gonna sink that many hours in to a combat game where i don't enjoy the combat. got on the other hand has in my opinion the most fun melee combat i've ever played, so i don't mind some boring repetitive stuff in the open world because i literally have fun even just fighting some random patrol of enemies for the seven hundredth time. if that's not really a priority for you though i can totally understand being much less impressed."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,!personally i think sparing him is the most in character choice. youre no longer playing by the samurai rules so letting him live makes sense and is a big fuck you to the samurai. and hopefully some day he comes around to your thinking! !killing him makes sense out of a mercy type deal since the whole honor and code thing means a lot to him. so theres really not a wrong choice here.!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i also !killed shimura and i felt it was the kindest choice for him. at the end of the day he was still jin's uncle and father figure and he loved him. to shimura the samurai code was his entire life and he had grown too set in his ways. killing him in battle kept his honour he so desperately needed. it was a harder choice for jin personally, but it was a sacrifice i thought was appropriate. plus also if you don't kill him he just commits seppuku anyway.!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,well ok then
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,we dont gatekeep gaming here.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,yea maybe that's what i'll do on replay
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,yes but the difference is consoles dont matter
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"for real, there were so many possibilities for different powers to distinguish themselves, but they just didn't. i was really salty when the game launched but i've kinda come around on it since. it fell short, but suckerpunch was going through a lot of growing pains as a company, and was expected to put out a launch title for the ps4. infamous 2 was their first game with a focus on highly cinematic cutscenes, which they got help with from naughty dog. then second son comes out and has incredible mocap in both cutscenes and gameplay, two of the biggest voice actors in the industry in leading roles, and a very well realized seattle to explore. the gameplay suffered a bit, but i think they accomplished what they wanted to as a company, and the results show in ghost of tsushima, where the gameplay and presentation are both on point."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,what is it with this year and bad pc ports? seems like every major game coming out in the past year has had a terrible pc release.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"graphics are still fine in my opinion the dark and dream like atmosphere really lends itself to not to visually realistic graphics. though it could really, really use a fps patch like honest to god i be willing to pay 60 for it on pc if they just release it there with unbound fps and make it so that that frame rate doesn't ruin the gameplay."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,almost every playstation exclusive in this list is available on pc now.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"lmao. yes, it was a solid point that was made"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"ff xvi isn't actually a sony game though, they don't own square."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,being a bethesda game starfield is likely to get a lot of free passes from critics and players alike even if it's bad.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i play games to play. both have great exclusives, but nintendo's focus and general vibe are much closer to what i want out of the hobby. obviously that's just my opinion."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"i gotta be honest i think nintendo has it all. you look at mario or kirby or splatoon for a fun gameplay mechanics without much story. then at fire emblem or xenoblade for huge stories, and really complex gameplay mechanics. then maybe at zelda as a middle ground with straightforward gameplay in its puzzles and combat and a lot of lore. i would say that sony is likeminmaxing it. its why they have a companion tell you the answer to the puzzles and the story is roughly a dozen hours. i think they are trying to hit that goldilocks zone with every game rather than specializing specific games for specific things."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"well thats true, nintendo games hardly ever have immersive storytelling except for some jrpgs and the zelda titles, but thats the problem with modern games in my opinion  all the gameplay is the same and no one innovates on anything anymore and everything quite frankly feels bland. games used to be fun and exciting but nowadays theyre all the same with minor changes in gameplay and mechanics. this is basically the reasons i like nintendo and some indie devs compared to the others."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i mean, that's not hard nintendo's games have never had good stories."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,nintendo is great for children
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"my favorite game of all time and the only game that i play now is monster hunter and that series started out on playstation. games don't really need stories, they need a gameplay hook. and monster hunter has a gameplay that's crystallized around killing a single monster with a single weapon. and in general, these are the kinds of games that keep players going on for a long time. games like cs or dota have simple gameplay hooks and it's still going strong after 20 years iterating over the same formula. basketball is still the same game putting the ball in the basket, hundreds of times a game, every game. they are well loved by many and people watch several games a week every week for decades, accumulating 100s of thousands of viewed baskets in their entire life. these kind of games don't sell consoles like games like interactive movies do, but they are truer to the meaning of a game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,"you want games with diverse gameplay throughout many different genres? nintendo got you covered with great exclusives. you want 3rd person action adventures with pretty graphics and a good story? sony got you covered. xbox is only really good for multi platform and game pass. also its the cheapest entry into current gen games with the series s, if youre on a tight budget."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,im pretty sure even jim ryan said he wanted sony exclusives to be this cinematic blockbuster experience
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"that is why tlou worked so well as a show, the game was a somewhat interactive movie already so if you just remove what little control the player has you are left with a show."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"i'd argue that nintendo makes good mario games and good zelda games but those are pretty specific games. compared to god of war, horizon forbidden west, and spiderman, sony's exclusives are better."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"we can do that list for the switch 2017  botw and mario odyssey hard to choose just 1, 2018  smash ultimate, 2019  fire emblem three houses you could also say super mario maker 2, 2020  animal crossing, 2021  metroid dread remake of super mario 3d world also came out, but it's a remake, 2022  probably the weakest year at the top. i'd say xenoblade chronicles 3 or bayonetta 3, 2023  it's gonna be tears of the kingdom and pikmin 4!. lowest metascore i had to stoop to while compiling that list was 88 and i think anyone would agree that the breadth of game types at the top for nintendo is much wider than the third person action games that make up the entirety of sony's toptier output. you've got third person action games, 3d platformers, a 2d metroidvania, a life sim, a turnbased strategy rpg, a fighting game, and a jrpg."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"that dont make the games less fun. sony and xbox do remasters and remakes too all the time but sadly neither of them have a shroud of innovation left in them. if the leaks are true, tears of the kingdom will be the greatest open world game of all time, even bigger than botw and then some, all that running on a tablet hw. pretty embarrassing that games like that run on potato hardware and yet for example naughty dog struggles to make the last of us run in a decent state on top end machines, dont you think?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"yeah... that's kind of my point, halo is all they really had of a similar scale. for the majority of the past decade xbox has only really had one studio with a similar size to a playstation studio, and that's 343. even if halo didn't 'flop' as you put it, xbox still would have only really had halo while sony would have had the dozen or so games listed in the post. games don't come out of thin air. they're made by people. the reason sony has more premium games is because they invest more into large studios. even today xbox only really have bethesda and 343 that have a similar size to a playstation studio."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i feel that ms or at least this regime of stooges has adopted the business philosophy of trying to control the market and trends rather than adapt to it. no one wanted online only games.not back in 2013 and not now in 2023. its like ea telling the community that we no longer wanted single player games. then they release fallen order and its a hit. ea wanted to push live service and tell us what we wanted rather than listen to the community and deliver solid games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"that xbone always online thing was the reason i switched back to playstation after the original xbox and the 360. haven't owned an xbox in 10 years. i have two ps3s, four ps4s they are excellent media stations for nonsmart tvs and one ps5 though."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"fair enough, i see the utility in that. i do use steam streaming from my gaming pc to a tv in the living room for that purpose, but if youve got multiple people who game in the household, i see how that wouldnt work. as for the controller, im the exact opposite. i grew up with ps and just dont like the feel of the flipped dpad and left stick positions on xbox. to each his own, im sure if i gave it time id adjust, but with dualsense support on pc, i dont have to so why bother. anyway, thanks for giving a legitimate answer."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"xbox because not all games are cross progression and you just don't want to lose your shit. also, maybe you like the living room gaming scene. switch because first party games are only on thr switch. playstation because you want to play some grand tourismo or something. pc because for some reason some games just never make it to a console."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"plus, on my pc i can play games that aren't xbox exclusive for example stray, uncharted, god of war, etc. to me, it completely makes sense to have a pc as well as another console if you can afford it. i also have a switch but in honesty it only really gets used when i'm travelling which is a rarity."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i have both as well and i think the xbox ecosystem works great with both! im signed in no matter which platform i play on and love to play games on both. pc i can play some of my xbox games on and gamepass games as well and i can play most of the ps games i want on steam.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,100 agree with this. i came close to giving up on it and the only reason i didnt was because it was a kojima game and thought itd get better eventually. im glad i stuck it out and love the game but understand its a big ask and its not for everyone.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,"i think it's relative to the total game length. a game like cod is only 6 hours and has maybe 10 mins of intro. a game like death stranding or mgsv is like 60100 hours long and can have an 'intro' of 610 hours. death stranding specifically dedicates it's entire first area to teaching the player everything, and doesn't really even open up until a good 10 hours in for most people. depends on the genre as well. there's a lot of interconnected systems in kojima games, and they take their time to properly teach them to the player. also, japanese games just tend to have very long introductory sequences. whereas western developers are much more likely to do the whole 'in media res' intro in an attempt to grab the players attention so they don't leave the game they just paid 90 for in the first 5 mins."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"its a bethesda game, it will be extremely buggy and badly optimized at launch, and become a great game once pc modders get to grip with it, like skyrim. personally ill buy it on pc, since it will get mods to patch the bugs quicker."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,playstation plus sucks. it's not even competing against gamepass value.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i'm surprised you're being downvoted. there's only so many games anyone can play and there's a ton of stuff on  that's awesome. gamepass is better but  premium also has a lot of value in my opinion.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,oh my god yes. that honestly probably has a wider appeal than resistance. the killzone 3 multiplayer was elite
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,honestly i played the entire killzone franchise and i just dont quite get the draw. id like to sit down and play it again as im approaching my 30s and see if it hits differently. the last time i played it would be killzone 4 back in 13 and i just remember it being pseudo crisiscodblade runner.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,def resistance and killzone. especially now when they need more mp games. am i the only one who wishes for warhawk to return though?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i think the mass effect approach is better. release a remasterremake to draw in those who missed the original and generate excitement for the new title released a few years later. its hard to get excited for a title when its a sequel to a game that can't be played unless you have 17 year old hardware.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"they could do the remake to gauge interest in the project future projects, if ti does well release a new game using the same engine assets to reduce time cut corners for both the remake i.e. script and story and a new game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"sony's been doing a good job at hitting that mark so far, most titles at least have a performance 60 fps mode."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,so i genuinely forgot about the lack of respec since its not a feature i use anyways. i always plan my character to be perfect before i touch the controller so i never need to respec. but i do agree it would be a good addition to my list as a feature for people who don't want to replay the whole game to make tweaks. i disagree about vial farming though. its part of the games identity the same way grass was to demon souls. its only actually a nuisance if you are playing very poorly consistently and have absolutely zero motivation to look into any method at all of dealing with it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"inability to respec can easily be addressed, but blood vial farming is just integral to the identity of the game, as annoying as it is. its the cost of making a healing item that you can have maxed out inventory from the beginning of the game and can be acquired while exploring, while every dark souls and sekiro have the limited healing between check points."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i must be a fucking weirdo but i kind of like blood vial farming. i have diagnosed, legit ocd and something about trying to figure out the best places to farm vials, then optimizing a routemethod to kill everything along the way. its very satisfying to my weird compulsive lizard brain."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,that seems unlikely to change in a remaster
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,unanimous problems you are not using that word correctly.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i think blood vial and qs bullet farming does hurt the game. first thing i do is rush through blood starved beast to do the infinite blood echoes trick and just buy max vialsbullets. really makes the game so much more enjoyable.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"farming is fine. lots of games have it. the respec thing seems odd to worry about, the game is short and leveling happens quickly especially with echo farming so making a different character for each build isnt as big a deal. respeccing would be a cool option to have, but i disagree that it was any sort of major oversight."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"on top of the core gameplay being fun, which it is though felt like a slightly jankier sekiro, is the immersion. i was very rarely opening the menu, you can just sorta walk around and find everything. birds leading you somewhere, the wind guiding you on your actual objective, smoke rising in the distance, a mass of fireflies, the arch ways to shrines, everything you found you could do so with the environment. plus the little touches made the game for me, after a mission jin is catching a quick nap on his horse. the haiku and hot springs were also neat and immersive ways to add exposition, bamboo strike was just good fun."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i think nintendo builds a lot of their games like amusements. a fresh idea that's accessible and fun as soon as you pick up the controller. people don't care about mario rescuing peach but a lot of people talked about the cool shit you could do with cappy. if someone has only played breath of the wild once for 10 minutes messing around in the open world they probably still had a fun time for those 10 minutes.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"what planet are you living on? xenoblade, most of the fire emblem games, earthbound, golden sun, kid icarus, a lot of the zelda games have good stories, the pokmon mystery dungeon games, the list goes on. some are up to opinion, but youre on drugs if you think nintendos games have never had good stories. there are a plethora of things you could choose to criticize nintendo about that almost no one would argue with you about, from their assbackwards legal decisions, their consistently shit online implementation, their shitty attitude towards their fans, and id be 110 in agreement with you. their games are amazing though, for the most part. loathe as i am to admit it, because with how shitty they are otherwise i honestly hate them."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"okay i'm gonna rant a bit, but i promise it's not a console wars thing, i just really enjoy comparing great games. imo horizon isn't in the same tier as any of the games you've just listed, but that's probably just because i've already played too many games just like it, and i'm tired of them. don't get me wrong, it might be the best of those types of games i call them 'template' open worlds, but i have a hard time ranking it higher than an atier because it does very little to innovate in its genre. i couldn't finish it, because i've been playing games just like it for the last decade, and it didn't do enough to differentiate itself from them to really grab my attention. god of war, spiderman, i could see the argument for them being better, based on personal preferances. spiderman has the most inherantly fun movement of any game ever made imo, and the combat is damn good too, but that's pretty much all it offers. love the game, but there's not enough gameplay variety for me to consider it quite on the same level as botw or mario. god of war 12 have stier combat, voice acting, and visual designgraphics. and a top level story by videogame standards. but again, it's like the game is trying being the best of it's kind, instead of forging its own path. taking the sonynaughty dog 3rd person adventure template and creating a 1010 version of that. i don't really have anything bad to say about it, but up against botw or odyssey, not quite as innovative. although, the leviathan axe and drapnir spear come pretty close. on the other hand, botw and odyssey were fucking miracle games imo. along with elden ring, they're the only games i've ever played that i think totally raise the bar for everything else around them. mario odyssey has a new and unique gameplay idea introduced like every 510 minutes of gamplay, always fun, always polished, and never overused. plus, the movement is flawless. it just radiates fun, every second. kinda like spiderman, except the difference in gameplay variety is night and day. and botw's fusion of open world  sandbox elements, with puzzles that can be solved in multiple ways, cultivating the truest sense of freedom and enough emergent gameplay to rival immersive sims, was just incredible. it lacked in some areas compared to other open world games, and other zelda games even. but as for the open world itself  the way that everything is interactable, and everything interacts with everything else  no other game compares. it makes every other open world i've ever walked through feel like set dressing. a 3d painting, but nothing more. but in botw, the world itself is infused with gameplay. to me, that's really something special, and something that's never been done before on a game of that scale. overall if i had to rank them in order sss  botw, odyssey. s  gow, spiderman. low a  horizon. but fyi that sss tier is exclusive as hell, and perhaps the only other game i'd put there is elden ring."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"it depends on what you're looking for, they're not objectively better. horizon is a glorified ubisoft open world with an actually interesting world and combat, but the content inside the game and the open world itself are pretty bland. the same goes for spiderman actually, and i love that game. the traversal alone for me is worth it, but i'm also a massive spiderman fan. i can see it not appealing to someone not into the character, or even superhero games in general. with my tastes, including spiderman it probably takes the cake for me. but without it, mario odyssey i'd actually take over horizon and god of war. it's simply just fun, doesn't need tons of cutscenes or anything like that. one of my absolute best gaming experiences in forever. i was actually kinda disappointed in botw, but it's because it relies too heavily on players making their own fun. the sandbox is great and all, but i need some kind of objectives to keep me hooked, not just go out there and do stuff, idk."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"on top of 3d platformers and action adventure games, nintendo also makes good rpgs like fire emblem and xenoblade, good 2d games like metroid although the prime series was also well received, splatoon is a good shooter with lore that is deeper than people think. animal crossing is a popular life simulator. and thats not mentioning the racing, fighting and party games too."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"not to out myself but ive already been playing tears of the kingdom and i wanna hear your opinion when you get to play it but id lessen expectation on greatest of all time. playstation to pc ports are terrible, i know nothing of coding or what goes into it and why theyre consistently bad. but when you play them on playstation they run fine so i dont know how to be mad because i typically stay away from ports for a while till they get fixed."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"and yet the graphics in nintendo games have yet to distract me from the excellent games. art direction goes a long way, as does focusing on gameplay. i have a fancy pc, ps5, and switch, lots of pluses and minuses for all of them. nintendo's lack of realistic graphics barely qualifies as a minus in my experience."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"also visually speaking, nintendo is obviously lacking big time. both metroid titles released on switch are really, really good looking games. obviously they dont compare to recent aaa playstation releases. but what they accomplish on such gimped hardware is incredibly impressive. metroid prime remaster in particular looks like way more than the siwtch should be capable of and runs at a perfect 60 fps."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"i've never played a nintendo game with a good story. i wouldn't say that the zelda games have good stories, nor the pmd ones. the fire emblem games have okay stories, sometimes, but honestly they have significant pacing problems. three houses had fine dialogue, for instance, but the pacing of the plot was so slow. and pacing is a writing issue."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-04,i think a lot of people view final fantasy games as a pseudo sony ip due to the long standing exclusivity they had with square during the ps1ps2 era. edited for accuracy.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-06,i'm not saying nintendo games can't look good. art direction and visual style go a long ways. they'll just never look as good as games on modern hardware.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"then i can at least recommend the xenoblade series. the first one is a masterpiece and xc2 has numerous issues, but the story behind it is my favorite. the xc2 dlc, torna the golden country is one of the best pieces of media out there period, that by itself is in my top 3 games of all time. i havent finished xc3, but what ive played is also amazing. the rest, well have to agree to disagree because while i wouldnt put many of them in the top ten stories of all time, the ones ive played are good if not great. fire emblem sov is probably the best fe game from a story perspective, though ill admit i have a soft spot for fire emblem. it really is a shame that nintendo owns some of the best ips in the world, though. they make great games that are held back and handicapped by how out of touch and assbackwards they are."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"its actually geared more toward people who favor gameplay over stories. of course, nintendo has some great stories still, but sony and microsoft are more willing to sell games with absolutely boring andor broken gameplay under the guise that the story is good. only about 15 games a year even have a story worth mentioning, and a lot of those wouldnt stand up against the average narrative found in a new york times bestseller. it makes sense to focus on novel gameplay."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,"because the playing games is for kids crowd has been criticizing games, and especially nintendo games, for a long time. fun things can be fun for all ages. i'm 35 and the latest kirby game was dope. mario kart 8 is probably my favorite game of all time at this point. just because those games can be enjoyed by 5 year olds as much as by 35 year olds doesn't mean they're automatically for kids."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i feel this deeply. i was hesitant to use it at first because i love the boc and leviathan axe so much. i'm glad i leaned into it after a but. so much fun to use.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-05-05,i love the gameplay of rag but the story of the 2018 gow is so much more enjoyable for me. the sequel feels like it was too long and yet too short at the same time. not sure how to explain it properly but thats how i feel.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,it was a great game and i hated how some people shit on it because of a particular scene in the beginning. shit isnt black and white in life. especially something as complex as vengeance.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,the gameplay is really fun and the visuals and atmosphere were amazing but man the story just was so eye rolling the majority of the time. the first games story and its characters were likeable and enjoyable for the most part but for some reason in 2 it felt like that got left behind. almost every character was just so uninteresting it was hard to care when any of them died or were in danger. i wanted to really like the game as i did the first one but the only thing i came to enjoy was the gameplay.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"i take issue with some of the writing, but overall, very much liked the experience. tbh, if someone hates the story, they should still play it just for the absolutely amazing atmosphere in every single level. its really incredibly how nice it looks, dripping with detail everywhere. gameplay is a ton of fun. va is great. etc. got kind of an unfair wrap when it released because everyone was mad at the beginning, which is the wrong reason to critique the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,i recently played and beat it for the first time as well. maybe like a month ago at this point. i thought the story and the game as a whole was a masterpiece. i found it hard to move onto another game afterwards. luckily i also hadn't played god of war ragnarok either so that ended up being my transition. also a masterpiece imo.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,i enjoyed it a lot but it went on for far too long. i was forcing myself to play halfway through abby's arch. i think i lost interest around navigating through the hotel while fighting the cult with that cult arrow kid.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"did yall ever play the prequel, the first of us?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"i didnt like it because of how ellie and abbys life are literally copy pasted. people say they are two sides of the same coin. their lives are actually literally just one side of that coin. there isnt a difference. theres the same animal scene, the dead father scene, the love triangle, the pregnant person in that triangle. friends getting shot in the head right in front of their eyes. there are like 15 super key events that are identical. its just not believable to me. and then ellie is ruined in that last scene in california. that part is so damn random just for nothing to happen at the end."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,someone dmed me that inwas betraying joel and ellie when i mentioned that abbys quest for revenge was just as warranted as ellies. its nuts
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"most of the criticisms ive seen are more to do with the anticlimactic and poorly written ending. ellie kills hundreds of people to get to abby, only to chicken out and let her live. it just feels like druckmann and gross were insisting that there needed to be a 3rd game after an already unnecessary sequel. plus i just could not bring myself to like abby or any of her friends, so the whole story falls apart. every single one of them is a horrible person."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,do u have reasons for disliking the characters? is it because none of them are stereotypical good or bad people? jesse is the only one that i can think of that is the clear good guy but im sure if the story was about him it would have eventually shown him doing something morally dubious. thats the reality of who survives in the apocalypse.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"tlou part ii is the story of ellie, a story of revenge and the stories of revenges are made of blood, a found this quote on google by marcus aurelius.  the best revenge is not to be like your enemy. i think it that represents the main theme of tlou part ii but ellie was looking for revenge like abby in the first phases of the game but at the end ellie spare abby..."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-21,"the pacing definitely struggled in part ii compared to the first, and some of that was by design to really hammer home that oppressive nature of revenge. narratively it made sense, but i don't know that a game was the best mechanism to tell that story not that there was another option. i've probably gone back and played part i three or four times but i can't bring myself to go back into part ii."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"partially agree, but that part deepen the abby's character, she tried to be helpful but but she lost almost everything in the flashback"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"theae are extremely superficial similarities. ellie has a pregnant partner, not a pregnant friend. she has nothing going on similar to abby's messy relationship with owen which is a huge part of her story and character. she also doesn't have any force in her life similar to the wlf or isaac, another massive part of abby's story. abby isn't looking to settle down like ellie is. they're totally different people with some similar characteristics and elements. if you think what happened at the end was nothing then you weren't paying attention. you don't have to like it, but just dismissing it as nothing because it wasn't the outcome you wanted is disingenuous."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"abby isn't a character who the players can like but i saw several parallelism in the story between ellie and abby but also some differences, she isn't a bad woman but the tlou's world is a horrrible world . agree about the other characters but they are secondary characters so it isn't their story but a vengeance story..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"i mean like i said they were just uninteresting people. i don't really care about stereotypical good or bad people. almost everyone in abby's group just felt boring. even ellie who was my favorite character in the original just felt like her charm was gone at a certain point. compared to the first game with characters like tess and even sarah you felt a connection with them and the story they had and watching them die felt powerful and meaningful. swap over to 2 and that's lost on half the characters. characters in my opinion were dying before i even had the chance to care about who they were. it isn't a horrible game and if you liked it that's great, for me it just didn't land that way which sucks."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"hey i like some of those too, particularly bioshock and kingdom hearts. i also like tlou2s story. especially the flashbacks that gave insight into what happened between the end of the first game and the beginning of the second game. those were the most gripping in my utterly moronic opinion."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,i liked that game too!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"sometimes characters make bad decisions because they have flaws. they don't act like logic robots and that's what makes tlou great. it's not random at all. ellie still has ptsd from what happened to joel. abby had her life in the palm of her hand twice. ellie is scared. to her, abby is always out there, poised to take everything from her just like she did before. that was the subtext of the farm sequence with dina. it wasn't even about anger anymore. it was fear, but she realized in the last moment that even if she killed abby she would still be ruled by fear because someone might come for her in revenge. that's why her flashback at the end was of joel at peace. even after everything he'd done, he lived his last years for someone else and would want the same for her. it's not about the people she already killed. ellie isn't gonna become a pacifist or even never kill people again if she feels like she has to. it's about killing this person in this moment for this reason. edit also, i'm not trying to be condescending, but i would really manage your expectations about the show changing the ending. everything about the sequence of events is intentional and works because of the order. ellie sacrificing her happy life is part of why killing abby at the end is so pointless. i doubt they are gonna make the changes you want."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"honestly youre a real prick for even saying that, especially when majority of gamers agree that tlou 2 didnt have a good story. you want some real stories huh? disco elysium, mass effect, yakuza 0, talos principle, a plague tale, and even tlou1. its depressing that yall will die on this hill for a game made by one of the biggest ego's in gaming. the gameplay was fantastic personally but sorry, it just wasnt well written and im going to hold that opinion til i die."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"well you blocked them so they cant give you the real argument, but ill do it on their behalf. the entire point of the story is about the futility of revenge and how ellie has lost basically everything that matters to her in the pursuit of it, and in flipping the narrative midway through it holds a mirror up to our own desire for revenge as a player. by the time ellie gets to abby in that final scene, if the storys message of how revenge isnt worth it has connected with you, you shouldnt want ellie to kill abby. it wont achieve anything, it wont bring her or you happiness. youre meant to have moved past the simplistic emotion of i just wanna kill her because she killed joel. if you think the problem is you and ellie didnt they the revenge you wanted in the end, then the games story just hasnt got to you, and thats fine. its not a problem with the story, it just means its a story that youre unable to connect and empathise with."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"i see where youre coming from. i just dont think that is made clear. that gives me destiny 2 vibes where the audience is the one creating the engaging story and living together the depth rather than the artist. but i dont think they are going to change the ending, i think they are going to change the structure. im 100 confident they will not be killing joel in episode 1 or 2. it wouldnt make sense for audience retention specifically because pedro is the largest draw to the series. but i think structure wise. making us sympathize with abby prior to the incident makes infinitely more sense than spending 20hours with the gold of killing her then trying to flip the script. its not a good decision making someone the villain for 50 of the game then trying to make us like her all of a sudden. idk if you played kingdom hearts 3. but that story was bad for a bunch of reasons. but how all of a sudden at the end it tries to paint the main villain for all games as a good guy makes everything fall on its face even harder. tlou2 has this symptom but not as clearly asinine as kh did."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,i don't think it's the best written story but it is far from trash. where are u getting this data that most people agree it wasn't a good story? cuz watching videos about people complaining about the game is not empirical evidence. the only game i have played that u listed was mass effect. that game had plenty of bad writing but i give it a break because its from 2007 and it's an rpg with tons of dialog. it's depressing that people will hate a story because they don't agree with the character's choices.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"firstly, i didnt block anyone. theyre free to respond, they just chose to lie because they had no argument. second, nothing you said is news to me, nor does it refute what i said. i fully understand the story and message they were trying to tell. it just wasnt written well."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"sigh, whatever man i just dont care enough to explain anymore. we could both talk circles around this all day so im just going to agree to disagree."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"what can i say  every time someone tries to criticise this game, all they say is some vague shit about it not being written well without actually making a real argument."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-03-19,"that snark might work if i hadnt already made an argument before. youre choosing to pretend like i didnt because youre dishonest. but fine. you want more? here you go its subtle as a hammer. nothing about the story is written with proper nuance or grace. the entire time theyre beating the player over the head with revenge bad like a grade school kid who just heard this concept for the first time. a good example is how they treat dogs while playing as abby vs ellie. abby is constantly petting dogs, trying to make her look like a good person. while most of ellies interactions with dogs is killing them during combat, making her look like the bad guy. most people like dogs, so this is a really hamfisted way of trying to emotionally manipulate players into liking abby over ellie. which might work better if abby and all of her friends werent total pieces of shit who backstab eachother. theres also the weird decision to try and ask us to like abby after watching her kill joel, rather than letting us get to know her before she does that. retroactively asking us to care about the killer of our favorite character is a strange choice that just did not land with a lot of people. i could go on and on with examples of how this game is poorly written, but we both know youll ignore them, and i doubt youre even reading this far into my comment before replying."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"gonna be controversial spoilers should be a given. out of my 200 hours that i dumped into starfield the ending, and slow realization that i was becoming basically the hunter, was pretty fucking well done. that and the feeling of being able to start new after entering the unity and getting better and better armor or power like the hunter wanted started off as me just wanting the best gear. and then about 6 speed runs through the unity later, i kinda was just like whats the point? all im doing is starting new for some more powerful armo ohhhhhhhhh shit. im the hunter now. some people it probably clicked quicker. but i went through that initial playthrough, getting real cool with barrett, and watching the hunter kill him honestly gave me the most emotion out of a bethesda game ever. and i was dead set on fuck this hunter dude. so then his slow reveal, and the pilgrim, and finding everything out was all pretty fucking cool, and then realizing that i kinda fell into the same pattern without the game explicitly saying it to me was also rad. starfield in my opinion gets a lot of hate for no reason. i think it was vastly misunderstood as bethesda fans were expecting another standard bgs rpg, and space sim fans wanted a space sim and its neither of those things, landing somewhat in a awkward middle ground. but if you really invest into your playthrough, i found it to be the best story bgs has put out. i didnt care for skyrim, fallout 3 had a okay story but good side quests, fallout 4 story and side quests were shit. new vegas was obsidian. oblivion and morrowind i never played. starfield easily takes the best story."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"one of my alltime favorite trailers is lego luke and vader fighting and vader chops off luke's hand. luke plugs it back in. vader chops it off again, luke plugs it back in. after a couple more repetitions, luke loses his balance and falls in. vader looks around for a moment and then tosses the hand after him with a sheepish grunt."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"never played the first two bioshocks but played infinite, and i've never had a game make me set the controller down to try to suppress tears. never had a game hit me with such a sincere feeling of loss."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"theres no way to play this now, right?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"what bothered me about this game was that it literally forces you to make a specific choice you know the one and then spends the rest of the game berating you for making it. all men are monsters, etc.. no mf you made me do this or i couldn't continue the game. there was no choice."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,there it is!

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"the mass effect trilogy was amazing first game had clunky gameplay, seeing as it was an old game, but it was an amazing intro into the mass effect universe second game, as a lot of other people say, is by far the best game for story and gameplay, and it definitely fleshed out some missing links in the first game the third game, while it got some shit for doing some things different, i quite enjoyed it. sure, it wasn't a satisfying ending to the trilogy, depending on what you chose, but it was quite fun to play."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,when you go through all of the effort to stop sovereign just for the bombshell of he was just one of thousands was the real moment for me.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,also in 3 when youre talking to the kid at the end. that shit blew my mind. i played it years after release when the ending got fixed so to speak. i understood the criticisms but personally loved it

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,i even said out loud 'don't make me do this'... that ending sure came from an unexpected angle
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"absolutely. so fucking good. my friend and i just sat in silence and shock for that very last part of the game. very few words were exchanged, what an unforgettable experience."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,i played it with my husband and the last chapter was a rollercoaster of emotions. one of my favorite games 3
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"yep, wasnt particularly impressed with the gameplay but the ending was definitely something."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,i'm assuming they pulled a heat?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"that was so dumb. the cop did so many illegal and illogical things, it was just bad story telling"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,i was nearly done with the game when i saw a youtube video titled something like what happens in fallen order if you try to fight ! darth vader ! at the end this wasn't even long after release. i was so annoyed.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,that entire event gave me goosebumps. im not sure wed ever seen darth vader express his power in such a way.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,really good twist in jedi survivor as well

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,youre 100 on the money. in my head i knew what the story was going to be and all the audio logs were fun and all but you kinda knew how all that was going to pan out. until it did not pan out the way you thought it was going to be. in that scene the story went from generic postapocalyptic scifi to something special and new and exciting
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,agreed. watching those scenes play out and discovering the true fate of humanity was a truly unique experience for me. i was on the edge of my seat every time you learned more about the past. fantastic game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i'm sure you've heard the rumors. that zero dawn is a topsecret superweapons program. the technological miracle that will save us from the faro plague  if operation enduring victory can hold off the robots long enough. the reason i'm sure you've heard the rumors is that i'm the one who spread them. and they are all lies. zero dawn is not a superweapons program, and it will not save us. legit had me leaning forward in my seat wide eyed just hanging on every word. one of the most memorable moments in any game i've ever played. then they had the audacity to follow it up with sobeck's the good news reveal and absolutely blew my mind."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,"its honestly the most realistic doomsday scenario to me. horizon is not a scary game, but the concept of the faro plague scared me. i could totally believe that the world would end because some fuck head like ted faro was so desperate to make the next best innovation he doesn't stop to think how bad it could fuck up, if he does fuck up... ...and by the time he does realise what he has done, its far too late."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,i like how simon gets explained to him what happens over and over again. he even experiences it himself. but he's still surprised at the end
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"this ending was wild. the game literally tells you, like, 4 separate times how the process of snapshots works. it explicitly tells you what is going to happen, you just dont know how, and the juxtaposition of expectations makes you think naw, aint no way. then it actually happens, and youre just like what the actual fuck? the writing in this game blows my mind. ive always wanted to write a story with such powerful meaning, but this one is so intelligently constructed it actually intimidates me to write my own stories. it doesnt hide anything from you, nor does it offend you. it tells you what is going to happen, your natural existential denial basically opposes what reality is, just like the protagonist. its honestly genius."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"everything about outer wilds, really. for anyone reading, i know a lot of people like to treat their favorite game as some sort of sacred experience and tell you to go in completely blind or youll ruin it and theyre usually being a little dramatic. this is not one of those times. this game is an otherworldly, beautiful experience that only works at its fullest without spoilers or knowledge going in."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,it's really incredible how just a small moment reshapes so much of your understanding

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"it honestly blows my mind that a game as aggressively nonlinear as outer wilds even has a plot twist, but yeah, that moment is devastating and completely recontextualizes everything else in the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,man by the time i got to that fight i was so over it and just wanted the game to end already. so when the camera turned on all i saw was a pissed off cubby women in the clouds. never love hated a game more in my life.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i think it was kinda cool that the way to progress that game near the end was to not recharge the crystals. this is just moments before your character learns that the fey is evil, but theres a lot of suspicious evidence that makes you wonder certain things. i just remember sitting there thinking what if i dont do this what happens? and was impressed when the story continued."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"the subtitle of the game even spoils the twist, but you'd only realize that after the fact. ! fairy flies!"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,ughhh my jaw dropped when that happened. i have yet to beat it since childhood but i finally picked it back up on an emulator. the furthest id been so far was the kalas boss fight
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,"man, that got me so hard. it was done so well, and i definitely never saw it coming. it was super clever, since you would never suspect him because you essentially play as him. no one would suspect their literal main character."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"did you play it? i mean, i get that everything's not for everyone, but it definitely wasn't the most obvious thing they could have done. very mid game thats been elevated because of the culture wars. lol"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"part 2 was a step down from part 1, but acting like it didn't have unexpected surprises is silly. the fact that the game ends up being almost twice as long because you switch main characters to the antagonist half way through was absolutely unexpected and it's silly to act otherwise. up to that point, the game had already been pretty long and had a pretty complete story arc. typical revenge plot, ellie had worked her way through almost everybody who had wronged her, and there was only one person remaining. i'm not going to say it was the greatest twist in gaming history, but abby showing up at your safe house and shooting two main characters in the head, only for you to literally take control of abby was definitely surprising to anybody who didn't pay attention to the leaks."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,that's how i felt about part 1. part 2 i liked a great deal more.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i'm with you. i saw the leak, instantly knew what druckmann was going for, and checked out right then and there. i don't like that kind of manipulation in storytelling. specifically, introducing a new character, making their establishing moment an unexplained act of horrible violence against a protagonist, and then over the next several hours, basically scolding the player for having the reaction they were clearly trying to elicit."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"ill stand on my opinion that connor is one of the best ac protagonists, but all his best characterization is locked behind the homestead missions and side content whicu admittedly were kind of lacking in ac 3."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,the boat ride they trap you in to teach you combat is like 30 minutes  then you make it to the colonies and the game opens up a little bit when you play as haytham but there is easily 23 hours of content if you're trying to bull rush it. and then you play as a toddler connor and go through more tutorials and mindless garbage. and then you have some trippy spirit sequences as connor. and then you do a couple more training missions as adult connor. and then the actual open world gameplay begins. ac3 had some of the worst pacing in the history of aaa video games. i have no idea how i managed to play through it 3 times.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,i was an adult in 2004 and while you definitely got the hints and it wasn't a shock to me ... it was still for me the best plot twist in gaming.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"my wife first played as an adult. i spent the entire time expecting her to figure it out. i kept thinking damn, this is way too obvious. how did i miss it? she was still floored. the hindsight makes a huge difference."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,yes i was a giant piece of shit. but i did it for the republic!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"it's because it plays with the meta elements of gaming. you are used to the idea that there are certain objectives that need to be completed before a game can progress. it's part of the structure of a game. the twist is that you, as the player, are having to perform the commands from a character rather than the game medium. the game manipulates you into thinking that it is a design constraint rather than part of the story that you ust perform the actions. that's what makes it so phenomenally mind blowing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"the voice acting is extremely instrumental in making the entire setup work, imo. karl hanover absolutely nails weaving the phrase into the character's dialect, so it sounds completely natural and you truly don't suspect a thing."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i think it's because the game hasn't aged too well. i played it for the first time a couple of years ago and i could see why it was pretty monumental when it came out, but at this point it's kind of just a halfdecent shooter. good game and probably deserves the love it receives from fans, but at this point i just don't think it has anything truly unique enough to warrant new fans getting totally hooked outside of the twist right at the end."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,oh noooo!!!! that's the worst!!!!  i'm sorrry
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i actually just finished the game last night for the first time. i think it's an excellent twist within the context of a video game, it's a meta commentary on the mechanics of most games and the player's own expectations and sense of power. i don't think it's as strong if you only look at it from a narrative perspective, but as a video game plot twist, it's delightful. very few pieces of media have been able to effectively destroy the 4th wall so violently yet subtly at the same time."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"aside from the white phosphorous scene, i thought the game was really well done. it's a linear game, so you obviously don't have a choice. you either play the game or stop. but many times it's presented like you do have a choice. simple things like shooting the crowd of civilians, or shooting in the air etc. which go along way to making it feel like you're doing things because you chose to. but then nope! use the white phosphorous. it's obvious they're civilians grouped up at the end but you're stuck here until you kill them. i kept trying to go around and skip using it, but as soon as i realised i had to it killed any effect the scene was supposed to have and completely ruined my immersion."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i think the 3rd game was best for gameplay, so many quality of life improvements on 2, feels much better all round. otherwise i'd agree with what you said."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"the first one was really good rtwp. go back and play it as such, assigning your moves and your teammates moves while in the pause and you'll see what i mean. people never understood that your bullet randomly went somewhere in the reticle randomly, and that was why your gun stats made the reticle smaller, and they couldn't figure out why they weren't a shooter god. exactly how alpha protocol did it which people also never figured out how it worked. there's nothing wrong with where the series went, except that it started very unique and it sucks to see anything unique change to be the same as everything else."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,aw man that sucks cuz it really was a successfully done moment. its annoying how sometimes it feels like you either have to completely disconnect from the internet to avoid spoilers or have to rush through a game as soon as it's out.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"not necessarily imo, or at least i'm not one of those who expectsneeds one of the !legacy characters! to appear in everything. i was fully prepared for that story to turn out to be very selfcontained, or maybe have the !grand inquisitor be the one to appear at the end! or something along those lines."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,there is a lot of 4th wall breakdown stuff and it comes out of nowhere. it was some great timing on my mum's part and the fact she played along when they returned home really muddied the water. also my step dad iswas a genius with computers. even now 20 years later if i can't solve a problem i go to him. i just assumed at the time he swapped some audio files and that was it. but yeah it was part of the game i mean listen for yourself httpsyoutu.bem0fsyzqrymy?featureshared it certainly got me for a good minute
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"it's a weird thing to wrap your head around and given we follow the copy's perspective until the final transfer, it's understandable that he didn't fully realize how it worked until that moment"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"simon is pretty dumb but in his defense, he literally has a brain injury, it's why he was scanned in the first place. that's the headcanon i use to justify his stupidity."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i gotta give some props to the writers and producers here. soma does a really good job with catherine's dialogue. she technically tells you the truth throughout the game regarding the transfer process, but lies by omission, which is why simon, and many players, were still surprised by the ending despite already knowing how that process works. the game also misdirects both simon and the player when upgrading the suit. you play as the new simon after upgrading because the old simon is in stasis however, it feels as though you never missed a beat during the suit upgrade transfer."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,the game definitely makes you think long afterward and i agree that this is what makes for powerful writing. dont be shy to flex some of your skills and to practice your writing over at rwritingprompts! there are weekly events as well where you can get live feedback.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,i want someone to make a movie out of it. if it could be done well.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,"it's cheap now, buy it and go in blind. its narrative driven, and has the most poignant ending i've experienced in a game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"indeed, i played all three of them and they all feature the most creative plot twists i've ever seen. but it was the 999 that hit me the hardest, because you know why."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"yeah, you can't really recreate it on any other console. ds is just perfect for it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,i mean to be fair we knew there wasnt going to be a happy ending before the game released.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"maybe that's one of the best, because then it can catch you offguard"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,i think you have moments of passing out every so often but thats it
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"it depends on what parts of the ending you're referring to when you say obvious, especially since there are different endings based on your actions throughout the game, and the game has some genuine surprises all throughout, especially with some of the deaths. as for slow and basic, i don't know what that even means, but arthur's journal alone is more creative and nuanced than anything you'd come across in the vast majority of games. compare his journal to the simple quest logs you get in something like cyberpunk 2077, which itself is a stellar game. there aren't significant gameplay mechanic changes when he gets sick. in the later stages of the game, you get debuffs to your cores, it's harder to keep from being underweight, and arthur is visibly sick and people comment on it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"your stat cores drain faster and require more resources to top off, plus arthur coughing or choking when you use tobacco or alcohol. though that is purely aesthetic it's also harder to make arthur gain weight. unfortunately those systems were severely underplayed in practice and mostly easy to ignore. so if you weren't paying attention to that stuff, or reading the stat descriptions deep in the menus, then you'd have no idea."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"in the end youre still big boss, hes not the person, hes the legend, and you are it even if youre not the original"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,the interloper twist was a rough one.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i think the dlc was my favorite part of the entire game because as much as i adore the base game and the slowly piecing together the mystery across the universe, i think them using just a couple locations for the dlc let them make a much tighter story that felt truly amazing to piece together."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"yes. you won't regret it. still my favourite game of all time, years after playing it. i wish i could blank my mind and play it all over again."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"it should've been disguised as a ng system. every time you ng, the world is a little different and the number ticks down by 1. instead, you're just forced to play through the same boring everything several times. the game was amazing on the first loop, and i didn't hate the second, but my enjoyment had long since died by the fourth."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"especially when the good ending is unlocked by playing dumb and following airy to the end. if you see through her plan and break the crystal, you get the bad ending. it should be the other way around."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,yea like he's one of the greatest villains ever he actually wins and he does it in a way you never expect also but completely in character for him and the celes twist right before that in the factory such a wonderful game another great twist was with golbez in ff4 and his declaration to cecil after the battle of the 4 feinds
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,but unfortunately that is none of them by the end none at all and it's bs

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,what a little shit!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,i learned that revenge isn't worth it. except it is. but not before it's not. however it is. but not really.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,its very old now.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"of course i played it. i loved the first game. its contrived as fuck, with characters that are just cw levels of cringe. like i said, if not the for leaks, the bigoted assholes, and the death threats to laura bailey, people would be a lot more honest about their views on the game. its mid as fuck, from a narrative and character stand point. character motivations in this world dont make sense. no one is going to travel 800 miles on a chance that you might find a guy who might lead you to another guy. not in that world, with all sorts of shit between a and b. the retconning of the fireflies was another big issue. they were a terror group that was all but wiped out. they operating in some backwater hellhole, because fedra had all but wiped them out. then all of sudden they are well stocked, in brightly lit rooms and the place is home to families and whatnot. theres no way, joel would have walked through part 2s firefly base. yet, here we are. going back to abby. she makes that 800 journey with her pals, and only once they arrive is owen asking about how they are going to get the info out of tommy. seems like that would have been part of the conversation before they set out across a hell hole full of monsters, rapists, murderers etc. then she fucks off in a mood, runs into a snow storm, then into infected, and then right into not only the man that shes looking for but the man that shes was wanting him to lead her to... theres good luck, and then theres contrivance. and then, joel hardened by 20 years of the wasteland sees the mood in the room swing wildly to the right when his name is mentioned and he... cracks a joke... everything about that opening segment was about killing joel as quickly as possible without earning it. it doesnt have to be some mad heroes death, but you have to get him into that room in a believable way. and nothing that happened was believable. you could see the writer the whole time. and then right after that ellie tells tommy that she'll go without him if he doesnt take her, so he then leaves without her so that she wont come... shit writing. there was a story in there that had nothing to do with joel and ellie and it was a banger. but we got almost nothing of it. part 2 should have left joel and ellie in part 1 and just focused on abby, owen, lev and yara. by far a more interesting story to be told there. but no, revenge bad with extra steps."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"yeah i don't get how anyone who has actually played it could consider it to be mid. i thought that the story was weaker than the first game and it went on a little too long, but everything else was fantastic. even if it's not your kind of game, you can't deny the high level of polish that has sadly become far too uncommon in aaa games these days. all of that said, i will never play it again because the story was incredibly depressing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"sorry, but that wasnt a surprise. killing joel was the most obvious thing they could have done. not killing him in the first game, was a surprise. killing in the second, was just two tropes wrapped in one. hell, everyone guessed joel was getting killed or already dead 4 years before. thats how obvious it was. trope 1 killing off a mentor figure to start the hero on their journey. trope 2 killing off a formally bad character to redeem them for their bad acts in the past."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"it wasn't ever really a leak, it was pretty well known there was more than one character afaik. with that being said part 2s story was so force fed and hamfisted that i really did not enjoy it. there was a good story in there somewhere, but had the nuance of a piece of cardboard."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"noticing a trend when it comes to discussion of this game. do any of these people downvoting posts critical of this series have a counter point they'd like to share? considering how fast they strike and flee, i'm starting to assume that they don't. this isn't troll bait. i love the first game and i'm not saying anyone should dislike the sequel. i like reading opinions different from my own and otherwise thought that was what forums were for."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"maybe if you played it as an adult or someone with some media exposure to pull from. i was a teen and i definitely didnt see it coming at the time. too immersed to focus so much on the dialogue back then. nowadays, im studying everything"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"whats interesting about the kotor twist is that its easy to dismiss the hints about the twist as just video game logic. seeming amnesia, force visions of the plot, a connection to bastilla, the jedis willingness to train you, all of these things can be handwaved as stuff that happens because youre the protagonist. the game gives you hints, but it also gives you reason to ignore them, or not consider them as hints. it uses your knowledge of typical video game storytelling tropes against you. thats what makes it so brilliant as a twist."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"the really cool part is that it makes you question gaming in general. the crucial difference between the experience of gaming and other media, is that you are in control. you have the agency to make important choices. you're forced to look at the choices the game gave you, and realise that you largely had the illusion of control, your path was scripted a to b. all of the choices about upgrades and so on were just the ones the bad guy didn't care enough to direct you on. once you take a step back, it makes you question how on rails are most games? join the vampires or the vampire slayers? almost all of the quests are identical on the two paths. often it feels like you're free, but you're just making small ad libs to someone else's script."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i would agree with you, if the game gave you any agency in the action. you are so hard on the rails, that it just feels hollow. all that twist told you was the character you were playing was a slave."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i legit am still figuring outtrying to understand things about this game. like last time i played, it finally hit me that i am pretty sure every time you die in the game, a version of booker actually dies."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"that's actually hilarious cause i ran a ttrpg heavily inspired by bioshock set in antarctica. 1960s, players on a cruise ship going around the bottom of south america, storm gets them off course and a bit closer to antarctica then originally planned, when they see a light house through the storm, but the light house is a laser kind of weapon that cuts the ship in half, and the party washes up...on a tropical beach. from there it's get a bit island of dr. moreauish, with plasmids mixed in as scientist doing genetic experiments, usually on local wildlife. i think i even connected in concept with system shock where the scientist was receiving assistance from some space communication. last game session ended with me playing a recording of the last communique but i had used audacity to make it sound like shodan. good times."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"yeah. i showed my now wife the game when we met. she made multiple comments to the effect of why should we listen to this guy? i mean, i know you have to to advance the story, but if it were me i'd be suspicious."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"what i didn't understand is why ryan knew that i was a mindcontrolled slave, could take control of me, but then used that control to make me kill him. why not use me to kill fontaine instead?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"if the game gave the player any options, then i could see your point. but you could put that twist on any game on the rails and it would have the same impact as a video game plot twist. now if you had options and you choose to listen that would be a meta commentary. a great example of something like that would be the no russian level."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i think the you can stop playing the game argument is valid. it's parallel to the narrative of the characters in that they didn't need to be there and couldshould have left, but didn't. by continuing to play it's the fourthwallbreaking equivalent."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,i didn't enter the game expecting vader to show up but when cere tells cal about the dark shadow that broke her when she was captured and interrogated i fully expected a vader appearance at some point.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,i just went in fully expecting !darth vader! to make an appearance. it just fit too well into the story for him not to.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i played it many years ago so i will do probably a oversimplification !kefka finally open the spears world, all of them fight him but he defeat them and now is mega powerful jacked up on magicite and raises a whole ass continent to the sky. everyone goes there to fight him, you find shadow there too and it looks extremely endgame just before the final boss. when you finally confront him he gives a ultima weapon to ceres and says if she kills the whole party she can rule the world with him, she stabs him instead and he says fuck it and destroys the world, you dont even battle.! !everyone tries to flee in the airship, it blows up and the screen fades to black. you wake up on a beach only with ceres, then the old man there tells her about basically the apocalypse, you take care of him for a while that is actually a whole ass year and after he dies you find a letter telling about a raft, you left the island on it and now there is a whole ass new post apocalyptic world map, and you have to find everyone who survived to fight magic god kefka who now rules the world on a tower!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"the point where this twist happens is when the player reaches the floating continent where the presumed bbeg gestahl was going to use the power of the sealed gods to take over the world. he tells celes a party member who used to serve him to rejoin his empire, then kefka gives her a sword with which to kill the party. celes stabs kefka instead, who is infuriated by this and takes the power of the sealed gods and uses it to kill gestahl and reshape the entire world. the twist hits hard for me because it also uses the dramatic change in kefka's status previously a comic relief villain, now a lunatic god causing suffering for his own amusement to drive home the change in the world  your party is split, the world itself is broken and most of the people you've met before are dead."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i assume he is talking about the floating continent, not the end of the game. the world is practically torn apart after that."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"its pretty inconsistent, often they can see everything but sometimes snake has to tell them whats going on, i guess whatever fits the dialogue best lol"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"it means that the story follows a very simple direction in a slow manner that we've seen in western before many times. it's completely fine and it's well done, just don't think it's a super unexpected plot twist. cyberpunk also isn't a good example of a simple quest log, because the quests are written by jackie or johnny depending on what stage of the story you're at and they're also named after thematic songs that change depending on in what language you play. jackie and johnny give their own thoughts in the quest descriptions along with their attitude. cdpr went the extra mile there, very similar to the witcher 3."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,thats my point. i wanted to be the real big boss like the doctor alluded too during the surgery. not some cheap knockoff. i enjoyed the game but will just wait for mgs3 delta to come out so i can properly role play on next gen. are you getting that one?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,you could break the crystal on accident as well if you pressed the button even just one more time after airy said to stop. then you would be locked into forcing it to break and seeing airy as she is. my biggest grip was just that you had to repeat the game over and over and over again with next to little change. it got so boring! and then when you unlocked spirit master and the stillness skill the game was pretty much won since that attack just won every fight for you.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i didn't get any of that when i played it. i also played when it first came out and like with most things avoided as much news media about it as possible, so i didn't find out about the hurr durr abby is a dude crap until afterwards. that being said, i thought it did a good job of getting me to care about the characters and what they were going through more than most games have part 1 excluded. maybe i'm just shallow, but i thought the gameplay was great, and the story was really well done. i actually didn't like the time jump towards the end at first, but after finishing it and thinking on it for a while, i think it had more impact that way. also, i gotta commend them for making me really think about both sides ellie and abby and how there's not really a right way to solve their issues other than just letting things go. similar to spec ops the line. and even though i don't want to go through it again, i believe that says something about how well it was done. i was mad during parts of it and didn't want to have to control a character doing things that i wouldn't agree with in real life. but that's what makes it way above mid for me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"for sure. it's absolutely in my list of things i'm glad i experienced, but i don't want to go through the emotional toll it took on me again. up there with the movie requiem for a dream."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"trope 2 doesn't even apply to joel. joel was killed because of his bad acts, but he was also killed specifically because of his good acts. he died because he saved abby, something he wouldn't have done if he didn't change as a person. that was the surprise. yes, killing off a mentor isn't exactly world changing, but that doesn't mean the way it happens can't be a surprise. joel was killed by a person who would have died if joel hadn't grown as a person between the two games. he was killed by his sins and killed from changing. it was a super fucked situation. something can be a trope and still surprising. nearly every great twist in the history of media relies on tropes, a twist that comes out of complete nowhere is just bad writing done for shock value. i'm not saying joel dying was some kind of high fiction, but clearly it was pretty surprising based on how many youtube compilations you can find of streamers playing the game and getting pissed about it happening. also...joel being killed wasn't the big shock of the game. abby killing a main character, shooting another main character in the head, then becoming the protagonist for the second half of the game was the big twist, and if you go into the game blind and try to claim you predicted that would happen you are lying lmao. expecting to play abby is one thing, that is telegraphed, but the way it happens once again was absolutely out of nowhere. you didn't have any reason to believe abby knew where they were, or that abby was even tracking her."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"the entire plot was leaked and shared online. people were pissed about the story before they even had a chance to play the game. having two characters was expected, but one of them being the person who killed joel, and for more of the game than the main character would have been completely unprecedented, if the plot didn't get leaked."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"specifically to your last point, the game doesnt scold the player for having that reaction. its a tragedy, and it doesnt blame the player any more than a horror game does for the player getting the protagonist hurt."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"oh let's gooo!!!!! i've been wanting to run a bioshock esque, just trying to find the best system to use! what system did you run it in?!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,your wife sounds like me when my now husband introduced me to bioshock. he also used the term would you kindly for a while before i played it so i just didn't even notice when the game started using it too. excellent experience
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"well i think the easiest explanation is that fontaine could've just as easily reverted the protagonist back with the phrase and then it's just a neverending mind control ping pong match. a more profound explanation and what i gathered from it is that, as he says, !a man chooses and a slave obeys, he chooses to die as a free man, which is what he believed in. gotta take into account that his back is against the wall at this point and was certainly desperate so he definitely wasn't thinking straight either.!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,adam is a helluva drug.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,"absolutely, the twist is very overrated. there have been many games that did it properly, even before bioshock. for example, pathologic 2005 would have you question why you do what you do, especially since it's not real, but more importantly it would give you the option to do something else. while bioshock and specops the line made an interesting attempt to shock the player with their own actions, it rings pretty hollow, given it was the only thing you could do within the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,"i think the greater injustice wasnt that they added voices, especially cause i feel they made it faithful, having clone wars actors and all but the worse thing for me was the mumble mode. its horrendous. its literally just them mumbling. no acting it out, nothing additional, they literally just mumble. and yeah its additional time to make the animations and such, but it just feels so half baked. og lego for sure"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"yeah, their orders were to leave the area and call for help at the first sign of any survivors. walker disobeys these orders to 'save' konrad and the 33rd, before declaring a personal war on their occupation."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"sorry, should not have trusted ai answers. according to google ai thing the dead space remake has 12 chapters, which are not explicitly mentioned in the search results. however, based on other sources, the chapter titles are 1. new horizon 2. a new war 3. the cured 4. a walk in the park 5. where is she? 6. the marked 7. the last resort 8. the trial 9. the hand of issac 10. the path of least resistance 11. the sacrificial lamb 12. the final cut"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"developers split up i think, one of them did cocoon, the other did somerville"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i dont think thats accurate, maybe a couple developers from them, but playdead only had 2 games out limbo and inside. the game cocoon your referring to is made by geometric interactive. source quick google search cause i love those two games and wouldve been shook if i missed the third"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,!white blood cells. at first they attack you but once you get far enough into the game they don't anymore because you now appear friendly to the body!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,i havent played in a long time. i must have also missed that. can you elaborate?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"ok. and when you play gta, do you constantly shake your fists at the screen because the cops are incompetent? when you get released from the hospital, do you altf4 because realistically you wouldn't be free for a long ass time after doing what a player does in gta? it's a game. suspend. your. disblief"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,so one correction i wanna make is in your second paragraph. the character doesnt actually have to die. you can help them out and the character can live. it doesnt change anything gameplay wise besides a few scenes before you leave but you can do it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,thanks!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,and then theres learning what happened in thebes. the man !built a harem  put kill switches into every person in thebes to prevent them from going against him. it was so bad that the doctor who gave him the immortality treatment  the doctors teenage daughter committed joint suicide in order to escape the hell that they were living in.!

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"maybe it's a meta thing that i'm only seeing because i've just watched people play instead of doing it myself. not sure i'm willing, though. i can only take so much bleakness these days. i feel like ellie's rage is the player's rage, and that the point of the story as you get to know abby, her friends, and their motivations is that vengeance is a selfperpetuating cycle of nihilistic destruction and emptiness. i'm just not convinced that this sequel is the right vehicle for that message. either way, thank you for the response."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,thank you very much for that. i wonder if it plays well on modern hardware? i'm on pc. research required!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"im not interested in arguing about it, i just dont agree."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"yeah, thats the one that i was baffled that id missed on my second playthrough. its just right there. edit and the map on the wookiee planet, that one also really spells it out."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i felt so betrayed by the council. revan saves the republic, gets backstabbed by the council, then gets memory wiped to force you to like them... fuck that. that was the first game i went full evil and it ruined star wars for me because i always suspect the council to be up to some shady bullshit in all the games and movies."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,"as a story twist, it's fine. but i just disagree with the meta angle. the core plot twist idea is the character thinks they have agency in their life and then they realize they were being controlled. as a player, i never thought i had agency because i had zero control over any decisions. it would be like putting a sign at the end of a roller coaster as a meta commentary on going upside down. i think this distinction is highlighted more in games that actually give you agency and have tricked players into obeying. that is a meta twist. bioshock was just a story."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,got it! i wish i could play that game again but unfortunately in high school i let a friend borrow my disc as well as bioshock 2 and he lost them somehow. now they delisted spec ops the line digitally so i'd have to find an old disc to play it again.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"no !there's no hint he could possibly still be alive. in the first game it seems like he's just doing the so they don't repeat our mistakes thing, but he's actually planning to live forever and be directly involved.!"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i was under impression that was just tellah being there in spirit. if you go watch the cut scene, tellah isn't there in mysidia tower along with all of the others. he would be there if he was brought back to life."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i've just watched people play instead of doing it myself. very different experience from actually playing it. i'm just not convinced that this sequel is the right vehicle for that message. the game aligns with that message, and is a huge theme in the game, but that is still only the vehicle in which it tells the real story, which is the one between ellie and joel their complex relationship, their falling out, and her eventual reconciliation with his memory."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,"no worries g they did release a remaster of the campaign, so if you can't get the original working well, you could try that"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,i wasn't trying to argue just discuss it? why even mention your opinion if you don't want to talk about it?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,it's an innocuous question on its face. that line could fit in a lot of fiction. it just makes way more sense when you have the context.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,it does kind of diminish your point when you realise that revan also murdered planets of people. that's why he was memory wiped.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i mean... a society of religious warriors, answerable to no one? when has that ever been a good idea?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,"the core plot twist is that you, the player, think that the character has agency in their life. that's the twist. that's the meta aspect. it's not supposed to surprise you that you were on rails. it's a surprise that the character is on rails, and has been the whole time. because most of the time, the protagonist of a game has agency, but we're used to the story guiding the player along rails. you may not like the twist anyway, but i do think you may have gotten the point of it backwards."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,it's been god knows how many years and still get mad and sad whenever i remember that ending
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,what is the 4th twist? didnt play burial at sea

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"til spec ops the line got delisted online. after a quick googling, it seems like they delisted it because the music licenses expired. the game isn't even that old though 2012, can't believe the license was that short."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,in the first game !he is definitely doing it because he doesn't want history to remember him as the guy who killed humanity!.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,"yes, she's to blame for humanity being able to wage war against itself again, after she sacrificed all those who were useless for her plan. i'd say that's the definition of a villain."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,yea and in the ds and gba port he's a playable final party character and honestly if you have played the game as much as i think you have go with the ds port it's so good and the extra content is wonderful just look up a walkthrough for all of the arguments and how where to get them as there is an absolute ton and many are missable
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,ok so you are right just looked it up and in the after years he goes with anna in spirit to talk to edward so looks like he is only there in spirit
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"i gathered the other themes, particularly how they relate to the final moment from the first game, but your points are still fair. i'll give it a go and see if the feeling holds. thanks!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,"ah yes, how could i forget. thanks once again."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,"the core plot twist is that you, the player, think that the character has agency in their life. that's the twist. that's the meta aspect. that isn't meta though because it doesn't comment on the nature of gaming. you could tell the bioshock story in a movie and the twist would have the same plot impact. you could tell it in a book and the twist would have the same plot impact. take something like no russian, you couldn't tell that story in a movie or book because the twist and meta commentary is founded in the nature of the player playing the game. i enjoyed bioshock and i enjoyed the twist. i just disagree that it's a meta commentary on gaming as a whole."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,this is the way
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,"the best part is the polar opposites you get in terms of characters between faro and herres. faro was the father of the end of the world. his arrogance and greed single handedly led to the complete destruction of earth's biosphere and the extinction of humanity. and after all that he was still willing to doom the future of humanity because he didn't want to be remembered as the bad guy. then you have general herres. who had the misfortune of being the man in charge of sending countless humans to their certain death under the veil of stalling until a superweapon was built, when in reality it was to delay the extinction of humanity just that much longer. and after all of that he made it a point to ensure his name, and more precisely his role in enduring victory, was forever tied to him and him alone. his testimonial he sent to elisabet to have archived in apollo is still one of the most surreal and haunting messages i've heard in a game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,"i don't know what game you think you're talking about, but it isn't the one everyone else played."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,you called it right! i've played through the snes version multiple times. i kind of hate that they added content to bring tellah back...i actually liked that square was willing to kill a party member for real back then. i'll have to try the ported version.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-12,or maybe you're so blind to the plot that merely follow what everyone says is enough.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-07-11,even in the snes version he does not stay dead not in that game now in ff2 the one with ferion maria guy and cast they actually do stay dead but no pc actually stays dead in any version of ff4 edit i cried when yang blew up man that his so hard the text and music just hurt

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-13,its already remastered. this was the pc port announcement.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-13,"because that's the version of the game they are porting to pc. they are not porting the ps4 game tlou2, from 2020. they are porting the ps5 game tlou2 remastered, from 2024."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-13,"yup, i really hope that xbox pulls itself out of this funk and smashes some stuff out of the park, we need healthy competition again, otherwise sony is going to keep pulling shit like this."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-13,praying that steam enters the console market soon
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-13,"this current weird trend of playstation games getting remaster when they really weren't that old yet and  or still look good enough to not really need one to begin with. just as an example, last of us 1 got a remaster literally a year after its original release when they made the ps4 port. sony for some reason has this strange fascination with treating ports of recentish games as fullon rereleases instead of just a port, and people rather understandably think that's silly."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-13,its called remaster. as far as i know god of war or ghost of tsushima or horizon fw went with the same title. this probably means they will release remaster on ps5 as well
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-13,it was more an ad than a trailer. like they didnt hype it up that much.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-13,"thanks, i had thought it was already and that they were going full todd howard. good for pc players i guess, but id have much rather seen a last of us 3."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-13,i agree with all of that but the op seemed to imply that this is a new reremastered when it's not. part 2 remastered was released on ps5 this january and this is just a pc version of that.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-12-13,they already did. it was a 10 upgrade and came with a roguelike mode
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,it's because of the story. most people wanted the last of us 1 all over again but with better graphics. instead we got a huge story twist. which is very good in my opinion. this is a revenge story that ends badly for both sides.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"i think a lot of people had a picture in their head of what the game would be. and then when it was radically different, and went in a darker direction, that really upset them. there are problems with pacing, and the order of playing some sections. i think they could have benefited with introducing a load of a new character's storyline earlier if it could be done without spoiling the surprise too much  i think a lot of people had problems empathising with the character after playing 10 hours of the game. i also think the last 20 of the game could have been carved off as a separate dlc, giving a happyish ending for those who wanted it, but then continuing the story for those who needed closure. imho it's a very good game. it's not groundbreaking, like the first was, but then it was never going to be. it has flaws limited character models, pacing issues, some aspects of the story, but ultimately i think a lot of hate comes from people who didn't feel they got enough fan service."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"playing tlou1 made me feel powerful and the end felt like righteous justice. ellie and joels moralities were really painted in a positive light that was not completely accurate. tlou2 made me feel uncomfortable, drained and that every decision ellie went through was a path further into darkness. the ending felt like resolution to all that darkness with a small semblance of hope. i think i know why people didnt like the game because i personally felt fatigued playing it. with that being said, it has a great emotional impact that the creators clearly set out to do. its not a feelgood experience and wasnt meant to be. character development was excellent including for secondary characters. i was thrown for a loop on the change in the playable character but i ended up liking the experience. gameplay was very similar to previous game with a few innovations. i was a bit disappointed by the weapons system being largely the same. the stealth element was improved in diversity and felt much more challenging. overall gameplay was fun but left a little to be desired. game was 810 for me"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-27,"abby as a character was very controversial for some reason, but i never minded her. i guess a lot of these incels felt their masculinity was in danger by seeing a women stronger than them, and hated her after that. i felt her story was well thought out and important to the story, and everyone that dislikes her didn't play the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,i think it was because of the story.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,had no problems with the game. to me the story was amazing if they had been able to add the parts they had to delete would've loved it more
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"people missing the point of the story and the narrative they were trying to drive home. revenge isn't black and white. ellie and joel are not the heroes of the story necessarily. most games paint the protganists as righteous, mowing through hordes of nameless npcs. tlou2 gives those npcs a name and a story  and makes you think twice about killing them. abby's motivation for revenge is just as compelling a story as ellie's. the point of the game wasn't to make you feel guilty about the choices ellie makes throughout the game, but to show you the two sides to every story. i personally enjoyed the twist and abby as a playable character. to someone else's point, the ending is a suitable way for ellie to break the cycle and try to find some semblance of peace in her life. the game does have some questionable choices though  forcing us to repeat the first half of the game, but as abby was weird. i would've much preferred a back and forth until the climactic confrontation at the theater. i could also do without the violence against dogs. i genuinely thought about putting the game down after encountering that. overall, i'd give the game an 810."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,the last of us part ii is magnificent. easily one of the best games of the entire console generation
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,i always loved nd games because they add lots of details and small events that keep the gameplay fresh and sometimes give it a new twist. i find the story ok so i don't get why people hate it either
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"i know the haters are sick of hearing they just dont get it but ive been reading through reddit for a few days now since finishing it and... thats how it is, by and large. i dont think theyre stupid or anything, i think they just got too caught up in their own emotions to see the bigger picture. that, combined with people who just want to shit on things for fun. if the haters want the lovers to stop calling them stupid, they should probably stop falling for the ellie is the first female protagonist memejoke every single time. there are legit, intelligent critiques out there, but nobody sees that due to the constant stupidity of loud mouthed fools."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"people didn't understood the final, the biggest ellie's fear was to be alone, and in the end, she saw that she was alone."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"i didn't like the game personally bc of the story, narrative, storytelling, the setting of promises and payoffs, and the fact that they use joel just as a plot device and emotion device. i don't think it's the worst game ever tho, it's a solid 710 at least."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-27,"so i just beat the story. pretty good. about on par with tlou1 minus 1's great ending. i have a few lingering questions, though, probably because i wasn't paying enough attention !so...that lady that had her mural painted all over the city? she will protect you? the leader of the scars? who was she? did she ever show up? was she that chick that god smacked in the head with a hammer durring the abby section? if so, what a fuckin' waste, i didn't even know it was the same woman! second question !there's notes all around the city that you find several times. they just have a person's name on it can't remember the name. what's the deal with those?!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-07-19,"hi op, late to the party but i just finished. i found it a brutal game and loved every second i didn't hate the ending but it would have been nice to know if ellie even realises how broken she is and how her actions ruined her life and those around her even more."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"oh i dont know, maybe because they killed off joel in the worst possible fashion and force you to play as his murderer for the second half of the game while you hunt down ellie and try to kill her? its bullshit. ive read people say did you really expect joel to live through the sequel??? lolz so ignorant. the first game builds up so much emotional attachment to these two and the second game just says fuck you and what you feel or want for these characters. not to mention joel, who is the most careful person in this post apocalyptic world, who never gives up his identity, just gives out his info and is immediately murdered for it. completely fucking ridiculous."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"it was because of the story. the graphics, gameplay, acting, setting are all fantastic. then the story steers you in the direction of hating a sympathetic character who does bad things but feels remorse, then loses everything in the end while at the same time trying to make you sympathize with a bad person who has done unforgiveable things and seems to feel no remorse then gets away with it in the end"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,i played it without ever playing the original. gameplay is boring.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"i would say that a big problem with the game is its pacing and story structure, since it is honestly shite. flashbacks inside flashbacks, either because the tone in the real game is getting too dark, and they need something people wanted when going into the game, or just building up context, that we need to know to understand the story. this is a story that i think would have been much better if it was told chronologically, since it would have given a much better first impression of !abby too. her campaign would probably also have been much better first too. and then the ending really messes and fucks up the overall theme, and gives players a lot of dissatisfaction. ! i would also say the representation feels really weird and forced, but worst of all is how many plot holes and stupid decisions that have to be made for the story to actually carry out, and these you might not realize, since they are gonna take a while to settle in."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-27,exactly. and without her you don't walk away with questioning morality the way you do with the first. they managed to recreate that feeling by including her and i think they nailed it.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,the journey in the first game was all for nothing as well. they went all that way to find the fireflies and it ended with joel wiping them out and crushing any hope of a cure. did you just forget about that?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"i dont think it was specifically the ending, the ending was just the nail in the coffin. no closure and felt kind of incomplete."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"pretty much after our beloved x character got killed by a and youre forced to play as a afterward. with your mind still filled with anger and frustration, the game told you to play character a to understand her..ehem, its backstory. at that point, probably most of us already dont give a fck. literally speedrun until the end no joke. the story is predictable passed that point because you kinda get the theme of the game already, which is revenge."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"the ending was spectacular. game kept me on edge the entire time, it has to be one of if not the most compelling game story i have ever experienced. to say my expectations were exceeded is an understatement. then again, many people seemed bothered by far cry 5's ending and i thought that was actually really well done also, though that wasn't quite near this level. if game writing in general continues to be absolute rubbish, it's because when something actually thoughtful and well executed comes around a bunch of people throw tantrums."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"for me it was the theme. the game seems like it wants to pretend the overall theme and message is unique or deep in any fashion? but... its not and the hammering of the message throughout the story feels grating because of its lack of originality. don't get me wrong the graphics, sound, and even gameplay to some extent are spectacular. the story just tries to play like its deep when its true depth never goes beyond a teaspoon of water."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-27,"i agree. one of the few games in recent memory where i actually had to pause and think about who is the right and who is in the wrong. in the theater scene i found myself rooting for ellie, but at the beach i was wholeheartedly on team abby."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-29,"the game is not asking you to like her. killing her off only leaves one more innocent person without a loved one. abby didn't get her fulfillment when she completed her revenge on joel. she got it when she found new friends in yara and lev. killing off abby would not satisfy anyone. that's the whole moral of the story. the game is not asking you to make the decision for ellie either. she, not you, chose her path. this is not a roleplaying game so you're only supposed to be the passive observer. you don't have to agree with it but that doesn't make it a bad game."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"the bandwagon exists because many people don't like the game, and they actually have an argument to justify it. you don't have to agree with the arguments, but stop assuming it's because of some mindless herd mentality that the game is receiving harsh criticism. that's just silly."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-28,"right, the people who were gonna rush to cutting the only immune girls brain open, killing her without her consent. those people were innocent?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"that has nothing to do with how he did his death though. he was very careful in the first game and in the second game, hes a fucking moron or you know completely out of character. he would never trust random strangers that he just met with his real name, especially when he should know that they likely people after him and this is what kills him. then he gets brutally murdered and tortured by abby. it was more to do with her father dying than joel supposedly screwing the chance to save humanity. people are also still attached to joel. so to play as his killer for the big part of the game, of course nobody is going to like that and if they were going to do that, they need to do it right but they didnt. then ellie doesnt choose to kill the one person responsible for why ellie wants and actually does murder so many people along the way which is stupid. both rdr games actually did the revenge story and how certain characters died, a lot better."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"abby was no hero either. the line between good and evil got smudged into survival, if you are weak strong will rule over you and you need to do anything to live. and there are to many problems with firefly's and the doctors desire to dissect ellie before even do any test shows their incompetents."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-28,killing off joel wasnt he problem. it was forcing us into playing as abby afterwards that was the problem. it was a huge disservice to our connection to joel.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-27,"and tlou2 uses that bond and that love for joel to fuel the character and the player's motivation. you should be pissed off at what happened to joel. you should want to go hunt down abby. you should be feeling exactly what ellie feels. and then you play ellie, and do a bunch of terrible shit to a bunch of people, all in the name of vengeance. and as a player, you feel just in your actions because of what happened to joel. but then the game shows you why ellie is such a terrible person for doing so. because it shows the people ellie has been hunting down as what they are people. people with their own lives and their own loves and their own motivations. that's the moral of the game it tricks you as a player into participating in the endless cycle of hate and revenge."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-27,"allow me to treat this game as a story, which it heavily relies most than any other game. this is an amazing scape routine for a bad review. if it fills us with bitterness that's exactly the point of the storyteller and if it doesn't it is also an accomplishment of the writer again. it surpasses the death of x character which was pretty much comprehensible for a tlou fan coming in to this sequel. the success of a story is to convince you of its message, not only to explain you. you can drive a cliched or an exceptional message and land it amazingly if you lay down the foundations for it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-27,you brought a good point up tho
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-27,probably because its so soul crushing to watch. and then we have to face the realities of all the terrible things joel has done. an emotional gut punch to say the least. i love how both these games leave me feeling so morally conflicted. so much to think about and consider
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"i dont see it as a problem to introduce a new faction. factions arent too important in the game, its implied that there are so many in the world, i would have hated it if the scar or wlf had come back with a vendetta and settled a score in the last hour or so of the game. that's a waste of future resources, the ending was apathetic though, but it did leave room to tell more story which is what i was hoping for."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"ah yes, forgiveness. don't mind me killing everything beloved to you and then forgive you. i can see why you see the theme as forgiveness but it falls so flat on it's face that you can easily miss it, they didn't do anything new to a theme that has been done a million times that it just comes out as bland and uninteresting."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"no one ever thought joel was a saint, especially himself. that doesnt mean his choice at the end of last of us 1 is wrong."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"and that theme is the exact reason the game falls flat. it's such an overdone theme that to make it worth iterating for the one millionth time, it needed to be better presented than the amateurlevel trope show that it was."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,and because of that you throw every review that isn't an 810 in with review bombing and discard any legitimate criticism of the game. all the time in the world couldn't help you understand the nuances of the situation. you're on your bandwagon and nothing is gonna convince you otherwise.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-27,well most disagree. the story telling was fantastic. not sticking with the main characters just because its traditional is stupid. going along the ride with abby really showed just how fucked up the people we love are. but we stll love them and root for them. the questions of morality is just as strong with lou2 as it is with lou1. thats what makes these stories so special.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-28,"ok, thats the first valid point ive heard about it. thank you for that."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,to be fair. when you play as abbie you kill plenty of people with sons and daughters. so what's the difference? we only have to wait for naughty dog to make tlou3 about wlf soldier number 342 to then humanise him and demonise abbie?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,and i don't think anyone has a problem with that. people just hate how he died

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-28,"well the game both literally figuratively spits on his corpse, so he clearly isnt beloved to the people behind the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-28,"well, weve heard nothing of those other supposed innocents, and they certainly never sough revenge, so it doesnt have a lot of bearing here. sure, they argued with each other. but they still came to decision to kill a girl without asking her if it was okay. therefore they are not innocent, and their supposed heroism some serious stains on it. if they can decide that ellie could die, joel can decide the same for them. they just lost."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-28,"did you see how much of a stickler he was for patrols to be safe, particularly the ones with ellie? also, why are ellie and dina and such all tough and hardened after years of comfort, but joel got soft? doesnt add up to me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"that isnt a good excuse though. hes been surviving for 20 years and theres no way hed lose basic survival instincts where one of the biggest ones being, dont trust anybody unless you know for sure you could trust them. hed have to be an idiot to do that which is what they made him. also, he couldve just used a fake name anyway. theres no reason he should be using his real name. if they were going to give joel a heroic death, thats fine too. if they were going to make him die a horrible death, thats fine as well but they shouldnt somehow make him a huge dumbass for him to die. there is no excuse at all for how they made him die. most people arent even mad that he died. hell they are fine with it but how he died, how they did his death, was absolutely terrible. another thing is how they misled people into thinking he had a bigger role in the trailers. i get the idea of misleading people to avoid spoilers but what they did was straight up lie about what the story was about."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-27,"is it? so if someone dislikes it or has a different opinion than you, then you just dont get it? fuck all that. i got it, its trash."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-28,"they edited the ending surgeon scene, and seem to be ignoring the original depiction of the fireflies. i know what retcon means."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"no, its not. they wrote a really shitty story and i had no desire to continue playing it. if your game is so bad that people walk away from it two hours in, something is wrong that that story."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-27,"great insight, thanks."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"i don't see in that way at all, it feels like she lost all connection to joel while caring form him. no one would like to forget about someone you care about and how ellie was crying fro him shows that she cares deeply about him. but no at the end she leaves everything that remind her of joel and i feel that she lost something so deep that she can't get back anymore."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"!i think you nailed the point with some critics i have with the game. you, as a player, are making your own assumptions about the ending and how the characters feels, it's ambiguous bc that's what they wanted you to feel, that's why the promise of ellie's character arc it's at the end, it's for subvert your expectations and give you a lot of questions for you to answer. there's no real answer bc they don't explore the answers within the characters. they give you the answer for the argument what is the prize of revenge? and ultimetly revenge is bad, it costs everything, a story told over and over again. imo, tlou it's not about the plot, it's a about the characters, but tone, argument and themes are the protagonist of this game by a lot. you can say abby's story it's like the first tlou, yes, but she's being use as a mirror of what ellie and joel went through in the first game, she's as well as joel a device to make you feel things wich also the game does a lot. even dina is used, she's only there for ellie to go back and later, to show that ellie lost everything, she's nothing of a character beside that.!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,"considering that the seraphites were built up for like 10 hours of gameplay, and this new faction had like...2 hours maximum, it felt rushed as hell to me. felt very much like the creators were writing themselves out of a hole in order to make sure abby and ellie would run into eachother."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-28,and the lesson of the game only really applies to one of the characters. ellie lost everything. abbie didnt. but who was the one who actually got their revenge? i thought the lesson was the pursuing revenge was a bad thing? it really only seemed to serve to clear abbys mind and direct her toward her lifes old purpose the fireflies. ultimately abby is rewarded by this narrative and ellie is just punished endlessly.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-27,i dont think ellie actually ever forgave abby. i think she saw joel in her since she was only focused on saving lev. ellie didnt forgive her she just didnt kill her
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,yeah it may not be wrong to him or to us but it is to somebody else. there really aren't any definitive good or bad guys in the games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-26,ok sure thing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-29,i definitely think that the game wanted to make a point about tribalism and that expands to the players themselves. ingame the survivors have all formed tribes that see themselves as in the right and others as wrong. because of the time we've spent with joel and ellie and our attachment to them we're basically part of their tribe. we excuse or justify actions of theirs that we condemn other characters for. once we got the reveal of who abby's dad is everything clicked for me. ellie wants the exact same thing that abby wanted. how can we root for ellie and at the same time condemn abby. i don't think the game wants us to hate joel and ellie for what they've done. we understand and empathize with them. it wants us to understand and empathize with what abby went through. i think ellie's decision at the end was meant to honor joel's decision in the first game. ellie wanted to forgive joel for what he did. joel risked everything and put a giant target on his back so that ellie could live and have a good life. he knew that there would be people like abby that would want to come after him. i honestly think that if joel knew who abby was and why she wanted him dead he would have respected it. he wouldn't have wanted to die but he would understand. he wouldn't have wanted ellie to sacrifice her humanity to avenge him.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"according to the fine print, this is by units, not revenue, which might explain the last of us 2 remaster, if they count the 10 euro upgrade version as a separate sale. also interesting tidbit, black myth wukong is not counted here because the publisher doesnt participate in the data collection that is used in here and in which i think all other german publishers participate, so that skews the numbers as well. but i am happy to see that both space marine 2 and lost crown do well here, i really enjoyed lost crown and am bummed that it was not more successful overall. finally, we germans sure love our farming simulations! farming simulator 25 which is here listed under its german name landwirtschaftssimulator 25 is already number four on the yearend charts for 2024 and it was relased in midnovember, so it had maybe a month of sales to get that high up. if it had released a bit earlier, it might have given ea fc a run for the money lol"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"they say if you continue to repeat your mistakes that end up hurting you, you are either insane or dumb."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"i know a lot of people who play fifa nonstop, from early access release date to early access release date of the next one. i dont know anyone who enjoys fifa."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"i'm not an avid fifa player i mostly just play it through gamepass, and i complain about it constantly but i also enjoy it and there's nothing like it. i bought fifa 23 and i have like 400 hours in single player career mode, man imagine if someone who cares made a career mode, it's already good in its shit state."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,i know multiple people that are like that too. some of them spent thousands of euros on micro transactions
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,honestly i'm fine with your friend bankrolling ea so they can invest in other projects but only so long as they don't insert those shitty mechanics into other games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,football fans are also practically a cult. slave labor was literally used to make a fifa world cup stadium and they couldn't have cared less.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"it is pretty much top 510 title every year. despite what reddit thinks, fc and cod pretty much outsells everything else and are the most popular titles."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,i'm pretty sure nba or nfl games are also top sellers in na reddit is a small echo chamber compared to the masses of casual gamers that have a gaming system for a single game to play on the weekends

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-09,"because it's a terrible game. i like football and i would play a decent football videogame, but ea has been making garbage for years without consequence."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,why are sports gamers non gamers?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,not to mention there is nothing else in the genre. gamers have to choose between dozens of games in each genre... then there is fc for football fans.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,you meant aaaa

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"yup. also, nintendo is not providing digital sales data, so if they did, chart would have also looked slightly different. whole reporting is just a mess, especially since noone is reporting outside of big publishers. and even if they are reporting, there are caveats like nintendo not reporting digital sales. from steam best sellers there is also manor lords which could have ended up charting. same for stalker 2, hades 2 or gray zone warfare."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"palworld would have not been included even if it was full release, because devs are not reporting numbers. that's entire point of my post. that so many devspublishers are not reporting numbers, that making chart like this seems pretty pointless."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,what do you think they've been doing on switch lmao
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,isn't it what they're already doing?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,yeah with sometimes new game modes and gameplay features the gameplay features just come with more glitches and exploits. but the point still stands that the game will never get fixed because ea has no reason to fix it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"it's genuinely an incel hate group, i have no idea why reddit even allows it to exist."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"i do understand it, but one is a function of another. if something is top 20, and max top players for a game is 1k in a given time, for a multimilion game market in germany, something is not right."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,steam is biggest platform there is. bigger market for ea is ubisoft and origin ? than steam ? what? surely no. this charts supposed to bring all purchases from all platforms not selectively. anyone has a source for those sales ? or how they are computed?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-09,is there a 'simulator simulator' to scratch that meta itch?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,true. although skull and bones is more arcadey. you'd think sea of thieves would be in there on the sim side of things
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,the definition of insanity is doing the same shit over and over again and expecting things to change.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-09,"he probably still enjoys the game a lot, obviously. you usually complain about stuff you care about and want to be as good as possible. and while spending 70 on a very similar game every year might seems insane for us hardcore gamers in the end they probably got 400 hours of fun out of the new game every year so realistically a way better deal then we get out of a lot of games. assuming they don't burn hundreds of euros on fut at that point, is turns into a really bad deal realy quickly. what's the solution to this though, competition is impossible without licences. pes had to be way way way better than fifa to have any shot, as soon as quality is similar to one with more licences will be the one everyone will play. and as far as gameplay on the pitch is concerned, i dont think there is room for a lot of meaningful improvement."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,its literally number 1 every year unless gta is released

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,not literally nongamers but people who play sports games are fairly distinct from the wider gaming demographic. they tend not to be invested in gaming as a whole and either play sports games alone or are just more casual about the entirety of the hobby than core gamers. its like calling middle aged moms gamers because they happen to play candy crush or something. theyre gamers by technicality.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"i mean, as a german i'm shocked as well."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"yeah, this is only a small part of the whole picture and a pretty incomplete one as well. that being said, this only shows new releases in 2024 and in relation to each other, which gives you at least some interesting insights i am a little surprised that apparently echoes of wisdom seemed to do better in germany than astro bot, even though astro bot was the much more acclaimed game, both were platformexclusive and kind of a bit a flagship release for their respective platform. nintendo only reporting physical sales means that mario party jamboree is probably underreported here, how much higher would it have climbed if digital sales were included as well? would they have duked it out with farming simulator 25, which is once again the hidden juggernaut in german sales charts, every time they release nobody except the hardcore fan base seems to care and every time they sell call of dutylevel numbers in germany which is just crazy lol. and i have no idea who were all those people buying skull and bones, especially as i do not even remember seeing it on retail shelves anywhere. in regards to games like manor lords or hades 2 not reporting, i can kinda understand those, though. early access is tricky in regards to accounting for sales, because when exactly do you account them for in regards to unit sales? i mean revenue accounting i can kinda get doing this yearbyyear during early access, but when do you account the game unit to be sold? maybe that was also the issue with baldurs gate 3, because while it was hugely successful, it was also in early access for like three years, do you account the units for the year the player got early access? or when the game officially releases? and would we even be able to get the early access numbers for reporting?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"ah, i see what you mean. sorry, i didn't mean to come across dismissive in my comment, just wasn't sure if the ea status made a difference here since it often does for things like game awards."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,because simulator is german as well. the word has latin origins and so multiple languages have it in their vocabulary. just happens to be written the same way in both german and english.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-09,"this is a list of amount sold of new games released in 2024, not all games sold in 2024. so ur comparing completely different lists. hence hogwarts not being there since its a 2023 title like i said. its not in the us and uk list either."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,well 2024 was a pretty weak year considering aaa releases so im not suprised that one or two trash games managed to slip into the list. especially with how much was spens for the marketing on skull and bones. would be nice to have other markets in comparison.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-09,"games sold partially influences player count yes, but its not the other way around as said you can buy 10 copies and never play it, but that game with zero players will still be higher on the list compared to a game that was bought by eight people who play it everyday in regards to top sales its all about the perspective of the data collected. anyhow.... most of the games in this list are trash, sadly"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,origin and ubisoft both offer gamepass esque on demand services that let you play their games for a monthly subscription. there are sizeable amounts of ea and ubisoft players using their own launchers. not to mention gamepass through xbox is available on pc and offers eaplay

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,but people who play sports games are fairly distinct from the wider gaming demographic quite the opposite no? the numbers show the wider demographic are the casual gamers we the serious gamers on reddit are the niche

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,it doesnt matter? you dont need to play more than it. you are basically also calling out ppl that play only one mmo or moba or shooter out just cause they dont play enough games? sports gamers often times play these games for hundreds of hours every year from my experience

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"if you only play fifa and don't care about any other games, then you don't have a hobby of playing games, you have a hobby of playing fifa. and yes, that is also true for people who only play a single mmo, or moba, or shooter. it's the same way you wouldn't call someone a sports lover if they only play and care about one sport and ignore all others. it just depends what you understandmean by gamer."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,defining a gamer as a person that plays at least one video game one time is a meaningless category. am i an athlete if i ran 100 meters one time? its not elitism to apply standards to people.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"in most cases it's not gatekeeping, it's just having a different understanding of what the word means. sure, gamer can technically be as vague as anyone who has at any point played any type of game, which isn't even limited to videogames, it includes as well card games, board games, roleplayinggames, etc. it's just that at that point you're describing almost everyone. for some people it has a more focused meaning, more akin to someone whose main hobby is gaming."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,its not even about what specifically you play. there are many variables and calling someone a gamer or not isnt an insult or compliment. we dont have legally binding standards for what a gamer is so i suppose if you play tictactoe one time then youre a gamer. that just broadens the definition so much it becomes useless.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,"ea f1. which isn't ea fc, you'll note. so back to the original statement, which was talking about ea fc as a game for non gamers."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2025-01-08,why does it have to have meaning? it's all about context. i've seen people say turn based games aren't real games. i've seen people say pokemon and animal crossing aren't real games for real gamers. i've seen people say madden and fifa aren't real games and true gamers only play gears of war. oh you only play free to play games? those aren't real games. oh you only play arcade games? those aren't real games. you don't play indie games? you aren't a real gamer. oh you only play mainstream aaa? you aren't a real gamer. it's just a way to gatekeep because you want to feel special and unique.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-08-12,"deciding to absolutely hate a game, let alone based on a youtube playthrough, doesn't seem like the brightest idea in hindsight. good for you for giving it a go. it's a phenomenal game despite its weaknesses, one i look forward to playing again when it comes to pc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-08-12,"i can't believe i'm reading these same tired arguments 4 years after release. lucky for you, there's an entire subreddit dedicated solely to posting these same points over and over again."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-08-12,"the game has some serious pacing issues but overall i really loved it. nd tried to do something different, and its pretty evident they bit off more than even they could chew, but the game is still fantastic."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-08-12,thanks for letting us know!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-08-17,i loved that game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-08-12,"what i did like is the way the world was built to show how people survived going on. the small western style town where ellie lives, the stadium that has become a fortress for humans to survive, the cult on the island building up. though, i admit, the cult on the island didn't feel explored enough. it just felt weird to bringing them into the story to me. what i loved too is just the way the world is built to show how things have decayed, the buildings laying over, collapsed. and adding in all the things you can find to add extra story. i also enjoying the combat. the whole effort into building a game that has a real feeling world, one that you can totally be involved in is something i always love in games. i do like that the game builds on the first, making it even bigger. what i didn't care much for was the story in a lot of ways. i get it is a revenge story to start and ends showing that revenge is an empty journey, or that is how i saw it. but i thought it odd that abby goes to track down the man who killed her father, dragging her friends along, out into the world and out into unknown danger. or that she manages to find him what seems too easily. i get wanting revenge but at the same time...in a world like that, it seems like a fools errand. at the same time, the whole revenge tour of ellie just ruined her for me. she throws away everything and anything and becomes a serial killer? another thing that was lost to me was the sense of tension and survival from the first. it just seemed less about trying to live and more about trying to kill, often violently and excessively for revenge rather then survival. would i like to see a third part, continuing ellie's story? i think so. i think that they way the game ended, it seems like there needs to be a circle of that comes around to redemption, a point where ellie becomes the joel character. honestly, having built such a vast in game world, it seems like there are other places to explore, other things to see. that could be fun with ellie. but at the same time, i wonder how the rest of the world might fair. does it look the same everywhere? are other places more stable? less stable? does the country as a whole start to rebuild, come back together? and do they ever find that curetreatment they were trying to get in the first one? i have this weird feeling that one part of the story would be someone slowly discovering that they did find a cure at the cost of killing untold numbers of people to their horror."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-08-12,"never understood the issue explained with joel's death. do you think only soft people get offed? bc, soldiers, gang members, terrorists, heisters, special agents, they all get tricked, take wrong turns, eat bullets etc in a regular basis."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-08-12,"i don't think i've ever had to push myself so hard to see a game through to the end. it's just so relentlessly brutal and bleak, the sort of experience you play through and realise you've had absolutely no fun whilst playing it. terrible story issues aside, i think the worst thing about the game is that it still feels almost identical to part one in terms of gameplay. with so many years between release you'd expect some form of evolution."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-08-12,"that's another reason i wanted to play the game. i realized it wasn't healthy to pile on the hate of something i haven't truly experienced myself. it's better to make my opinion based on my own playthrough. i enjoy the game a lot now, but i'm glad i waited for it. i guess this experience has taught me to be a little more open minded in hindsight, which i guess is why i have a certain bond with this game"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-08-12,"yeah i played games that are tragedies as well, i just don't think this is a good one that's all."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-08-12,"while i think the game is very good, i think it's so smug to always think games are power fantasies and tlou2 made some genius move by killing a main character. sure it's surprising, but i don't think it's that special tbh."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-08-13,"i fully agree! i kinda wish it wasn't 3 days as ellie, then 3 days as abby, but apart from that, i adore the game so much. i also really enjoy playing as both ellie and abby"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-08-12,"these people with such flimsy arguments for why they hate the game are just arguing in bad faith. they're influenced by all the other brainwashed people who got mad there were lesbians and trans characters. don't waste your time refuting their points, they will always have a braindead reason that logic doesn't apply to this case."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-08-12,"how did no one tell you yet that youre just blatantly false on that last statement . its astonishing that you can say that about its gameplay when part 2s gameplay was a fantastic overhaul of the previous basic ass mechanics of the first one. story issues aside, i think youre genuinely dogshit at the combat in game bro cause no way you saying that shit when i feel this game is one notch under mgs v in gameplay."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-18,i would say 1 was a masterpiece. found 2 a little bit of mess. felt like the game could have ended after the theatre part.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-19,"it's just a nonsensical revenge plot. both characters are absolute mass murderers and everyone is shitty in it. i kind of liked it while playing it even though it was way too long, should have ended on the first day 3 then thinking through it the character development and plot was just not good"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-18,maybe never
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-18,you understand all the characters are morally grey right?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-18,there really are no good or evil protagonists in both games. spoilers ahead... joel was literally a smugglerdrug dealer for 20 years before his journey with ellie which ended in him massacring a building full of scientists and doctors preventing them from making a vaccine for the infection which leads to part 2... one of those scientistsdoctors was abby's dad the only person with the knowledge to create a vaccine she got her vengeance by murdering joel which in turn made ellie go on a killing spree murdering all of abby's friends including a pregnant woman. so all that being said none of the playable characters are inherently good or evil they've all done some pretty messed up shit.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-18,"you play an evil character the whole time, in both games"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-18,why do so many people dont understand what this brilliant game is going to teach us?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-18,"they force you to try and emotionally invest in a character that noone cares about or knows. even after completing the game i still don't give a fuck about muscle girl or her sidekick. i felt as though the lesbian romance was a contrived attempt at woke bullshit noone needed or wanted. shit felt forced to me. the ending offers no kind of resolution or closure, just a bleak and depressing finish to a story that could have been better told. i'm glad you enjoyed the game, i did as well. just my opinion though."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-18,"huh. i didn't feel any of it was contrived or forced. ellie was shown to be a lesbian in left behind, 6 years before the release of part 2. i thought the abby's story was incredible and was totally drawn in and sympathetic to her perspective. so much so that at the end of the game,! i dodged and dodged abby's attacks, hoping they would stop fighting. !"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-19,woke bullshit there it is!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-18,"here a few points from what i was thinking about this game. just my opinion.  always take care about your friends, u never know what could happen joels death.  honesty is important.  life is not always easy.  ellie wasnt able to forgive joel, she wanted but suddenly it was to late.  when it comes to survival, people do bad things.  who is bad is in the eye of the beholder. for abby joel was the bad guy, for ellie abby was.  no matter how bad somwthing is, people can change or at least try to.  no matter what happens, keep moving forward. btw just the museum part is an emotional blast."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-19,"why have u been depressed? i mean yes, the ending was hitting hard. but for me it was cause this story was over."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-05-02,you're in the most open world portion of that game which does not last long.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-05-02,oh it gets more intense very soon
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-05-02,"the pace definitely picks up, especially after you shelter in the theater and start going through the different days."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-05-02,depends. did you think last of us part 1 was exciting? no? then it probably won't. yes? then it absolutely is. there is nothing less exciting about 2 than 1. so it all depends on how you liked 1.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-05-02,i played these games back to back finally last year.. highly recommend to continue on and the game definitely picks up.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-05-02,finished part 2. didnt like it. i prefer first part overall.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-05-07,"it does pick up, bu then you basically restart the game as you switch to another character. it's really tough to keep going when you are back at square one, so you might want to drop it before you get there."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-05-02,depends on how you view exciting. if you're expecting guns blazing super fast paced action then no. but there are some really amazing stealth sections with humans and infected. and the story picks up as well.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-05-02,all the excitement is gone after the first hour.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-05-02,that part felt uninteresting to me and its my all time favorite game.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-05-02,"yes it does. the initial seattle parts don't have much going on. then you go to a theater and that's sort of your base area and you go out to different missionsareas of the city after that. it's not always guns blazing, last of us should be played quietly and stealthily when possible to conserve your resources. so slow down and take it all in"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-05-02,"if you're excited by extreme boredom, then it's super exciting"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-05-02,not much happening? in the tlou part 2? when are you just riding around and needs me to press a few buttons now and again? care to point out the specific section? sounds like bullshit to me.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-05-02,"yeah, whether or not part 2 was better than part 1 overall remains polarising. but there are a few moments in 2, at least from a gameplay perspective that absolutely top part 1. two sections involving boss battles won't go into more detail to avoid spoilers even if it is a 4 year old game were extremely intense. and there were a couple of jump scares that were extremely memorable. was the game possibly too long  i'd say yes. but the gameplay absolutely had some massive peaks"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the intended sentiment means nothing when you have a small portion of the audience who can't accept two women kissing. in the age of the internet a relatively small focused group of whingers can sound much louder than they would if they had to put any actual effort into whinging via public outlets. it's also safe to assume that those who don't really care are just getting on with their lives and aren't legitimising the naysayers by arguing what is essentially a petty prejudice.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it wasent upsetting that she kissed a girl, it was uncomfortable how they focused on it so much. like if it was with a guy it would have felt just as weird to me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,doesn't bother me at all but it does seem like people make choices to just seem progressive now and that's not a good reason to do it. i don't know if that's the case here but i have zero issue with it and that's only because i'm not a piece of shit.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i felt like it was hinted at in the last of us when she speaks about how she was infected and the reaction to it that her and her friend had, which suggested to me that there was some form of romantic connection between them. however, in left behind this was confirmed as definitely being a romantic connection."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"even if it wasn't established before, who cares"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i know. im just venting a bit i guess. it just angers me is all
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,especially when they showed that fucking sick gameplay? who tf focused on the kiss when the gameplay looked that awesome? welcome to 2018 though. if a gay character is going to make people miss out on whats for sure going to be a gaming masterpiece thats on them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,probably because those gamers only exist in your head
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,wait the disney channel talked about tlou?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-17,we might find others in this game or at least one more. but i feel lile a lot of them were probably killed and or sold off as a precious commodity.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-15,you're thinking waaaaay ahead of everyone.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yay strawman
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the white military ultra alpha is living in other peoples shoes so isnt not wanting them for the sake of x the same as being unable to process living in anothers shoes?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"exactly. if a game allows me to create my character, i usually try to make it look like me. but if the game forces me to play as a woman, another race, or a gay person, i be like alright, proceed."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"well, if this is, what it takes to move on, then be it. stupid humans can't accept what is just a fact of life. nobody is writing articles about blacks are allowed to sit in the front of the bus nowadays or women are allowed to vote anymore. the same will be true of the fact, that there is and will be diversity in games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-16,"it's not going to be just that. mild bigots and their sympathizers people like you will hyperfocus on that one aspect to complain about, whilst accusing everyone else of making a big deal about it. and for the record, the existence of people who constantly complain about the inclusion of lgbt people are exactly why gaming journalist will welcome this aspect of the game. clearly, we still have a long way to go towards the acceptance of gay people in society, and no, that's not a weird thing to desire."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"not any significant number of people care. but outrage clickbait trash like polygon and kotaku and the like are going to be writing many many articles assuring you that a violent mob is frothing at the mouth and ready to take to the streets murdering any woman, gay person, or black person they set eyes on as a response."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-21,this is the commercial t i was looking for. the fact that lesbians are such a tiny  of the population and shoving that into an end of the world scenario juat isnt likely. instead of the game about a female heroin it's about a lesbia n
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,httpstwitter.comnaughtydogstatus1006350453439942656?s21 the first reply there and i was surprised how many likes it got. httpstwitter.comofaisalo1status1006402228922535936?s21
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"not gonna lie, the ellie portion of tlou1 is my favorite part of the game. so people upset about not playing as joel are just wrong."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i don't know if that's the case here but i have zero issue with it and that's only because i'm not a piece of shit. im not saying i have an issue with it because i dont, but its this kind of attitude just doesnt help anybody."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,im glad you picked up on that. her reaction really says something about it too. ellie was confused when this chick kissed her.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,did you read the comments on the thread you just commented on? theres a good handful.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the last lesbian is the best gayme showcased in 20gayteen so far. elliegbt looks like a different person though. dunno wtf they did to her face but she looks totally different from the first trailer they showed.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,gamers are fine with things if the writing is done well
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,true. i guess i shouldnt be surprised. i just thought that her sexuality was already a done deal
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"tbh thats definitely a type of lesbian. not butch, not femme, just somewhere in the middle, forever wearing collard shirts, but never flannels with the arms cut off."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"what games are you referring to that appropriate european history? honestly curious, not being flippant. as to your point about strong women, is it any different than games featuring strong men? if the character is to be strong, and happens to be a woman, i honestly dont think that matters. again, just trying to engage in civilized conversation"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"how do you engage and promote diversity within consumers themselves? by having games that don't alienate, an increased diversity of characters to play as is only going to increase diversity in the customer base which will go on to increase the diversity in the workplace where these games are made. in what world is that a bad thing?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"edit its like someone forcefeeding you pizza. sure pizza is good, but not like this. its not at all like that. she kissed a girl. thats it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,how are they shoving it down your throat?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,propaganda for what?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i guarantee you wouldnt say this shit if she kissed a dude.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,well that doesnt make any sense
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,fact factfact is a fact.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"well, i guess we might see it as them being assholes, but from their point of view, the problem may be that devs are letting politics enter the gaming sphere and dictate how to set up their games and characters. which, although that claim doesn't have any ground, hasn't been disproved. and we probably don't think it needs to be disproved so it never will be."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it might make people uncomfortable who were invested in the character. it's a character decision that they don't agree with like if a tv show kills off someone they like. that's where i'd assume it's categorized for some. edit keep forgetting there is an army of retarded kids who down vote everything.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"people are entitled to express their opinions, just as you're entitled to express yours. why do you feel that everyone should follow your train of thought?. i don't care either way, it's a game!, but irl, other people's sexual practices don't affect me and as long as i'm not involved, why should i care? when people tell me i have to support their world view, that is where i draw the line. you do you and i will do me. i don't ask for support in what i think or do, don't try and force me to agree with what you think."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,dude the trailer looked sick
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-17,it was actually a good transition too. the girl saying they should be terrified of ellie...then boom shes stabbing a guy in the neck
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"yeah, the numerous posts i've seen on here and other sites of gamers complaining about females in video games must have been hallucinations you silly plank."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"disney teen? im not sure what the channel name is, but they cut the e3 broadcast during the kiss"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yay reality
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,excellent point. i guess my distaste for it isn't that it's not reflective of my life but more so that it's the cookie cutter safe default for the majority of games. video and cinema are easily considered art but if 95 of the art at the louve was all jackson pollack style paintings people would think art is stale. i like variety personally and in the art of gaming it seems like too many are willing to go with the status quo because they don't want backlash but that's not what art is about you know?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,thats not much.. i wonder how polygon will make an article out of 2 tweets
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,and the last of us has very good writing imo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i haven't watched all of the e3 content to be able to comment fully on this year's offerings. however off the top of my head we have dice with battlefield 1 and their vast vast over representation of minorities for european factions. the ottoman empire had the palest troops on offer which is ridiculous. the same scenario is developing with battlefield v but in an even more farcical fashion. the i recall the witcher 3 developer being taken to task at the lack of minority representation in his game, to which he responded that the lore and inspiration for his game comes from a european standpoint. then we have the gear of war franchise which no one ever cares about being multi racial because it's set in a future universe. but they've added this pointless strong woman trope character out of nowhere. then we have the new assassin's creed franchise where we have african spartans in the trailer. historically something that would never ever existed because of how staunchly focused on blood purity the spartans were. its just a current theme in all entertainment platforms of late. i've seen the bbc produce tv shows that are appropriating my ethnic culture and having black characters within the stories of my heritage. around the time dunkirk was released i remember the onslaught of articles calling christopher nolan a racist for having a predominantly white production because he was maintaining historical accuracy. to be honest i fucking hate talking about race, sexuality, religion etc but it's pushed so much nowadays in everything that i'm left with no choice. i just don't buy things that are actively against what i was born as but some people seem to have an issue with that. i don't care what other people buy but a lot of people seem to care about what i don't want to buy and why."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i've yet to see any evidence that diversity is a good thing. all jokes aside the diversity is our strength meme often stinks of desperation at the futility of a nations demographic situation. in fact all evidence points towards diversity being a negative in terms of social cohesion and integration. artists, authors and other creatives have been selling their products and creations in regions other than their own for centuries. you don't need a diverse team to sell that. there is no need to promote diversity within existing companies, if you want a real diversity of choice then publishers would concentrate on acquire new devs in developing markets. that's how you get a true experience, not this artificial multicultural insult that seeks to pander to the perceptions of the white, middle class leftists that often get to set the agenda in these companies."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yeah if anything it's like watching someone eating a pizza and then screaming about how dare they. they know i'm on a diet. this is an attack
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"everything i say is a fact. i can prove it, just ask me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,neil even said once that his personal politics are central in his writing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you're right. it doesn't need to be disproved. there's been a trend lately where we've allowed it to become normal for people to make wild assertions and then let them demand it be disproved rather than hold them accountable to prove their assertions.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,why should we cater to morons who are uncomfortable with gay people.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,if the sexual orientation of an already well developed and established character causes them to be upset then they should really evaluate their opinions.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"im not saying theyre not entitled to express their opinion. they can say it all they want. all im saying is her sexuality shouldnt matter to anyone. if you want to disagree with me, you have every right to."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,best game shown for sure across all the shows. blew my mind.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-17,"was outstanding. but, people see what they want. if they wanna focus on a kiss from a developed and established character, instead of how outstanding that gameplay preview was, thats on them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you mean sites that turn 12 tweets into an article? or other posters that make up large reactions to things that never happened? or posts taken out of context like the strawman articles about bfv where they lied about what people were upset about?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"violence is fine, lesbian kiss is not."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"hard to say, the whole art needs to be about backlash kinda scream marxist vibe, its not something i generally agree with as that view tends to ignore the heart of a work for the sake of it being controversial, which when the inclusion of lgbt seems to be the hot topic of the year wouldn't doing something against lgbt be the controversial statement? when you look at uncharted series on the surface its very cookie cutter even parts below the surface are but the heart put into the work makes it shine more than trying to make it buck the trend i have nothing against variety and for a large portion we are lacking it, one if my favorite games is journey, i just find variety for the sake of variety ends up being poorly written or ends up just a cookie cutter on being different a lot of the time sadly this years line up still comes out rather unoriginal with many of the companies doing sequels or following trends or appealing to money"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,perhaps im blowing it out of proportion. ive seen a few more on facebook and youtube.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i have heard that, its just difficult for me to get past the stealth aspects, it was also a generalized statement as to writing and insertion in general over just tlou franchise"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the fuck do you mean actively against what i was born as?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"as long as it's personal, that's all good. let all him express what he believes in in his own game"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"exactly. hence this will always be a problem because there will always be that small few that will assert such accusations, and the many will just dismiss it as we've done now."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,how are you catering to them? and why do people have to be comfortable with gay people? i personally am but i don't feel people have to like or feel comfortable with them i just expect them to treat them with decency and respect as humans. be grossed out with the sex all you want for all i care.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,they can have their opinions just like you can have yours. they aren't hurting anybody by being uncomfortable with lesbians.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,lmao you found the devils advocate!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i find it rather odd that you're all in a tizzy over what people think of a video game. are you one of those liberals in training? you know the type, they're the ones that hate anyone that has a differing view to the one that they hold and would actually go out from their college campuses etc to do harm to people that don't think like they do. seems that you're the one taking issue with what people think about what people think, what may not be an issue for you, is for other people. if this was a real life scenario rather than a game that people play i could partially understand your soap boxing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,no....no i don't mean those things....but please feel free to make up what i mean in your own head. it makes for a solid argument.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i totally see what your saying and my point wasn't that art needs to be risqu for the sake of being risqu i also feel that takes away from the artists intent. i just feel like we've gotten so used to the same thing over and over and it's boring. not to say uncharted isn't good. it's great but that game series also has a very solid story and tells it well. uncharted is a bit of an outlier but a great counter argument. how do you feel about this lesbian kiss is it shoving propaganda down people's throats? does it not bother you at all? or are you somewhere in the middle?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"last one is missing, oh well, still a handfull of accounts, this isnt something the scale of womensmarch, that would be a legitimate concern"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i just dont see value in advertising hate, be it towards a videogame kiss or a dragon in a childrens movie getting a gf, it wont do anything other than cement their hatred"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,an evil pale skinned heterosexual male of european descent with no confusion about what gender i am.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that is such a blanket statement. just because someone isn't physically hurting someone doesn't mean they aren't making them upset and invalidating their existence.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"its just an issue i feel very strongly about, and i wanted to share my opinion. i dont hate other people with differing opinions. if i came off as hateful i apologize."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"theres literally people in this thread doing the thing and they are like where, bro, right here i guess their reading capabilities are selective along with their sight?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"honestly i never got that far in the original so i don't know her full story or character development, is this out of left field? i cant really say for sure, since i am a lesbian i know what opinion people tell me i am supposed to have whenever this topic comes up, but its all about writing for me really if it comes across hamfisted or tacked on for the sake of it i will have issues, take mass effect andromeda for example, the engineer just blurts out they are trans for no reason with no real context or forethought put into it. with ellie it doesn't appear that being a lesbian is the be all end all of the character or completely come out of nowhere like if they randomly made joel gay despite there being no inclination, history or signs and him having had a wife in the past"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"yeah, i guess im just blowing it out of proportion. i just wanted to share my opinion is all"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,jesus christ. ok lol. good luck with your horrifying oppression. sending prayers.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"don't apologise, your view is your view. you just seemed a little too concerned about something that is essentially a video game and not real life. the world would be a very boring place if everyone thought the same thing. have a good day."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i got yah. i feel the same way as a gay white american male. if the story is good and characters well thought out and developed they can be any gender or race. hell if they made a story compelling enough and relevant throw in someone who is a furry i don't care. it's the tacked on stuff with no compelling reason that grates me.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i honestly feel like the people like this who feel oppressed need to just consider if they're bthe arseholes. as also a straight white male, and knowing many others, i have literally never felt oppressed or excluded because of my race in a way that i didn't think was totally reasonable."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,thanks bro. remember that every like represents a prayer to god.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,they are clearly just incredibly dumb to think they are oppressed because all of a sudden people who arent them are standing up for themselves
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,crackling audio guy just got fired that's for sure.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"good trailers and announcements, but hot damn the stream was a mess. constant incorrect camera feeds, random voices talking over announcers, audio feedback, just a pure av mess."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,well. i'm whelmed.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"sony's games were really strong, but microsoft still had the best conference. sony showed 9 games, main titles not receiving release dates besides spiderman. still have no idea what death stranding is. spidermantloughost were definitely the highlights but that's all."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"besides the big gap between last of us and the rest of the conference, i liked that they went from game to game to game with no wasted stops to talk to game developers. even after major game trailers."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,am i the only one who thought sony's conference was no where near as good as microsoft's?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,pretty meh conference tbh. nothing blew me out of left field. a lot of what i expected.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"after microsoft's presentation i just can't see how people think sony nailed this presentation. largely trailers for games with already seen, little gameplay of the games we haven't seen, bad pacing music solos? really? and not many titles shown, lots of technical problems... this was on the same level as square enix and ubisoft to me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i am probably in the minority, but i thought that conference was pretty meh bordering on bad"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"spider man is gonna be awesome, thanks alot for this dude"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"ghosts looks like shadow of mordor in japan, so that looks fun."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,less than 20 minutes of games once you put in all the music solos unexplained music bits how could anyone think this won? it had some quality in it but overall? lukewarm
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"honestly, i think sony losing to xbox at this years e3 is a good thing for us gamers. it gives xbox a better push forward in the race so sony isn't dominating, and if a company dominates, they stop trying ...like here, i guess. of course, sony won this gen 100, but competition is good for the industry. sony might be in the position where they have to make a new lbp game or a jak game, and who doesn't want that? with that said though, wow. no medievil, only 3 new games, probably not all exclusive to sony, and sony's twitch crashed. bethesda tes fan here  xbox  sony  ubisoft  square  ea here's hoping nintendo can redeem this e3. personally hoping for a new fzero."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,want to give you a big thanks! really love all of these you've done! one more conference to go!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"great looking games, but terrible conference imo."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,your bias definitely shows.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,man that was quick. thanks!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"ghost of tsushima, nioh 2, spiderman all looked sick. control is interesting looking as well. solid overall."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,game reveal wise microsoft killed it this year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"look, admittedly the conference definitely picked up in pace after they moved rooms. but seriously? that much time on tlou? a fifteen minute intermission with sony's own fake press roundtable? musical concerts are nice but only when you have momentum. no release dates except for re2? just four showcase titles that felt super scripted? no developers talking about their games? no other announcements? this year was sony's conference to losethey had so much momentum and such strong drive behind them. and then they blew it. nintendo not factored in, my current ranking is definitely as follows 1. ubisoft  killed it in every sense, except i wish more new game announcements happened. 2. microsoft  tons of focus on the games, the console's ability to make playing games easier, and acquisitions that will make the next generation way easier on them. i preferred ubisoft, but microsoft was damn close. 3. bethesda  pretty good. some high moments, some low moments, some great reveals, and some points where we were left with two many worrying questions that shouldn't have been there. 4. sony  good games content, but a clusterfuck of a show. 5. square enix  basically nothing new, just trailers, and almost all repeats. why did they even have a conference? 6. ea  lolwut?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i was pretty underwhelmed. the last of us and spider man looked good, none of the other games piqued my interest, really. hoping nintendo has some surprises tomorrow."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,where the fuck was red dead
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,definitely a little bit biased with your overall review there. games were good of course but the random intermission and overly long instrumentals kind of killed the momentum. a lot of the gameplay show also looks scripted with characters slowly walking into perfect set ups. spiderman looked the best from a gameplay point of view i would say.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,spiderman arkham city
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i'm sad
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,still no idea what the fuck is death stranding. no ffvii at all which is weird and a little concerning now. i suppose after kh3 they will talk about it more.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"to anybody complaining about no red dead redemption 2 there were no indications rdr2 would be shown. rockstar doesn't do e3. they don't really like to share the spotlight with anybody else. i can understand you wanting to see something because i do too, but it was never going to be there so you were setting yourself up for disappointment. i mean, maybe they'll show up in the next few days, but i wouldn't count on it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"pretty boring considering how many of them we've known about and seen over and over. last of us still has no release date. what killed me the most was the lack of variety, other than kh3 and trover, it felt like i was watching a bunch of really long movie trailers. they all are hyper realistic, story driven, third person and more zombies than i'd like to have in a single conference. don't get me wrong, they are astoundingly beautiful and will probably have great story and gameplay. it just felt a bit empty."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that was bad
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm actually playing spiderman at sony this week, it's ridiculously fun. reminds me a lot of prototype 2. unlock new spiderman skins as you level up. really fun, coming from an xbox gamer too."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that wasn't good.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"didnt expect nioh 2. 1 was incredible, the combat was better than soulsborne games, but the enemy variety could use some work. hopefully they'll fix that up."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"as a fan of eastern aesthetics and culture, i love how many games this year are going the feudal japan route."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the games shown are looking great, and i'm sure they could have pulled together another dozen games that are 45 years away from completion and shocked the audience. but honestly the structure and presentation of this show was awful. when they are sinking millions into putting this show on for the world why does it come off feeling like a rushed high school presentation?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,rip ff7
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i was disappointed by this one . it was the worst one for them in years . no real future games except control . i want to see future games too . days gone was a no show and rdr2 was a no show !!!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"to be honest, i love showcase of gameplays than multiple trailers or teasers. at least i know what i'm getting with my money. too many people are hyped up with a 3 mins scripted trailer but ended up getting a game that is no way comparable to the hype it garnered."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,thanks again uloffeno!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i get what they were trying to do with the start but that intermission dragged and took away from the rest of the content even though the integration of the church setting into tlou was sublime. imo, they should've started with spiderman and ended with tlou. spiderman is 3 months away and is prime for the start of your showcase and then you end with the long term aaa release. nonetheless, the footage for both looked great as for the rest, that samurai game looked amazing as did control. still not sure what death stranding is but it should be cool and atmospheric. kh3 adding pirates is terrific as well. the only game i didn't really care for was the roiland game and i'm too young to have much hype for re2. i was hoping we would get information on 1 other superhero project either rocksteady's alleged superman game or square's avengers project but that proved to be too high a hope. all in all, great footage but poor organisation and structure of a presentation. bring on nintendo!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,after the last of us part ii showing it didn't matter what came next. i was happy.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"am i the only one who just doesn't get how tlou is people's favorite game of all time? i think it was just so hyped and by the time i played it, it felt like a bit if a let down. i'll still play the sequel just can't get as hyped about it as others."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"if you missed it, do yourself a favor and check out the gameplay demo from after the presentation. can't find it on youtube yet but it is beautiful."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you the real mvp for this break down. i totally forgot sony's breifing was tonight
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,something to add is they said there will be new game  in god of war during that intermission
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"here i am, just wishing rocksteady would announce what theyre doing, ever, at all..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the good... the games. a couple of game i already knew i wanted, a couple that i might be interested in. a couple meh games that looked pretty. the bad... the over 2 hours it took them to show 10 games. could have done a lot better with the pacing getting to the meat of the presentation."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"based on this conference, is the next playstation going to be at the next e3?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,looking forward to sony's new exclusive game the adventures of fluteman  banjoboi
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"meh. not a great conference, some good games but no surprises really. at the minute xbox have still had the best conference, but of course nintendo will probably steal the show yet again, can't wait til tonight!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"why the fuck did they do that long intermission, i thought sony knew how to layout things by now"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"after reading this chat, i genuinely don't understand the fighting over console exclusives and their value. i suppose i come from a weird place in the fight since i own both consoles anyway, but i still find the fighting over which console has better exclusives and wanting a winner between xbox one and ps4 to be stupid. do you need validation for your purchase decision?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,why is no one talking about re2?? they're remaking a classic from the ps1 era and it's freaking amazing!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,ghost of tsushima reminded me a lot of assassin's creed. i don't know if that's a good or a bad thing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,dying at all these people complaining about not being blown away by some big announcement when they literally said they weren't doing that. edit and what the fuck is with this whole obsession with you all and winning e3? who the hell cares? is it just something meaningless you can all beat your dicks about?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,more spidey fuck yeah!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,death stranding stole the show. looks amazing. my frustration on silent hills being cancelled has subsided.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you honest to goodness think sony is winning e3?? i honestly wouldn't rate their show much above ea's to be totally honest.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,hearing that the infamous guys are behind ghost of tsushima is very hype inducing. infamous 1 and 2 were amazing games and i can't wait to see where they take this new ip.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm pretty suprised they didn't show more. maybe they're being stretched thin for content inbetween e3, they're own show and gamescom?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,whats new game when talking about a game? ive seen this a couple times this e3 and im not sure what that even means.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,only excited for spiderman
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,during the fake roundtable thing they straight up said not to expect any big announcements or surprises. they didn't lie about that at least.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"spiderman release september 07, 2019 one of the villains you are missing is mister negative"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,ghost of tsushima and sekiro shadows die twice in the same e3? we now samurai boys and girls!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,can't wait any longer for spiderman. finally a good one after spiderman 2. also i was hoping for remake 2 and yep there it is
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what the heck happened to days gone ? they showed the game for the last 2 years and now they just throw some random frames of it into the vr part ?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"these breakdowns should be pinned at the top instead the official mega thread where theres no information and people just comment silly quotes that make no sense if you didnt watch. seriously though, thank you so much for making these breakdown posts."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,during twice stream crashed they showed destiny 2 forsaken. showing cayde 6 being killed by the prince.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the first building people were sitting in was designed to look like the building from tlou trailer, which made for a cool transition to the trailer. also the minor music sections between trailers like the guitarplaying banana were from the game dreams, which was discussed more after the conference."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"resident evil 2 blew everything from every conference out of the fucking water for me. my favourite game of all time being completely remade, i can't fucking wait baby!!!!!!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"as someone without a leg in the race between xbox and sony neither really blew me away, sony's conference however had too much cringe compared to microsoft... the intermissions were beyond annoying the first time i just wanted to click away so i did and i came back after like 10 minutes and they were still on the fucking intermission! over all so far my favorite conferences were bethesda and ubisoft just eaking out over xbox sony wasn't nearly as bad as ea or square enix tho."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"sure, if we ignore several 10 minute intermissions, and three concerts, it was nonstop games.... it took like 30 minutes to get to the first reveal. the format was ass."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"im surprised no one is talking about the resident evil 2 remake! ive wanted this for so long. that game was one of the first games i played as a kid, and was by far my favorite resident evil game. looks like the release date is fairly close too. sooo excited."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,kingdom hearts 3  new worlds pirates of the caribbean i'm pretty sure pirates of the carribbean were on kingdom hearts 2.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"no ff7, no red dead, no borderlands 3. dam e3 you let me down."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"no release dates as far as i remember. that sucks. i give it a 610 since most showed, weve already known of. what they showed was cool tho"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that last of us 2 gameplay was so clean. i'm having a hard time believing that's actually gameplay.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i was very let down by sony. everything we see we already knew was coming. what is there to get excited about it?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"this felt a lot like last years conference to me. a lot of games that look absolutely incredible but seem highly scripted and will most certainly receive a graphical downgrade prior to launch. especially considering there werent even release dates. i want games that are coming this year, not a reason to look forward to next e3. and where was days gone?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,more like the e3 press let down
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,pretty lame
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"this was the worst presentation of e3, with the best games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"sony killed it as usual i'm not a fanboy of any one platform as i'm happy to play on them all... but this was the worst presentation of this e3. the games they showed were fine, but the presentation itself was just so bland. a friend of mine pretty much nailed it  this is like watching cnn's election coverage. definitely winning e3 for me right now i've got to strongly disagree. there were no new big game reveals, no surprises, very little momentum, and minimal excitement. sony absolutely has some amazing games coming out in the next year, but i felt that they totally dropped the ball on firing up their fans with this presentation."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"every single game in that conference looked great. that was fantastic. the pacing was awful though, that huge gap between tlou and the rest of it was unacceptable. the big highlights are e3's best kh3 trailer spider man ghost of tsushima was a very pleasant surprise, will definitely be following it remake 2"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"sony killed it as usual. hahaha, are you kiddding. that was an insanely weak conference. you disgust me op."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,saw that fromsoftware logo then fuck up.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the rest of the show, it was nonstop games, literally no one talking on stage.  it was literally half the show at least it seemed of intermissions with them talking with people from the studios. i personally didn't feel like they showed that much. most of it was stuff we already knew about. it felt as if they didn't have a lot to show, so they used tons of filler content like the interviews, music, instruments, etc."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i didn't much care for it. that intermission really killed the pacing, and made me not even care about ghost. control looked alright. resident evil 2 made me most excited. the rick  mortyesque game didn't look good. nioh 2 was such a cocktease. death stranding looked really good. and spiderman as the closer pissed me off."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,for a person who doesn't own a ps4 it was fairly poo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it was terrible the intermission was ridiculous, it dragged on way longer than any conference showing so little has any right to, and we didn't even learn much. the last of us ii will be great, but the trailer looked pretty scripted and didn't tell us that much. ghosts of tsushima is probably gonna be good, but nothing in that showcase made it look fresh or unique at all compared to all the other open world games everyone is making nowadays. death stranding still feels like we know just as little about it as in 2016, so it feels a bit odd we spent so damn long on it. lastly, spiderman was the best they did actually showing something off, but most it didn't seem that new compared to what we knew from last year. everything else was glossed over extremely quickly."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,terrible conference. i am a sony fanboy all day long and i was so hyped for this one. felt like a big let down. they just threw some trailers on a screen. didn't even talk about thr new titles at all and kept subjecting us to that horrible fucking intermission panel.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i think if square combined with sony, it would turn out much better."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,holy hell this was a bad conference. glad they at least had ghost of tsushima because all the rest is anywhere from mediocre to downright abysmal.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,take my upvote! again
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,bethesda won e3 this year for me. their trailers and announcements were far more exciting than than anything sony showed.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what's the deal with the all in one kh package? does that mean that we shouldn't buy the remix games yet?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"don't care about the audio issues or awkwardness is rating these conferences. it's about the games and sony has the games i am most looking forward to l! besides bethesda, but 76 doesn't look like my thing and es6 and starfield are too far out to get hyped about. really don't care about assass creed, the divison, halo, or gears of war. just my preference, but tlou 2, spiderman, and ghosts of tshusima were the games that had actual gameplay footage that i am most excited for. death stranding may be sweet too, but really, it's all just confusing intrigue at this point."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,stayed up for the xbox conference and was disappointed. didn't stay up for the other ones and don't regret it. maybe i'm getting old but these conferences just aren't exciting anymore. i don't even think it's because of the leaks. i miss the hiccups and fuckups. now you just have one guy on stage and a load of prerecorded videos. hardly any live gameplay stuff. may as well just be a nintendo direct if they pull this shit.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"nothing about destiny 2, im surprised"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"there isn't multiple porter's in the trailer, sam just had his hair up. threw me off as well."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,does anyone have a link to the last of us ii footage?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,ghost of tsushima just made me cry a little. it is just beautiful beyond words. death stranding is just fascinating. it's just peak kojima. dracin looks like the kind of game i could absolutely love and it's made by the great gaming melancholic miyazaki himself! i'll watch that very closely. didn't really care for the rest.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,tlou also has pistol silencers.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"so, no ff7 remake ? also this all package games in ps4, is this part of the limited edition kingdom hearts 3 or something separate entirely ?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"some gameplay sections of characters walking, but they showed different characters so there may be multiple playable characters for me it looked like, its still reedus but with short hair. if you notice the scene where he pulls out his toe nail you can see its reedus, but got shorter hair. a few scenes later, shortly before he pulls out his gun from the suitcase you can see he got a little pony tail. so i assume you have a growing hair mechanic like in witcher 3."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"holy shit, don't read the comments on the yt video for the trailer for control remedy. sony fanboys claiming it's an exclusive and xbox fanboys claiming sony is out of ideas so they are ripping off quantum break. even though it's not an exclusive..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i was including some of the smaller ones like tunic and ori as well. i only do that because no mans sky was considered an exclusive even though it eventually came to xbox. a lot of the smaller games they showed that were launch exclusives. if you go by major releases, then yes, i agree with you. otherwise if you go by timed exclusives along with major releases, id say the point still stands."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"now that were getting kh3, i have a feeling death stranding wont come out for another 5 years..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,hmm that open world japanese game sounds good but thats really all that peaks my interest. too many artsymovie style games. at least there will be non exclusives to play.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"all this thread needs is links to the trailers in your description, or even time stamps, but im guessing with how quick you put these up that would be difficultimpossible. thanks for the work dude!"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i didn't get a chance to watch the microsoft e3 conference but i watched the sony conference in hopes of seeing spyro. after watching this conference i am even more tempted to get a ps4 over an xbox one. were the xbox one games just as good or was sony the clear winner on games? it should be noted that i have never watched e3 before and haven't followed the gaming scene for about 6 years so i have no idea if these games look amazing or if they are just the norm now.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"so is death stranding a ps4 exclusive? also, i need ghosts and last of us 2 now, so time to upgrade my ps3 to a ps4"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i'd say sony tries to keep things different every year and hats off to that. i guess the transition from the church to the main stage was a bit slow for the viewers at home but from the looks of it was an awesome experience for the people present at the showcase. the games as usual were awesome and love that sony first party deals primarily with single player games. i would say the show was awesome and this year both sony and microsoft had a good show at e3

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"trailers for games that have already been seen not entirely true. the destiny 2 forsaken story reveal was new. it depicted cayde6, a fanfavorite character, kneeling, battered, worn, and alone. he is slowly surrounded by the scorn, who are seemingly being led by prince uldren. one of the scorn snipes caydes ghost, and then uldren proceeds to kill cayde using caydes own weapon, the ace of spades."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,was really disappointed by sony this year. not very many surprises or new games we didn't already know about were announced or shown.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"you know what i dont like about sony conferences? they dont talk about the games between trailers, its just trailers one after another. i guess the majority of people dont like the talking and just want to see games, but i really miss it when its not there."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i have to be honest, this was underwhelming. i'd say it was only slightly better than ea's, and on par with ubisoft. it makes me feel like they are planning on dumping the ps4 next year and they didn't want to push out a ton of new games. the stage switch was totally unnecessary too. just show us some fucking games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the last of us 2 looks amazing obviously. and ghosts of tsushima is something ive wanted ever since way of the samurai, i was erect for the whole trailer. but sadly, as big of a kingdom hearts fan as i am, kh3 just doesnt do anything for me. maybe it was what they showed but something just seemed off. im not a fan of frozen and tangled so maybe thats whats putting me off. ive waited half of my life for kh3, i just want it to be good and right now im a little nervous"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,fucking last of us looks like tomb raider but its gay
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,pretty disappointing. cant see how people can be that hyped about this show. even when someone is biased

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,at this point i'm just over death stranding. either show us it or don't. i'm actually tired of being baited along with little to no idea what's happening for the third year in a row.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sony did great but i am obligated to say the conference was shit bc no ffvii announcement. i seriously hyped myself way too much and that pretty much ruined the whole conference for me.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i think sony are being very clever here, it's obvious they have a ton of new games in the pipeline but they're holding anouncements back until the games are closer to completion. the situation with few exclusives at microsoft makes this doable in my opinion. i've a feeling that they may be holding a few back for next gen also. i can see a ps5 announcement next year."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"seems they ran out of ideas for re , you guys think there will be a new onimusha anytime soon?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,only thing i got excited for was nioh 2... oh well there is always next year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i know kh series waz a sony exclusive but i am pretty salty that they aren't bringing the previous games to xbox. i mean why the hell not? if they're gonna bring kh3 to xbox why not let xbox players have the previous games? so tht fans who maybe dont have a ps4 relive the series as well.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you mean spiderman.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i think m was very impressive too the way the just said that they bought 5 game studios casually and the hilarious gears of war troll they pulled off. but men am i hyped for cyberpunk.. they really kept the best for last... i just hope there is no exclusivity with that one since pc is bae
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sony had a lot of variety. xbox with the same old brainless fps titles. pass. we'll see what nintendo has coming up.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,ellie kissed a girl and liked it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,thankfully they didn't have any awkward people on stage and it was all about the games. that alone made it the best conference so far for me.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"as a tlou specialist, ellie cannot craft bombs but she can smoke bombs, and they've changed the ingredients for crafting sugar is gone, binding is gone so no more melee upgrades or they only take blade, scrap is added. it looks like rag is also gone replaced by gasoline. overall, this should make the crafting a bit better in the story, although i wonder what med kits will take to make, given the legit choice in the first game to make molotovs or med kits on the harder difficulties."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,is there a video for spiderman?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm primarily a sony fan but, good lord.. the stream is just an absolute shit show. people going through one room to another? what's up with that? the presentors are doing some cringy impromptu talk. a guy picking up the signal and talking while one of the presentors is playing the spiderman demo. a weird cut between the trailers and the musical thing. solid games though, especially with ghost of tsushima. the whole sony e3 presentation is an accurate depiction of good idea, terrible execution."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"its funny because i was watching the stream with little to no audio at work and i thought the conference was amazing. came to the stream just for the last of us, but watched the whole thing cause i was basically hooked with just seeing the trailers lol."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"in the trailer they said that the monsters fastforward you. i think they carry cloned fetus of themselves so when the monsters attack, he ages rapidly and gets eaten while the fetus also ages to become an adult him and carries over the memories somehow"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,pretty sure kojima and norman just did a bunch of acid and fucked around in a cgi studio
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"new world is fucked. beings cause time to slip forward. infrastructure all shit cause gets fast forwarded and crumbles. humanity relies on special couriers to transport stuff. couriers have extinction markers, either dna or some innate shit that allows them to sense these beings that fast forward time. couriers carry their baby clones with them hooked to their consciousness via a cord. if they get caught by the beings and go forward in time their body will whither and die, the baby will fast forward and become an adult while the consciousness is uploaded from old body to new quote in trailer about norman reedus surviving if caught but the area around him will become a withered crater. famous people each different courier companies. maybe combat, lot's of hiking"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it's a multiplayer battle royale game.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,a studio let kojima do whatever he wanted. kojima's a crazy talented but i think he's nuts. i'm fearful that the game is going to be a big mess because noone is there to tell him 'no'. that being said i think there are going to be some elements that are going to be sensational because of that.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"given how close kh3 is, it's no surprise that they want to keep the focus on it. i imagine we'll see a lot more of ffvii next year"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it's probably put aside for ps5 now. there's just no way it's ever coming to this system.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"they pretty much fired everyone working on it and started from scratch, so we wont see much for a while and when we do it will probably look completely different from what we have seen."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it killed the conference for me. i really don't know why they did it. they had the formula for these things figured out.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"there was no surprise, no real excitement. you could hear it in the audience. red dead would've saved it, because death stranding and kh3 were just utterly confusing. at the end i kept exclaiming to myself that people actually paid for the privilege to see it in person."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i'm let down tbh
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i honestly was waiting for the main show, and just now noticed the stream said postgame show. thought it was looking hella hype if this is what they started with. still want most of them, but certainly super whelmed as well."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,how? they had amazing games. i guess only a few though
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,microsoft came in strong and set the bar high. i have been disappointed by everything after. nintendo should be a treat though
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yeah i have still have some grudges against microsoft but they hands down had the best conference. just game after game with a couple minute talks for their major releases.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i totally agree with you even when i don't have a xbox and will probably get all the games sony showed, i think microsoft's was indeed better, presentation and content wise."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,they also showed mostly multi platform games that are also coming to the ps4 though. so half their conference may as well have been part of sonys anyway.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"microsoft had the better conference but you can still play all of their games on pc and most of the ones they showed also on playstation so sony will continue to dominate them. mostly every game playstation showed is only on playstation maybe nioh goes to xbox also? . also sony literally said they were changing it up this year and instead of announcing tons of games they were going to deep dive on 4 big games which they did, long gameplay sequences of tlou2 and ghost of tsushima and spiderman and pretty long trailergameplay? of death stranding. i would prefer a mix of both maybe like deep dive on games soon to come out like spiderman while also revealing more new games but i absolutely loved the big gameplay sections from tlou2 and ghost so i cant really complain. i think they will see how this did and change it up again for next year."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"quantity doesn't beat quality, at least for me. i was only interested in a few of the 50 games they showed, as i assume most is the case for most people. not to mention only 18 of those games are exclusive and a majority of those are platformers or other small indies. i still think sony's exclusives are stronger, but i'll be picking up halo and a few others."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"this surprises me. i really didn't care much for microsoft's presentation. it felt like a shotgun blast where they just hoped they showed enough things that something would stick while sony had a much more curated presentation. all personal preference of course, but when sony gets me excited about the same number of games as microsoft did while showing off a fifth as many, that's impressive to me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,there were game trailers?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"also despite being a short list, everything looked extremely polished and unique and almost entirely gameplay trailers."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,why stop to talk to developers about games we've known about for over a year?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yeah all four of them
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you're definitely not the only one.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i think that's the general consensus, but fanboys seem to be arguing with anyone who has that opinion"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"conference wasn't as good as ms  agreed. microsoft caught some steam coming out first. even with a lot of multiplatform titles, it still won due to a good pacing, structure and just the fact that it showed those games first."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yeah what happened to the massive release trailer rapid fire? they're 34 filler time like all the other shitter companies now.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"yes and i own a playstee. sonys focusing too much on weird eccentric movie style games. every game is some attempt at an edgy philisophical drama and after working all day, thats the last thing i want to focus on."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i agree with you. structurally, it was horrible. revealing only one new game in the first 30 minutes of a show is a bad call, no matter what the game is. then to have an intermission afterwards because they had to shuffle everyone from one hall to another? terrible idea. it's like they tried to come up with a cute gimmick but they could've had a bunch of reveals in that time instead and had a better show."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"if microsoft just showed their games, would you be saying the same thing?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i feel like something went wrong with their original plan. the extra long break after showing tlou2 was weird and felt improv. and then they revealed a new game by from software after the conference appeared to be done, that a bunch of people missed. apparently they didnt even show the trailer on the playstation stream, it was only shown on the twitch stream lol edit guess not. my friend said it wasn't on the ps stream, but he must've just missed it. and god of war is getting a new game mode, but it wasn't mentioned in the conference. the game trailers were awesome, but the conference format was really awkward."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"with only 1 of the 4 tentpole games having a release date in 2018. well be lucky if tlou2 is 2019, but death stranding and ghost are most likely 2020."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"because microsoft was showing third party games that are most of a greatest hits of e3 2018, and less showing you reasons to buy their system. openingly admiring they're just now buying studios to make games for them, not even actually telling you any names, screams that they don't give a shit about xb1 at this point."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you're probably in the majority then
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"after the first 35 minutes or so, i was ready to say it flatout sucked. it picked it up later, but damn that was a lot of painful waiting."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"same, other than tlou everything was meh. death stranding just looks meh, think kojima isn't half as good at making games as people say he is. spider man looks pretty generic for a super hero game. the samurai game looked okay but didn't look like anything that hasn't been done before. conference and its games were lackluster. nothing really that pushes or makes me hyped."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,honestly thats the game im most excited for from playstation. i dont get the hype for last of us. it looks the same. im sure im gonna play it anyways
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,if this game has a nemesis esq system ill venmo you 100

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"they didn't show 20 games that were multiplatform, not sure how that even matters. you can tack on a vast majority of what microsoft showed, being ps4xb1 releases, to what sony had tonight."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the banjo music was essetially the theme for tlou. the random fruit was from the game dreams that was explained. the music before ghosts of tshusima may have been unexplained but fit with the theme. didn't really watch the other conferences so not making a statement there either way, but i enjoyed the music and didn't find it unexplained."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,each to their own but i thought the bethesda conference was bad.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"how did they lose? because microsoft will release a forza game in 2018? they showcased a bunch of third party games that you can keep buying on your ps4. they didn't show anything that would make someone buy an xbox 1 at this point in time, if they haven't already."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,if you are a tes fan i dont see how you can put bethesda first after seeing that blades bullshit. i have never seen something more cash grabby and terrible in my entire life. i thought it was another joke like the alexa thing for the entire time todd was talking about it. i honestly still cant believe its real. and a 34 second clip saying tes6which todd already said last year they were making in no way makes them the best conference. for me bethesda was 3rd last ea and squenix were worse and i am a fucking massive tes fan.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,shoudn't it be microsoft and not xbox? i own both pc and ps4 and i have no desire to buy an xbox because i know i can play all the games on my pc.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"this does not change the race at all. i have both consoles. play my ps4 a lot more, but not solely. sony has sold twice as many units and will continue to do so. xbox is not gonna reframe the race this late. sony has not stopped trying. thats ridiculous. they tried something different and it failed. their messaging has been consistent. deeper around our core exclusive titles this year. they have worked to cultivate the best and deepest talent filled studios, and it worked. they focused on those stories."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the microsoft one felt a lot like, look we are getting all these previous ps4 exclusives too. while sony's was like here you go a lot of gameplay and story on our new exclusives. felt like microsoft was playing catch up obviously not for all the games. ubisoft did a good job indeed, and i'm not hype on bethesda's games so for me sony did a great job, perhaps second best to ubisoft first place for me at least as i am more interested in the titles sony showed."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i laughed when i saw the division trailer started playing . they try to hype it so hard with these beautiful trailers but the graphics aren't going to look half that good . just like when they showed it the first time .
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,fans apparently only want an hour and half of teaser after teaser of games that won't come out for 3 plus years on consoles they don't own yet.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"hype does nothing but ruin experiences for people. you want hype to garner interest, but when expectations are built to such insanely high levels, it gets to a point where there is no way the game can actually live up to them."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i kinda in the same boat as you but i can see why people love it, from a storytelling perspective is a video game masterpiece, if it wasn't just because i don't think the gameplay holds as equally i'd be praising it too."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"tbh i think the majority of sony exclusives are let downs they all get 10's then you play them and you sit there wondering why it got a 10 when most of their exclusives have become crytek games look pretty but have terrible gameplay. but then again when you compare it to xbox that just seem to release terrible games, i think the whole standard of what is a good game now has lowered massively. the witcher 3 is the only game worthy of 1010 this gen."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"doesn't change the fact that it was a clusterfuck of a conference. just because they set the bar low doesn't mean hitting that bar is any better. and you can focus on only a few games, but damn, keep the momentum going all the way through. a 15 minute intermission? 2 musical sections? no release dates for anything except a remake? very little active gameplay in 3 of the 4 main games? it's not about being blown away by some big announcement. it's big underwhelmed by the fact that even with the bar they set, they executed terribly."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it's ok that their conference sucked because they said it was gonna be weak beforehand.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"honestly the fact that all that was shown was loosely scripted gameplay with zero release dates is an absolute fuck up, i mean these are games that have been announced for over two years mostly, they should at least have a year or something."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the gameplay looked like long boring walks from cutscene to cutscene, did we see the same thing?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"idk, death stranding didn't have nearly as much actual gameplay or interaction to steal the show in any way. it lost in pretty much every regard to tlou2."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"you start the game over, but keep all the gear and levels from your first playthrough. the game is also made more difficult."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i agree, i really like the longer gameplay segments however, especially that it helps see more of the game. i prefer a lot of what other conferences do with talking but i dislike half cutscene half gameplay mashup compilations, much prefer the gameplay reveal their games have."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"microsoft had no reasons to buy an xbox 1 though, with gearshaloforza already having iterations on the xbox 1. if that didn't sell you by now, chances are these new versions won't either. everything else was multiplatform."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"if you played the first one, that was a part of ellies character that was fleshed out in the dlc and at least in this trailer, it juxtaposed how different her life inside her enclave is a complete opposite of the vicious and visceral nature of hers that was on display during gameplay. it wasnt shoehorned, it fit already established character lore so i dont get the idea this is propaganda at this point."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,like gay people and women exist?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what aren't you getting? you play a guy making deliveries across a world that's undergone some kind of cataclysm. you avoid the monsters and shoot guys. they strongly hinted at some kind of time warp mechanic where the monsters send you back in time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"both sony and ms have a shitton of splinter cell reskin games where you watch a characters ass for 30 hours while taking cover and button mashing during cutscenes. i applaud splinter cell and resident evil 4 for changing every single single player game into a clone of them. and now i can add breath of the wild to the list. for instance, death stranding is botw but carrying large backpacks, tlou2 is splinter cellre4 but with lara croft as the main character, halo infinite is botw but its first person. every single game is just coverzombies or coverlara croft again"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,thats fine. microsoft is trying to build xbox into a brand and not a console. exclusives are anticonsumer and eventually people will think back on game consoles like we do on dvds. microsoft is building towards the future after the the xbox one launch flop while sony rides the popularity wave for as long as it can.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,ms has the best console for multiplats though so it's not too surprising to see them show those off
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"but it wasnt part of sonys. thats why it was the stronger of the two in my opinion. microsoft did a much better job of getting people excited about all the games theyll be able to play on the one regardless of whether they also had the option of playing them elsewhere. sony seemed to only be concerned with showing off the stuff youd only be able to play on their console. microsoft had a gaming show. sony has a sony show. subconsciously, it made me start considering rebuying the one until i went through everything one by one and realized id be able to play most of the things i was interested in on my ps4. still, the effect was strong, and i imagine will have a strong impact on those who have neither console."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"80, more like. 50 games, 18 exclusives. 35 of their presentation was sony, basically. edit 60, sorry. 25 leaves 35 being sony stuff."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,microsoft is pushin the play anywhere feature. of course you can play them on pc too. thats the point.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,quality over quantity.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"what do we actually know about tlou? death stranding? ghosts? re2? nioh 2? control? they could of talked about any of those games if they wanted to. i'd listen, but i also appreciate leaving that to the rest of the e3 days."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,every developer that talked at e3 was probably for a game we have known about for over a year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,10 and how many of those can you play on xbox?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the only people i see arguing are people like you who are really fucking butthurt that microsoft has the lower tier console this gen, and all by their own design."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"and dropping halo, forza and gears in the same conference? i dont think thats ever happened before!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sony fired most of there shots with the really good 2018 releases and is now left with a handful of games not coming in the near future.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i believe so yes. if both companies only showed their games, microsoft still would have shown more as they have 2 platforms essentially. no matter if you buy it on pc or xbox, thats a sale for ms and they just showed more by volume and possibly in quality depending upon your perspective. i love sony and have owned my ps4 for twice as long as my xbox, but as a matter of fact, xbox just had more and stuff i liked and more in general. i liked the ps4 stuff, but if im buying or stuck with one right now, id go with xbox due to the studio acquisitions and the sheer volume of games that are coming and will look good on it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it looked like they went to a different buildingtent or whatever it was just so a guy could play a banjo and watch tlos 2 and then a 20 min break so he could change to play a flute in an entirely different building
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i was watching the playstation stream on youtube on ps4. no issues with my feed, saw the extra trailer."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i saw the trailer on the playstation stream. i really wanted it to be bloodborne 2 when they said from software. i was bitterly disappointed.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"because microsoft was showing third party games that are most of a greatest hits of e3 2018, and less showing you reasons to buy their system. they showed 18 15 exclusives, which is more than what sony even showed in their entire conference. all to be released in the next 12 months. openingly admiring they're just now buying studios to make games for them, not even actually telling you any names, screams that they don't give a shit about xb1 at this point. you are hugely mistaken, and it's a shame you'll be missing out on the benefits of their ecosystem because of it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i don't think that's a good thing...usually a good thing is, that was so amazing it felt like it went by so fast!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"seriously, whats with the collared shirt over tshirt look? its as bad as sneaning and needs its own name."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"at least they had guys come out on stage that weren't some guy in sandals playing the flute for the local christmas carol. 5 aaa games doesn't even beat bethesda, shit even nintendo is probably going to kick sony's ass"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i thought sony had it in the bag and that it was their conference to lose, and that nintendo could steal it. now microsoft is on top, sony dropped the ball, and nintendo is still a major unknown except for what is basically guaranteed game of the show smash bros."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i definitely think nintendo will kick sony's ass, but it will be tough taking down what microsoft and bethesda have come out with, and this is coming from someone who only has a pc and switch. unless nintendo is going to have 45 minutes of pure new title after new title, they are going to need a pokemon mmo or something to make big enough waves"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"nintendo could show only a black screen and nintoddlers would still say they won e3. nintendo will definitly not win e3 if they just show the same games they always do. another smash, another animal crossing, another pikmin..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i thought xbox showed a lot of content after content without interrupting to much imo.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you need you watch the xbox conference before saying that.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it clearly wasn't less than 20 minuites. lou2 was 11 minutes of footage alone. it was prob 3540 mins of stuff, not sure why op said that number"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,so basically everyone wants what nintendo is doing and do a 2025 minute revealtrailer after revealtrailer
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"if i wanted just trailer to trailer, i would wait until it was over and watch a youtube playlist of all the trailers. also there were cuts, the 5 second music bits, and multiple intermissions"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"not a lot of content aside from fallout 76, but they did announce some pretty exciting new stuff."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"bethesda was really bad, they spent 20 minutes on a garbage mobile skyrim game portrait mode omg!!! instead they show us one pictures of skyrim and starfield."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i believe he speaks only in terms of e3 conference. he doesn't disagree that this gen was won by sony.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,why are you on every damn comment shit talking ms? it's okay that you're too poor to afford both consoles. but give it a damn rest.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,xbox is a windows 10 platform. that's what makes microsoft's side of things so unique.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"well, good thing they just announced acquiring five studios. microsoft lost this generation, but they just put themselves in a fantastic position for the next generation."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yes.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"ghost of tsushima is yes, nioh 2 also samurai will be on pc well the first one is anyways."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it is indeed a ps4 exclusive.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"half expected it to be onimusha at first. but, this is just as sexy."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i was gonna say lmao. did my stream cut or something?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"ironic that you say that. i could not disagree more and think it's the exact opposite. not only did microsoft show off way more exclusives fifteen with a ton of gameplay for almost every one, but sony's gameplay couldn't have looked more scripted and tightly choreographed than it was. not only did microsoft premiere a ridiculously high number of games, but sony premiered two games, both with no gameplay, both multiplat. i still don't know how much of spiderman is qtes and scripted sections because all the gameplay demos we get is so heavy in them. and death stranding still has nothing except walking around. there were literally only two games where your description appliednier automata and kingdom hearts iii. sony showed one game for fifteen minutes, then had a fifteen minute intermission. then it started to pick up. but all the while, all the bullet points i mentioned. and in the whole conference one game got a release date."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i mean, ms are playing catchup. and judging by their conference, they're making the right moves. we'll have to see what comes from these 5 new studios, but ninja theory was a great call, along with finally bringing playground games into the fold. all the rumours have been that the latter are working on a new fable game, but i have a feeling that might be coming from the newly created santa monica instead."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,my problem is that sony showed only 4 games and i would bet a hefty amount of cash that those same games will be shown at e3 again next year. excluding spiderman
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,they show trailers occasionally at one of the major conferences
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,a 30 sec rushed gameplay in a 3 mins trailer doesn't tell me much of the game. i prefer they give us a dedicated 510mins of gameplay like spiderman or god of war.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,same with watch dogs. i was immensely disappointed.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"ubisoft are a bunch of liars in my eyes at this point. i don't care what they announce or release any more, i know i won't be buying their games."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,thank
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"definitely. while xboxs presentation of games was great, the actual content was lacking. i was looking for exciting new ip and i didnt get that. multiplatforms is nice, but with microsofts drought of not on playstation content majority multi platform is not going to cut it. people are acting like fallout 76 is an xbox game because xbox presented it. no. i cant get excited for halo because i played halo 4 and 5. why would i be excited for halo after that? im cautiously optimistic. this really is the make or break moment with me when it comes to halo. if the campaign is more garbage i dont have to go back ever again. not excited for forza because driving games are just not me thing. ive played a bunch and i just dont get the appeal. i never played gears. the concept and design just didnt appeal to me. crackdown is cool, but it should have come out 2 years ago. based on what they did show nothing says it was worth 2 years of extra development time ill get ori 2 because its ori and im a sucker for that crap. when it comes to xbox, i was looking for a hook and i didnt get one. it was a cool 20182019 showcase, but not a worthwhile xbox showcase. sony seems to have the opposite problem. they showed a few games, majority exclusive, but took a few too many steps into, get on with it. funny, i said that sony could be a few steps ahead of xbox if sony showed some gameplay. they did, but it was still lacking. they needed less gameplay and discussion and more games. they wanted to avoid the oh, well play this in 3 years joke that has plagued them in past e3s. doubleedged sword i guess. neither of them really hit what i needed them too. both were close, and both were kinda meh. i dont know. 610 for both."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i get where you're coming from, ms clearly need new ip's, and i doubt you'll find anybody but the most fervent fan boys who'd disagree with that. but gearshaloforza already having iterations on the xbox 1 is such a weak argument. they're huge franchises that have massive followings. by that logic, why should anyone be getting hyped about tlou2, we've already got one on ps4 albeit a remaster? would people not be losing their collective shit if sony had announced uncharted 5?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,0.01 of actual combatants yet somehow they somehow manage to show up in every single cobat game now. very equality such progressive wow. stronk and independant.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i agree. enough suspense and setting for me to buy. dont need the whole game spelled out for me before i play it.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i believe they announced it last year at e3.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"you read an accurate summary of the monsters mechanic. something that was already hinted at in previous trailer, with people rapidly aging before our eyes, choosing to kill themselves over getting eaten and carrying the yellow tanks with them."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"all the trailers have been great so far. absolutely bonkers, but great."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,whatever that fuck is i want it.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that's an instant buy then.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i thought i was the only person on earth to play that game. it's honestly amazing!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,remember the del toro trailer everything was still based on mysterious time effects. the black sludge advances on del toro so he immediately hooks in his baby. the planes and tanks have some weird black effect trailing from them indicating that they are not from current time and maybe brought back or forwards through timefall. it's all very unexplained. mad's has old skeleton soldiers that he drenched up from the dead. idk if mads has a strong extinction factor allowing him to not only see these time effects but also change them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,kill him!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,seriously? that is very very depressing. fuck konami.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"he also said that he would go against that statement for kojima. the filmmaker reiterated that hes pretty much done with video games after this last disappointment. except with this man, ill do whatever the fuck he wants, del toro said, indicating kojima. httpswww.vg247.com20160218guillermodeltoroilldowhateverkojimawants"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'd actually be happy with that, it looks absolutely gorgeous so i'd be perfectly happy with shadow of the collossus, but kojima. but we did see what appeared to be a stealth section, and he pulls out a rifle at one point. plus there's all those zombie dudes from the last trailer."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,he had some sort of gun near the end so theres probably at least one mechanic that were not seeing. im expecting a kind of survivalhorror experience where its mostly sneaking around whatever those shadow things are.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,seems kind of early if that's the only reason you bought it. i recall last year they specifically said an ffvii remake wouldn't even start until kh3 was done.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"well, i thought kingdom hearts 3 and final fantasy xv were coming out on ps3 when i bought it, so.... edit keep in mind that sony always kills it on exclusives. the last of us was worth the purchase alone."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,nice
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"playstation 76 is a console, and also at the same time, it's a battle royale multiplayer game. but it's still a console. and a battle royale. eat it, switch."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"strip away the fanboy and it kinda makes sense though. sure its disappointing that they didnt try as hard this year, but they dont really need to. sales are still stable so i'm sure they are gonna wait till those start to lul before they try super hard again. also sony likes to announce alot of their stuff at tgs."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that much is obvious. the game is heavily influenced by arkham been calling it batman arkham spider since reveal lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i was waiting only for medievil personally
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,they mentioned dreams later
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,no final fantasy 7? what's the point in a project like ff7 remake if you can't milk it for all it is worth at these events?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"shit, i forgot about medievil. now i'm concerned we might not see it this year."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"new game announcements,only one was nioh 2 actually giving release dates or windows for their major games that have been announced for years actually showing us what death stranding is after 3 years and 4 trailers a good,slick,problemfree and cringefree streampresentation"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i thought most people agreed bethesda beat out ubisoft easily? ubi let down a lot of people with no splinter cell despite all the hype, assassin's creed was already leaked and people aren't as excited as usual because origins is still new so they're starting to saturate like they did in the rogueunitysyndicate years, siege took up a very long segment with no announcements except esports bs. i know it's all subjective, so in your opinion, why is ubisoft up there with xbox? i thought xbox and bethesda both killed it and sony and ubi are the next best as both had mediocre conferences with one or two great trailers and both suffered from multiple av fuckups."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you shouldn't be downvoted for stating you're opinion.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yeah op is a sony fanboy. he was commenting in his xbox thread trashing ms. shits lame. i have bith consolesthinking of grabbing a switch today too but havent decided. xbox absolutely beat sony at e3 this year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i disagree, sony showed gameplay, they didn't waste time with dumb speeches about how their games are different. they just let their work do the talking."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,microsoft showed off 18 exclusive games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you obviously didn't watch microsoft's conference because one of the main ideas was 18 exclusives. which is almost 25 of what they showed.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,cry more?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,microsoft and specifically phil spencer stated that they'll focus on exclusives more since it is what's missing from xbox. without exclusives a console is dead since there is no reason to buy one otherwise.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,deleted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"sure it is a wondertale playing games on whatever you like. however, exclusivity still makes ps seem vastly more special, even just timed ones. just tlou2 is solely making the ps a strong brand in my oppinion, whereas the xbox feels forgotten, and i just know microsoft launched a lot of things that i might consider for pc. so it might build microsoft as a brand, but it imo it makes the sony and ps stronger brandwise, as a console choice. games i wish i had on pc it makes me feel like, so that is doing it well imo even if i surely wish it was avaible here. microsoft had a solid good presentation surely!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,remind me which company supported hddvd over blu ray?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"... microsoft is announcing game studios they just now got, 5 years into a console with maybe a 7 year life span. there's no way you can actually spin that to be positive. their press conference was 90 games i will buy on my ps4, so thanks for showing them to me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you're really bad at math
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"even then it looks like a slow year for sony. don't get me wrong, most everything shown looks spectacular, but it doesn't seem like enough right now. hopefully next e3 is better"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i mean.. we know a lot about re2. it's been out for about 20 years.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"a few of them at least. the others i'll play on my playstation. your point? this conference was presented terribly, i'm sorry but the truth hurts, it was a total let down. the 4 big games look great, but the show itself was just bad."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"actually at least half of them. and microsoft showed off 15 exclusives. many of them world premieres. if you want to turn this into a quantity contest, microsoft easily beat sony this year."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,get a job and get both consoles. you'll stop being such a cringey twat who feels the need to attack whichever console mommy didnt buy him for christmas.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"say what? this aint 2013 bud, and even more blatant is the fact that you seem to be very triggered yourself."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"not being a fanboy but can you expand on this when saying  if both companies would only showed their games microsoft would still win? if talking about major releases or triple a as everyone addresses them nowadays microsoft has halo, gears, forza, crackdown which are good franchises in their own right but it's nothing new. sony has death stranding, the last of us part ii, ghost of tsushima, and spiderman with only tlou2 being a sequel. so i would say they are kinda equal."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i think that is why it wasn't part of the main stream and was shown afterwards. it definitely didn't look like something that people would expect out of a from software title. not saying it will be bad, but i can see why people would be disappointed."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"they showed 18 exclusives they really didn'thttpsca.ign.comwikise3gamesate32018. the exclusives they did have were mostly small indie gamesdlc. both studios really only showed 2 or 3 big exclusives worth talking about. spiderman, tlou, ghost of tsushima, death stranding vs forza, crackdown, gears, halo. big corps buying small studios shouldn't be a positive, it usually means tighter restraints on the studio which makes worse games, which results in the studio being shutdown and then you get cc on mobile. all in all no one really won e3, anything worth talking about won't be here for years."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"out of all the exclusives they showed only small indies and crackdown which looks quite meh to be honest, forza and gears are xbox exclusives for real. the rest are coming to other platforms too. microsoft just basically stole all the big e3 announcements and made it seem as if they we're their own. what has xbox got so far? sea of thieves, state of decay, forza and halo? compare that to horizon, persona, uncharted, gow, tlou, nioh... should i even keep going. microsoft is trying to sell a console at a higher price that the competition's with objectively worse games, and that's that."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"you do realize that sony has far more exclusives than microsoft, right? really, this dickwaving about exclusives honestly shows that you understand the one is fragile. i loved my 360, and was rooting for the one, but they made some very severe mistakes and sank their own battleship. sony has outsold them and had vastly more exclusives over the life of this generation that are 1 high sellers, and 2 highly regarded by critics and gamers alike. there's nothing to microsoft's xbox 'ecosystem' that isn't already available on the ps4. fucking origin offers a lot of the services that xbox one does. origin. stop being juvenile. it's okay to like the xbox one, but give it a rest. microsoft's dick was massive last gen compared to sony, and they went all flaccid this generation while sony's knocking shit off tables just by turning around. here's to hoping microsoft will do better next gen."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you mean fallout 76 where everyone has mixed feeling about it due to questionable choices in making it always online? or the teaser about tes vi that shows absolutely nothing besides its title?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"those 5 triple aaa titles all showed gameplay and were absolutely amazing. bethesda had mixed reception with fallout 76 and didn't show anything than a title screen for tes6. you can have you're opinions, but i think bethesda was an ok conference. sony and xbox are the top dogs right now at e3."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"a lot of people haven't mentioned this but they essentially have four conventions where they announce games e3, paris games week, tokyo game show, and playstation experience more emphasis of e3 and psx. this makes their e3 presentation a lot more lackluster because they actually save new games for psx now."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"with that pokemon go switch thing coming soon, there's no way they'll show off the pokemon 2019, that's probably going to get announced like in january and more trailers during e3 next year. they have metroid, smash, and a bunch of other stuff that's expected to get shown and will no doubt be amazing"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,don't ever underestimate the power of super smash bros.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i've only briefly skimmed through each of the shows. what did microsoft come out with that was so great?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,which is weird too because phil spencer talked for a good 10 minutes total. they really managed to balance everything well
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,multiple intermissions? there was one. maybe i miss remembering but just the one after last of us.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"check you're facts before commenting champ. unless it's someone like miyamoto, then nobody really cares about the interviews and shit."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,id say xbox is a windows platform.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"so... they basically said fuck xb1 owners. yeah, that'll go over well when people turn in their xboxes for next generation"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,damn really wanted to play this. the sword fighting didn't look like a mash the same lightheavy button fighter.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i may be a bit biased since tlou is my favorite game and i am always looking forward to more info and that i just watched this. but you are right microsoft seems to be doing good things. nier and kh3 should be experienced by everyone so i am glad they are on xbox too.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"when is halo coming out? when is gears coming out? what reason do you have to buy an xbox again? cause those two games already have xbox 1 interations, and the system sure as hell ain't doing that hot regardless."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"microsoft did not show 15 exclusive games. literally every game shown there can be played on pc as well and all but 3 gears, halo, forza are probably also on ps4. every game sony showed except nioh and kh3 i believe and i guess maybe re7 remake are only on playstation. also i vastly prefer these deep dives on games with actual gameplay instead of a random 1 minute cgi trailer. like the ubisoft beyond good and evil thing, yeah its pretty cool but we have no clue if it will look anything like that in game how it plays or anything. so maybe for people who only watch e3 microsoft won but as a gamer sony was vastly superior, and while microsoft still insists on putting all of their games on pc as well as xbox they will never outsell a sony console, its just a fact of life."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"that intermission was so the entire audience could move to a different location, and they said that. but when you're a kid, observation is difficult, i know."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"they shouldn't show them? well, we saw tes6 this year. better not ever show it again? oo"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yeah true. so hyped for those four games though haha.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,basically one. the gta5 ps4xb1 rerelease. not exactly the most ambitious debut.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i do agree,i think is a matter of time or of what the developers are ready to show at that time."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"you are a deluded idiot. ubisoft have really come on lately. they saved for honor and siege from being failures both are now on the rise again, siege especially. ac origins was great and odyssey is looking awesome as well. the crew 2 is also much better than the first. the division 1 is very good now in its current state with lots of content and end game, if 2 can carry this on it will be very good. stop hating on ubisoft... they had one terrible year when unity released but since then they have only improved year after year."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"titles, really"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,am i the only one who just doesn't get how katamari damacy is people's favorite game of all time? damn right you are.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"yep, your right they showed one for re2, my mistake. still was hoping for at least a year or something from one of their three main games that they showed."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"oh please, i'm obviously not saying rush it but perhaps they shouldn't announce a game four years before it's probably gonna come out. or they shouldn't wait until a couple of months before the game is released to actually announce a release date. it's not about the development of the games, it's about the way they market the majority of their games, which in my opinion is really sub par."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,honestly this is true 610 for both of them this year.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"while they didn't announce too much new only two or three games?, they showed off amazing things for what they had.  a healthy amount of developers talking passionately about their games without going for too long.  extended, unscripted gameplay for their previously announced games.  tons of release dates, many in the near future late 2018, early 2019  a live concert at the height of their momentum for donkey kong, followed by a release date  the star fox crossover reveal  further post launch support for games that have really picked up since launch for honor, rainbow six siege the whole thing felt very friendly and approachable. microsoft showed off more, especially stuff we hadn't seen before, and was also very approachable. but ubisoft's felt like it had just a bit more heart behind it."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"whoops, 15 exclusives, not 18. i was trying to remember the breakdown they gave at the beginning. that's still more than what sony showed overall. their budget sizes shouldn't matter to anyone. personally, i'll take the indiesover the majority of what sony showed. i have zero interest in spiderman for example, both in games, comics and movies. big corps buying small studios shouldn't be a positive, it usually means tighter restraints on the studio which makes worse games, which results in the studio being shutdown and then you get cc on mobile. this purchase from microsoft shows that it's a different microsoft in control here. a post i saw the other day explains this perfectly httpswww.reddit.comrmicrosoftcomments8q82g2microsoftaddsfivebiggamingstudiostoitse0h8ts5  the more i think about it, the more it seems like a choice that only a new microsoft would make.   the old microsoft would have made massive, highprofile acquisitions with tons of money put into them. instead, it's a new studio in socal headed by a reputable veteran and aimed at grabbing possible talent leaks from hangar 13 and infinity ward, two studios that they have funded since their inceptions, and two studios that match the company's vision. the vision here goes along with xbox game pass which aims to populate lots of small and midsized games and have a steady stream of them. the acquisition of ninja theory, in particular, is very highly applauded in this regard. it's not to turn the studio into aaa machine, but to support the independent aaa methodology the company established with the last year's hellblade.   all of this feels very natural, with seemingly no clash of culture. it's no secret that bungie and rare did not get around very well with microsoft studios executives, but they have been trying to make better choices in the last few years. this acquisition news perfectly encapsulates that. good choice."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it usually means tighter restraints on the studio which makes worse games just like when naughty dog was bought by sony... oh wait, they were actually given far more freedom than ever before due to access to ridiculous amounts and types of resources. then they went on to create two of playstation's best ip's with uncharted and the last of us. tldr you don't know what you're talking about."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"crackdown? oh, you mean the super extreme hyper terry crews simulatortm?!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"out of all the exclusives they showed only small indies and crackdown which looks quite meh to be honest, forza and gears are xbox exclusives for real. the rest are coming to other platforms too. wait, so you're writing off indie games just because? alright then. microsoft just basically stole all the big e3 announcements and made it seem as if they we're their own. and sony could have quite easily done the same. but the games microsoft showed are all best played on xbox or windows 10. what has xbox got so far? sea of thieves, state of decay, forza and halo? compare that to horizon, persona, uncharted, gow, tlou, nioh... should i even keep going.  do you literally only play exclusive aaa titles on your console? if so, then that's really sad. you're missing out on a lot of fantastic games. microsoft is trying to sell a console at a higher price that the competition's with objectively worse games, and that's that. well, that's not that, because it plays all of the non exclusives better than the competition, and then more with backwards compatibility."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,not everyone. i thought that looked great. plus the online idea seems fun. thought fallout four would be fun to play with others. now we get it on this one.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"while that's true, that doesn't change the two key facts we're dealing with  it was a far inferior conference to microsoft's this year  it was a far inferior conference to sony's past few years"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"cyberpunk, shadows die twice, devil may cry, fallout, forza, metro exodus, and dying light ii were pretty great"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"50 games talked about, 18 world premieres and 15 exclusives. they acquired four 1st party studios and formed one so 5 new studios. they briefly talked about improvements with xbox software game pass, faststart i think it was called. yes many games are multi platform, but showcasing them on the current most advanced console means something and had quite a few japanese games which have been sorely missing from xbox."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,how long did there conference go for? it was about 1h 45min right?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i mean if you want to try and target me by my name which i made for runescape when i was seven then okay but still doesn't give you much to 'hype' about that pathetic thing sony calls a conference

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what? not at all. that's what the other dozens or so announced games were for.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,nintendo dropped the wiiu after 4 years and the switch isn't backwards compatible with it. i don't remember a big uproar from the community so i don't think people will be upset when the generation arrives.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"there is the from software game coming out on xbox multiplat which has a samurai flair to it. cant recall what its called right now, but it was premiered at the microsoft conference."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"you can feel free to prefer sony's, especially if tlou2 is hotly anticipated as it is. i would never take that away from you. i was only pointing out the strangeness in this statement the microsoft one felt a lot like, look we are getting all these previous ps4 exclusives too. while sony's was like here you go a lot of gameplay and story on our new exclusives."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"halo's usually released within a year, maybe year and a half, of its announcement. same with gears. cause those two games already have xbox 1 interations, and the system sure as hell ain't doing that hot regardless. i mean, other games such as crackdown 3 were also shown off. also, while 1 of each of those series got iterations thus far, neither was that good. this is another opportunity for them to produce a real system seller with each. now, i don't trust 343 with halo at all, but the revisiting of the old art style makes me a bit more hopeful this time around."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"after the sony conference i barely have any reason to buy a ps4, the only thing that somewhat interested me was tlou2"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"ps is the only division keeping sonys head above water at this point. its great that they are putting out some great games to stay profittable but the sad reality is sony likely wont be a company anymore 20 years down the line. and if ms goes with the approach it looks like they are where they are gonna start pumping thier xbox division with cash, ps could die in the next 2 generations from the sole fact that they dont have the money to keep up. ms can release consoles that dwarf sonys in power and sell them cheaper to destroy sonys console division because well, they can. they have the money for that loss to not put a real dent in them. sont doesnt."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,just because there's a reason behind it doesn't mean it wasn't dumb in the first place.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i agree that they shouldn't announce games so early. bethesda announcing tes vi now is nonsense, they obviously have absolutely nothing to show about it. with that being said, i feel like every game showcased during sony's conference were already to the point of being announced. surely it would have been better if they hadn't already been announced 1 or 2 years ago. e3 became the dicklength contest we now know, pushing each dev to announce their games as soon as possible. i like that sony is now willing to talk only about upcoming games and major hits they cannot afford not to  la tlou 2. they could have shown more, they are currently working on many games. heck, they have ff7. they could have gone the easy way though they chose not to showcase it. i like that they stick to fewer games, already well developped. they'll release them as soon as they can don't worry about that."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm obviously not saying rush it but perhaps they shouldn't announce a game four years before it's probably gonna come out yea, no one else at e3 has done that this year."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,indeed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,because ever since then the market has been oversaturated with games trying to copy it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-13,it looked like kh battle system with an ffvii skin. the actual release could be entirely different.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-13,"ha! thats mainly why i liked it. i personally dont like fps at all, though that seems to be the most popular. different strokes for different folks"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"twitch chat absolutely blew up with hate when they started the music and dancing people to announce just dance 4?, but to be honest, even though it's really not for me it was fucking catchy and 1010 advertisement."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"oh, i agree about that, i was just specifically talking about the amount of games. i was a little disappointed there wasn't more content concerning siege."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the release dates is absolutely a problem. i found the musical performances to set the tone very well. and i agree with your complaint about the intermission.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"how is forza horizon 4 irrelevant? if racing games aren't your bag, fine, but you can't deny that that it's a stunning game and does have a huge following. it's been the best racing franchise in the market for some time now, i'd hardly call that irrelevant."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i mean sony only showed 5 exclusives tlou, spiderman, ghost, death stranding, trover. not really a forza fan, but it's hard to say it's not the best racing game out there."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i personally don't like any major companies acquiring small developers. it's usually a bad sign for the quality of the game the developer is going to make in the future and the life span of the developer is usually shortened.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"or they will be shut down and have loved franchises run into the ground until it hits rock bottom with a shit mobile game announced at e3. when you pay a monthly fee, you also can't call it free."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"you cant play 7 of them on xbox the only 5 were trover, death stranding, tlou2, ghost of tsushima, and spiderman. all the others were multiplat. 15 exclusives of which 90 were indies not only is that statement heavily reductionist and in complete denial that both ori and cuphead were two of the best games of their respective years, but it's also plain wrong. i just went through the list of the exclusives with trailers and at least half are not indie."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that's still more than what sony showed overall. their budget sizes shouldn't matter to anyone. idk just how many different platformers can you get excited about? it's kind of dishonest to even say 15. when you start counting dlc for sea of thieves you are kind of stretching at that point.  this purchase from microsoft shows that it's a different microsoft in control here. a post i saw the other day explains this perfectly hopefully that is true and it's not just a reaction to sony showing off so many indies last year and dominating the news and sales.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-13,you shouldn't overlook what happened to rare after microsoft acquired them though.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm not denying that. however, when sony also focuses on psx as it's other primary reveal conference it takes away from their e3 showing. the last of us part ii was announced last psx and if it had been announced here everyone would have thought it was a better conference. microsoft only focuses on e3 and it looks like they're actually trying to publish console selling games now. psx is to blame for this year and last years conference not living up to expectations. edit think better of the sony conference, not necessarily better than microsoft's conference."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"totally agree, i just feel like i keep seeing trailers and clips for games and yet i don't actually know much about these games. the games look amazing but as far as i know they never come out and actually talk about what you do in the game, or the story in the game, and so i'm just left with so many questions. edit i know that trailers can show you parts of the gameplay and story, but sometimes a small 5 minute video is representative of the game on a whole."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"microsoft's best selling point was their commitment to adding their biggest offerings to game pass. their exclusives this year were not that exciting. halo and gears are good but not coming any time soon, and the rest are niche or small."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-13,what happened? afaik they didnt get shut down and are still making popular games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"1 i didn't make a rule vs exception statement, you did. i provided evidence that your general rule is bullshit. if you claim this is one of few exceptions, i can go look at other studios that were purchased when i get out of work, because i'm now even more interested. but regardless, if a single one out of 20 studio purchases contributes what naughty dog has, it's worth 19 closed studios. 2 what does knowing the inner workings of naughty dog have to do with anything? i know and you should too, unless you're very ignorant that year 2000 sony had more money, more employees, and more technological expertise than year 2000 naughty dog. you know that, right? it's important that you know that. 3 your original point works better for 3rd party publishers. those companies want to see the highest possible profits and do not care to build brand recognition. this is why companies like ea scrap devs like you mentioned microsoftsony don't scrap them as much, which i think contributed to your confusion on the matter. microsoft and somy are more willing to sink in resources and invest because they're not looking to maximize profits on each game's revenue  they're looking to build the brand itself, investing more sacrificing more in the present for better returns in the future more people choosing your console and purchasing more games from you even the multiplatform games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you have a gaming pc. you are not the target they're going for but nevertheless xbox is a windows 10 platform and therefore you're included in it. don't you have enough on there to play?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,no you're right if sony dropped naughty dog they would be broke and naughty dog is totally the rule and not exception.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-13,it may just be that i don't play a lot of triple a games so i'm not bogged down by the first person shooters. i'm still stuck in a top down rpg game phase.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i really liked ghost of tsushima. not a big fan of the first tlou but this one's graphics look amazing. not worth staying up at 3am for extremely disappointed.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i am most certainly not defending sony's release schedule. i've been waiting for a majority of the games they showed for 3 years. but to counter your point, sea of thieves needs more content to even be enjoyable and pubg is a broken mess on xbox. god of war getting a new game plus mode is more exciting than either of those announcements to me. i didn't even remember the other games on your list after xbox slammed 40 more crossplatform trailers at me and i probably won't be buying them."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i didnt say sonys conference was better. but are you really counting dlc as a game presentation? lets erase the dlcs so 3 out of 8 are indies. isnt pubg already released? so 3 out of 7. tunic is only timed exclusive but lets count that. xboxs conference was the one i most liked but not because of xbox but because of the games i can play on my ps4 or pc. xbox is not trying to get buyers to buy a xbox. sony is delivering awesome exclusive titles so gamers will buy the ps4 while microsoft is delaying or cancelling game after game. this is just a speculation but if the new ps and xbox are coming in 2020 then gears and halo most likely wont be on xbox one
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-21,one gameplay sequence that plays exactly like kingdom hearts isn't enough to convince me they had built anything for ffvii at the time.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"microsoft is delaying or cancelling game after game only recent delay that comes to mind is crackdown, and only cancellation is scalebound rip. that's hardly game after game. and sony might be in the same boat, but we'll never know because they don't seem to be too keen on announcing release dates. things seem to have gone very quiet on shunmue 3 and the ffvii remaster, for example."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"personally i don't like it for 2 reasons. the gameplay, while exzellent is very long and repetetive tbh. after 20 hours it's kinda dragging. the story wants to make you feel a certain way, and does so brilliantly, i just don't like what it makes me feel about the characters it revolves around. hope that helps."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"yes absolutely, one of if not the best story driven games of all time, it was worth the full price at launch and is worth every penny on a discount. don't mind the people who didn't enjoy it, play it for yourself and enjoy it for what it is."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"1 million percent worth it. i'd pay full price for it again. part ii is even better then the first one, a masterpiece of a game imo"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"its a wonderful game that does something unique with its characters that alot of other story games fail to realize. and that is the fact that humans are irrational, when they lose someone they love they can lose their humanity, sembelence of safety, and ruin their judgement. they can lose control and make choices that dont make sense because were human. people shit on the story because ellie makes choices that they dont like, that they feel adds shit and unrealistic details to a story bevause the choices made make no sense. but most people for some reason expect humans to make 100 efficient choices that are best for everybody regardless of how their judgement is affected or the mindset they have"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,yep fantastic game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"after having only played part 2, is it worth it for me to get part 1 remastered?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"its one of the finest games ive ever played. i understand people dont like a particularly dark story but if you can handle it, its an absolutely unforgettable experience."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,it's worth full price
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,hell yes! it's worth full price imo.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"part 2 is fantastic. definitely play the first if you havent already, its a direct continuation of that one. the story is dark and raw, super emotional, and i think it does a great job representing how a world like that would operate. it takes you on a roller coaster, some people dont like that, but its definitely worth it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"definitely, i put off playing it for a long time because of certain story bits i'd heard about that put me off. i finally played it and can honestly say its up there as one of the best single player experiences i've played."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"yes. i believe the first game did a lot more with a lot less, but the sequel is still excellent. bold narrative choices i don't think work in a game format, but i respect naughty dog for taking the risk."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,dont be biased about this so if you want to play a good history this is the best
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,worth it for 14 bucks but its very long. id recommend days gone for a zombie related game with a good story
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-24,you stopped halfway but somehow you know the entire plot with one character yeah right

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"jesus, someones salty"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,part 1 is arguably one of the best story based games ever
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"i love days gone!!! despite all the technical issues it had, i had such a blast playing as deacon. a shame sony doesn't see the potential in it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,i thought i already had elaborated tbh.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"i'm not anymore, but sure i'll admit i was salty about that game. the first was one of my all time favorites. what they did in 2 kind of ruined the series and characters for me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"thanks, the friend that im staying at only has pt. 2 and i dont have a ps myself, but just might pick it up for him then!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"ah i see, so u actually just have no reasoning and repeat what youve heard because ur incapable of interpreting story and cant come up with ur own thoughts about it? homie gimme some reasons, why u think its poopoo, if u agree with opinions i dont agree with of course thats fine homie, but whatre ur reasons from ur own experience with the game for it being poopoo"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"the second game was a better game all round if you ask me, plays better and has more impactful moments, story stays with you if you where invested in it....like i was. what they did in the second game may have hurt a good few fans but i myself never have a expectation going into any game no matter how much i love the last game, yes it drags along in parts and yes some story points could have been left on the cutting room floor but by the time the end credits rolled it was definitely in my top 10 favorite games of all time. it's not for everyone that's for sure but if it clicked with you no pun intended it definitely leaves a lasting mark"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,not sure what you mean. i gave six reasons in my original comment.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"i couldn't disagree more but you're entitled to your opinion. i'll agree with that the gameplay itself was a slight improvement but it didn't have the depth or challenge to keep me entertained for 2025 hours, it gets repetitive fast. everyone i know in the real world hated it, ive only ever seen people say good things about it online."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"ur not giving anything that i can point to and say ah okay i can see the thinking, jus kina giving these blanket statements that could be said about really any game. it just doesnt give any ideas of ur thinking is all"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"funny on the flip side i have never meet anyone in real life who hated it other then people online, it has the same repetitive gameplay as the first game so i can't understand that point at all in anyway, but like you said everyone has there own opinion on the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"one example cheap tropes like killing the dog, the pregnant woman or sparing abbey at the end of the game. she probably killed hundreds of people in that game without any remorse, many women, likely some of them were pregnant, but then this particular pregnant woman who was a story character we're supposed to feel bad about? and then to suddenly get a conscience at the very end of the game when it comes to killing the person who murdered joel. it was all just really lame, badly written and made no sense."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"well, repetitive gameplay gets more repetitive after 40 hours original  sequel than it does after 15 hours just original, especially when there's no longer an engaging story with likeable characters to carry it. hope that makes it more understandable."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"the whole point of the game is to show that humans can make irrational decisions especially when under pressure, when fueled with anger and the need for vengeance. multiple times in the game ellie is given a choice between the 'good' choice and the 'selfish' or 'vengeful type' or rather impulsive decisions that would probably be made by a person whos possibly in the lowest headspace theyve been in in their life. these decisions are the whole point of the story, to show that at the end of the first with joel killing abbys father was one of those decisions. an example of this outside of tlou could be in god of war 2018 when atreus impuslively did a thing people in bad headspaces often times dont make good decisions and its pretty ignorant to think otherwise. the choices made by a character in a story dont dictate every other quality of the story also killing the dog, not a trope, she killed the dog because itd realistically be there and lets be honest itd probably be pretty weird if the dog just happened to be gone and like i said, people make irrational decisions the lower they go. the whole theme of the game is 'humanity', not 'perfect choices'"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"from your standpoint yeah it makes sense, from mine still makes no sense"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-24,"honestly mate, i'm not getting into a debate about the game. all i will say is that the weight of her decision to spare anyone made no sense because the entire game i was unashamedly murdering people one after the other in brutal ways. then conveniently, when we come into contact with story characters the ones who were actually responsible for murdering joe btw, suddenly the decision to spare them or not is tough choice? this type of game is not a suitable vessel to make a commentary on moral choices such as sparing people because the structure requires you to indiscriminately murder hundreds of people for 25 hours. cheap badly written frustrating nonsense. op asked people's opinions and i gave mine. if you think the narrative is some thought provoking contemporary masterpiece then great. i thought it was cheap, lacked tact, miserable, absent of a single likeable character and unengaging."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-23,"i just mean the logic of the argument. 40 hours of doing something monotonous is more repetitive than 15 hours, right?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-11-24,"homie idk wat to tell u. that was the whole point, people make choices that dont make sense. its what makes us human, that is quite literally what the message of the game was. if u dont like that, sure. but homie, you have absolutely no clue what you are talking about this type of game is not a suitable vessel to make a commentary my brother in christ it is not that deep, its a game about humanity and choices in general. its not as black and white as u seem to want it to be"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,agreed. i played both games and nier definitely has the most phenomenal score of any game released this year. botw doesn't even come close.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"speaking as someone who played botw and nier for several dozens of hours each, i can say that i hands down pick botw. i loved nier, and its definitely my favorite pc game of all time. but it still cant even come close to botw imo. i think that the narrative of botw was very subtle, but very strong. after finishing the game and the second dlc still havent gotten around to the first, i dont even know what it is yet, i can say that the narrative totally engulfed me and i caught myself uncontrollably smiling at the key points. while nier does have an amazing score, i think the great thing about botw was that it didnt. i mean, the music was amazing, but most of your adventure was silent. it really built onto the huge world and the sensation it brought. that alone, for challenging the conventions of how a games music should be formatted, is what makes me think botw managed to outperform neir. but if im going to be totally honest, neir should have won both times. i personally feel that, even though botw was my favorite, if they were equally popular games, neir would have won. you are totally right in saying that there wasnt an equal playing field, but thats life. im sure theres a much smaller game out there with a better narrative and music than both botw and neir. maybe even petscop."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-11,maybe a game that has you slogging through tens of hours of of bland gameplay through a bland world only to have to do it all over again with even more blandness for little payoff is a bad game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,i didn't care for nier automata's narrative. the ideas were novel but the execution was poor. the plot was choppy due to the split chapters and aside from 2b and 9s none of the characters were fleshed out or had any real development.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,"this is a gamers poll, this show how people feel about the game, how they feel about the support from the developers and their experience with the game. fans voted for it, if dota and lol players felt that strong about their games it could have shown in the results."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-08,dota having a lot of cash prize doesn't make it a better or more popular esport game.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,that list is still in early access
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,yeah but le ea
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,if the category was most impactful controversy then nn would win. but it was just biggest controversy and people really freaked the fuck out over bf2

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-10,in the us
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"same here, for an early access title it feels really polished."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"you can't take 75 of this seriously, the people who voted here, or the average rgaming reader is a disgrace to the gaming market, seeing how omg i luv this game with big titties overwatch was voted into best esport at spot 1. that's a big joke. same for a lot of other categories. tells you a lot about the average consumer, even when they pretend to cry about ea doing shit, in the end they will buy every shit, i mean they can't even do a survey right  sincerely."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,"it would be for ongoing game. i took the list from the game awards show and added wow based on someones feedback. otherwise it doesnt technically fit in the realm of 2017. apologies for missing that one, i believe it only had a few other votes in said category anyways."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,it was an honorable runner in goty. i think im just going to link the full results soon.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"it's a popularity contest and his is rgaming, you think most people here would go against the circlejerk and support a ubisoft game?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,"i'm playing it right now and absolutely love it, about 30 hours in. but the first couple of hours weren't super fun and the combat was rough  i think that might hurt it quite a bit?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"i saw a comment that made me laugh which said that aloy always sounds out of breath. i did like the way they did the whole datapoints thing where you slowly pick up tiny pieces of the puzzle to put together why the world is how it is. it's one of the only games where i actually stopped to read and listen to every single note i came across. like you said, the other elements were firstclass. gonna have to call it my game of the year, didn't play botw so i wonder if that would change my mind."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,it would if best graphics were a category

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-15,"for me as a game artist, cuphead takes the cake. its the most impressive art direction i have ever seen, and its hand animated frame by frame. persona is a very stylish game but its not comparable to the kind of craftsmanship thats gone into the making of cuphead imo."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"its a popular vote, and crowds tend to go in the same direction. horizon has gotten so much love in media and online that most people will just vote for it because theyre influenced by the mainstream opinion. also, many voters may not have played the other games, and just voted for the one they knew"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"i fail to see how aloy is a mary sue. we get a montage of her training her entire life to be as skilled as she is while learning that her genius level intelligence is a result of how she was born. if you want to criticize aloy and the actors performance, by all means. but to call aloy a mary sue is being entirely unfair and dishonest to her."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"because what's the point of having a handheld category if you throw something in that can be equally argued as being a home console? may as well not have a category for it if the switch counts, because we all know best switch game would automatically just get a second award."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"the switch by technicality is originally marketed as a home console, to run alongside with the 3ds. even though it has a handheld mode, making that judgment means anything on pc can be considered a handheld game, as systems like the gpdwin exist, or simply slapping a bluetooth controller to a windows tablet."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,"because while the switch has the capability to be handheld, it's still seen an a console first and foremost by the company that creates it. also, a bit unfair for handheld only games to be going up against console games that happen to be on a device that can be played in a handheld mode. though i don't much see myself taking my switch everywhere as easily as i can my 3ds. doesn't quite fit in pockets, and probably not a good idea to anyway."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,it's because hzd was the more popular game. this entire thing was just a popularity contest. that's why cuphead and botw basically won every category they were in. you could nominate botw for best performance and it would still win over hellblade just because it's so much more popular.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-08,"this is the one that baffles me. every time i hear ashly burch speak in a game, i wonder if she's capable of expressing an emotion. if aloy turned out to be a robot in hzd, i'd have said oh, that explains the flat delivery."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-08,"i think that most people are just thinking fuck ea. and then picking the most recent time ea dicked everyone over. if they had been in reverse order, mea would have been first."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-11,"looking at the results, yes, that is a very unpopular opinion"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-14,i had the same feeling. i wanted to like it so bad.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-16,"i think it's good, but it certainly doesn't deserve some of the awards it received."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-12,"well, it's also insanely broken. i mean, i'm still having lots of fun playing it... but god damn is it unfinished. the maps are poorly designed, some shotguns can never get instant kills even at pointblank range, and war is unplayable without that jackweed announcer screaming they are building the bridge! in your earballs."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-15,"a lot of talented people worked on it, but its definitely not the sum of its parts. and furthermore it represents some extremely worrying design trends in the industry which are just plain bad for the consumer. it can rot at the bottom of every list for all i care."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-10,yep....blizzard are retarded then because the overwatch league is a thing. if it has a professional gamer scene then it is an esport. and its hell of a lot more of an esport than pubg for example
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,"uncharted 4 was not a 2017 game. do you mean lost legacy? that is a great game, excellent in fact, but it losses impact as it is essentially a super sized expansion pack and not a new game. i loved dishonored death of the outsider but it seems not one played it or remembered it. a shame, it might mean no more dishonored going forward."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"a lot of what you say shadows my opinion about botw. whenever people ask me what it is like i tell them anything you think should happen does. feel like throwing a rock down here will cause a and b to happen, it does. this makes this game really feel like a lived in world."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-12,"me too. personally i'm biased towards zelda. it's not that i don't like mario, but i never grew up with him, except for at friends' houses and such playing mariokart. and i like some of the platforming games, but surprisingly this is the first time i beat a mario game. huh. it was a new experience honestly and i liked the fact that it was more free and open than the hyperlinear designs they've previously had. it was clever, sounded amazing, and although i'm not a big fan of the art style, it did look nice. my personal favorites were the metropolis and wooded kingdoms which looked stunning. but botw was something different altogether. i had a connection the series. i was familiar with the world, but i wasn't familiar with botw's. it was different in all the best ways. not only did the game look absolutely fucking beautiful, but the word was so alive. it wasn't just a few select areas with people. there were towns all over. people travelled the roads. enemies were fairly intelligent, using weapons on the ground and other enemies as weapons. literally my only complaints about the game were weapon durability not the system itself but how extreme it was and rain when you need to climb. botw and odyssey are both something special. odyssey perfects a series classic in mario 64 haven't played it but i've heard it's amazing but botw reignites the fire in a series. it showed us that it was worth it to wait all those years for a new zelda. and i'm so fucking excited for the next game."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,"i completely agree, first couple of hours were so slow. i was just more surprised it didn't get mentioned. i know it may not be game of the year when compared with horizon only got xbox but that game looks fantastic, zelda or mario, but i figured it'd get some form of recognition from gamers considering how the franchise use to put out the games on a yearly basis. its like with origins they gave us what we want. egypt is the perfect setting, bayek may not be ezio but his motivations are understandable and it probably has one of the best looking and playing open worlds. if the full results get posted i'd like to see what people liked about it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-10,"i disagree. personally i would vote for persona but they both are well deserving. as for persona's being done before probably not to it's extent. persona 5 art direction praise doesn't lie in it being cartoon anime style but in how stylish the game does everything, especially the ui. httpsi.pinimg.comoriginals936cc7936cc7d7c3b3c23678cbcde6f6720b11.gif either way all i said is that persona should be on the top 3 and the most stylish game this year, not that it should've won."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"thats like saying super man isnt a mary sue because hes a kryptonian. in the story aloy never seems out of breath or challenged by any obstacle. the player might be, but aloy conversates as if each task was nothing even if the tasks should take an army. she does it by herself without issue"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-11,can't really blame them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-15,aint no good in trying too hard though. not every game is for everyone and thats ok!

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-10,"the combat is great, and so is the music. the story seems good on your first play through, but once you know all of the twists the game has the worst story i've ever seen. it retcons itself something is set up and retconed within the span of one cutscene once the characters actions make no sense, it tries to make you sympathise with madmen, and what little character development there is is boring or cliche."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-08,an attempt was made.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-10,definitely isn't. games worthy enough to be considered an esport are actually fun to watch. overwatch is the most boring fucking game i've ever witnessed. many others say the same. overwatch has no right to be considered the best esport game. there are games way better that have pulled way more viewership in tournaments. i'm baffled at all the 12 year olds on this sub that voted for overwatch knowing that there are far superior games and most people agree the game is not very entertaining to spectate.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"he called horizon an rpg, i wouldn't take his opinion too seriously."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"odyssey is fantastically designed, but botw was a constant new and exciting experience. i just didn't feel that from odyssey. it's the difference between the best version of something i've done before, versus trying something new in a hobby that i thought i'd never try something that felt new again. everything in odyssey impressed, but nothing surprised, not everything in botw impressed there are definitely issues, but there were just so many surprises in a games don't do that, sense. i don't know how else to describe it. but i've put like 150 hours into zelda, and maybe 40 into odyssey, and i'm still playing zelda 8 months after release and finding new stuff."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"i have so many problems with odyssey that it makes me mad that people call it wellpolished. it's not. the story is short, the ending is disappointing, moons had the same problem korok seeds did, and the fact that some of mario's moves are motion control only is a huge turnoff for me. i know i don't need the motion controls, but i hated playing in handheld because of this, and handheld was a big draw for me. smo is great, don't get me wrong, it's one of my favorite games of the year despite how i talked about it. i just don't think it's better than zelda in any way, including polish."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,but odyssey felt like it had the most clever design per square metre. that's a horrible metric to judge games on.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"yeah, i remember being stuck in the rain and being like i need to rest so this rain passes, and thinking, i wonder if i can take that metal door and wedge it here to get out of the rain so i can start a fire. everything in my video game limitations lexicon screamed this is dumb, there is no way that will work, and it did. time and time again i either discovered moments like this, or saw other people discovering things like this, and it was just a constant stream of oh, they actually thought this out to that extent? moments. from a game design perspective, i don't think anything i've ever played has had as well thought out and cohesive mechanics."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"this is true. link is somehow the fantasy of every woman in hryrule despite being a 5'3 mute, and in my case, running around wearing body paint and animal hides almost exclusively."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-10,"no.... sorry, you're not right. in any competition with scores or ranks, that standard way of dealing with a dead tie is to award them both the place that they were competing for, but give the next highest competitor two ranks below. in this case, two first places and a third. i know what i'm talking about, but please, patronize me more"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-08,"even so, i mean, it's fun, but it's not the best at anything."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-16,it's actually because they don't allow early access like steam and xbox.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-15,more so that they don't have a game preview program early access.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-10,no shit. i was questioning why it won a console exclusive award despite obviously not being exclusive.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-09,"i respect your opinion, however in regards to best esport i think it's ridiculous that cs didn't win. its esports fan base is just so much larger than that of overwatch and rocket league, and its really a unique esport in that the concept is extremely simple and you don't really need to understand any game mechanics to spectate it  everything is very intuitive in that way. even if cs didn't win, how was it not on the top 3? i mean arguably i could see lol and maybe dota being up there but rl and ow???"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"ow is good, but that's it. it's just good. how anyone prefers watching pro ow matches compared to the spl or sc ii leagues, i have no idea."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,yeah it's overrated garbage imo.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-17,"its a good, fun game. not for everyone obviously but its easily my favorite game from 2016 and well into 2017 until i got a switch. plus it does lootboxes right"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"that is why they made all the changes a few patches ago. watch a new match, it is infinitely better, easy to follow. they know it sucked before and changed it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-17,"when was the last you watched it? recently they're really pushing for esports which is a lot easier to digest and understand. the cameras move a lot more smoothly, they have replays, a top down view occasionally, and teams have their own color and white for away teams. does seem like they kind of tried to make it too much like us football though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,and it clearly is not the best esports game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-12,"thats maybe true for dota dota players tend to play only dota, they have way less games in their steam library but thats not the case at all for csgo in my experience"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-09,"i just finished the game 3 days ago. good lord, man, it's so good. botw probably still has my favorite because almost no other game uses music in the same way it does and i'm a sucker for minimalist piano and its audio design is ridiculous, but xenoblade 2 is a close second for me right now. and i'll admit it has more earworms. also, that ending theme."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"some general criticisms the world is bland looking and sort boring the side quests are basically go here, kill this robot and collect an item the supporting characters are underdeveloped and the villains are severely lacking too much of the story relies on expositional data logs the itemupgrade system requires too much grinding the game didnt need to be broken up into multiple playthroughs. 9s's story was almost identical to 2b's with 1 or 2 extra tidbits of information and the playthrough just had you repeat everything you've already done but added the hacking minigame. the game has a message that's all too familiar and redundant. we get it, ai can have feelings too, war is pointless, whats the meaning to life, yada yada yada...it's all been done before and nier automata just beats you over the head with it from start to finish. with all that being said it's still a well made game and the presentation was great. it just didnt wow me like most people."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"it's rgaming game of the year awards. it's a popularity contest. not an objectively the better game contest. again, what the fuck did you expect?"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-08,"if you think a game like botw should have music constantly playing, i feel like you really havent played the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"ehh no, that's not how it works."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,i think the audience that frequents the sub is probably not that into esports. i mean i think it's still really up in the air whether overwatch goes anywhere as an esport and this coming year is going to be a big test to see if they can actually start bringing in the viewers.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-10,"i used it as a starting point and added in many areas. we have another plan for next year. for the most part, what we have got the job done rather well. im rather positive it wouldnt have changed the top 3 in any category."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,that might explain why only 23 of people on xbox even bothered to complete the first area. they may have felt it was too slow.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,pretty sure there was controversy around greed before it's release.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-11,it's an action rpg. don't know what that guy's talking about.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-17,"no, but a single player game can't really work like that. i've had family members want to see me play it or something, but its more family friendly and available to most people rather than possible for everyone to play at once. i'd still consider mario kart better for a family though"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-11,because in our hearts and minds the ps3 stopped existing the very millisecond the ps4 was released.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,i dont have a ps4  but supposedly it's pretty great. pretty natural for people to want the best game they played this year to be goty.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-10,"the story seems good on your first play through, but once you know all of the twists the game has the worst story i've ever seen. so basically its great on your first play through then its obvious....like a lot of single playerjrpg stories."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-17,"it might not have the right to be considered the best esport, but its an esport nonetheless. with the overwatch league happening now we'll see how it plays out. also rgatekeeping"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"you do realize lots of places, including it's creators, classify it as one. i think it's far from an rpg as someone who played and loved it, but to make this comment, despite lots of outlets calling it one, is funny."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"i get that reasoning, but i think i might be slightly desensitized to that feeling of surprise. there were a lot of, wow, that's really cool moments in zelda, but my mind wasn't ever absolutely blown. i would think to myself this should be blowing my mind right now, and i was really trying to force myself to feel that feeling after a while, but it wasn't happening for me. i actually did have some of that feeling with odyssey on the other hand, especially with some of the more challenging optional extra levels. i totally get where you're coming from though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-08,"but not liking the games story, ending and objectives is something different than saying something isn't polished"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"it's not like i was actually measuring the game's quality based on that metric, it was just a way of saying i think odyssey is overall more consistent in its design than breath of the wild which has its great moments spread out more."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,it wasn't intended by the creators but the fact that you can stack two minecarts onto each other and use magnesis to with a bit of training literally fly anywhere on the map is just beyond amazing to me.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,its because rocket leaguepsyonix has terrible marketing and not really good production value compared to top tier esports. the game is pretty much soccer which is already the most viewed real life sport. idk how they havent captured a larger audience by now. i feel like latin america would eat the game up
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"nope, just a pc, switch, and an old xbox one. might get a used ps3 or ps4 when i go off to college soon though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"i agree on your point about the characters, i felt the same there. i also agree about the story not being as special as some make it out to be. my other problem was the combat. i felt that the game never forces you to play different and you fight every enemy the same. also, you are basically the same as the beginning in the end except for a few minor changes. though i heard when you max things out gameplay changes but in my playthrough to e i was never able to max everything or anything besides the engine blade. i think the bland world, although from a game standpoint is very lacking, worked for the game itself. i think people hype the multiple playthroughs a little, but i do think a and b were slightly cool in that it gives you extra tidbits second time around. it's basically continuing the story with credits inbetween. i feel like most side quest in games are the same so i never dock games for them. that being said i do think it's great at being a game, but doesn't amount to be untouchable as many claim it to be. it's an okay game overall."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"it's an dying world, what are you hoping for.  the side quests is simple, yes, but i don't think it's insignificant for it can add a lot to the game' world.  if this is about a2, yes, but only ingame.  this is personal so i don't judge you.  again, this is also personal. you don't have to do so.  i don't think of route b as another playthrough because it isn't. a normal playthough is consist of three main route, a, b, c. and i suppose you don't know the purpose of playing as 9s in route b as well?  perhaps. but it's not about the theme or the message, it's the way the story is told. if it didn't wow you then simply it isn't for you. you don't have to love everything. but you need to fully undertand the game story or at least a main part of it to bash the game for something like overhyped."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"i'd say it's more of a 3rd person action game with rpg elements, but i guess that comes down to perspective. i haven't seen many people categorize games like rise of the tomb raider as an rpg, even though it has the same rpg elements. but i'll give you the fact that rpg is vaguely defined. when i played horizon, it didn't feel like an rpg to me because leveling and progression felt very bare bones, but again, i'll admit that's just a perspective thing."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"botw purposefully has arbitrary hills and valleys although there is often still stuff, which makes the world feel bigger. odyssey obviously doesn't have this type of design since it would make no sense. if you stripped botw of the hugeness and oftenoverwhelming massiveness, it would lose a piece of its soul, imo. i personally love that there is a significant percent of the landmass in botw that is meaningless to the story, and is only there to explore. else, it would just feel like a 3d version of a link to the past, which is a tiny world, and would feel quite awkward in 3d space. although, i personally think they could have upped the walkrun speed of link. he does feel a bit slow at times, and it can slow down exploring or you could eat stuff that makes you go faster, but still."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-11,"on what platform, if i may be so bold? it's hands down the best game i've played this year. yes it has problems. the majority of the time i've played the game it was in early access. i have encountered no problems since the game's release."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"melee also has a shot at winning best esports game, despite being 16 years old."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-08,"as much as i love lol esport scene i would give the award to csgo, that game is something anyone can watch and understand while still being fun"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,they voted for pubg for best ongoing...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,"definitely. rocket league is easily my favorite game of the three on the list, but it doesn't deserve to be on the list over games like dota or csgo."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,you can get a ps3 for pretty cheap. keep in mind the ps3 version of p5 has some screen tearing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"youre assuming i dont get it. believe me, i fully understand the game's story, what im saying is that it's not particularly well done and people belittling others for not enjoying it arent as smart as they think they are."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"as someone who understands the story, i still think it's overhyped. i'm fine with claims that it's amazing, i'm fine with the ratings it got, but when i see people claiming the game is on another level or untouchable and that's a fact, which a lot do on reddit, is what leads me to say it's overhyped."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,why didnt witcher 3 win every catagory and its other choice then? not a high enough tier shitpost to be gamingcirclejerk.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-09,"with that logic, i could say the same for all superhero movies. theres one guy with superpowers and then a big evil guy that he has to beat up. and i can apply that same logic to any series theres a lot more into the timeline of zelda, and youve obviously not played or even understand enough of the games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,i'm not really sure how it's going to grow into a big esport money. don't get me wrong it could completely go bust but it's going to get a shit ton of support over the next year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-10,if our wanted me to remove games it would.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-11,nope.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-15,"well, what does rpg mean to you? hzd is a game where you run around and shoot stuff with a bow most if the time, its an action game. some rpg elements like skill trees and dialogue options have snuck into most action games, but its not really the focus and its fairly shallow."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,the backstory that you discover in hzd is pretty great. did you complete the game?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,i do  been hoping for a patch on pc so i can go ahead and purchase. narrative is a very aesthetic concept  so you get a mix of people not understanding and just a general disagreement on what resonated more. some of the most tired and overused tropes can be presented in a way that they connect with the viewerreaderplayer. we arent talking about a game with no narrative vs one with a strong narrative  they are both single player games with an emphasis generally on story. from what i've seen of both games  they seem to be really strong in different aspects of the spectrum. i really dont think fanboyism has anything to do with the majority of voters as horizon is a brand new ip. i hope i get to play both soon  holding off on buying a ps4 until i know wether or not tlou 2 is coming this gen or next.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"played both, horizon had the better story for me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,because it's funny. witcher 3 is a meme here
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-15,so this reddit thread is an accurate representation of popular opinion now? lol. is so fukin boring only 12 year olds like it isnt exactly making a great case..
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,no!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"for sure. i've actually spent more time on splatoon 2 than odyssey and breath of the wild combined, and i've spent a lot of time on breath of the wild and odyssey, so that really speaks to the fact that i've been pretty hooked on this console. as much impatience as i have for nintendo's general bullshittery, so many great hits and so much to look forward to in a single year is pretty spectacular. when i speak to people about the merits of the switch they think i'm a paid nintendo shill or something, which is pretty spectacular."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"i really should've phrased this differently, sorry. i didn't mean in literal physical space within the game world, i meant in terms of how much fun i was having with the game consistently. i was always having fun with mario odyssey. i was sometimes having fun with breath of the wild, and as the game progressed, the fun started getting more and more distant for me personally. i understand that a game like botw isn't going to have the same kind of fun as mario odyssey, but at points, it started getting a bit boring and my awe started fading. stumbling upon a huge secret was very exciting, like the first time i found one of those huge mazes, or that old temple in some valley, or the weird horse god thing, or even just finding the slightly larger than average horsespoiler, but that would only happen once every 30 hours or so. you could argue that because it's so rare for something like that to happen it adds to the experience, which is true, but not that much. maybe i'm just not a huge fan of openworld games, as i feel like the critiques i'm giving could apply to any of them. i am really happy with the direction they decided to go with breath of the wild, however. if i had any influence on the next game, i'd want them to go the same way they did after ocarina of time with majora's mask. take the same assets of the game, have a new, fresh gimmick to make gameplay more interesting, and maybe shrink the world a bit while increasing its complexity and density."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-16,they left early access on december 20th
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"oh, so it is, i got it confused because it has timed vr exclusivity on psvr."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-11,"i think you are missing the key to what i was saying, though. people don't watch starcraft because they don't play it. i'm not saying you cant watch something and enjoy it if you don't completely understand it, but people tend to watch games they play because then they do understand it"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-11,i got it on pc.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-08,moth
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-09,"i'd say that rocket league is similar in that regard, but the level of skill isn't as immediately noticeable, as most people who watch an esport have decent enough experience with first person shooters. league of legends, while even watching has a steep learning curve, it's really hard to beat in terms of a good esport to watch. i don't even like league a ton, but world's is always really interesting to watch. cs is great and all, but with the stopping and regrouping every round, it doesn't have the weight of wondering what is going to happen in a critical team fight, and how much momentum one side will give. i think a lot of this is why league is the 1 watched esport. there's something about a professional league series that is just captivating. overwatch is pretty boring to watch in the pros, idk what it is. it's just too fast or something."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,the people who play dota don't play anything else. they certainly won't come around here.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-07,"you said you fully understand it but if so why the questions? so i think the problem here is that existentialism isn't for you. about the belittling thing. yeah, that's what happens in every fandom. they just want you to experience the same feelings but the way they force you into is a bit too harsh. look, i love nierdrakengard series and i know that there are people who don't like it and i know why. but i hate the word overhyped. it's ... subjective. people don't just praise some random game' story for no reason, right?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,might have to do something with the witcher 3 coming out in 2015 and these are awards for games that came out in 2017 but i am not entirely sure that's the case
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-09,"i've been playing zelda games since i was 5 years old. in fact, i've played the legend of zelda, zelda ii the adventure of link, a link to the past, ocarina of time, majora's mask, wind waker, twilight princess, spirit tracks, breath of the wild in fact, it's probably because i've played so many zelda games that i find the story in breath of the wild particularly disappointing. i'm well aware of the divergent timelines and how the games fit into them. while that's a neat bit of lore, it does not a compelling narrative make. the story is simple as dirt, and as i said, has been told to us repeatedly before. after so many games in the series, it really wouldn't kill them to try something new and different. edit also is this you, saying that botw was your first zelda game? httpswww.reddit.comrzeldacomments7odhr8ivejustplayedmyfirstzeldatitlebotwandnow"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,well yeah but as i said having money isn't going to make the games any more fun to watch. i don't play csgo at all but enjoy watching the pro games. i have played a good deal of overwatch and have yet to find it any fun at all to watch as a pro sport.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,it's not about the story but how it's told and what nier does is revolutionary in a way hzd is not. it's a new form of storytelling and it's silly that hzd won against something so bombastic and revolutionary

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-09,"i mean league should really win it because of what it did to esports, it pushed it to a respectable level among common people and now its an important thing in the world and keeps growing but the gameplay itself could be rather confusing for people that dont play the game. overwatch should be nowhere close to winning"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-05,"as a player of dota for over a decade, i painfully admit this is true about most dota players. friends from dota rarely play other games ... only recently have a few been playing pubg. i also play league as well since beta started!, but dota is preferred."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"with rgamingcirclejerk, that 2 year gap would only help. the key word was shitpost"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-16,lol that was funny. i find zelda botw and found nier and horizon much better with the best score going to nier by far.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-15,"i disagree. to me an rpg is a game with a heavy focus on character choice. choosing what clothes to wear isnt really very impactful though. for example in pillars of eternity you visual customization is pretty limited, but instead you customize your characters personality and origin in great depth. this shapes all the interactions you have, and the way characterd will treat you. those are to me more typical rpg elements, this stuff has been streamlinedwatered down and slapped on every action game and now they call it an rpg. at the end of the day its not super important, but its just some food for thought."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-01-06,"i dont see how nier is revolutionary in terms of storytelling. ive played through all 5 major endings, the only times it ever uses interaction as a storytelling device is the very beginning of the game and the very end. beyond that, its worldfiction is very well developed and some of its mechanics and its ui is grounded in that fiction pretty well, but thats not storytelling nor is it revolutionary."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the lights dim as the sony e3 presentation is about to begin. out walks gabe, and the halflife 3 symbol flashes on to screen, burning bright against the darkness. the symbol gets jumped by a funko pop headcrab, and the words, exclusively on psn and mobile! appear underneath. gameplay footage shows all the main characters as funko pops, deployed onto the field, attempting to destroy an enemy base, with all the mechanics and microtransactions of a clash of clans ripoff. the trailer skips ahead to show multiplayer mode, an obvious battle royale mode, featuring large scale battle on a single map of large terrain. canned, prerecorded audio can be heard, as your squad congratulates you on that totally awesome kill. the crowd looks on in horror as the words preorder today to get 6 steam trading cards and 1 free month of additional challenges, used to unlock a war chest containing a new random skin! flash up on screen."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,kojima really threw in a toenail in the trailer to distract us from the fact that we still have received zero information about this game. i wonder if people will eventually get bored of the mystery of the game if they release yet another movie like trailer or will the hype maintain?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"what the hell did i just watch?! church banjo man, then gameplay. 15 minute break with awful commentary. new conference center, white asian guy playing flute. probably the most interesting game shown. more bad commentary. some more games. playstation logo comes up on screen, confusion in the crowd. conference ends abruptly with more bad commentary to follow."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i feel like death stranding is prioritizing shock value over coherent story telling, which worries me. the demos felt very scripted to me although the games look very promising. this spiderman walkthrough their doing in the post show looks like everything i hoped it would be."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"inb4 people fail to realize that console manufacturers can't premiere 5 new first party aaa titles each year because they don't release that many. with e3 and the playstation experience being revealheavy the last two years, you're going to have a dry spell for a year or two before they announce the ps5 and start showing off new titles for it. seriously, i doubt we'll see but one or two more major ps4 first party titles announced. for the foreseeable future the conferences are just going to be building on information for the titles we already know are coming. or in death stranding's case, just making us more confused. wait, i'm not in before that, because it's all people are complaining about."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i love the concept of this conference...but it's just so poorly executed. the idea of each game being shown with actual gameplay footage, and with its own experience is pretty cool. i just don't want to hear more round table talking! it's painful. edit i was wrong. this is sick."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,get ready for convoluted nonsense
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sci fi bear grills
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that fucking toenail
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,walking the game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm literally okay with just walking, finding things, and delivering them if kojima makes it. i will play it for hundreds of hours."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"so. death stranding is basically a pizza delivery game. but you deliver babies and bodies instead of pizzas, there are no cities, and at any point invisible enemies can murder you. looks nice."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"no dates for launches, they are selling smoke harder than ff7 remake back in the days or nintendo with metroid"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,so only 2 games with a release date? hmmmmm
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the games looked great last of us 2 and ghosts of tsushima but from past experience im chalking those up to prerendered videos. the presentation itself was so abstract it was quite frankly awful to watch. and considering that one guy in the audience yelled fuck no you cant tell me what to do after being told to move a second time, i don't get the impression they loved it either."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,pacing was pretty terrible throughout the conference but man i absolutely loved all the gameplay they showed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,its been only 20 minutes and theyre taking an intermission ?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,so hate on sony all you want but the few games they have focused on look amazing and have gameplay trailers. i'm impressed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,wtf even is kingdom hearts?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"wasted about 15 minutes on the moving the crowd bullshit. that was time that could have been used to show more games, that they showed pretty much nothing of."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this new batman game looks great
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"felt like the presentation was good overall. start was rough and the ending was a little too abrupt, but everything in the middle was fantastic"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this conference was completely underwhelming wtf
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,no new games?!? we already knew about these games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this was hot garbage
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i remember when nintendo fans used to be ridiculed by sony fans for preaching quality over quantity years ago.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,nintendo save us
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i knew from the start this church was related to last of us

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"not quite digging the intermission, but points for trying something new. hopefully we don't see much more intermissions in the future."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,fuck yea. i hate the new cod direction but i'll definitely fuck with a free game

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,e3 2018 the year of every game trailer ever being accompanied by a sad female voice
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"so i still have no idea what death stranding is, are we even sure it's a game?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,thats it??

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,could have stopped after last of us.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"honestly as someone that owned a ps2 but then became an xbox owner, getting fucked out of playing old kh games due to console choice angers me hell console exclusives as a thing fucking anger me, i dont have that kinda money damn it"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i appreciate that they didnt stop every 20 seconds to beg for applause, and they showed a lot of gameplay. but i know they could have shown so much more."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that intermission after tlou2 really killed the pacing. it was so unnecessary.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"overall i'm leaving underwhelmed. death stranding was just another cinematic extended trailer with no new information, they just showed us how good it looks graphically. spiderman was kinda meh. tlou2 not sure how to feel, if it plays exactly like they showed then it's gonna be great. ghosts of tsushima was standout."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,my reaction to the sony conference game 1 ok dis hard game 2 ok dis hard game 3 ok dis hard game 4 ok dis hard game 5 ok dis hard game 6 ok dis hard

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,they should give 5 to 10 mins for everyone to rush to the next venue. close the doors and lock 'em to keep out the stragglers that will hold up the show.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sony had an amazing conference two years ago. the problem with the two conferences since then is that they haven't had many new announcements since all of the ones they made two years ago are still in production.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"where wasis red dead redemption 2? it comes out in a few months and we have seen almost zero actual gameplay. in fact there's a pre order now ad directly to the right of this thread. also, i missed the conference...what the hell is trover and the smear? google searches turn up nothing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"ghost of tsushima was hands down the most impressive game in my opinion. the composure and finest of the gameplay is so well fucking implemented. this feels and plays like a realistic samurai game. the scenes are majestically gorgeous. holy fucking shit man.. the unemotional spread of blood, the red of the leaves, the sparks of the fire, the dirt of the mud, the immersive sound effects... i'm so excited for this shit, man!!"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"so tlou2 seems centered around ellie. i like ellie but joel is that guy. for me it made it more believable killing multiple enemies as joel. ellie is smaller build and more fragile but was dodging bullets, stabbing huge guys outnumbered like she was a trained assassin. made it less believable. will still be a 1st day purchase regardless for me, i'll get over it. will miss joel."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"here are my grumpy old man thoughts  last of us looked good, if not just a little too scripted to be actual gameplay.  ghosts of tsushima was pretty looking but looked pretty janky, especially the combat.  i literally don't understand what kingdom hearts is but they sure make weird fucking trailers with missing audio and strange beats playing.  resident evil 2 is one of my favourite games ever made and i wish they were going with the remake style and not whatever this is. character models looked rough and voice acting wasn't great. hopefully they stick to horror and not an action game style.  spiderman looks alright, probably will be a fun game but don't have crazy high hopes for it.  death stranding and kojima can fuck right off. what is this game? why are people excited for it? you literally don't know what it is or what you do in it other than walk and pump your baby fanny pack.  overall i think this was actually a pretty poor showing from sony this year after the last couple of exceptional conferences they've had. also don't have intermissions if your conference is only an hour long."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,not really worth their whole conference looking like shit from being in a cramped church just to match this scene tho.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"fuck it i'm buying a ps4. i've wanted to play literally everyone of these games. no longer will i subscribe to pc snobbery. while our hardware is superior, sonys games look superior right now."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,overall xbox e3 was better but in terms of games i go with ps4. ghosts of tsushima is the best looking game out of everything.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"bethesda and the real dragon born, todd howard won e3. this was shorter and only kinda cool to watch like my weiner."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"so sony maintains their role as the apple of the industry, microsoft continues to be a brofest, nintendo is likely going to rain pure starlight from the heavens tomorrow, and the pc showcase continues to disappoint."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,somehow microsoft is winning e3 this year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the audio sounds fine, what are you people on about? watching the ign stream btw."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what is up with the bad audio?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i like where this conference is going
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i cant believe ellie is the last lesbian in her world
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,day one buy for me
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,all i can say is.....damn
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sony is the only conference that actually has trailers and good presentation. it feels like a great show to watch.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,can we get more banjo?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,ok this intermiasion ia really breaking the pace...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,why is the panel floating in space? weird ass conference
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"talk after the conference not during what a waste of time, if i want to watch the after show i will but don't put it in the middle"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,short intermission period it's been a 10 minute break after 15 minutes of conference jesus.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"wtf!!! no one wants to hear your stupid intermission, what is this wait. completely killed the rythym set from the amazing last of us2... this is killing the show"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,bald dude is definitely a catcher.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,lol nobody cares about the music
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i feel like there's been more time spent on random dudes playing an instrument than there has been on actual content... they're good don't get me wrong but between this and the intermissions between room changes it's getting a little tedious.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,all these live instrument solos is what i'm actually here for.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,its my first e3 that im watching and im entertained. is it always like that?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,holy shit what is this. this looks awesome
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,damn ghost of tsushima looks great holy shit. next bloodborne?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,well this is fucking great
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,bro this game looks sick
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sony is hanging me by my ankles and taking my lunch money
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,they got depp
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"inb4 kingdom hearts 3 is a black flag clone. for real though, can't wait!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"see, this is what square enix shouldve done during their presentation"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"this game is going to scare the shit out of me, i just know it"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what the fuck is happening i don't get it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"after the cringe that was the intermission, sony is absolutely killing it now"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,wait..... that's it?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,lol no one even knew the show was over!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i cant believe death stranding is more wtf after in game footage. i dont want to eat babies man.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,is the showcase over? are they just showing spiderman gameplay now? is holding out hope
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,where's my fucking avengers game?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,a bit lackluster
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,1h15 tuesday new square enix title...right before spiderman ? can you smell the marvel gaming universe boys !!!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"honestly i'm disappointed. last of us part 2 started it off really amazing, the resident evil 2 remake looks great, death stranding was, something. and spider man was awesome, but it shouldn't have been the game to end the conference off, even though it was pretty good. all i really just wanted was to see is something new from rocksteady, it's been three years and all i want to know is what they are going to do next, if they will make a batman or superman game, i don't want to wait another year or more to hear some confirmation about it. sure spiderman is gonna seem like my replacement to the arkham series for awhile but i still want to know what comes next for the developing team that got me into gaming in the first place."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,they done fucked up.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sony can end after this last of us 2 demo and they would still win
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i might be overreacting but this literally looks like the best game ever made
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sony wins. sorry i didn't believe in you at first.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,ellie is lesbian with an indian girl. diversity10
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this is truly comical! what are they doing?!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sony wins.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"sony definetly saved their ass in the 2nd half, but i still have a slightly disapointed taste in my mouth"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"man, those are some good looking movies"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm not a fan of this interview style of conference. i don't like either of these two guys and they are kinda annoying. i'd rather the beth style of shows. i really don't care how much 'heart and soul' they put into these. i'm sorry but i don't. stop yapping and show us more stuff, pls."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,how is he yelling while being hanged? literally unplayable
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,removed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,fuck me what a trailer for last of us part ii
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,just remember every second of that gameplay was made to sell the game. actual gameplay may not be that tight and fluid. hopefully it is though
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,wtf is this format
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,oh thank all that is holy they arent switching rooms

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sony is killing it holy shit
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,looks cool but i feel it's just going to be like batman combat and get boringrepetitive after a while.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sooo... no ratatouille?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,pretty whelmed by that conference. microsoft had a ton of things.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i don't understand why ppl didn't liked theirs show they gave u game play and not some bullshit trailer which doesn't represent the actual game mechanics.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,damn this was a boring ass presentation
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"im a little skeptical of all the negativity in here. i seriously dont understand how you could think that was that bad. i feel like im taking crazy pills. im getting a feeling the reaction is being manipulated. i know i may sound crazy, this just seems.. off. theres a bunch of people in the rps4 thread saying microsoft won. what the frick?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you people are mental if you think that was underwhelming. if they added another hour of cross platform trailers would that of satisfied everyone?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-11,"my predictions the last of us part ii will show another trailer with some gameplay. ellie will be main character, but i don't think joel will really be following ellie around like how ellie followed joel in part i. revealing of mystery woman who presumably annaellie's mother. 2019 release date. spiderman will show off more webswinging mechanics, and more of mr. negative. i'd like to see some info on the sidequestssidevillains such as kingpin and shocker. maybe more on miles morales? death stranding i have absolutely no clue about, so just shots in the dark another trailer and finally some gameplay, a release date, and kojima just blowing everyone's minds yet leaving us confused all the same. i know nothing about ghost of tsushima, so i don't know what to predict. spyro will probably get some time to shine. maybe god of war dlc or the final fantasy vii remake everyone seems to be hoping for. edit forgot about rocksteady rumors! hoping for a superman game on par with the arkham games. edit 2 damn was i wrong about a lot."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-11,"only thing that would make me care is if they announced a socom remake, in which case i'd nut everywhere"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,lemme get that bloodborne 2 announcement.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sucks we know all the big games sony is showing already....
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,if they announce demon souls remakebloodborne 2 i am buying a dozen of it and give away to my friends. edit grammar mistake
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"gameplay from red dead redemption will be the only thing that could top the hype i felt for cyberpunk 2077, but you know rockstar is just gonna release that video on their own."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,deleted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,im just hoping for either superman or avengers but probably not happening
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,dreams!!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,unrealistic dream here would love for them to announce a new folklore game. and some vita games please. it's such a great system.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i wonder if this gameplay was on super easy difficulty...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i imagine there's some kind of performance theyre preparing, hence the intermission."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,nice

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i guess these intermissions will happen multiple times during the conference to move them to each location. cool for the people there but kinda lame for us watching at home.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,uh...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i hope they just stay in one room for the rest of the conference

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this bullet tho
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,'folks at home should be happy with what they get'. he sounds less like he's hopeful we like what he's made and more like a dad who wants his kids to stop complaining about whatever shit they put in front of them.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that last of us clip was intense. cant wait
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,they must be running late or having technical difficulties or something. who does an intermission after one trailer?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i don't think we're getting any happy surprises like ff7 remake info this year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"if anybody here got a call of doodie, i suggest you go handle it now, during this intermission."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"wait... moving the entire crowd, mad men!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this is so underwhelming when compared to the good old conference formula... i'm sad right now. sony's conference is usually one of my favourite day of the year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that girl has graduation tassels for earrings
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,why?!?!? this intermission makes no sense
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,was the change of venue worth this wait lol

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,just push destiny 2 out in the intermission why not
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it's offline. this is officially dumb.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,well... time to go play last of us part 1. i just recently bought a ps and haven't got around to last of us yet.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,havnt seen anyone talk about the end of the spiderman segment. who do we think it is standing before spidey?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"seemed a bit more like a we won the console generation victory lap to be honest, i found the xbox conference a bit more exciting, but maybe that's just the inner fanboy trying to get out. there didn't seem to be any near releases shown, so i'll probably wait for more information before i consider buying outside of the spiderman game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what about dreams?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"that spiderman game looks like a copy from batman arkham games. edit not saying thats a bad thing, this game looks really good"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,did they just fucking cut to the commentary desk during the reveal? god this conference is a mess.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that was kind of underwhelming. was hoping for more. that intermission ruined the pacing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i may be the only one saying this but i think sony kinda doesnt care about their presentation in e3, because mainly theyre focused on making new progress like ps5 and companies creating new games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,everything looks so damn scripted...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this was probably my favorite so far. re2 looks so fucking epic. death stranding looked sick. the combat in spiderman was nuts. ghost of tshushima was awesome. nioh 2 was exciting to see. loads of great stuff out of sony and zero cringe worthy announcers between games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i thought ps was winning, but then they ended abruptly after spiderman, which i could care less about. what a letdown. at least ms knows how to end a conference surprise cyberpunk 2077 trailer."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"although really good, this was weak compared to microsoft"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,my first sony e3 i've watched in 4 years and it's in a fucking tent with awful audio. what a mood killer.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that didn't look like ellie at all..
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sony win.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i don't have any images yet but coming straight from the tlou part 2 presentation i am absolutely floored by naughty dog and what they can produce. well done to the team and their leadership, even after the changes that some worried about. hopefully all game companies across all platforms seek to make games the way they do for all of us."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,not a good start so far.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this is embarrassing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this is a disaster.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,so for the spiderman reveal ... uncle ben is gonna come on stage and play the harmonica?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"hey, its like, the same voice actors they get for every oriental cartoon or game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i know it's kojima, but this game does not look exciting at all."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,man sony trolled us hard with the no surprises talk at the beginning..
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,ok im buying a ps4 now

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,well that was complete garbage...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,pls no more live music

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,eventhough it was scripted that gameplay is fucking immense
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,hmm that looked a little too scripted. but i'll give benefit of the doubt.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,dayum that was a cool idea. the tent irl then the tent in the game. fuck that was good

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it looks pretty, it looks cool, but how much of it is game and how much is scripted segments or simple button prompts. the way they are presenting it means we dont know."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what is this? actually looks pretty interesting.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,nice desk shot

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"man, i'm so happy they basically ripped off the arkham games for this. they're some of my favourite games. this looks so good."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,weird start but after that it was pretty solid. ghost of tsushima looks pretty cool.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,did that bitch seriously eat a fuckin baby

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,no momentum. no surprises. pretty poor to be honest.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,so tlou2 basically means i have to buy a ps4 now.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,jesus this entire thing is terrible. this conference blows as much as this guy on the flute
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"of all the worlds to bring back, pirates was near the bottom"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"that conference was amazing. every one of those games looked rad. last of us looks like it took an even darker turn, kojima must put lsd in his morning coffee, resident evil 2 is the best game in the series imo, and i was particularly impressed with ghost of tsushima and spiderman. as a vr owner also pumped about several games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"wow, third meh conference in a row. apart from spidey and kh3, nothing really stood out. no rocksteady superhero announcement, no avengers project. nintendo's direct better be worth it tomorrow. ps  no jax 4"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the last of us part 2 just won me over so much, i dont know if that showcase was scripted. i love how brutal it still is. sucker punche's ghost, was beautiful but something about it felt stiff or off. but i appreciate a japanese samurai style game. death stranding, i know it brings on more questions rather than answering our previous ones, but there is so much trust i have with kojima, i just hope his first game away from mgs is not a flop. the minor glimpses of gameplay look beautiful though, the invisible creatures steps had foliage or plants emerge from the ground  totally makes me think of okami. but i am hoping for the best! re2, was a pleasant surprise for me, i know there was talk of a remake or remastered version. this got me excited, nice to see capcom getting back to its roots. as for no showcase of ffvii remake or the avengers project...i am a little disappointed...err correction, i'm hungry for certain titles through sony's show case and the others. but e3 isnt over yet, but i hope we get more surprises!!!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,genuine question. why does everyone love kh so much?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that was it? oo i stayed up til 2am and you can't even show me spyro
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"a couple of interesting games in there... but not a lot shown, and way too long."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i thought sony did pretty well. granted i only have a ps4 so i dont give a fuck about xbox games... a lot to look forward to on ps4 though
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,people so disappointed that they didn't pad it with 45 minutes of paid audience applause and awkward developer speeches.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"guy with a banjo in a church... . uh, sony, what is you doin baby."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this church theme is a real turn off.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"dude, im not sure how to feel about that. that game is fucking dark."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,looked very good but very scripted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"low key i might have to pick up a ps4 for last of us, that looked incredible."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,facebook feed mad toxic right now
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the lou1 was amazing but dont forget it played way different than the first e3 demo. theres no fucking way the combat in lou2 is going to play like that every time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"am i the only one who kinda likes this format? show off a big game, take a little breather to talk about it and other stuff , and then hop back on a new stage for a new game. its very nintendo like..which is my favorite e3 format."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that last of us stuff looked like it could be next gen. i doubt we see that very soon
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i trust flute man
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,someone should press his life alert
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,are all the games going to look the same?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"too weird, no thanks"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,its gonna be those girls kissing that pushes last of us 2 into an m rating edit this is a joke about how in america violence is celebrated and sex is frowned upon
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"waste of time! these venue changes added nothing to the experience for millions of people watching over the internet! i guess it was fun for the people there at e3, but for everyone else it was just pointless waiting. some talking at the desk, a dude plays an instrument for 5 minutes and then the trailer... repeat"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it's an interesting situation, where they didn't show much, but everything they showed was amazing. i'd say it's close between this and microsoft."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this is cultural appropriation
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"yeah, we didn't see many new games, but i have no idea how anyone says microsoft beats sony this e3. 90 of what microsoft showed we can play on ps4. sony showed off a ton of new gameplay, 34 of the games we have barely seen anything substantial of before. i thought microsoft's conference was great, despite me having no intention of ever buying an xbox one, because they showed me a bunch of games i can't wait to play on my ps4. but sony's conference showed me a bunch of games that look like new benchmarks in gaming, and i can only play them on my ps4."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,really glad to see lgbt characters get real mainstream appeal.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,where did the conference go? i came to me conference not a knockoff ign postshow. and where's the games? the only ones really worth watching for are ghost of tsushima and death stranding. this is the second worst conference this year with ea only just barely taking last.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"graphically and the way it's presented is pretty amazing. jawdropping even. just like many sony exclusives as of late though, i don't know if i'll have fun playing it. too old to be throwing 60 around for an interactive movie these days."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it may have been short but i wanna buy pretty much every game they showed, and it as a shit ton of gameplay so well done sony."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"sony is really starting to blow it with not doing crossplatform games. make exclusives by all means! but after watching microsoft's, it seems xbox is essentially saying, you don't want to share? fine. we'll take your stuff and share it for you."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,not sure why people are saying this was weak. microsoft showed off all the third party games for sony and sony focused on their insanely good looking exclusives.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i expected more from sony, what a huge disappointment."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,man. i dont know what you all are smoking. i thought that was amazing. those games look incredible. how the hell is the gaming community this toxic? you guys are the worst.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yikes. playstation users got robbed this year.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm confused, why was there a viewer discretion warning at the beginning?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,wtf... why do they think we care how the theater got built?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"man, sony is so damn serious. sometimes i just want to play lighthearted fun games. i swear every game their studios make are these super dreary, serious, dramatic games now. it's great and they're works of art, but man sony needs some just fun goofy games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,if kojima wasn't attach to death stranding nobody would be clapping. the hell was that trash
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sony really blew their whole load in 20162017.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"great trailersgameplay glad they didn't waste time with speeches between games the earlier intermission was stupid overall, solid showing"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,from soft vr!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that attack from above in the ghost of tsushima trailer was awfully familiar then i realized i remember it from the fear takedown mechanic in batman  arkham knight!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"anybody disappointed by that deracine announcement? when they said it was a vr game it kind of killed all my hype. it would've been so amazing if it was a bloodborne 2 announcement, especially with the from software and japan studio logos shown in the beginning. but hey, at least we a got a new nioh game"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,turns out death stranding is just an escort mission simulator.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"that sony e3 show was disappointing. no horizon zero dawn 2, rocksteady announcement of their new game, or new mortal kombat announcement. no bueno."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,so an arrow kills instantly but not a gunshot. plot armor

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it was a long shot, but i'm sad there was no bloodborne 2 announcement. guess from wasn't kidding when they said bb was a one and done game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the press conferences have been a bit disappointing this year imo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"so nothing about red dead. just great. still lots of cool stuff, but it was so annoying having the commentators switched to so often. loved tlou 2, ghost of tsushima, and the bit of death stranding we got. edit just realized we didnt get any ace combat! come on wtf"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,apparently its not over yet. sony tweeted a schedule for tomorrow and wednesday. httpstwitter.complaystationstatus1006368068178591744?s20httpstwitter.complaystationstatus1006368068178591744?s20
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"besides the changing of venues in the beginning it was a solid conference. we got gameplay after gameplay with hardly any bs in between, plus some pretty good reveals."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i have a baaaaad feeling about this press conference
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,no joel or infected. 610.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this looks like one of those games where you just press buttons to continue a story. doesn't look like much fun gameplay. just a fancy looking telltale game.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i'm more confused each time i see a trailer.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"however, the settingstory seems to be way more compelling than any gameplay offered by other studios. there's only so much 3rd person combat one can take. they have all become the same thing... slash block slash block rinse repeat. glad kojima is making an actual experience."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it started with a baby in a uterus? giving thumbs up and ended with a lady chewing on an embryo. i think it's one of those games where you just experience it the first time and after you finish it you theorize with others what it all could possibly mean.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it's confusing because they're like thank you! and now here's a new game announcement no one seems to know if it's over or not
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"well, probably dead or captured. my money is on dead."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,and don't forget an asian flutist dammit!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,these decision making dudes have lost touch with reality.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"well hey, it's not like they knew it was going to be recorded and put on the internet. who the hell would think that something as small as sony's e3 presentation would be recorded professionally?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,there is no evidence of gameplay yet. for all we know sony and kojima could be trolling us and death stranding is a cgi movie like the resident evil ones.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,also walking is confirmed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i think those weird shadow things speed up time. stuff grew wherever they stepped.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"two things i know for sure about death stranding. 1 its scares, baffles and intrigues me in equal measure. 2 i must have it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"also the funky fetus powers a magic grolamp that shows evil spirits that speed up time because he has space cancer. norman reedus can also sense the spirits are around him because he has some disease, but the lady with him can see them without fetus lights."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you mean 711?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i actually had a physical reaction to that. that is a whole lot of weapons grade nope.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"did you hear the guy after the trailer said, 'preorder today'. he shouted 'dont tell me what to do' then he was on camera and pretended he didn't say anything"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,don't tell me what to do! was my personal favorite.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,but now you can add ghost of tsushima to the list. that game looks epic.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,im betting he ends up in an underground prison and has to nurse his back back to full strength and climb out.  dehshay dehshay bahsahrah!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what if this is his therapy? who knows what he would be doing if he wasn't making games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"more like sony said heres money to make a studio, go do whatever the fuck you like to do and we wont acknowledge it if its illegal. see you at e3."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yea through that whole thing i was like what the fuck goes on in this guys head?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"without konami keeping him on a leash, the voices have consumed our dearest kojima"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i think they were breaking the other prisoners out.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the only part that looked hella scripted was the using the man as an arrow shield. i imagine the gameplay won't be far from this. naughty dog has perfected this type of action. i would like to see more realistic reactions to gun wounds, like ellie grabbing her arm when she is shot."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i dont know, man. the remastered version of last of us was pretty incredible. the environments look on par with current games and the fluidity of gameplay looks right when compared to the previous game. i think its definitely going to look that good."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,definitely up there
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,sony met bare minimum expectations.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,my first thought was psi ops 2

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i thought i was going crazy because i was thinking the same thing! the president guy was like, we're showing off four core games with a huge variety of style and gameplay! and i was thinking, ...are you sure?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,every chat is toxic its sad
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yeah that was rough. at least we got more spiderman. i don't understand why there was no days gone or actual death stranding gameplay but eh
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"logistically it was pretty poorly run, but i think the content was certainly good. they delivered what they promised, a deep dive into their four big games and then a bunch of other little stuff"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,spoiler its scripted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it was 1st up and it was stunning.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i think they are moving people from game to game so to speak
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,is it over? when did it even start?!

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,if we tell you youd have to clean yourself again
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"buy it, play it, beat it. you won't regret it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the gameplay is very similar. if the second interest you then the first is a nice warm up. plus it has a unique multiplayer that is like that brings stealth into a last team standing environment
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,there was never going to be anything about rdr2. rockstar doesn't do e3. can't say much about the other games though
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i think it was meant to be ironic
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i think that was supposed to say trevor saves the universe. it's basically rick and morty the game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i just loved how the red leaves on the ground moved in concert to the 2 combatants... amazing.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,ghost of tsushima
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i switched to the playstation stream and it's so much better
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"stoked about death stranding, last of us and re2make, but that was definitely a bad set for sony. not to mention ive had to switch from ps4 stream to youtube and the audio issues. microsoft definitely topped sony this year."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"stoked for nioh 2. i played the shit out of nioh. though, i haven't played much of the dlcs. maybe the first map of the first dlc... i should probably play it now."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the fact that the alexa version of skyrim is real... thats so good.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,so they said something about the monsters speeding up time around them. wondering if the babies are a clone of you that is your respawn? they kill you by aging you to death but the baby grows up quick to become you or something like that.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"spiderman combat looked pretty close to the arkham games, imo."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,accurate.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"agreed. toy story, monsters inc, pirates. game of the year for me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this is reddit we talking about here. it's either 10010 godtier or 10000000100 lowest of the low they need to die off the planet trash. there is no in between.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i think the idea of anybody winning is dumb. but microsoft and bethesda are the only two who gave really strong showings. sony kinda just had an awkward conference, skipped red dead 2days gone entirely, and didn't even show actual death stranding gameplay. last of us 2 was great where's the release date? and ghost of samurai was interesting but there wasn't really much hype there. tbh pirates being in kingdom hearts was what i cared about most there"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,people act like consoles should advertise these triple a games when those companies already have showcases at the event
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-11,i feel like death stranding will have one of those cinematic scenes that flows into gameplay and everyone will be like oooooo
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-11,any say on medievil remake you think?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"kojima has an interview with geoff keighley after the conference, so i reckon we're getting gameplay today."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm actually okay with that. if it's arkham, but way faster and more fluid, i'm down."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"you mean the other way around? spider man games have almost always been like this. obviously the combat seems the same. but, spider man games have always been punch punch kick, nothing really different."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,hey thats not a bad thing
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,and yet i am totally ok with that lol. just take every great hero and copy that formula.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,ms mostly has 3rd party... nothing amazing really
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the new potc looks way better than that of kh2 though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm thinking this too. both the companies feel like it, microsoft showing off third party games and only one ready first party. sony showing gameplay for games but nothing else. it definitely feels like ps5 and nextbox next year."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,rough start?

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i for one am just disappointed in the way this panel is. start off in some random church, sit there for a few minutes then be rushed to the actual venue. that's unnecessary. instead of having presentations at the venue they have these commentators at a different location. what is the point? what's wrong with the usual format? it works and isn't so jarring."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"to be fair, you have to have a very high iq to understand rick and morty. the humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. there's also rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation his personal philosophy draws heavily from narodnaya volya literature, for instance. the fans understand this stuff they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny they say something deep about life. as a consequence people who dislike rick  morty truly are idiots of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in rick's existential catchphrase wubba lubba dub dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to turgenev's russian epic fathers and sons. i'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as dan harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. what fools.. how i pity them.  and yes, by the way, i do have a rick  morty tattoo. and no, you cannot see it. it's for the ladies' eyes only and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 iq points of my own preferably lower beforehand. nothin personnel kid"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"iirc, tlou part 2 takes place 5 years after the first, so ellie would be 19. in the first game, they said joel had sarah young, you can fairly estimate an age of 1822. when the outbreak started, sarah was 12, making joel 3034. the rest of the game takes place 20 years later. making him 5054. then tack on the five years in between parts one and two, and joel is 5559. my personal bet is that joel does take a leader role, but gets killed by the people who ellie said that shed find and kill every last one of them in the trailer that was released last year. i think she wasnt actually talking to joel, but just imagining his ghost."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"holy shit i had to stop reading, this is literally just a game ruining spoiler thread."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,"i'd also change mass effect 3. so i'd probably keep the options for the existing 4 endings, but add in a 5th. to elaborate... edit tldr 5th option to convince the reapers to stand down by going over major decisions made across all 3 games.  destroy and control are the options that prove the reapers. the reapers are synthetic life beyond their control, and the only way to coexist is to destroy or dominate them. you either wipe the board of all synthetic life as anderson would have, or dominatecontrol them as tim would have. however, synthesis should have been described more as what saren wanted. no longer simply organic or synthetic, but something more. also, just because everyoneeverything is a mix between syntheticorganic, doesn't mean it's all happy kumbaya between everyone. in me2, legion explains that the geth was split between joining saren and sovereign in me1. they're all geth, they're all synthetic, and even though they can all communicate with each other, it doesn't mean they agree and understand each other. hell, just look at organics in the citadel. they all speak common and talk to each other, but cultural differences mean we all have trouble understanding each other. the batarians consider slavery their right and it is part of their culture, enslaving people is just part of their lifestyle. considering how much friction the other species have with the batarians and their culture, even though they all can sit down and talk, do you really think just because shepard forcefully converts everyone into organicsynthetic hybrid species, the reapers will lay down arms and be all happy happy happy with everyone else? if anything, i think synthesis would have made the whole thing a bit more chaotic. at least right now, the reapers are all under a hierarchy or mission goal. destroy and control basically remove or rewrite that goal, but synthesis is freeing everyone to be equal moving forward. a reaper is the combined knowledge of all the intelligent species of that cycle. knowing javik and how he portrays the prothean, do you think the prothean reaper wouldn't immediately try to indoctrinate planets and establish dominance? and the protheans are the only species we know from previous cycles. so yeah... all i'm saying, synthesis is uplifting all organics and synthetics to be technoorganic hybrids, while also freeing the reapers from their original directive of harvesting the galaxy. the 4th option of refusing the star child is pretty straight forward. you basically prove the reapers right by shooting. a lot of reapers die, the galaxy is harvested, the cycle continues. i also think the 4th ending is the worst, because you've essentially handed the reapers a completed crucible, and they now know about the security issue with the keepers. the next cycle will either have fixed keepers in the citadel, or have keepers 2.0 with some new species caring for the citadel. as for the crucible, it was basically a flu shot for them now. next cycle, even if the next species manage to create the crucible from the beginning and plug it in, the reapers know about it and know to block it. heck, if the next cycle start to immediately try to build the crucible and it gets discovered by the citadel, the reapers might immediately come back to do another reset.  so here, i would put down a 5th option you plead your case. the culmination of all your choices across the 3 games put forward to get the reapers to stand down. as stated, no organic ever made it this far and it's clear the cycle is flawed and a new path needs to be determined. the star child is basically the reaper ai in the citadel, and the citadel has records of all the things shepard has done, all the things the species from this cycle has done, and they can both bring forth topics to talk about. shepard can talk about how their cycle is different, is better, and the reaper can bring up counter points. topics directly related like the geth, how the council treats the quarians, the fallout with the whole conflict. topics like how the rachni was handled, uplifting the krogans, the genophage. how the queen was treated, the choice you made in me1. how the different species reacted to a possible krogran threat with what they did on tuchanka in me3. the reaper might even bring up what shepard did to the batarians at the end of me2. putting you on full blast for doing something unthinkable, unethical, despicable, etc. is this the kind of species you want to survive the cycle? basically, this would be a final gambit between you, your choices throughout the trilogy, and the reapers. the actions you've taken can prove, deny, or go beyond the reapers expectations from organic species. the willing sacrifice of your own to save the council? trusting the rachni queen with freedom? how you dealt with the heretic geth? wrex, the krogans, and the genophage? so on and so forth. if you've done more to prove the species of this cycle are different, that organics can coexist with not just each other, but with the synthetics they create, the reapers can choose to pull back. their directive has failed and their job is over, but now they can attempt to work on moving forward to what's next. if it's exile back into deep space, or leave the milky way for another star system, so be it. or maybe they can stick around to help. let the scientists figure out how to prevent indoctrination, and then slowly work towards being able to coexist. at the end of the day, the reapers are a product of the leviathans, and even though they are the literal boogeymen of the galaxy, the leviathans are to blame for this whole debacle. if your actions just prove you cannot coexist with organics, then it'll leave you to your fate. you can't shootkill the star child, it's a hologram. you can't run to the original 3 choices, you're weakened and it probably took away the bridge to get there andor closed the window to protect you from shooting the thing. the culmination of all your choices show you are no different from the previous cycles, only that the cycle needs some work to prevent them from getting this far again.  does this mean you need to do a full paragon run? no, there should be some choices where the renegade choice is the right choice to make. sometimes the right choice is the one where you need to be the bad guy. although, this is probably more of an issue with categorizing choices as paragon or renegade, and how certain choicesoptions get locked behind the system. at best, the reapers stands down and becomes a new species in the galaxy. at worst, you prove the reapers right and war continues. even with a krogan army, a united geth and quarian fleet, and whatever other species army you can muster, all you can do is watch the reapers decimate their forces. but at the very least, the choices you made helped decide this outcome, and not just make a choice based on what other people wanted. you don't destroy the reapers because the citadel species demanded they be destroyed. you don't control the reapers because you wanted the power of the reapers like tim. you don't force the galaxy to be uplifted into some synthesis where everyone is now a organicsynthetic creature, like saren wanting everyone to be better so the reapers would let them live. you, shepard, made choices over the course of 3 games that convinced the reapers to change their directive, to choose whether to stand down and let this cycle move forward and explore something new. without the main reaper directive, maybe some reapers will stand down. maybe some will try to force their collective cycle consciousness to establish their own new reign of power. maybe some will fight against each other. the reapers unshackled are ai, each powered by the collective knowledge of that cycle, and who knows how they might act without the original directive to keep them focused. so yeah, i'd add a 5th option to where you try to convince the reapers with your past actions. if it leads to peace, slavery, or destruction, it's because you made the choices that led to that conclusion. not because you picked a color."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,all me3 really needed was a slightly cheesy return of the jedi style ending and it would likely have pleased most fans. but instead we got the dumb star child and a choice of 3 colours.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,i felt like the whole game was giving closure to the characters. the main issue for me was that all the multilayered choices throughout all three games were undone by reductionist choices that had nothing to do with everything you did that went before.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"i would change it to where the moment between anderson and sheperd is the final moment before the cruicible fires off and it does what it was made to do destroy the reapers. however instead of destroying them a code is transmitted to the reapers that would erase their memories and leave them with one objective destroy the reapers. cue a scene where the reapers turn on each other and start tearing each other apart. after the montage of reaper slaughter, depending on your choices, sheperd can be rescued by whichever love interest you have, if you have a high enough war assets."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,"if your paragon or renegade ratings are high enough, you survive."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,"and also make the music that plays over the ending triumphant... after playing through the gears franchise, i strongly feel like something along the lines of 'finally a tomorrow' specifically the part that starts from the shot of hoffman up to carmine surviving should have been playing during the sequence of the reapers being destroyed, given how it not only accomplishes the goal shepard had through the entire trilogy but also frees not just the current species of the galaxy but all future ones from the fate of being harvested by the reapers and from javik's perspective, avenges the protheans and all other species previously wiped out by the reapers so it's the biggest victory in the history of the galaxy in that series."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,"i personally disagree with this. the trilogy was never meant to be about winning but more so about how you go out. i feel it far more fits in with the themes that are played out in alot of love crafts stories which the trilogy took so much inspiration from. it's not about win or lose but rather it's asking if you're proud of what you left behind in your lifetime? did the galaxy go out still bickering amongst eachother or did they manage to put their differences aside in the end and go out as one? did your friends meet their end bitterly or did you help them resolve their traumas and go out with a sense of peace? what about you? are you proud of your actions? did you ruthlessly pull no punches and go out with a fight the reapers won't soon forget? or maybe you took every opportunity to bring people together? did you manage to take the reapers down with you and assure the next cycle gets to live on? basically to me the entire trilogy, 3rd game especially, is thematically similar to how a man on his death bed might feel as he looks around at all the people in his life and what he's leaving behind"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"i'd have it so destroy is the only option. how well that goes depends on your war assets. high enough war assets, and the geth and edi live. i'd still have shepard die though tbh."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"oof seems like you fucked up... shepard can survive in one of the endings, if you have high enough war assets, there's even a cutscene showing him breathing or gasping for air among some rubble"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,"seriously, master chief and cortana should have been finished after halo 3. nothing they've done with the characters since has been worth the damage done to the brand. there's dozens of other spartans we could have followed, as well as countless odsts and even sangheili that would have been prime material for new stories but nope, always gotta follow the empty suit of armor. master chief isn't even that interesting of a character, especially after he just goes full force simp for cortana, who is literally a computer program."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,came here to say pretty much exactly this. odst and reach are the only games released after halo 3. the rest are bad fanfic. i wish mcc didn't have that blight stain that is 4 taking up unwelcome space.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"i barely paid attantion to halo 4 when it came out. thought it was pretty forgettable at the time. loved the bungie games, but 4 just kinda slipped by. revisited it a few years ago and i was actually shocked at how frustratingly bad it actually is. the story, the lore, the level design, the weapon balance and sandbox it's all just so far below passable, it's ridiculous. even the art style, which can look pretty at times, is more often extremely harsh and muddy when in combat."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,"i'm playing space marine 2 these days and it just feels like a sliver in time during the forerunnerflood war. 343 had a universe of endless stories to tell that they could have drawn inspiration from. we could have had 3 games focused on the flood expansion up to the first firing of the rings alone. we could have had new flood infection on some new made planet sparkling a new race for the rings. iunno man i'm just spitballing here. i think we could put 5 nerds in a room and write a better halo trilogy in an afternoon than 343 did in, checks notes, 12 years."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,i agree. halo 3 should have been the end of master chief and cortona's story. halo 4 should have rolled with crimson and majestic team especially when they featured a full set of support characters.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,you never know... somehow master chief has returned!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,imo 4 was freaking amazing and i'd end it there. 5 is where things tanked.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,yeah i mean honestly it's hard to have a more compelling narrative than humanity literally fighting desperately and heroically for survival against a zealous alien collective for decades. that premise is just so compelling that nothing can really compare to it. the sequels really should not have happened when the ot already had a satisfying ending. if anything they should've just gone the reach and odst route and set anthology type stories in the universe that fleshed it out more. those were some great games

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,"the last of us 1 didn't have a feel good ending either. the point of the end was joel forsaking the world to save a girl that reminded him of his daughter. tlou2 is a game showing the results of joel's rampage. the point of the end is that joel gave ellie a good life at the expense of abby's and abby ruined ellie's life the same way joel ruined her, leading to everyone involved getting destroyed by it. it's a good story, people just dislike joel died and are upset ellie was completely broken by the end of it that she didn't even want to kill abby anymore realizing everything she gave up for it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"yeah i've been back and forth on it ever since i played it. amazing gameplay. incredible graphics. good characters who all had great acting performances. but like you said, there are no real feel good beats !beyond ellie and dina getting some time together on the farm. beyond that, apart from filling in the blanks of what happened between joel and ellie, the story of the game is just ellie going on a revenge mission. twice. both ending mostly the same way. while that's all happening the lives of every character just get unimaginably shittier as things continue.! by the time the credits roll you just feel depressed instead of wondering what happens next. i can guess what's going to happen next awful things will continue to happen to everyone. yay."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"the feels good moments in tlou2 were the flashbacks with ellie and joel. that sequence at the space center was incredible, and it was the moment that most reminded of the best moments of tlou1."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"most of the factions are diametrically ideologically opposed to each other. even if you managed to somehow negotiate a temporary ceasefire between them, i wouldn't really buy it as an ending because i don't think the peace would last. the brotherhood believes that the way the institute uses technology is inherently evil and the sort of thing that could destroy the world again. the institute's ideology and life research won't allow them to stop doing everything the brotherhood wants. the railroad is radically at odds with the other 2 factions and they will never agree about the personhood of synths. the minuteman can mostly agree with everyone, but them making peace with at least one other faction is already a possible ending. now, one thing i would like to see changed is the ability to have a little bit of control over the faction's future if you choose the institute. you don't have the option to try and make the institute better or make it start treating the people of the commonwealth better. it is assumed that is you go institute, they will keep kidnapping and replacing people."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"you can have an ending where only the institute is destroyed. i feel like this is the best case scenario. it wouldn't make any sense for all the factions to have peace in the end, something needed to give."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,my head canon is that ellie goes back to jackson and works to regain dina's trust. it takes time but she gets there. the part i can't get past is that abby took ellie's fingers meaning she can't play the guitar anymore. this bit hurts because the guitar was how ellie felt closer to joel so without her fingers she loses that connection to him. i hope she found a way to play despite missing two fingers.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,"she does have a chance at peace, though. in the same way that the ending of tlou1 is superficially happy but undercut with a note of bleak foreboding, the ending of tlou2 is superficially grim, but undercut with a note of optimism. ellie has hit her rock bottom and in hitting that rock bottom, finding out just how appallingly far one can go in the name of a loved oneto assuage one's own trauma, she's finally come to a place of true understanding for joel, and why he did what he did. and coming to that understanding is what finally enables her to move forward. finally forgiving joel for what he did. and in forgiving joel, having to accept the final gift he wanted for her the ability to simply go out and exist in the world, to live and have a life, and to determine the course of that life for herself. and in accepting that, at last, she is able to start to let go of the thing that has driven her all game her own guilt, for not forgiving joel, for not saving joel, for not saving humanity, for still being alive. in achieving closure for joel's death, she's able to start to forgive herself. the ending of tlou1 is a, they lived happily ever after... for now, with an implied sword of damocles hanging over joel and ellie's relationship that you know will eventually fall. the ending of tlou2 sees ellie go through the darkest literal and metaphorical storm of her life, but come out of the storm on the other side finally able to start processing her grief and trauma healthily, and start to heal."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,but you have to sacrifice edi and the geth to get it
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,thats just a shitty change to make the there must be a happy ending crowd happy. in reality shep is absolutely fucked due to injuries on a devasted planet and due to the lack of mass relays the closest fleet is 2 days away. thats a big rip.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,you also got the entire story up to that point. my cope is that it mimics real life. you dont always get closure. your choice dont always matter. the journey was the real ending.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"id argue the real problem was that the three colors all had the same result the reapers are neutralized but the galaxy as we knew it is still effectively obliterated. its made abundantly clear throughout the entire series that the galactic community cannot exist without the mass relays, and only the reapers possess the technology to build and repair them. and in each version of the ending, the entire network is destroyed, effectively ending galactic society. every planet that isnt fully self sufficient at that moment is cutoff and doomed, and any planet that would have been capable of being self sufficient prereapers would have been a priority target and is almost certainly in ruins exearth. in the decades to centuries it would take to even rebuild the network, assuming you even can, a gigantic chunk of the galaxy would have ended up starving to death. theres nothing necessarily wrong with bittersweet but at what cost? kind of endings, but me didnt end that way. if it was anymore triumphant and saccharine a unicorn would have fallen out of garrus ass."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"original release didn't even have an epilogue. a whole trilogy built around the incredible cast of characters, no epilogue to see how they turned out. probably cut off to sell as dlc like javik was. the vendetta i have for them will never go away. they fumbled a layup so bad that it torpedoed mass effect as a franchise."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,i actually liked master chief's empty suit protagonist writing cause it made it easy for anyone to imagine themselves as the chief in the suit. i think they fucked up trying to flesh his character out. the only thing i would think they needed for inclusion was give the player an option from a female chief but never show himher and just let us all imagine ourselves as chief. or or yeah just let be a random spartan.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,agreed. mcc was great cause it allowed me and my buddy to play reach to halo 3 on couch coop in 2019 just like the good old days. we used pull the couch right up to the tv.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,3 has. you save your friends and beautiful gf and return back to civillization. that's probably the best ending there can be. literaly hollywoodgrade good ending.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-17,far cry 5 plus the colory expansion  yh i forgot name  has a pretty classic happy ending where you can even kinda redeem some of the antagonists if you really want.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"to each their own, i felt cheated when snake didn't get closure and kojima chickened out, unable to kill his protege."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,i think this it is. if she killed abby then the game would be better. stories about revenge where you decide in the end spare the person sucks. ellie killed over thousand random guys but somehow abby deserve mercy?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"i think tlou2 was on the right track with giving joel a cartel execution. that's kind of what it's all about, there are no heroes and there is no glory, the world is just fucked and nobody is special. then they chickened out at the end by having literally every character waffle on their ideals. tommy suddenly becomes obsessed with vengeance and doesn't care who gets hurt, abby suddenly decides violence is bad and wants to be a good role model for lev, ellie goes back and forth like 3 times on whether she's batman or a family gal. could probably get away with one of those and make it interesting, but all of it together was just sloppy and felt inconsistent. it's probably realistic, that's how people are, but it's a shoddy narrative. imo they should have gone harder on the idea that abby follows in the footsteps of joel, her former mortal enemy, and ellie is forced to see in lev a better version of herself, what she could've been and what joel wanted her to be. they were almost there but fumbled it by trying to do too much at once."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,the point of the end was joel forsaking the world to save a girl that reminded him of his daughter. that is if you think the fireflies are actually capable of manufacturing a cure. i don't think they could and they were mighty fast in deciding to kill ellie.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,"100 the only reason people hate tlou 2 is because joel dies, which is unfortunate because it really sets up the plot of the game well and reinforces the core thesis of the game that revenge is a self destructive concept in its very nature."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,that's what i said. the ending of the series would be the end of the first game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,that was such a bad cop out. sending in a radiation proof ally should've been a secret ending kind of option
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,"yeah, which makes it even more infuriating that it has no effect at all on the ending."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,nothing distracts like shooting them to death. or a stick of dynamite.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,"i don't see it that way. i think tommy always wanted revenge but didn't want ellie to have that life. tommy was by joel's side during the early years when everyone was out for themselves and they were doing bad things just trying to survive so tommy knew there would be no happy ending in pursuing abby and didn't want that for ellie, he knew joel wouldn't want it either. knowing that wasn't enough to deter him from going after abby though, which is why he went out there on his own. i think his change at the end was driven more by desperation and hatred of abby causing him to override his fear of allowing ellie to indulge her rage than an actual view change. after all, ellie had already gone out there and already done horrible things so why not try to finish the job?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,"tommy has a tbi from being shot alongside the brain. tbis notoriously cause massive personality shifts. in addition to this, you see in both the first and second game that being involved in the jackson community, being a helper, devoting himself to being one of the community's protectors is something that gives his life a lot of purpose and meaning. by the time of the farmhouse chapter, he's had time to not only stew in the loss of his brother and his inability to avenge him, he is also physically disabled. he walks with a heavy limp, he suffers from chronic pain he can't even park himself atop a tower and help guard jackson's perimeter, because he's blind in one eye, and can no longer use his signature weapon the sniper rifle. the nature of his injuries and of the setting mean that tommy can no longer be active in the way he was can no longer contribute to his community in the way that gave him purpose. and so in addition to the psychological damage wrought by both trauma and his brain injury, for the duration of the timeskip, he's had nothing to do but sit around and stew in his own bitterness."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,tommy berating ellie at the end was so out of character. i hated that bit so much.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,this! well said the comparison between the endings optimistic with note of bleakness  bleak with a note of optimism is spot on.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"it's not really an argument, it's a proven point that the creator was poorly staffed, under pressure from the studio, and didn't get to do what he wanted. it's just like the original ending to evangelion vs literally any other ending. you might say well we got the original ending. well, yea. look at the actual endings they went on to make when they had the freedom to do it, though."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"nah, not the full picture. square said just end it at disc one. he has openly said he didn't get to do what he wanted. it would have turned out differently and quite likely better. hence the original post."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"it's sad, but logical in a way. if the geth survive rannoch, they absorb the reaper code to become completely sentient, intelligent beings. same way for edi because she has the reaper code after taking the reaper iff in me2. the destroy beam just doesn't discriminate and will eliminate anything with the reaper code."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,the leaks so far seem to indicate that there's a non vr title and a vr title in development. with deadlock too it seems like valve is finally starting to make games again.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,i really like the part of the epilogue where ellie tried to play the guitar again but couldn't because she lost her fingers which was more symbolism of giving everything up for revenge. she has nothing now. not even the only thing left of joel.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,i genuinely can't comprehend how people can hold these intellectually dishonest and reductive narratives when it comes to criticism of something they like. that behavior is fucking all over reddit and the internet. it's insane to claim tlou2 is only criticized because joel died. there's so many good videos and reviews going over the story and its flaws.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"joel dying and abby living amd ellie never getting to avenge him, having to live on knowing his murderer and the one who crippled her is running around free and clear."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-17,"one of the main reasons that type of ending was never that likely is cause bg3 takes place in the forgotten realms. this is one of the more high fantasy type settings of dd where pretty much anything is possible. even when people were killed of for plot reasons and story or even progress of time like the companions of drizzt, these guys reincarnated like a few decades after their death. gods walk around and die almost all the time here."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"right. my headcanon is in the 8 months following gotp, snake became something of a global celebrity he traveled with otacon and sunny, told his story, essentially cleared his name as rhe truth of the patriots came out, but the more he told, the more people questioned, irritating him to no end as his health declined, robbing him of his ability to even walk in time. in time, the authorities that once were out for his head became replaced by endless paparrazzo. one morning, he felt a presence awake him. it was that of his old friend, gray fox. he knew what that meant. all he wanted was to watch the sunrise one more time before they left. as a fleet of news vans pulled up on the nomad, snake laid down, and passed away with a smile on his face, like in the projectbitoh novel. they had no choice but to lift the search, the alert, ro leave him oracon and sunny alone. snake left the world doing what he did best  giving his pursuers the slip. he got away."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"no, i think context matters a lot in a situation like that. full stop, they weren't gonna manufacturer a cure in that grimy hospital room. the only thing they'd have achieved is ellie being dead and the possibility of a cure along with her."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"i literally cried at that point. i can't believe i had to dig this deep into the comments to find someone defending the end of tlou2, it was basically a perfect story, and any other ending would've been a disservice to the rest of the story."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"funny how most of the criticism about the game came out immediately after the plot got leaked ahead of the game launching and a lot of the complaints never changed. what else is to complain about? the existence of gay relationships? the fact that abby has muscles even though it makes perfect sense in context? the only valid complaint about the game is that it's probably too long, the rest are a bunch of hogwash propagated by people who didn't even play the damn game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"ellie letting go of revenge because it cost her everything she loved is the entire point of the game, the game is a warning against seeking revenge. also i wouldn't really say abbie is running free considering she lost basically everyone she loved and was nearly tortured to death alongside her only remaining friend. it makes me sad that these points missed you because of how clearly they are portrayed in the game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"...the story in xenogears wasn't finished. and not just limited to the monologue. it wouldn't have been so simple to make it like the game of disc 1. probably, it's as finished as it ever will be. maybe if the players are aggravated enough, it could be redone in the future.  sawaduki you xenogears perfect works, 'the xenogears experience'"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-15,"that's more of a stretch because the crucible activates every relay. the only way joker, edi, and any geth make it far is by making an ftl jump blind, which is dangerous and the pulse from the crucible theoretically travels faster since it's propelled by the relays. then again, i'm no mass effect lore expert."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"kinda defeats the purpose, since reapers are all over the galaxy"

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"just because the leaks caused outrage, a lot of which was unfair and bigoted, doesn't mean that there isn't valid criticism to be had. if you think the game is a storytelling masterpiece with the only flaw being that it's probably too long, then by all means enjoy and express that. but you're filling in the reasons why people dislike the story and invalidate them in the process, that's just bad faith."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,look up who that person is. he has no authority on the matter. its a random university student's 'experience' with playing the game. it'd be like if you wrote a review.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"it doesn't, but that's beside the point. they argued against forsaking the world, not for joel being a good guy..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"they explicitly didn't ask ellie for her say, and they weren't capable of actually following through with making a cure. one could make a reasonable argument that they were about to murder ellie. they certainly were from joel's perspective. and if they were about to murder ellie, then murdering them to stop them can be justified."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"i've literally never once seen a valid criticism of tlou 2. it's always the same bull that people were saying since the leaks. it's not bad faith because it's literally the truth. if you don't like the game or the story, that's fine, but that doesn't mean the complaints are valid either."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2024-10-16,"hey guys, lets not bicker and argue about who killed who..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-11,you're an idiot
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-11,"not killing joel would be stupid, it would make the entire game pointless. what point would abby and the others serve? for what reason would ellie be going for revenge, did they accidentally run over her dog? joel dying simply reminds us that there are always two sides, as well as consequences to your actions. just because we played joel we see the good guy who wanted to save a girl. however from abbys perspective it is a selfish guy who decided one life was more important than the rest of the world, and killed her dad who was trying to find a cure. joel doomed the world with his actions, something even ellie acknowledged. to let him off scott free would be bad writing."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-11,they aren't changing the story. what they'll probably do is change the order in which the story is told and get more abby at the start and kill joel towards the midpoint of the game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-11,"i hope he dies, so all the babies that complainedboycotted tlou2 keep crying about it, i also hope second half of the series is abbys perspective  i wanna see them burn"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-11,"stop your bitching. killing joel was a good thing for ellies story, plus gameplay with ellie was quick and intense, playing as abbie was brutal and a great perspective. you are not safe in the world of the last of us. take it as it is."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-11,"that's the story they wanted to tell and told it. they defend it publicly in several interviews. if you, the gamer, don't like it, it is a you problem. there are many pieces of work that don't tell the story a particular segment of consumers want to hear. it doesn't mean it a bad story. oftentimes it's a good story, it just elicits unpleasant feelings in you, which is one of the main goals of a piece of art."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-12,"perhaps you should re read the comment. from the perspective of abby and her people, and once again even ellie acknowledges it, that yes he doomed the world. the operation on ellie would have killed her, but it was literally the only thing they could find to develop a cure, nothing else has worked. abbys dad did not just skip his happy ass in there and be happy go lucky over this, he was struggling and was torn, abby has to console him and even tells her dad if she was in ellies place she would want him to do the surgery. ellie was pissed at joel when she found out the truth. so again yes joel doomed everyone, he took ellie the only person ever to be immune and who could have become a cure, and killed all the people who knew about it as well as who could perform the surgery and make a cure. it doesnt mean that it is an easy choice, no one would approach that situation as if it was a simple thing. i agree with abby, if there was a major out break and people all over the world were dying and i were some how immune, and i find out that i could be used to make a cure and save millions but the operation would kill me, then i would go ahead and do it. would i wish there was another way? of course, but in this situation, our tech and everything is basically gone, we are out of our resources and pretty much all our experts. so you have no other options. its this or that. im pretty sure if everyone told ellie before the surgery, she would have agreed to it as well. so again yes joel doomed the world with his choice. however you seem to be thinking that they are in our world and they were not over run with zombie like creatures, and still have unlimited resources, and that the people involved werent acting with any humanity. they were, the decision was agony for them, but they could not think of any other options. it was all they had."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-11,"idk why the last joel and ellie made me laugh so hard, imagine? like literally nobody can be named joel or ellie  but yea i hated those crybabys, i did love tlou2, even tho the second part shocked me at the beginning, at the end i enjoyed playing as abby and getting to know her"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-11,why lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-11,"i don't agree. it is well written, and abby is a great, welldeveloped character. you can dislike where the story went without thinking it's a badwritten story. but your question was about whether they will change one of the key parts of the story and so far there are no evidence suggesting that they are even considering doing that."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-12,"sounds like retconning to me. from messed up scientists not thinking about the human they plan to sacrifice for a potential greater good, to a laughable one that just said, we were only humans trying to save the world. we mourned our father and killed the man who killed him but you shouldn't kill us because where does it end? what did i miss?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-12,"well whoever that character is, imagine that in the next installment of that franchise that character gets incredibly dumbed down and whacked in the first 30 mins and then has about 45 minutes total screentime in a 20 hour long game. its not about the fact that he died, its the way they worked with his character. joel always reminded me of leon in the professional, i loved this movie ever since and leon is one of my all time favorite characters. but joel legit got thrown away like a bottle cap. and i dont mean he needed some heroic last act, but 12 hours of the game tries to make us understand abbies perspective, but what about joels?, we see flashbacks of abby and her father, why not flashbacks of joel and sarah?. like is it that hard to understand?."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-13,"they did think about the person who would be sacrificed. the surgeon didnt want to do it. ellies moms friend who promised to take care of ellie didnt want to do it, no one wanted to do it. sounds like you just decided no one has any humanity. no one said sacrificing her was right. i also never said abby was right in killing him. however when ellie killed abbys people, she ultimately chose to let ellie go, and ellie chose to go after her again. abby only went after joel, the guy who did the killing, and let ellie and joels brother go, ellie and joels brother chose to go after everyone. and refused to move on were abby did in the end. abby was in the perfect position to get all of them but she didnt. thats what you missed. when you go for revenge, and then that person goes for revenge, you end up in a never ending circle until everyone is dead. even ellies girl told her to let it go, but ellie chose to continue and lost her girl and the baby because she chose to leave. in the end neither side was in the right, abbys lover owen even called her out. cant remember everyones names its been a minute since i played. but when youre looking at perspectives, both sides see themselves as the victim. its never one sided. that is another thing you missed."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-12,"we had a whole game on joel's perspective, and you having this emotion is i say what they meant to do. you hate abby, you hate the makers of the game for making no one safe in an apocalyptic game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-12,"no we had a whole game on joel and ellie building up a relationship through having a common goal. the flashback of sarah dying was just the premise. and again im not saying the 2nd one shouldve been about joel, but if the game is all about discovering the different sides of tragedy than there shouldve been a stronger focus on him, dude got turned into an idiot and wasted like a goon in some tarantino movie. i dont understand how anyone can argue that this wasnt just wasted. tragic characters do exist and are justified but joel just got written out. and thats always funny how people assume so much just because someone isnt on their side of the argument. let me guess im some overweight incel that only feels spite towards women because he doesnt have any game and i hate gay and trans people just because?. i dont hate abby, i just think her character was just flat as hell and didnt bring much to the table, most of the characters just felt like plot devices, and i dont hate those who made the game, i just think that they failed at what they were trying to do and wasting one of the top 10 game characters in the process was just a bad trade off. i genuinely felt nothing when the credits rolled other than what a waste this was. and no one is safe in the apocalypse?, my point was that joel dying isnt the issue, its the value and relevance he had in the story. its like no one is really just good or evil, this game is just too realistic for you...but yeah, joel deserved it fuck that guy!."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-12,"joel did deserve to die, ellie deserves to die as well, abby too, everyone in that world deserves to die, and the whole game is about joel getting killed because abby wanted revenge, and bc of that ellie going after abby for revenge as well, i don't see how you can't see that abby not killing joel is not an option, he killed her father, wtf even i would want to kill joel for that, or you want joel to be a superhero that can't ever be killed because people love him? wtf"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-01-13,"dude i said like 5 times that joel dying wasnt the main issue, i wasnt even surprised when i heard it prior to release. and i guess if abby also deserved to die ellie made a mistake letting her live at the end is what youre saying?. and i just red about some early draft in which abby infiltrates jackson and actually gets close to joel before shit goes down. now just imagine abby being half dead in the snow, joel and tommy find her and take her in, abby gets a whole different impression of him than she expected, she befriends ellie and over the course she genuinely doubts that killing him would be right seeing him being this good man just trying to protect everybody. but the more she sees that it reminds her of what he took from her and ends up killing him. those that loved joel so much wouldve got to play him more, you would have a great projection of the grey area of morality and good vs evil and if they wanted a revenge plot they could do it. this wouldve been so much more nuanced than joel dying to a golf club in the first 30 min and the rest of it mostly a series of events that just happen. joel used to be such a distinctive and memorable character, easily top10 for most ppl and what they did was just a disgrace and i just dont understand how anyone in his right mind things this was the pinnacle of story writing in videogames. decent fanfiction wouldve been more satisfying than that."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-12-05,that looks sick.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-12-05,fuck those stupid review bombers who killed the games popularity. its a good game with a few flaws sure but it did not deserve to be shut on so hard.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-29,"this game is not bad in general, it just wasnt groundbreaking or special for me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-29,let me know your thoughts i think its been two years and this discussion was worn out a couple months after the game released
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-29,"tlou 1 for me. don't get me wrong, i did enjoy tlou 2. i think it's definitely one of the better games in recent times, particularly from a technical standpoint, but in terms of narrative it just can't hold a candle to its predecessor."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-29,well i thought it was pretty neat
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-29,"i don't even know story game means, but i'm guessing it means a strict, linear game that unfolds like a play by giving you stage directions to act out, token combat, and breaking it up with cutscenes. it's the least interesting type of game to me, because it doesn't exploit the unique qualities of games to tell the story. it might as well just be a novel or a film. but still, the characters were uninteresting. ellie and dina had too much in common for there to be any chemistry. there were many wasteful characters who just took up space and time and left as quickly as they came into the story after they had served their functional purpose. it went on forever. i preferred abby's section to elle's, but the inclusion of both was a bad idea. it was the most heavy handed solution to the problem of getting the player to understand things from both sides. i think if this game didn't dazzle people with graphics  if it were a novel for instance, or an rpgmaker game, people wouldn't have given it the time of day."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-29,"the game would have been a 1010 if joel died later in the game. i would have liked to see him kick some ass. i think his death fits the game, just not at the beginning"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-29,"very few games get a real emotional response out of me. that game managed to make me sick to my stomach with the decisions ellie kept feeling like she had to make. that alone is worthy of praise in my experience. there were ham fisted plot points and some seriously unrealistic actions taken, and i felt like the moral they were trying to push was a little obvious and dumbed down for a 5 year old. but then i saw the response to it and realized they knew the audience better than i did."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,maybe audio but i wouldn't necessarily say narrative i've played a lot of destiny and no offense but unless they've made some big changes to how they handle their writing for the game i wouldn't say they've ever been as good as a lot of more narrative focused games.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,"regardless if they had heard the controversies, not liking the game would still have been their genuine opinion."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,"it's okay, but still the way you said it just made it look like you implied that it's just due to controversy. oooooor it can just be me, because i've already seen far too many people reject any criticism because ur a bigot lol"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,"well, crowd mentality can also be a factor, that's why i asked this fine fellow about it, you know what they say monkey see monkey do"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,it aight
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the combat looks brilliantly brutal, holy shit."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,you can go ahead and stop e3 now
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the dynamic combat was impressive
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i think they should be terrified of you. well, that statement seems a bit... cuts to her stabbing a baddie layered."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i can hear the cpu fans on my pro spinning up now.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i could never imagine a game so cool as tlou 2.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"welp, buyin a ps4 pro now"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what 37 of that trailer was doctored or scripted? would like to get a solid number on that from the studio.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,tlou is my favorite game of all time. i've waited so long for this and i'm willing to wait even longer. i have never been so fucking hyped for a game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"omg they way they hung that guy and cut open his abdomen, wtf."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"this game looks amazing. just like the first movie game, looks like it'll be an interactive cinematic experience. as a lessthanconservative christian, i'm curious how my veryconservative christian gamer friends will react lol! edit fixed the stupid"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"well, not that i didnt expect it, but it seems naughty dog is about to produce another masterpiece that puts its competition to shame. just the trailer is beautifully put together. their storytelling and character development is on another level that i cant think of another game game that comes close to capturing human emotions edit obviously i didnt mean to send game twice double edit is there anyone else that can produce high quality charactersstorylines better than naughty dog right now? the whole uncharted series was way above average, and the first last of us was the best ive seen ever. just from this trailer, it seems theyve done it again. remarkable."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i am going to get nuked for this, but what's new? excluding graphical upgrades, it looks pretty much the same as the first one.."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i would love to see a mother walk in on a 12 year old playing this game during the bar scene and just be like wut the hell are you playing
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"brutal, yet satisfying"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,fucker
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,does it stand upright wo obstructions e.g. does it sit in a shelf?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,nd is known for keeping it real during their gameplay trailers. you can see how the player makes mistakes all the time.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"judging from what weve seen so far, the story is going to take the characters to a whole new place in their lives, is going to introduce some new charactersthemes, show this world as it has changed over the several years since the first game, and integrate some new combat mechanics also. you should know already that this game is going to be a different experience than the first one."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yeah the problem is the lesbians not the graphic and brutal violence.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,its just two girls kissing. perfectly normal.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,the game will not be accessible for 12 year olds for brutality reasons and not a kiss between two women you dumbass
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,brutal combat is never not satisfying
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it lays flat in a tv stand but the back of the stand is open. loudest ive heard it is god of war though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,this is america
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"when did i say problem? i think it's funny cause it would make a 12 year old boy horny to see two girls kissing. it would be unusual, since the games she sees him play are typically shooting people, to walk in and he is seemingly playing a kiss at the rodeo game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"ugh yeah jesus but the sensual ramp up, it would be unusual for a 12 year old boy to be playing if the mom saw a second of the screen. edit to add like i watched the lesbian leaning anime strawberry panic under my covers in secret when i was 12. you think if my mom walked in she'd be like, yes perfectly normal, or would she be like.. ...wut are you watching right now..?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"it would be unusual for any 12 year old to be playing this game considering it will almost definitely be rated 18r, its the parents fault at that point."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"but games have always been violent and they haven't always been two people kissing, that's what makes it unusual. fuck he could be raised by two moms and have four grandmothers and there could be no straight people in the world the mom would be like are you playing a rodeo kissing game...?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"yeah i guess if she walked in at the exact moment they kissed and then left before it transitioned into the night scene then it would be an odd style of game, but that's not really the point i'm getting at"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-18,"i mean, all that is very true. but i thought the story was by far the strongest aspect."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-18,technically it was impressive but imo a storydriven game should have an interesting story. this is was made the first game a masterpiece. while the prequel has improved many aspects i felt like it has lost it's narrative.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-18,because story is all they do that's actually unique. graphics and detail is a meaningless benchmark because something better is always gonna come alone and beat it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-18,why do you think the game with the most goty awards in history is slept on?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-18,removed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-18,"so you think one of the top selling games in 2020 was slept on? the following will have spoilers but the games over a year old and im not sure why you would be on this thread if you hadnt played it. ignoring that rather odd point tlou2 has a lot of issues. claims of padding not being in the game is wrong, so much of the game time is empty walking with nothing happening. the second half is an attempt to add sympathy but doesnt really work. the reason being you have to be on one side for a story to work if youre trying to be both sides you end up with a mess that doesnt fit coherently. look at nier replicant and how it does its b,c,d play through and adds more to the bad guys and how you that makes you think about the whole game as a whole and how you are the bad guy from a certain point of view. tlou2 doesnt really succeed in this as it tries to show abbys change after meeting lev  yara in such a short period of time after having killed 20 scars already in your short time in her story. the change is too abrupt as she had shown no interest in leaving up to that point so that whole side of the story doesnt work. ellie letting them go and whilst being happy with dina despite suffering only to change her mind after tommy has a go at her doesnt fit her character. whilst revenge is something she wanted she does feel strongly about family and loyalty and wouldnt of abandoned her child and partner. the gameplay aspect is also suspect, nd cant do combat still. the shooting is just awful, considering both abby  ellie are supposed to be very proficient and arguably some of the highest skilled in their respective factions you would expect a better experience from this side but it is very clunky. you need to use your melee a lot as ammo is in short and this is biggest issue with the game which tries to portray its self as immersive. you will have bad guys fire 10,000 bullets each at you while sneak and execute them as you have only have 3 bullets, yet when you check their corpse they have no ammo on them. the main gameplay loop end up being spam triangle around every corner of every room as your resources are always poor and thats just dull. the games 25 hours long and it feels like 10 hours of it is spam triangle, 5 hours walking with talking and 5 hours of combat and 5 hours of stealth. also the playing guitar was ok the first time but is repeated far too often to shove a payoff at the end, oh look ellie cant play guitar anymore as her revenge mission was bad and shes lost a connection to joel. as soon as the fingers were bitten off you knew what was happening at the end. the original had a quite a lot of these issues but the shorter play time masked them. i dont mind the game its worth playing and its a solid 710 but it really is a bit of a mess thematically and in its story not really working, we know all 3 sides are goodbad already and the story portrays this poorly by making people just change. by far the best bits are the stealth but they really need to kill off infinite ammo on bad guys if they are trying to portray a more grounded experience and get rid of having to open every cupboard which lets be honest if theres a human presence their would already of been looted properly."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-29,i honestly feel bad for you guys who didn't enjoy the game man.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-18,"oh sure, i feel like media outlets and professional reviewers recognize it as a great achievement. but as far as discourse between regular folks in places like reddit i dont really see it discussed beyond the story."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-18,what about it put you off?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-20,"so not only did you ignore my plea to discuss the game on its merits outside of the story direction, but you somehow think that game mechanics like having the enemies run out of bullets or the player inheriting the enemies massive cachet of ammunition or that there should be no looting would somehow improve the game from a design standpoint? do you hear how ridiculous that sounds? and spamming x? did you even play the game? even if you cited the right button for melee, its not true or fair criticism. if you try to spam  on even the most basic zombie, you would just die. unless you played on easy or something, and if so, why complain about it being boring?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-18,thats because somehow the story is controversial. i dont see it but a lot of people are triggered for some reason over it
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-18,removed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-20,"i mean if youre gonna respond at least actually respond to what i said rather than making stuff up. your responses are just typical to the usual fanboy, you didnt play the game, you played on easy despite the game not having an easy mode it has adjustments to the amount of combat as many people do think the combat mechanics are borderline broke, i played on moderate as thats what the games balanced around. i didnt say you spam melee, i said you used meleestealth kills more as resources are poor so sneaking and killing people that way makes more sense. i didnt say there should be no looting nor did i say you should inherit enemies infinite ammo. imagine for a second a rework to the way enemies hadmanaged ammo, they should only be able to carry x amount same as anyone else but if they are in a baseoutpost they can resupply from a finite amount that is stored their. so you can bait shots until they have to go get more, if youre quick enough and you can then loot the ammo before it runs out, it should also be where the meds are set so you arent just walking around spamming triangle feel better now to loot the area. it would make for a better experience and change how you infiltrated that section. but no you dont discuss anything just rant about stuff i never said."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-18,"yeah, thats a bad reason to not play it. they dont redeem anyone. they just make you understand that the villian of your story is the hero of someone elses. abby had every right to kill joel. he murdered everyone she loved including her father. since youre never gonna play it these spoilers mean nothing to you but youre missing out by following the hive mind and not just experiencing something for yourself."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-20,hey man i cant help it if your complaints were indecipherable nonsense.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-18,removed
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-20,except they werent. youre just upset that someone doesnt like the game as much as you do.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-12-18,yeah it would suck to have to think or experiencing any emotions
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"the original didn't need a sequel, the ending was perfect for the story they told. this second one just feels unnecessarily tacked on."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"i don't care about the leaks, i want to play it for myself"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"i'm buying it day one regardless of the leaks, i'm sick of all the complaining about sjw and all that other crap."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"i'll play it with an open mind, and try to give the game the benefit of the doubt. i just hope they dont try and shove some bullshit agenda down my throat. i play games to get away from the bullshit."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"people that didn't heard the spoilers, people that thought it was good, and people like me that know didn't like the story but know that the game can be good i mean you play a game sometimes for the gameplay and don't mind the story at all like ac syndicate"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,i haven't read the leaks so i still have complete faith in the game. i preordered the 170 collectors edition due to being such a huge fan of the first game. i'm so excited for release!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,i do. there is no reason why not to. game is 100 gb in size with a lot of content. and i loved the first game thats that. i am playing for the story now. when it will come out on pc then ill replace the ugly females with sexy mods and then it will be perfect.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"i feel maybe it's not living up to the frist one, or massive technical issues or maybe it was designed on ps4 just for new hardware to pop up and them wanting to be a next gen launch title which would cement the game as a must have title to just play a new console."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"it's never going to be as good as the original. they're trying to make lightning strike twice and surf solely on the hype it generates. i'll probably play it, but i'll wait a year and read the reviews first."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,i don't expect the game to very enjoyable to play compared to what else is available so i don't have much faith in it at all really. i fully expect rave reviews and 1010 scores a plenty though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,yea. plus im not transphobic
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"honestly the game could be a masterpiece but i dont want to fund the company who has been illegally striking content on the internet, risking some youtubers livelihoods all in the name of censoring their opinions about the game. however the game is most definitely not a masterpiece but another cliche jab at stereotypical homophobic christian faith, a glorified brazzers lesbian movie and takes away from the ending of the first game making a mockery of it and the characters we loved. god bless the man who leaked it, hope he got paid in the end."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"i didn't have a lot of faith in the first place. the first one was just mediocre, and i didn't expect any better from the sequel."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"nevermind the sjw stuff, naughty dog is pulling an mgs2, and ppl are not gonna like it"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,me too. gamers seem to complain more about sjws and agendas then there are actual sjws.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,recent games had sjw agendas i.e. battlefield 5. dont know about tlou though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,can you give anymore detail on the brazzers lesbian movie?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-19,"battlefield 5? wtf are you talking about? see that's the thing, all these edgey millennials are just creating make believe agendas just to be mad at something."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,no they didnt
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,two lesbians make out on a couch. god forbid two characters who are romantically involved do anything remotely intimate in a video game. it's not like the witcher and it's literally multiple sex scenes.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"the leaks have reported multiple sex scenes that add little to the story, not only that but much of the story revolves around the fact ellie is a lesbian hence the homophobic christian cult hunting her. so much for not sexualising female characters, i guess."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"nah, they really do. some more than others, but few games are free of the crap."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,thats not what ppl are angry about
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"nobody is out for ellie, its the straight character that replaces ellie everyone is up in steroid jacked arms for"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"in the context of a complaint about it being a lesbian brazzers video, it is."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"true, missed that comment. but the anger is not directed at ellie, or her gf at all, its the new protagonist that you play most of the game as that is getting ppl angry."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"depends on the circles you frequent, and when you check in. i've seen the focus shift from the death of a particular character, to the fundimentalist antagonists, to the supposed masculinity of female characters to 'appease the trannies'. about the only valid criticism is sony's handling of the leak, and attempts to bully reporters and youtubers into not talking about it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"the character in question is very masculine, but not meant to be trans, she in fact, looks like shes on steroids, which is why alot of people are criticising it for not only being an unrealistic beauty standarda fact the people who usually complain about unrealistic standards are wierdly silent about but also highly unrealistic in the setting, as steroids would not be available, and keeping up the 3000 calorie diet needed for a woman to have such a physique would also be quite hard. it just seems forced, but i don't think its going to ruin the game, but there are valid criticism for such a character you should be able to pose."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"we must have seen very different videos, because all insaw was a reasionably athletic young woman with minimal body fat and an unkempt appearance. not some 3000 calorie shehulk."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"then you probably didn't see enough, look at the gameplay, then compare her to top level female ufc fighters and olympians, the person who this character is based on does crossfit and bodybuilding, both are rife with steroids, if you don't see it then you're just naive imo. either way, the calorie intake alone would be staggering, difficult to pull off post apocalypse. and even if thats not doing it for you, its still an unrealistic standard."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"its still an unrealistic standard. i mean, so was joel's broad chest and strong physique, considering he was a middle age alcoholic who spent more time avoiding work than actually trying to survive. then you probably didn't see enough honestly, no. not really. the last of us wasn't that good a game in the first place, and my interest in the sequel was more out of trying to keep up on the latest overblown scandal in gaming."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"joel didn't grow up during the apocalypse, much easier for men to retain such a physique than it is for women, abby has arms that are the result of steroids and a massive diet, wether or not you believe its steroids is irrelevant as the diet thing kills it. women can absolutely get ripped, but not jacked like abby is without help, her ingame model has the arms of a man.."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"joel didn't grow up during the apocalypse, much easier for men to retain such a physique than it is for women not with intake of highcalorie foodstuffs, particularly alcohol. they call it a beer gut for a reason. there's a difference between maintaining physique, and not gaining fat.  but not jacked like abby is without help she looks like any moderately butch highschooler who plays on literally any sports team. in a world where physical activity is the difference between life and death, she isn't remotely outrageous, physically. and that is definitely not a 3000 calorie a day body. maybe, maybe 2500, but that's even pushing it, depending on the actual foods their eating. it's actually not difficult to meet your daily calorie requirement even in a relatively harsh subsistence environment. really, the only thing that would keep people from being able to survive the apocalypse is outside threats, because growing food is surprisingly easy with a little knowhow. it's far, far more difficult to feed 300 million people in urban environments than to survive an apocalypse growing your own. y'all are really just trying to find things to complain about."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-18,"you clearly havent seen the leak, she looks like she's on steroids. deny it all you want, i don't see any reason to deny the obvious, but you do you."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-08,"what's up with that sub? why are they critical about a game that's not even out yet? i do like the first game, but that's only because i got to play it a bit. is it bad storytelling or something?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-08,ive seen a lot of people complaining about... a characters breasts being shrunken from real life? also a few people who think a character is trans because she has muscles i genuinely dont even know what is going on over there at this point
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-09,"there were some, uh... leaks ...that people arent very happy about"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-08,"ah i went through it a bit... and it's rather odd. i don't know how this new game will turn out, but i'm not one for politics., and if its just aesthetic issues, that's an odd thing to complain about."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-03-24,this is brilliant! i've been thinking of getting a tattoo that mixes the ellie design with something else as well  probably from deus ex.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2023-03-24,thanks! i appreciate it. and that sounds like a great combo.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-07-10,the fact that this game has a 42 completion rate is insane. most games average around 20 completion. the first game is only at 40 and that's over the course of seven years.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-07-09,im still upset theres no difficulty trophy. i earned that platinum on the first one. taking the difficulty trophies out feels like the gaming equivalent to a participation trophy.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-07-10,"you can't get them all in one playthrough. there aren't enough parts to fully upgrade all your weapons, or pills to upgrade your skills. you need new game to get them all... unless you're playing on the easiest difficulty maybe?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-07-10,"i grew up gaming before achievements were even a thing as well. but that's besides the point, people who want to tackle a games highest difficult should have something to work towards. that is the entire point of the trophyachievement system, to show off that you met and exceeded the skill ceiling for whatever game. it's not just a last of us problem either."

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,its your money. go for it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,are you my doppelganger? cuz i'm the same way.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,it's what i did for mighty number 9.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,game is fine. haters gonna hate.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,yes. get it. fuck the hate. so far the story has gripped my like fat kid to his baby back rib. i can understand why people might dislike the story but the outright hate is unnecessary. most of them havent even beaten the games cus it aint short and it just came out. the world and the acting is by far some of gaming finest and the atmosphere gets me so engaged. its like really walking through a post apocalypse zombie filled world. combat is mad fun and sneaking is challenging in its own right. i think the hate is undeserved. the critique maybe not so much but its far from a bad game my lord.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,the hate between nms and part ii is drastically different. a lot of the hate directed towards nms nowadays is just uninformed people thinking it's still the mess it was at launch. part ii is such a mishandled and drop in quality story wise that i don't know how people who loved the first game could even put it close to its predecessor.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,the game is fantastic. don't let anyone tell you otherwise
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,"no man's sky was absolute shit at launch, and is apparently a decent and complete game now. i'll never know, because i'll never play it after the shitty release the dev gave it. last of us 2 is excellent so far, and people are either butt hurt because they're homophobes or because they don't like the way certain story aspects were handled. i disagree with them on both counts."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,"most hatelove this game gets is coming from some political shit people are feeling, from a neutral point of view since all the political shit doesn't matter to me i would give it around 6 out of 10.  graphics are amazing and that feels like an understatement  there are some accessibility options that makes the game playable by people with disabilities, honestly i wasn't aware that such audiences are interested in gaming but anyway i just disable all of them because for a fully functional person playing with those is like using a cheat code, they are enabled by default.  game mechanics almost same as the old one no upgrades or new stuff  story line  this is the worst part, i don't want to spoil it for you but take the emotional rollercoaster that game of thrones made you feel and multiply it by a 100 remember how last season felt, remember how the red wedding felt , especially if you played the first part, if you haven't played the first part, well that also won't be a problem you can still play it but most of the story you wouldn't get. edit my feedback here might have been a little too vague, i didn't like the story it could have been better, the same context and conclusion could have been delivered in a better way. they really missed the mark in this department. all of that being said my recommendation is don't buy at full price."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-28,id send you my copy of i didnt buy it digitally.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,thanks for this blog post
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,you definitely should! the game is hilarious and goofy as fuck. last time i laughed this hard was during detroit become human.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,its more that its a sequel to a very popular game and the hype and pressure to live up to the original dont seem there
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,"did you play nms at launch or much later? it was trash on launch, with many features they specifically claimed to be in the game missing. they had to put stickers over the multiplayer logo on the game boxes ffs."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,at least it has good rope physics lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,"no man's sky was absolute shit at launch. if this is your opinion, i will not dispute it. i loved nms at launch."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-28,"too late, already bought it. day 1 in seattle as abby. so far, i like it mostly. don't like abby very much, though. usually, i prefer games that provide me with the freedom of choice. this one is... i really need to get used to that sort of game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,i loved detroit. that game was so goddamn annoying that i fell in love with the gameplay the second i bought it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,"at launch. first hour player. and man, it was perfect. i never listened to what they promised. i just saw the game in the store and i knew this is it"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,i loved nms at launch. i can't respect your opinion as a gamer then. that game was fucking horrible at launch.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-28,i think youll have a few more things you might struggle with in the game. like when it preaches at you about how shitty all the stuff it forced you to do is.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-23,i'm glad you liked it. but the majority didn't.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,"noted. i do respect your opinion. don't agree, though. because for me, it was perfect. have my upvote."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-28,"probably, yeah. but honestly, i'm actively ignoring the social implications of the game. if i wanted to experience a life full of shit and controversial decisions, i'd just relive my life from 2004 to 2006. i'm not questioning the game design but my preferences in video games."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-23,"yeah, i know. maybe if i had followed the docu and promises they gave and never fulfilled, i'd have hated, too. gladly, i didn't. still playing it from time to time, visiting the systems named after me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,you should play a good game and see what that's like and how alien it is from nms at launch.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,what do you consider a good game in this extremely specific genre? freelancer?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,"i meant a good game in general. preferably something that was released in a complete and playable state, not the 60 demo no man's sky was."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,"i've played those, aswell. i'm a fucking old dude. played my first game on the good old commodore c20."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-06-20,then you have no excuse. we're done here.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,"i think goty is really personal, for example i didn't like at all tlou but enjoyed the hell out of doom eternal"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,"i haven't had a chance to play tlou2 myself and everyone i've seen hating on it always has super vague reasons for the hate. so honestly, what was so bad about the last of us 2 anyways?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,who cares? does it affect your enjoyment of your favorite games?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,"game of the year award should be given to only those games which are released on all three platforms windows, ps and xbox. this would end exclusive deals. what do you guys think about that?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,no.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,lol yall need to grow up
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,"fairly? hell no. i aint saying its a bad game, but there were alot of discrepancies. too many awards for it barely any for got."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,"no, the story was cliched and spat on everything the first game built"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,doom should have won. just for that soundtrack
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,who cares?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,i don't care. it's only in the emotionally stunted bizzaro world of reddit that anyone seems to care about game of the year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,where is the i don't care option ?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,"yes. fight me. ghost of tsushima will always be my personal goty2020 though, shame it got robbed but tlou2 was much deserving. playstation stays winning though"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,lol yall are really salty about this huh?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,yes because it's the best game released this year.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,i haven't played it either. what i heard about was how they butchered the story that was carried from the first game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,well if ps didnt have exclusives most people would go to xbox for the game pass
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,i 100 agree.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,yes me no care becus i smort
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,you can just ignore
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,yeah i dont see why anyone gives a legitimate shit.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,thank you for proving my point.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,"no, seriously, if you genuinely wanted to know people's opinions, rather than just back up your own, don't care would be a valid option."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,me help u? yay?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-12-11,"that's a fair point, but i'm bot asking if people like the show or no, i'm just curious if the people that care think it's fair"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,that girl is definitely dead or clickerfied
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,everyone talking about this girl being dead and im just missin joel
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,i happened to have paused it for a moment then noticed a similarity. went back to double check and there it was. could this be why ellie is very angry in this game?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,thats not an easter egg.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,a turkish all seeing eye!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"d e d, tlou world is brutal and unforgiving. cant wait to jump back into it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,good eye
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,yissss
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,easter egg or foreshadowing...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,top picture with circle over bracelet. bottom black rectangle with circle in bottom right
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,so... the made ellie a buff lesbian?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"my thoughts exactly. leaning more towards the dead side. this game looks like it's going to be about way more than just the infected. the first game was too, but this will eclipse the first game in that respect. this is about regular people. the infected are just an added part that we'll deal with on the side."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"yea, she ded."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,or the combat scene is a flashback and ellie gave her girlfriend a bracelet.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,clickerfied
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,weren't clickers zombies that had been zombies for too long? unless those scenes are years apart i'd go for just dead or zombie
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i read a comment where the user suggested that in the reveal teaser, joel is actualy a ghost talking to elie. that was a gut punch"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"maybe not, but i think you get what i mean. it's hidden in plain sight."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,it's a low light shot. what can i say? edit forgot a word.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,what?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-23,she been gay since the first game bruh.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"heres my theory involving all the trailers. ellie amon was originally in that weird cult. they had something to do with makingbreeding humans that were immune for some reason. and im sure its super fucked up. it has something to do with the dragon flies. im sure because the dragon flies, man. ellie up and disappeared rescued by joel the coaches are, someone knows she exists. it has to do with that cult. joel may die. that child definitely does because this is last of us. ellie is about to uncover some major shit."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,u goddam rite
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"the trailer told us he was alive. the guy who approached ellie said your father chewed me out or something like that. if i had to guess, ellie and joel and trying to live peacefully with others, and then they get attacked by a group of bandits called insert name here, these bandits kill everyone she has come to care about, and sends ellie on a rage filled, revenge adventure to hunt them down. just a guess."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i think he means it has story significance, an eager egg is usually unrelated to the actual game."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"fireflies you mean. and that's a possibility. seems a little far fetched to me, but hey, that's why we'll play it."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"he's certainly alive before the attack, but that teaser was after. we don't know if joel made it or not."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,lol you are assuming that teaser is before any of this.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,right. i couldn't think of a way to put it in a short and to the point title so that's what i went with.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-13,lmao yes! that what happens when i havent slept in 24 hours. lmao but can you imagine a rival group calling themselves the dragon flies? lol
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2018-06-12,"i'm guessing that they're holding off on a big reveal of joel because the game seems to focus of ellie so much, and it'll have a bigger effect when they do finally reveal joel."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-25,i've played it once and never again. it's just a really exhausting game
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-25,tried getting through it again on three separate occasions and get bored with it fairly quick. to be clear i don't hate the game i just don't see myself revisiting anytime soon
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-25,"i loved everything about the first game. the second game is a technical masterpiece as you stated. the visuals, design and especially sound design are near perfect. the issues for me was the story. they made some very bold choices for characters in this one that just did not work for me. i wanted a continuation of the story of joel and ellie and there are some parts of the game that again nail that feeling ie the opening and a couple of moments in the middle of the game, but it fell short imo on delivering on what made the first game truly special. i get what they were going for as far as making you feel uncomfortable playing some of these sections. at a point it made me frustrated with choices the characters are making and their motives for doing so. the game has some great set pieces and gameplay mechanics, but at the end i felt the story made me feel like shit and that was maybe the point but its worth a play though to see for yourself but def play the first game if you have not."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-25,"honestly i still don't like the game at all. gameplay is decent, visuals are great but a purely realistic style is just boring to me, level design and exploration is bad, characters are bad, writing overall is bad, and the pacing is ass, which guts just about every other part of the game. the only purely good thing i can say about the game, aside from the visuals, is that the soundtrack is very good. i'm glad i didn't have much connection to the first game cause all my disappointment here could've really been amplified otherwise."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-25,i dont think its that peoples minds changed its just been out long enough now that the people that didnt like it have moved on and its the people that did enjoy it still talking about it.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-25,"good game, bad last of us"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-25,"my opinion has actually gotten worse the more time i spend with it. i played it around launch time and was mildly impressed, the gameplay was solid, the graphics were top notch, the story kinda sucked in that hbo too dramatic for it's own good style. i went back and played it again about a month ago and it's actually worse. now that the veneer has chipped away i'm starting to notice all the little bugs and reused assets. the story has gotten much worse too now that i know what happens in the late game. i've started seeing all of the plot holes, contrivances, and just asinine decisions to force the drama. so i went from a solid 8 or 7 at launch down to a 4 or 5."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-25,i didn't play it but i saw an entire letsplay i thought the game looked really good and the gameplay loop also looked neat. i thought its thesis was fucking dogshit stupid though.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-25,"imo, the way they handled joel was the equivalent of halo 2 coming out and axing chief, or splinter cell killing off sam in pandora tomorrow. coyly you imagine if forbidden west came out and kill areola in the the beginning?"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-25,"my issue wasn't that joel got killed, everyone following the game kinda expected that to happen. my issue was that the setup was really contrived, and the fallout of him being executed was just bad writing. his death set up the whole chain of plot points to the revenge scene at the end, which, while cliche was somewhat engaging. but the ending kind of invalidates the whole point of killing him in the first place. you dont have a character like ellie get progressively more angry at the loss of joel throughout the game, only to do a 180 at the end because of a single flashback, no real person would ever do that. and for a game built around people reacting organically, it completely falls on it's face."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-07-25,"yeah. the opening hit you in the feels and then it goes off the rails quickly. thats one thing in any medium that bugs me. you have an established character. they act in a certain way because of their experiences. then you make that character do a 180 without explaining why or having the foresight to write a compelling reason for them act in this different way. i think of luke in the sequel trilogy or joel in this game. he is a hardened survivor, some can make the point he is not a good person for his actions. he would be wary of any strangers or new people entering the town and in pet 2 he is like hi, welcome. want to come to come to our town and live with us. then go about doing what they do and then making you play as that person and saying you have to like them now. you can make characters change and act differently but there needs to be a reason why that is compelling."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,nothing to be excited about the story is pretty bad.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,it's ma'am
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,ill buy it and play it and let you know how it goes!!!
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,damn im preordering this.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,but only when u rip it out of any context and just put it straight out
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,"good thing your stating an opinion, instead of facts..."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,i'm pretty sure i am stating facts
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,"nope youre just drunk, bye buddy."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,i'm pretty sure i ain't drunk lmao
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,"it doesnt matter, because your opinions are garbage."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,yikes seems someone cant handle me criticising a poor story
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,but youre wrong. you havent even played it to even have an opinion on it so youre not worth anymore of my time. again bye
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,then please do tell me how i'm wrong and you dont have to reply to me and then say bye because you're kind of contradicting yourself
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,"you haven't even played it either, so by logic you're wrong as well"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,"dont tell me what to do pal! youre not my daddy. also you are wrong, and bye again"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,"but i never made a statement to the quality of the game... you did. so only your wrong buddy,"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,seems i'm right and you dont even have an answer to my question lmfao
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,well the fact you're defending that pile of shit means you think it's good.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,lol what question...
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,might wanna prepare some hate buddy from peeps
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,then do please tell me how i'm wrong might want to go to specsavers mate
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,i enjoy watching the sony ponies try and defend tlou2
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,you tell me how youre correct lol.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,the only thing i dislike about the game is the story but graphically it does look pretty impressive for a console game.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,i was the one asking the question not you so please do tell me how tlou2 story is amazing
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,"eh it looks like most triple a games in 2020, nothing special imo. but yeah the story is beyond awful"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,i didnt say its amazing. you stated its garbage so you have some answering to do... not me lol. so i ask you. how is it garbage?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,but youre wrong. you're the one that got yourself into this boat buddy by saying i'm wrong so tell me how i'm wrong and how your opinion is better than mine somehow.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,"but youre wrong.  you're the one that got yourself into this boat buddy by saying i'm wrong so tell me how i'm wrong and how your opinion is better than mine somehow. your wrong because no matter how sadly you try your never gonna redefine opinion to mean fact all the guy said is that your wrong about your opinion on a story being fact, which hes right about get a grip and get over the fact people like something you dont"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-05-08,i do have a grip but i'm asking how i'm wrong since he did say that my opinion didnt matter.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,"this is coming from the same awards agency that gave forknife game of the year, so i'm not impressed."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,no surprise. its a technical masterpiece. no other game pushes the ps4 to the absolute max.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,masterpiece
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,"spoilers for this p.o.s. game for me, had nothing to do with the transgender characters or anything like that. i thought the game sucked because it embraces a tradeoff of story for violence, and they love that cliche nothing ever gets solved and everything is sad mentality. they set it up to be this big vengeance tale where the person everyone hates is the only one who gets her vengeance. not to mention abby is a fuckin homewrecker, if she would have left the dude and his pregnant gf alone they might have been less distracted and been able to sail away without getting murdered, but nooo. the whole story is a big drama emo tale with excessive violence thrown in to make up for the fact they knew the story sucked whale dicks. like walking dead or game of thrones it lost its way and the ending shit the bed hardcore. rant over, sorry"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,it is rigged ghost of tsushima should of won it didn't have any of that woke trash
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,the game awards was the real one.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-30,"let me just remind you guys that people are allowed to like or not like something, for any reason they want."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,they voted for rdr2 actually. the gamers voting in voted for fortnite.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,their opinion mate it's a public vote lmao
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,tldr its woke trash
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,woke? because it includes characters that are different to what is normally done? fuck you.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,more like tldr i don't understand how to critically read a story.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,"i enjoyed ghost more from a gameplay stand point because i love samurai shit, but tlou2 had a way better story."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,why do people hate part 2 so much ive never played the last of us
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,shut the fuck up. everything except the story is phenomenal. accept this.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,fuck you for enjoying a pile of shit game with a shit story and a shit agenda buncha political correct garbage in tlou2 i enjoyed the shit out of the first game i loved it but part 2 can eat my cock from the back fuck outta here i get it you loved the big dikey abby that no one asked for and the narrative pfffft fuck off
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,more like tldr yup its definitely woke trash filed with identity politics and white man bad bullshit and lets kill your favorite character just to piss you off white boy whatchagonnadoaboutit?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,oh yeah killing joel like that because whiteman bad is really good story telling and also them pushing stupid agendas yeah i will stick to ghost of tsushima
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,"damn, all of what you just said holds no meaning whatsoever. no explanations, no reasons, just the ramblings of an idiot"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,"oh no, a game has lesbians in it! and it has brown people! this is clearly a threat to western civilization!"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,oh my god your quotations have zero context anymore and you dont understand what tldr means you fucking incel.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,did you play the game? the whole reason for her journey was his death.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,"there is no agenda or 'wokeness' to it whatsoever, joel was not a good guy and his decisions got him killed, that then sets off the entire plot and ellie's internal conflict. the story is great albeit structure quite poorly."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,i did play the game and i knew he was gonna die but killing him like that was pathetic all to push an agenda it is woke trash
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2020-11-25,i went in blind and it took me completely by surprise and i was all in for revenge. it was brutal and i was happy to inflict that pain right back. so as a story dynamic i thought it was excellent.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-03-27,so dumb. wrong
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-03-27,huh
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-03-27,it's only divisive because people are really ass blasted because of the story or characters. gameplay is better than the first.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-03-27,tlou2 is amazing. one of the only games of this gen with quality similar to that of rdr2
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-03-27,"i don't know if it was that divisive, just that the unhappy people were really, really, loud about it"
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-03-27,no its just shit heads mad cause women exist
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-03-27,"for me the divisive ff was ffxv. i was sooo hyped with the debut video, but when the game was released it was nothing similar anymore. instantly lost all urge to play."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-03-27,shouldn't have posted this when american's are online. they'll rabidly defend the garbage writing for some weird reason.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-03-27,"the pacing both combat and story was off in tlou2. i enjoyed the game, but not quite as much as the first. it took me months to figure out why. my conclusion was the pacing, which is a difficult thing to nail and is subjective."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-03-27,everything is better than the first. the only divisive thing is the story.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-03-28,final fantasy 13 was good too.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-03-27,the entire subreddit got locked and it wasn't because of tourists hating it. it bombed with a huge amount of hardcore fans.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-03-28,garbage writing for which game?
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2022-03-28,which was better than the first.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-06-20,game may be divisive but theres no denying how awesome the museum section was.
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-06-20,tlou2 is a good game.

Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-06-21,deleted
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-06-21,"it's frustrating, i loved the game engine and game play. i can accept the plot they were writing, but the pacing and structuring of the story ruined it for me."
Reddit,Action,The Last of Us Part II,2021-06-21,"meh, its whatever. i had fun. thats what matters to me."
