Neelyry,2025-02-22,60,"Sadly this is the worst GOW ever made. I no longer feel like a God of war, more like Dad of War. A retired near senior dad that's weak and struggles to fight. You even have to play as Atreus which is tedious. This may be the first GOW that i don't finish the campaign. I liked the previous one but that was a step down from GOW 1-3. Ragnarok is another step down."
Limpin,2025-02-17,20,"Black angborda? Isn't it blackwashing? Whole game much worse then GoW, and story so stupid then I am shooked."
thisejIDK2,2025-02-16,100,"Yeah this game being released to the PC, everything feels easier now, thanks very much"
Kajav,2025-02-10,90,"Definitivamente lo que se consiguió con este juego es una obra maestra, a nivel narrativo y de jugabilidad supera al primero que ya de por si era una obra maestra en si mismo. Lo bueno: - A nivel jugable es una excelente propuesta para e genero. - Los niveles están mejor estructurados o separados entre si, logrando un excelente balance. - Mayor variedad de enemigos y escenarios. - La historia es digna de una pelicula. Lo malo: - El tema de la exploración aunque mejoro en su diseño no te premia lo suficiente para querer hacerlo todo. Definitivamente una joya recomendadisima."
Tamert,2025-02-06,80,"I would say if the 2018 version 9-9.5/10 this wouldbe definitelya solid8 and nothing more. This game is definitelyso good and you must play this one and all the other God Of War games. If i wouldsay a few words about the game the first one would be 2018 had better boss fights for me. I know this has more andit feels like GoW3 but something didn't pull me. At some points you are not playing as the ""God Of War"" and you're playing as ""Loki"". This part is important because you are playing as him at least 4 hours and i wanted a skip button at some points. Ending is so good and makes you emotional just like 2018 version. Even though it's bad parts for me, it's still a masterpiece and you should play it!"
enano2407,2025-02-02,100,"Una completa locura gráfica y narrativa, tal vez demasiado continuista y recicla demasiado el gamplay pero la lanza Draupnir está a la altura del hacha leviatán, el giro argumental que tiene es una locura y empatizo mucho con los personajes, es como GOW 2018 pero mejorando todo"
nizang,2025-01-19,90,"A phenomenal continuation of Kratos and Atreus’ journey, blending intense combat, heartfelt storytelling, and stunning visuals. The story dives deeper into Norse mythology while exploring themes of family, fate, and redemption. The relationship between Kratos and Atreus evolves beautifully, showcasing growth and emotional depth. Visually, the game is breathtaking, with each realm brought to life with stunning detail. The music and voice acting elevate the experience, with standout performances that make the story even more impactful. Ragnarok doesn’t just meet expectations—it exceeds them, offering an unforgettable experience for fans and newcomers alike."
xaviar_nl,2025-01-04,90,"A great game with a very well written story, and great characters. It also looks gorgeous. I also played the 'base' game ""God of War"", and somehow Ragnarok feels a bit more repetitive, and a bit more platforming-heavy. Not really a major minus, but it is present."
m1c1b,2025-01-02,50,"Просто скучная игра без особого геймплея и сюжета. Единственное что произойдёт за 7 часов игры (а именно столько я выдержал) - это 1 масштабная драка и беготня туда-сюда без какого-то развития сюжета. Если первая часть меня порадовала, то Ragnarok был дрогну спустя 7 часов. Вернусь ли я к игре -вряд ли."
basic123,2024-12-31,70,Great game with stunning visuals and good mechanics. But they had to include people of color in a greek mythology. This was not very fitting and was a forced decision.

Janui,2024-12-19,0,The developer of svipdagr deserves to die. I hate **** make people's lives miserable instead of fun. This is cheap boss design.
petriAND,2024-12-18,90,"Gameplay - 8.5/10 | Story - 8/10 | Visuals - 9/10 | Sound design/OST - 9/10 | Acting/cinematics - 9/10 | Fun - 8.5/10 | Optimization/bugs - 9/10 => 8.7 For sure, it's one of the best games released in the last few years."
ElderMist,2024-12-17,100,"It’s a shame the older games are unavailable on PC because now I want to know the whole story. Besides the excellent fight system there are deep characters with tragic but empowering stories. And overall this game has almost no flaws. The only one that annoyed me is evertalking characters when I try to solve a puzzle. I understand it might be hard for some players, but give me at least one minute to think on my own!"
Harthik69,2024-12-15,90,Nice Game. Would love to play again in future. Good Graphics and mechanics!!!
Spoon2,2024-12-11,100,"incredible game, hats off to the tam that made it. combat, graphics, character development, story, art, all insanely good. ran well on PC too"
TheRealBatsy,2024-11-22,100,"The best story game i have ever played, i have played almost every story game out there, i have tried all the games out there, this one is on a different level, 10x times ahead of any story game i have ever played, played the 2018 game it was great, didnt think they could do something better than the 2018 game, and they did we asked for more enemies they gave us we asked for more bosses they gave us, doing side missions are not boring nor repetitive, only down side of this game is the irowood mission, i give that mission a 6/10, but i understand that mission had to happen, other wise i dont think i disliked anything about this game, pure masterpiece, glad i played it, kratos is wiser than ever, glad i grew up playing this game, played the first god of war games when i was 7 years old, and now i feel i am as old as kratos, the writing of the story makes you really attached to the character, well done santa monica, cant wait to try your new games"
ooooFOXoooo,2024-11-17,100,"The Witcher 3 is the best game I've ever played for my 24 years gaming experience. GOD OF WAR RAGNAROK is the one which that is closest and breathing down its neck. GOW is adult, it doesn't takes much on nowadays tinsel or trends, this gameis about the most important, about eternal things. It's perfectly made, it looks gorgeous it has everything, the masterpiece should have. The only thing which makes me sad, is that we would see these kind of games less and less."
faytclubs,2024-11-16,100,GREATEST OF ALL THE TIME I wasnt aware of the story until 4th hour of the game but later the deeper i entered the story i loved it so much man this is a masterpiece but i wish i could fight with thor more. A frking masterpiece....
safari,2024-11-14,90,oyun iyi ama bir önceki oyunu daha çok sevmiştim. ayrıca atreusa bu kadar yatırım yapılıyor ama çok kötü çiziliyor şekilsiz şaşı bir çocuk gibi yapılmış o beni biraz rahatsız etti. yan görevler dahil 30 saati geçmişimdir. **** oyundaki gibi daha rafine değil ama aksiyon ve ataklar güzel hikaye anlatımını beğendim. sadece son savaşta da bir koridordan çıkarmalıydı bence
Bankruptinator,2024-11-09,30,"Compared to GoW 2018 this game is a massive drag. Story decisions were just terrible. This is the ""Subverting Expectations: The Game"", every time it feels like it's about to get good it throws it away and just makes for a really unfavorable tale. It also became a massive slog around the time Vanaheim got released, too many side quests, too much stuff to bother with, boring traversal....which is sad considering I really liked the 2018 game and 100%'d it, but Ragnarok won't be getting a second playthrough. Game is getting a 3 and only a three because of the combat."
environment,2024-11-08,90,"Fun game.Puzzles with reasonable challenges, mostly optional.Good fight.Good story. Character development.Interesting story DLC.I only suffered one performance problem, which was in the portals between realms where, around 30% of the time, the FPS dropped and then rose again but lasted a few seconds like that.9/10"
ProGamers,2024-11-07,100,"God of War: Ragnarok manages to improve its fresh formula that we were able to enjoy in 2018, allowing the franchise to mature and evolve again along with its characters, in turn offering us a very careful and well-optimized port to PC."
RodrigoKosteski,2024-11-05,100,Kratos papai! Esse tipo de jogo triple A que vale a pena de verdade! Finalmente. Gostei mais do que o primeiro inclusive!
Doc1975,2024-11-04,70,"Sarebbe stato un ottimo prodotto ma, grazie alla ""solita""influenza negativa woke di Sweet Baby Inc, sono state volute inserire tematiche di inclusività e banalizzazione tipiche di una certa politica totalitaria, rovinando il tutto. Peccato."
aitorsibo,2024-11-03,100,"A perfect finale for the Norse saga. I love the fact that they kept it down to two games, and decided not to overextend. As usual, masterfully crafted, world, story and characters are top notch. The gameplay has been improved with the addition of a revisited skill tree and a new weapon. I really liked awakening the weapons and swapping between them depending on the situation. The game starts with a bang, perfect hook. I really like how the story unfolds, and I absolutely love the character's progression as they face the inevitable. Kratos's arc ends beautifully in the Valhalla DLC. As it is a sequel, there are many nods to the original, and the bases are the same, which is not a bad thing at all as the original was already very good. Don't worry, you'll get your fill of epic moments :).Excited about where this goes next!"
M-Reviews,2024-11-02,90,"Fortunately, the PC port that has now been submitted adds little to the manageable criticisms of the PlayStation versions. A few patches to fix bugs are probably necessary - especially with regard to the graphics memory problems - all in all, you get the same epic experience on the calculator as on the consoles. However, everyone has to decide for themselves whether it is worth shelling out another good fifty euros. By the way, this also applies to the incomprehensible compulsion to have a PSN account. Despite all the complaining, you won't find a better action adventure set against the backdrop of Nordic mythology on the PC at the moment. I'm curious to see whether the upcoming PlayStation 5 PRO will balance the account!"
vova22379,2024-11-02,60,"Gorgeous visuals and strong characters, but repetitive combat and predictable story twists keep it from greatness."
VOIIIXI,2024-10-31,90,"God Of War Ragnarök masterfully builds upon its predecessor, delivering an epic continuation of Kratos and Atreus's journey through Norse mythology. The game introduces a rich narrative filled with emotional depth, complex character development, and stunning visuals that draw players into its beautifully crafted **** gameplay mechanics are refined, offering a seamless blend of brutal combat and intricate puzzles. The addition of new abilities and weapons enhances the combat experience, allowing for a variety of playstyles. The boss battles are particularly noteworthy, showcasing challenging encounters that require strategy and skill.Visually, Ragnarök is a feast for the eyes. The landscapes are breathtaking, from snow-covered mountains to lush forests, each area bursting with detail. The voice acting and soundtrack elevate the storytelling, immersing players in the emotional stakes of the characters' journeys.However, while the game excels in many areas, some players may find the pacing a bit uneven, with certain segments feeling drawn out. Additionally, there are moments where the narrative could have benefited from tighter editing.Overall, God of War Ragnarök is an extraordinary sequel that successfully expands upon its predecessor's legacy. With its compelling story, engaging gameplay, and stunning presentation, it stands as a must-play title for both fans of the series and newcomers alike."
DenyFlash33,2024-10-29,100,"Just a cool game in everything!!! At first I passed god of war (2022 on PC) and when I passed it, I was curious, well, what else can be done with the same locations that were already ... although I was delighted with the first part too, but when I started playing Ragnarok I was just euphoric .... it seems like the worlds are the same, but the creators of the game changed them so much and it looks cool, and Svarthelm and Vagnheim are probably the most beautiful and unusual ... The gameplay has become more frisky, now you can play for both Kratos and Atreus and it's cool ... I'm really only at the beginning of the game ... so far I've passed 8 hours ... but I think it will be even more interesting further ... the only thing is the interface was convenient in the first part ... and honestly, it was possible not to change it ... but what they did was done ... although this little thing still can not spoil the feeling of this game. Today it is the game of the year for me, although it came out two years ago, but on PC only a month ago"
AcerolaOrion,2024-10-23,0,"God of Woke. You killed Gods, Titans, Creatures of the Abyss! What mythical supermonster will you fight this time? Idk how about we just throw some tiny real life sized lizards in there as enemies, some crappy ledge jump animations and tell everyone how Kratos wife was ohh so much better than him all the time in unskipable cutscenes. Ohh and also his son is gay now (not much of a surprise given the hairstyle). Bleh"
dannydans,2024-10-22,70,"Kratos is soft, this is not the same game at all. They killed the real GOD OF WAR with the reboot. Its like days of our lives, pathetic drama"
BenjaminTenyson,2024-10-21,100,Efsane bir oyun. Dövüş mekanikleri inanılmaz. Hikaye çok iyi aktarılmış. En memnun olmadığım nokta son bosslar çok kısa sürdü. Son bosslar çok daha epik ve tatminkar olabilirdi.
Sholva,2024-10-20,100,"An excellent sequel and really good PC port. God of War (2018) on PC was a nice surprise for me, and it is a game I thoroughly enjoyed, and it was a high quality port here on PC. I’m happy to say that its sequel, God of War Ragnarök continues this, we got a very good PC version of this game for sure, even though in this case the port does not include many extra settings that make it go quite above its PS5 version, graphically speaking. When it comes to Performance, on my Ryzen 7 5700X and Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti, Ragnarök can be played at mostly max settings, 1440p native resolution, at above 100 FPS easily, thanks to the very much excellent FSR 3 Frame Generation implementation; It is rare to find a game where FSR3 Frame Gen is perfectly implemented, with no stutters or annoying ghosting but, in Ragnarök, it is pretty good, and you should use if you can get around 90 FPS or more, post frame generation. When it comes to Controls and Keybinds, well I played the entirety of GOW 2018 with Mouse and Keyboard, it had excellent controls on PC, and I basically did the exact same for Ragnarök: the PC controls are excellent and I had no major issues customizing my controls to my liking. This may surprise some of you but yeah, action games can be played on Mouse and Keyboard too, they just need to have well designed controls, and this one simply has, nothing wrong with that. Graphically speaking, the game looks quite beautiful, even though as I mention the PC port does not include actual settings that go far above the PS5’s, unlike GPW 2018 did, with stuff like Shadows, but that’s quite alright, the game looks better than its predecessor, in my opinion, and runs really smoothly. Combat is as fun as it was in the previous game, and there are even more options and abilities now to use, both from Kratos himself and also from other companions. Speaking of companions and Characters, the acting performances are stellar in this game, particularly Kratos, Atreus and Freya’s characters, they really did and incredible job here, but so did the rest of the cast, which is quite big and varied in this game. Sound Design and the Soundtrack are two other aspects I really liked in Ragnarök, there are many epic moments in this game that are accompanied by incredible pieces, and many emotive moments too, it’s really great. Story wise, this game goes some places for sure, it’s a truly epic adventure with a satisfactory conclusion, in my opinion, I’m not talking any spoilers here, but I never felt the story felt padded or with bad pacing at all, all the sections of the story felt quite meaningful for some much needed character development, and I got exactly that, and it was well executed in the context of the story and what its characters needed, at that time. All in all, I enjoyed my time with this game a lot, I loved the previous game quite a bit, and I can say I liked Ragnarök just as much, it really does things quite well and it has some incredible set pieces and absolutely epic moments and boss fights. All paired with an excellent and mostly issue-free experience here on PC, a game that runs basically always quite smoothly, it’s been a joy to play it."
jarvitom,2024-10-20,100,It was perfect. Perfect. Everything down to the last minute details!!!!!!!!
abken,2024-10-19,0,"Terrible PC port (keyboard + mouse). For some reason you can't rebind all moves. The target lock is still bugged more than a month after the release. Previous game had the same issue but got fixed faster, this is ridiculous. Quick Turn is now bound to some weird keyboard combination and it is not rebindable (quick turn is important for GMGoW). Many of the bosses have physics/rigid body/hitbox issues (e.g., gravel belly) - they start vibrating because Kratos gets under their rigidbody and collides. It is a mess. The gameplay is slightly ""smoother"" than previous game, but there's soooooooooo much more to be desired. Overall just really disappointed. Not to mention how much filler side content there is. As a player who always plays games at highest difficulty and tries to get 100% Steam achievements, this is just not a pleasant experience. Play it on Medium difficulty, enjoy the hack'n'slash mash gameplay (not judging, literally more fun)."
FortOcean,2024-10-18,80,"Very good port, but with some technical issues, which will be probably resolved with future patches. Aside from that, the game itself is a masterpiece."
3imad_langlit,2024-10-18,90,"this game is better than the 2018 god of war in every single way when i thought it couldn't possibly be better it exceeded my expectations. the world is stunning and immersive, gameplay was super fun and versatile and the story was a masterpiece and unpredictable most of the time but what i loved the most was the character developement especially kratos's he has come a loooong way and gained wisdom and a better judgement and sense of justice and propably will even more through the next games considering that painting he saw at the ending overall this game is an absolute masterpiece and a top 10 game oat in my book"
Sanbarra,2024-10-12,60,"I don't understand the hype about Playstation games. God of War Ragnarok feels like a standalone expansion to God of War. There is absolutely nothing new. The combat system is identical, the non-existent story that you can't skip is identical, the enemy variation undercuts anything that's come before. Tubular level design like from 1999. Not even the 3D assets offer anything graphically. Other soulless AAA games at least get that halfway right. An action game for boomers, who shouldn't be given too much to play as it could overwhelm them. For everyone else, an insult to their lifespan and wallet."
KoKop0,2024-10-11,20,"this game on PC is unoptimized mess, this is unacceptable coming from Sony & Santa Monica Studio... it wasn't ready for release and every single update/ patch after release date make the game run worse! Im very disappointed"
SimoUnica,2024-10-10,100,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
darkss__eth,2024-10-09,30,"Completely destroyed Kratos and the saga. The story is trash and super boring. Most missions and bosses are completely forgettable. Although the gameplay is kind of fun with Kratos, it's too easy at times, even at the highest difficulty, and playing with Loki is utterly uncomfortable. Atreus is a soyboy, and Kratos is soft AF in this game. They really want to kill men's testosterone nowadays, lol."
ColossoHyrule,2024-10-08,100,sem palavras super obra prima obra de arte demais maravilhoso melhor franquia ja feita
Nazareth_7,2024-10-08,80,"This is an incredible way to ""end"" the story of Kratos and open up a new story with Atreus. While I do prefer the last game, its not lost on me how great the story is here. The boss fights were better in this game, and the combat as a whole felt like it was built off from the last game well."
TomasLacerda,2024-10-07,100,"By far, the best game I've ever played. The story is utterly incredible and kinda surreal how good it is. I will recommend this to anyone and everyone."
SB442,2024-10-05,70,"God of War Ragnarok was good, but it wasn't nearly as good as God of War 2016. The main issue is actually the story, more specifically a lack of a connecting theme and a lot of giant pacing issues. Unlike last time, where almost every side story and main story had an overarching arc of family and relationships, Ragnarok feels like it's all over the place. There is some talk about fate and defining one's destiny, however there isn't an actual commentary on the topic, and characters don't feel like they can actual change any outcome. There is also a lack of twists or surprises, and the ones in the game barely change anything in terms of character growth. Ragnarok does feature really well written characters and scenes with above average dialogue, especially Odin, Thor and Freya work incredibly well. Despite him being a kinda bad villain, Odin is probably the most entertaining character and he steals every scene he is in, even if the story barely has things for him to do. I expected a lot more interactions between the characters, more mischief and more of what Ragnarok is about, which is the death of most Asir gods. That doesn't really happen sadly, and the story really lacks stakes and dramatic elements in its second half. The pacing is a bigger issue, why was it more easy to recruit Surtr, the catalizator for Ragnarok, than to defeat some random side mini boss? We barely see Odin do anything bad and all we hear are people talking about him. The game starts strong, but becomes very repetitive in the middle and incredibly rushed by the end. There are cool story moments, like the celestial hounds encounters, or Getrude's life or Tyr's personality, but these elements don't form a theme and feel like a series of unrelated side missions. Ragnarok's gameplay is fine, it's more or less the same as its predecessor with even some of the same enemies and moves that you unlock all over again. The combat itself is very restrictive, everything depends on your level, you can't fight foes with higher levels efficiently. The combo, and elemental magic system adds some depth to the combat, and enemies are very generous and they usually let you execute your combos, however some mini bosses have simply far too much health and fighting them becomes a bit repetitive. You can't really use any tactics against these, if you have a lower level, your damage output will be so small, that fighting them is not worth the energy. Overall, stick to the main missions, then the combat is fine. Side content feels imbalanced, and the wanderer bosses aren't well designed. That being said, there is a lot of content here, lot of characters, lot of side missions, lot of scenes. But these feel like many separate adventures, instead of one."
SebbS82,2024-10-04,90,A wonderful game. And very good optimised for ultrawide. Nice story and much content. Better than God of War 1.
SirPuffy,2024-10-04,100,"Après l'horreur de Star Wars Outlaws ça fait du bien jouer à un vrai jeu. Des graphismes époustouflants, un gameplay et une histoire au top. Je me régale, merci. Ubisoft prenez-en de la graine avec vos bouses infames."
Kerber,2024-10-03,30,"QTE games could be great for some console, middle-aged gamers who 0 challenge, but on PC this concept is really bad. What is even worse is that story, instead of being main driver when gaming mechanic is based on hitting buttons on a screen, is actually bad. Sad dad story with rebellious kid and old father might be perfect for gamers with estranged kids, but not a lot of those on pc. Audio is busted as dolby atmos doesn't work and dual sense is not working wirelessly but those should be fixed with patches, but still strange to see xbox joypad working and playstation onr not being supported. Graphics is good and not demanding, game is stabile. It is good to see such stabile game, and hence 3/10 as only positive. Broken atmos, story and silly game mechanics bring 0. With weak story and silly game mechanics, sony should stick with playstation, as pc gamers aren't really audience for such games. And weaker sale numbers than previous gow had prove this. Novelty wore off and there are much, much, much better games on pc with tight gameplay and actually rewarding players not for pressingbutton that is shown on a screen, but actually being good in a game. And that is a pc gaming. I stopped playing after couple hours , this is unbearably boring and watch gameplay videos before getting it."
