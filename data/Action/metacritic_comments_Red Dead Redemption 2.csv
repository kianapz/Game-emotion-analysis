Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-21,"probably one of the best games i've played in 2018. when rockstar take their time, they came up with these masterpieces. well done!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-20,"given that the developer of this game is rockstar games, it's no surprise that it has received such high ratings. having played it myself, i can confirm that the acclaim is welldeserved. this game is a mustplay for anyone who enjoys the wild west and openworld genres. in fact, skipping this title would mean missing out on an essential experience for gamers. the storyline, gameplay mechanics, graphics, and expansive world are all exceptional. i honestly can't find a single complaint to make about this game."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-14,"a glorified, long winded walking simulator with a lot of cutscenes that can't be skipped, no free saving and still not great performance on max settings on modern hardware. you get to shoot a few guys every five minutes or so, that's that for actual gameplay. hunting is boring, loot is uninteresting and character progression is not very deep. but at least you have five other mini games to play. more of an interactive movie than a game. but i would suggest to watch django unchained 20 times in a row, which is more interesting the 20th time than this slow paced snore fest."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-27,"a fun game overall, but extremely overrated. definitely not a masterpiece. story is engaging, but it takes itself too seriously and it has many nonsensical, cartoonish moments. overall the writing is subpar, but the dialogues are good and the acting is excellent. the game suffers from way too many issues to be considered great. controls are awful and gameplay design is extremely poor. all missions are the same and the game forces you to strictly follow a script every step of the away, taking away all player's freedom. there are a lot of boring moments and overall the world, while beautifully crafted, is rather empty and not that big either. towns in particular are very small and unimpressive. side missions are also very lackluster. the best thing in this games are the animals and hunting. unfortunately i hate hunting, but if you love killing squirrels and skinning them, this game is for you. interactions with the world and its characters are also pretty dull. a lot of efforts have been put towards immersion, with some results, but overall i could never get really immersed, due to the childish plot and completely unrealistic mechanics, like the whole crime system, which is awful with police teleporting all over the places and ridiculous bounty system which allows you to commit mass murder and then clear your criminal record by simply paying 100 dollars to the nearest post  immersive!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-24,when i first played this game i got bored easily cause it felt way too long and the map was way too big for my liking but after playing the first red dead redemption and enjoying that i came back to this to give it a second chance and it's honestly way more fun for me to play now i still have the same feeling as the game just being a bit too long for my liking but it's amazing either way.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-23,"this game was recommended to me by a friend of mine who completed it before me and gave me a couple of instructions on it. when i was able to buy it, i immediately installed it, and when the game was launched, i immediately joined it. i went through every quest, watched every cutscene, and went through the main plot with great interest. and when i finished the game, i realized why this game is so loved  the nonlinear plot. and, as a person who has completed this game twice, i can describe all the pros and cons of this game. let's start with the positives. this game has a very large open world, with many locations, cities, even landscapes. this game also boasts an excellent plot and welldeveloped main characters. a very nonlinear plot, which differs from most games and on which many theories can be built, which is seasoned on the one hand with absolutely understandable main characters, but if you think about it... i especially liked the development of arthur as a character, first as a bandit, ready to give everything for the sake of his gang, and then, as a lost leader who saw the disintegration of the gang, he tries to at least somehow atone for the sins of the person. another plus is the diverse flora and fauna. since the game has many forms of landscape, fields, forests, lakes, hills and mountains, there are correspondingly many different animals and plants. when i played the game for the first time, i was a little freaked out by such variety. even after completing the plot and ending, i played another 30 hours just like that, driving the entire map in search of new game or animal to sell skins. but the downside, as another friend of mine told me, is that the game is too slow, especially at the beginning. deep down i agree with him, i sometimes caught myself thinking this way, but i still liked the game. well, as a result, i can say that this game, it seems to me, has forever become top 1 on my list of favorite games."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-21,"bueno esta es la tercera vez que me paso rdr2 y no tengo palabras para describir la grandeza que tiene este titulo y lo que consigue hacer rockstar con esta obra. este juego no es un simple juego lo considero mas una experiencia que todos deberan de vivir al menos una vez. esta claro que el juego es lento pero es necesario que el juego sea as para ensearte todo lo que ofrece y poder de esa forma disfrutarlo como es debido. desde como se ve, que es una completa barbaridad teniendo en cuenta que estamos hablando de un juego de 2018 y que a da de hoy en 2024 muy pocos juegos consiguen hacerle frente de tu a tu, desde lo bien que va en cualquier plataforma que lo corras en pc tiene una optimizacin brutal desde su gameplay par algunas personas repetitivo pero sinceramente no se como podran haberle dado mas profundidad a disparar teniendo n cuenta que no deja de ser un sandbox, su estructura de misiones otro de los puntos que mucha gente ha criticado del titulo y de verdad que me lo he pasado tres veces y considero que red dead te pone en un montn de situaciones muy diversas y que para nada en las 7p u 80 horas que le puedes dedicar se te puede hacer repetitivo. todo esto acompaado de hasta el momento el mejor mundo abierto que se ha creado en la historia de la industria. con un milln de cosas por hacer, npcs que realmente tienen una vida detrs y no estn ah simplemente por estar, cada ciudad como puede ser valentine, rhodes, saint denis, blackwater, strawberry, van horn... tiene su encanto y su diseo artstico, su gente que actan de manera diferente en fin se nota que estas realmente en lugares diferentes, y que decir de la historia para mi una de las mejores historias creadas en la industria con unos personajes fascinantes habra que hacerle una resea solamente al personaje de dutch y llevada por lo que para es el mejor protagonista jams escrito en la historia, arthur morgan, con arthur vivimos una verdadera redencin que realmente nos lleva a plantearnos cosas y llegamos a vivir momentos muy felices y momentos muy trgicos, es complicado de explicar lo dentro que se te puede llegar a meter arthur pero no es un simple personaje de un juego mas, sino que llega a ser alguien al que realmente le cogemos un cario especial. para ir terminando simplemente lo dicho me parece una de las mejores experiencias que puedes vivir jugando a videojuegos y si tuviera que decir algo malo es que hay veces que el personaje se queda un poco atorado debido a la gran cantidad de mecnicas que tiene si se queda una superpuesta de la otra pero quitando esa tonteara solamente tengo palabras de admiracin hacia rockstar por haber creado esta carta de amor a los videojuegos."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-06,"incredibly generic and overrated, rockstar is good at making tech demos, but awful at making characters and worlds you actually care about, this feels so painfully generic compared to tlou. everyone talks about it being so immersive, but they take camera control away from you all the time, random music starts which isn't inworld, etc, i don't see what the hype is about, no amount of game features can make up for a generic cast."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-02,"in the vast expanse of gaming, few titles manage to capture the essence of an entire era, a spirit of adventure, and a sense of belonging quite like red dead redemption 2. from the moment you step foot into its meticulously crafted world, you're transported to a time when the wild west wasn't just a setting, but a way of life. rockstar games has outdone themselves with this magnum opus, delivering an experience that transcends mere entertainment and becomes an unforgettable journey through the heart of america's untamed frontier.passionate doesn't even begin to describe the relationship i have with this game. it's an obsession, a love affair that deepens with every sunrise over the plains, every thunderstorm rolling across the sky, and every encounter with its richly developed characters. arthur morgan isn't just a protagonist he's a legend in his own right, a flawed yet undeniably human figure whose story resonates long after the final credits roll.this game doesnt deserve the bad meta score of 97 it desererves 100 and no negative reviews this game is beyong good and would give it a 11 in score if i could. from the breathtaking landscapes of the open world to the intricate details of its bustling towns and settlements, every inch of red dead redemption 2 feels alive. it's a testament to rockstar's dedication to their craft, a commitment to immersion that sets a new standard for openworld gaming. whether you're hunting game in the wilderness, robbing trains under the cover of night, or simply sitting around a campfire swapping stories with your fellow outlaws, there's always something new to discover, something to marvel at in this living, breathing world."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-28,"this game is great, but feels repetitive. it feels like it relies 80 on story, while most of the game is ride across the map to do more boring 'fetch me this' quests. if they cut out the bs and focused on the fun parts it would be much better. they give me story and then 7 hours of filler to make it more realistic or something. i wanna have fun when i play video games."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-24,"this game is an absolute masterclass in storytelling and narrative design. arthur morgan is simply one of the best characters in any video game i've ever seen. on top of this, this game's world is just fun to explore with lots of activities to keep busy with. for some downsides, i think the structure of some missions in the campaign can be repetitive and sometimes frustrating, in the worst cases limiting player freedom to an unacceptable extent. also, the multiplayer experience certainly leaves a lot to be desired. overall though, this game is simply incredible on almost every level."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-01-21,"it is without a doubt the most overrated game of all time, considering the reviews and general praise the game gets. the story is a complete mess overall. the story is essentially about a gang of outlaws or criminals that attempts to gather enough money so they can live independently in some sort of paradise life. you are playing as degenerate, that thinks they have the moral high ground by robbing rich and poor and then distributing it to your fellow gang members. how is that fun, or how is that a good story? not to mention the story itself isn't gripping in the slightest. there is no clear objective or incentivizing moment in the story to make the player understand or actually care about the gang or it's characters. there is no cohesion, sense of direction and focus in the story to make the player actually engaged in it. the writing is nothing special, the dialogue between the characters is extraordinarily uninteresting, none of them have anything interesting to say and neverreveal any interesting backstory. the incredibly dull characters in the camp are somewhat fleshing out through side content and camp wandering, but not only was that overly tedious that i never wanted to do it, but largely uninteresting because getting piecemeal insights on forgettable camp follower isn't compelling as they weren't introduced well to begin with. gameplay is quite poor and considering how long the game is, the gameplay never evolves. you don't unlock new skills, abilities or anything like you would in a true rpg the only progression is unlocking new weapons and clothing, which have minimal gameplay impact. so the gameplay from the first min is going to be roughly the same as your endgame gameplay, which is alsovery boring. the graphics and open world is good, but thats not enough to carry the game. all the open world activities are pointless, so the incentive to explore and adventure out in the open world quickly diminishes. despite this, it is often regarded as the best game of all time, i wonder if these people are generally unintelligenthaven't played many games or if there is something i don't get about this game."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-12-11,"hands down the best game i've ever played in my 38 years of life. i'm wrapping up my 5th playthrough. this is my 1 goto game when i can't think of what else to play. the visuals are incredible. i've added some small visual mods to enhance textures and atmosphere, but even vanilla, it's astounding. playing on a 4090 at 4k hdr. it's the atmospheres that really get me. watching the sun's rays march through a foggy eastcoast morning, heavy clouds rolling in before a moody cold storm hits, watching the sun set over a lake while fishing as birds fly around and a mountain lion sneaks up behind me. the world is incredibly alive. the trees sway in the wind realistically, animals are everywhere, npcs can attack out of nowhere. there are so many tiny attentions to detail. even after 5 playthroughs, i'm still discovering new things. my only complaint is that there isn't more story. the story is huge and there's a thousand hours of things to do, but i want more! it's sad i'll probably be in my late 40s whenif the next version comes out."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-11-29,rockstar gave it their all in this game. one of the most immersive experiences i've ever had while gaming. everything just clicks. its one of these times where i just cant find the right words to describe a great game without doing it any disservice.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-11-28,"easily one of the best games of all time. insanely good story arc, the only game ever that made me rethink my life choices, that gave me a different perspective on people and their choices. i cannot express how perfect this game is  and just its story but its amazing music, beautiful graphics and landscape. so much activities  quests, places to visit, minigames, hunting, fishing, collectibles."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-11-27,"one of the most immersive experiences i've ever had playing video games. arthur morgan for me has become one of the most iconic characters in video games, even though he is a thief and thinks he is a horrible person, his actions most of the time go against this thinking about himself, conflicting with what he thinks is right. himself and the loyalty he has to dutch and his pack. the moment he got me 100 was in chapter 5, where there is a dialogue with an npc who is trying to convince him for the third time that he is a good man, saying he doesn't know himself, and in a moment of weakness he blurts out i guess i... i'm afraid. i couldn't hold back some tears in this scene, and many more in the closing scene of arthur's story.i could spend hours writing about the very alive and organic universe of this game, the life that each npc has, or the various options for what to do while exploring the map like hunting, fishing, cleaning up guns, taking a shower, and all that while gawking. such a breathtaking scenery. but i'll leave this part for those who haven't played the game yet to get a feel for it.i am dying sister...  the good man"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-11-27,"i wasn't a fan of this game at first as i don't really like such slow games, but over time, i started enjoying it more and more. now i believe that it's one of the best games ever made."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-11-27,"red dead redemption 2 for pc stands as a triumph in many aspects, offering a meticulously optimized experience, captivating narrative, stunning graphics, and unparalleled freedom within its openworld environment. rockstar games' masterpiece delivers an immersive wild west experience, enabling players to traverse an exquisitely detailed landscape while engaging in diverse activities like hunting, side missions, and exploration. the optimization for the pc version of red dead redemption 2 is commendable. the game runs smoothly, showcasing its visually breathtaking landscapes and lifelike character details without compromising performance. the beauty of its graphics, from the sprawling landscapes to the minute details, creates an immersive world that's a visual feast for players. one of its strongest attributes lies in its free roam mechanics. the ability to engage in various activities like hunting, side missions, and item collection adds depth to the gameplay. exploring the vast open world is a joy, with countless treasures to discover and experiences to be had. however, despite its many strengths, the game suffers from a relatively linear and dated design philosophy, which significantly affects the overall experience. the game's structured missions often lead players down a predetermined path, restricting the freedom that the open world otherwise promises. the rigid go here, do this nature of missions and the lack of flexibility can feel restrictive and counterintuitive in a game that boasts an expansive world. the game's adherence to a cinematic style contributes to its linear design, sometimes stifling player agency. the stringent mission objectives that penalize deviation limit the organic exploration and player choice, causing frustration for those seeking a more openended experience akin to older titles like deus ex, which offered more freedom in decisionmaking. in summary, red dead redemption 2 for pc is a visually stunning and narratively captivating game that excels in many areas. however, its adherence to a more linear design philosophy limits player agency and contradicts the openworld nature that defines its appeal. while its cinematic approach enhances storytelling, it comes at the cost of player freedom, which might disappoint those seeking a more flexible and choicedriven experience. despite these limitations, red dead redemption 2 remains a remarkable achievement in gaming, blending stunning visuals, compelling storytelling, and an expansive world that, while somewhat constrained, still offers an unforgettable journey through the american frontier."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-13,"boah, this is the open world game. no, best game of all timevisually the most outstanding game with so much attention to details in this living and breathing world. from snowy mountains to plain grasslands, from muddy swamp to barren desert, from livestock town of valentine to industrialized city of saint denis, feels i've seen everything in this world of wild wind  npcs are like real life human with routined life. they also react like  will feel bad for killing them or rob them if you have a heart. the wilderness is vast and dense. how dears graze or run. oh, you can pet dogs dthe story and narratives are well written. this is the prequel to first rdr. story takes place in 1899, last era of wild west. we play as arthur morgan, a senior member of vanderlynd gang. not spoiling anything, a truly remarkable and shocking story to go through with deep narative and character. sometimes game's story feels better than some award winning films.mainly a 3rd person game but can also be played as 1st person. gunplay is pretty fun and realistic with lots of weapons from the 18th century. there's dead eye mechanic  some kind of aimbot power to feel like real gunslinger. the most realistic and horse riding i have ever experienced in this game. horse need to be fed and kept clean. there's level of horse bonding reveals how much loyal your horse will be to you. there's honor level system that will affect some part of story and cut scene. game is satisfyingly long with bunch of well written side missions and lots of activities.there was some optimization issue at the launch time on pc port but it's now pretty much fixed with several patches.i am truly grateful to play this game. i wasn't a fan of wild west but this game made me one. i wish i could play this as first time once again. a truly remarkable journey to wild west. arthur, best video game character i know. must play this legendary game if your machine can run this. wish i could forget everything and play it for the first time!not just a game, but more than life itself.personal rating 1010only single player story mode"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-11,"i just had the chance to play this game in 2023. it was a really amazing experience. it is not just a game in which you do things that lead to an end, but you get to live the life of the main character, see his evolution and most importantly the evolution of the ones around him, the environment and even the small towns cities evolve through time. it is really full of details letting you talk to people everywhere, animals scattered all around that feel almost alive they see them eat, drink water, they're surviving too, decomposing bodies, relationships, some decisions and interactions. it has amazing graphics a really amazing soundtrack and music and as of 2023 the game is completely stable. the story telling is really good, and it is a really good story that didn't just focus on shooting people as a wild west cowboy, but you get to feel good, bad, really bad and worst because of the difficulties and hard things you face through the game. the only things i can say i didn't like that much a would have like a better fast travel system and hunting was not really that necessary, the upgrades you can get from hunting are not really needed even if you want to do every single activity in the game. i really was not expecting that much from this game but it completely destroyed my expectations for the better. totally recommended."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-01,"i've started playing this game six times, including when i bought it on ps5. each time something prevented me from playing more than the end of the first act. but all my friends kept telling me that it was a good game and worth trying again. and so the time came when i said to myself  either i need to put on my hat, check my revolvers and find out which way arthur morgan will go and where he will end up in the end, or never start the said game again. and as you can imagine, i wouldn't be writing this review if i chose the second option. what i mean is, if there are guys and girls who, like me, have not been hooked by the game from the first hours of the game, do not give up and throw red dead redemption 2 into a dark corner, give the game a chance, and somewhere after a third of the passage, the game will fully thank you for it with unexpected plot twists, deeper disclosure of the main characters of the game, chemistry between the characters, and so on. in general, the game is big, looks and sounds good, is filled with various references, and you want to explore it. if you are a fan of the wild west, then this will be a 10 out of 10 hit for you. that's all for now. have a good day and enjoy your coffee."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-21,it's hard to understand why the review scores are so low. it's one of the best games ever and one of the best optimized games ever released on pc.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-20,red dead redemption 2's exceptionally realized world and superb narrative make this one of the best experiences of the generation.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-19,"first of all, the game is not perfect. no game is. but it's really goddam close. pros the characters are acted better than any other game ever, and the story is dynamic and gives the player so much freedom not rpg levels but you know. the world feels so alive, and almost every npc can be interacted with. every tree and rock feels like it is there for a reason, and the cities and towns have incredible atmosphere and feel like they exist in real life. the game looks amazing as well at launch it was really buggy and badly optimized but now it's one of the best optimized games on steam. i have a laptop with an rtx 3050 in it and on medium to high settings, it gets 5060fps in most places and drops to 4050 in the larger towns and cities. cons controls feel like they are 10 years old probably because they are. its essentially the same as red dead 1. they feel very sluggish and unresponsive. your horse will often stop and spin in a circle if you try to turn too much while sprinting on it. the gunplay is pretty good but not great and the game isn't very difficult, it just adds difficulty by throwing a bunch of enemies at you. even so, i still die a lot more from the bad controls than from the enemies actually being that hard and no, there are no difficulty options. you are stuck with what the game gives you."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-19,"game has a good graphic side, but story is too extended. for me it became not interesing playing after 40 hours of literally doing nothing, because main story cant give u anything interesting in the begining and in the middle of the game. open world is good, but it is not a gta where u could take someones car and ride to ur mission or other activity, no, traveling in this game is mega annoying. i would not recomend this game 310"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-19,"un juegazo. no le pongo el 10 porque el online a da de hoy sigue teniendo bugs y no tiene contenidos nuevos ni servidor privado como gta v, que es la niita de pap de rockstar."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-18,words aint enough to describe the game... untill r makes better one. this is the best one
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-17,amazing story and setting. looks beautiful and the story is fantastic. i felt the actual action at times was repetitive and the pacing at times was off. overall an amazing game though.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-16,impressive story and great gameplay. masterpiece from every perspective! mustplay for every rpg lover!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-14,"that is the best game i've ever played. in fact, i just came here cause i felt like it was my duty to. already put more than a hundred hours into the game, beaten the main history, but i feel that there's much more to be seen. and i don't even started the multiplayer game yet. i just don't know why there's no option to give an 1110 for this game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-14,this game is best boring game i have ever play in my entire life so good but boring
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-14,"a beutiful story with clanky and in the long term tiring gameplay, gunplay and gore make it worth"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-13,very good game. i enjoyed playing this game a lot. i strongly recommend this.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-13,the most succesful game in history i played the game for 70 hours without getting bored and finished it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-13,"despite being unplayable at launch on my pc, i went back after the game was fixed, and was pulled right in. i hadn't played any games in the series so i can't compare it to previous releases, but the world is beautiful and i really enjoyed getting to know the characters and their back stories. perhaps the most amazing thing of all though, are the random encounters and side stories that come up as you're just exploring the beautiful world"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-12,"basically the perfect game, and i wouldn't be surprised if other games have taken a hit to sales because rdr2 is so much better by comparison."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-11,"a true master piece. amazing graphics, great story and characters. only the multiplayer is a big letdown, otherwise it's almost perfect. instant classic"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-10,"after playing for just under 20 hrs i deleted the game from my pc. it's a very good game, but there is absolutely nothing inspiring, engaging or new about it bear in mind, for me, you may have a completely different perception. so  literal gta clone in the wild west  no compelling story for 20 hrs, for me it feels like just jumping from mission to mission. the concept of a story written that way is fitting for mobile consoles not pc games for me. when i finally sit down to play i want the story to be engaging, this one was not. a quick mission to play for a moment is something i can do at a train station waiting 20 minutes for a train.  rockstar as always blew the controls and i genuinely feel no one there ever rode an actual horse. i am sorry, i know this is not a good review, but this game just made me feel tired and i had 0 fun with it. if you liked gta and are a fan of the wild west this will probably be a solid 9 for you at least. for me? deleted, probably will never return to it, i just feel sorry i cant get a refund anymore."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-05,"the absolute best open world game you will have played so far. the game world is beautiful, the characters are amazing. everything and everyone can be interacted with, and the world is amazingly immersing. the main character is so relatable that after a long day of hunting, i found myself laying down to sleep after what i truly felt was a hard days work. now to me this game is something like a 9.7. the only reason its not a 10 is that the story sadly tanks massively around the middle and in the epilogue. around these points it is amazing, one of the best i ever had the honour of experiencing, but during said points playing felt like a bit of a chore. dont let that stop you though, it still is absolutely one of the most amazing games out there."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-03,"i have heard so much praise about this game, but i don't think it's anything special. the story is great, but that is about it. the game is very slow and nothing is too interesting or unique."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-07-27,"so many years later, it's pretty crazy to think that people had technical problems at launch. this is the best optimized game i've ever played. no other game can look so amazingly good especially the lighting effects, breathtaking! and keep the framerate so stable, in such a gigantic world. i also loved the gameplay and freedom, some of the most fun i've ever played in a third person shooter, but way too easy. the attention to detail is in absolutely everything and not a single repetitive side quest. the characters are incredibly crafted and the script and voice acting are sensational. anyway, i have nothing but good things to say about this game except for the difficulty thing so i can't give it anything but a 10."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-07-24,the game that best reflects the wild west theme with its gameplay and mechanics.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-07-18,best visuals and gameplay mechanics with very interesting storyline. highly optimized! would definitely recommend to play its story mode. the attention to details in this is mind blowing!!!

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-07-15,"perfect game in every way story, gameplay, environment, characters, music."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-07-15,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-07-13,"rdr2 initially took some time to captivate me, but as i continued playing, i found myself genuinely enjoying the experience. without even realizing, i became deeply invested in the characters and the events surrounding them. each chapter brought its own intrigue and pushed boundaries in terms of storytelling, character development, and immersive environments. while some chapters resonated with me more than others, the game evoked a range of emotions. i found myself laughing and amused at certain points, but as the journey reached its conclusion, feelings of sadness, anger, and deep immersion took hold. i am thoroughly impressed and highly recommend this mustplay title."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-07-06,"really disappointing nothing really feels like it was ready for release. for me personally the performance is ok 60 fps on balanced settings with 6700k and a gtx 1070. most of my complaints are just with the bugs and lost freedom of the game. i have a problem where the mouse aiming is not very precise and when trying to make small adjustments to line up shots it is almost impossible because the reticle moves in 56 pixels at a time and has almost like a deadzone for how much the mouse has to move before it registers like the problem that still persists with the gta iv pc port. when looking back at other games rockstar have released it was hoping for the aiming and combat to be atleast as good as previous games like gta 5 or max payne 3. but no, it feels clunky and imprecise. movement also aint so good. trying to walk close to a ledge to push some over? too bad arthur has a death wish and jumps down with no hesitation. and movement just feels more restrictive compared to gta 5, changing direction is slow and is made even worse if youre riding a horse. one time where i realised rockstar had removed freedom was when chasing a train a promt comes up jump to train. but it only appears when it is clear. why was that made? why not make me able to jump always make me time it and if i dont i get to see arthur ragdoll and get hurt this would make it more intense when trying to leap from your horse instead of it being precalculated it just needs me to press the button. made me feel really sad. freedom in missions is also very rare youre constantly being told what to do and how to do it. follow this man, wait for this cutscene, shoot these guys. it is very boring and tedius. a mission where they have to rescue sean from a boat full of bad guys. instead of me, the player figuring out how to rescue him, the game does it all for me and i have no input on what happends. might aswell watch a movie instead of these. its like a constant cutscene but where i have to hold down 'w' to keep my horse moving forward and only the 'w' does anything, trying to turn the horse and nothing happends they strip me of my controls to make me stick to the plan but keeps me awake to make me press 'w' and bore myself to death. the game looks and sounds incredible and i have no complaints here. but it feels like the wanted to make a movie instead . most of the time youre just coasing by no doing anything because the game is doing it for you. an addition i liked more than i would have thought was the growing beard and hair. its just a really nice feature. also the game crashes almost constantly if in fullscreen mode. i found that if left in fullscreenwindowed mode, it has a much lower change of crashing out of nowhere. if buying the game wait for the steam release. steam more features and functionality compared to the rockstar launcher which was built in 2 weeks by interns being paid minimum wage."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-07-05,"this is one of the most perfect games i have ever played, story is an 1110, gameplay is always fun to muck around with. the only downside for pc rdr2 is the controls on keyboard with a horse"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-07-05,"easily my favorite game of all time, great story huge very detailed open world packed with so much to explore and do. the game runs great providing you're not trying to run it on some budget gaming pc, great soundtrack and audio. the longest and best western movie i have ever played."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-07-05,"great game worth the money. it's a pity that rockstars at the start so blundered with launch problems, it really knocked this game down. but in general, if you understand the essence of the problem, you could immediately go in and enjoy the game. the last time the game was so addictive was in 2015, when the witcher 3 came out. great game, great graphics, great mechanics, beautiful landscapes. i put 9, because sometimes you feel the emptiness of the world, but this is a western, this is quite normal for him and connoisseurs like it. worth your money and time."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-07-03,"this game is dreadful really. i've given it a point for being pretty but the game play is some of the most tedious i've experienced and even having forced myself to restart it after a year and play through a solid 20 hours, i can find absolutely zero fun in this game."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-06-15,"i'm surprised to see so many people report bugs that are gamebreaking. for me, it's one of the few games that amd rx5700xt can handle without a blackscreen. the story is 1010, the gunplay is a little tedious, the tutorials are basically nonexistent, even if there are any, you'll probably miss them because they tend to appear during intense gunfight scenes, and they only stay on the screen for a few seconds. you can also play this game as a hunting simulator as well."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-06-08,"rdr2 is all that's great and all that's terrible in modern gaming bundled into a single product. first of all, it's not really a game  it's an interactive movie where you are prompted to press buttons at a specific time, that's all. in the course of the campaign none of your choices matter  that is assuming you occasionally do get to make a choice at all. this has become a real plague these days, probably due to influence of consoles, where controls are limited and achieving real mastery save for a few genres is near impossible. ironically, the only time you feel like you're playing a game is... when you're not playing it, just roaming around the beautiful open world. that is the best part of rdr2  just riding around, exploring, hunting, looking for treasure before returning to the mindless campaign of pressing buttons and, sometimes, shooting bad guys in carefully choreographed scenes that you also have zero influence over. the visuals, the atmosphere, landscapes are all phenomenal  really among the best in the open world genre. but the game as a game fails in every respect. you never really feel like you are playing but rather just ticking boxes in somebody else's scenario. good or evil, consequences of your actions are ultimately the same, as is the conclusion, after which you're really left with nothing to do. i spent 100 hours on it, rather enjoyably, but also consistently frustrated that the freedom i was promised is really just a mirage and that i have absolutely no impact on anything. you also get the sense that the project overwhelmed the rockstar team. a good part of the map 3040 is pretty much locked out of the main campaign and becomes only accessible in the epilogue when you discover... there's not much to do there. it's like they tried to make something out of it but clearly got pressured by deadlines and left it for dead. with time you also realize that crafting stuff makes little sense either and new guns that you unlock later in game don't really add anything new. there's really no reward for advancing in either of these verticals  again, as if someone started working on it and left it half baked. you'll do well with the first selection of the most powerful pistols and rifles, and only use the rest if it's required to hunt a specific animal. that's it. as an open world experience, rdr2 is as good as it gets, 1010, absolutely fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable. but as a game... well, as i said, it really isn't one. you're just a spectator occasionally asked to press a button as a way to tease you that you have any involvement at all. it could have been something much greater. in a way, i'd like them to continue working on it and spend the next few years making it into something it could have been."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-06-01,"based on the gameplay, graphics, sound, content, and originality of the game, i will give it a rating of 10."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-06-01,"wtf. you need to be online to run campain  major problem on steam deck. and using two launchers, steam and rockstar games is disgusting. not only takes data to rockstar, but also takes a lot of time to run the game. there is no problem when you ran version from the internet."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-05-23,media perfect console game with gta5. on pc arrived late. bcouse of no rdr1 relase on pc to make comprassion hard for pc players. rdr1 more fastpaced like assasins creed 1 on that time easy to in and out. now this game espicaly first very slow . game staring thinking like self tarantino heighfull eight very inspred smilar areas. you eventualy arrive on smalltown many hours. you try to buy weapons you cant weapons requre levels money not enough. which kills openworld pace. forcing to stroy of game which like kojima games very long. the game map more greeny areas. players wanted to see spagatti like town more deserty even they shot on spanish will disspoint. game have that areas too old rdr 1 town area basicly. if you want to go there with horse bounty hunters kill you no option to fight and survive doesnt matter how good you are. if you try to go with sea with small boat the boat sunck. you can think bcouse this very reallstc but no if you steal big ship try to crossing that desert area river automtclhy big ship also sunck. its not full open world like media claims not like ac games. the pc port of game even arrvie late not good. treating 2gb vram cards not even change any settings. forcing you to change ini files on settings. peformance on towns get halfer. very problamtic port on budget pcs. no physcal rslease on pc. saying the best pc game of allt ime rdr2 its realy not. graphicly game quaite level of today games copared old games sure was next gen but graphics on medium not look good .textures become look like dirt. heavy antialasing use on consoles also make game very blury.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-05-20,"masterpiece... do not play with the save files of the game, it unlocks all achievements"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-05-16,"detailed and ultra immersive story. need a quite decent, i mean fast rig to handle it, though. rockstar proved again why they are the best undoubtly. add to your list asap if you haven't!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-05-10,"one of the best games i have played in the past 5 years. extremely engaging and well thought out story, lively open world, and a ton of content. main gripe is that the mission structure does get a bit stale near the end. 910"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-05-09,"is it so difficult to make a perfect game? i dedicated 120 hours to the story on xbox one s and 200 hours to the online mode on pc, and the summary is simple masterpiece. only geralt comes close to whispering in its ear, no one else. there is no product close to this level of quality. rdr2 has it all, a very wellcrafted story, wellcrafted characters, crazy graphics, absurdly immersive realism and game feeling, and an open world that actually feels full of details, unpredictable and surprising, something impossible to find in the packaged open worlds we see today. ubisoft knows exactly what i'm talking about. rdr2 is a huge game in size and spectacular in detail, only suitable for dedicated players not necessarily hardcore who are willing to dedicate the necessary time for the game to seep into them. if you are a casual gamer, i recommend titles more like naughty dog, with an equally wellcrafted game feeling, story, and characters, but with a much simpler and linear approach. an adult game for adult people."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-05-01,"jogo imperdvel, nica coisa que faria o jogo ser perfeito seria ter deixado os inimigos mais inteligentes e em menor numero, tem hora que quebra a imerso o tanto q vc mata nas misses."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-05-01,"at first i gave it zero points, but now i'm revising my opinion. after they managed to fix the pc port i put 120 hours into it and had a lot of fun"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-04-30,"really great game, with bugs so long after release, long very good story, runs great on 2023 hardware, supports dlss and hdr, but got stuck several times in missions and horse ran against obstacles countless times when using the cinematic camera"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-04-29,"this is an extremely well made game. there's a lot to enjoy about it. i just wish wild west settings were my thing or i'd probably be giving it a 10. if you're into that sort of thing, it's probably a 10. for me though, i found the game kind of depressing. impressively depressing but depressing and grim nonetheless. don't get me wrong, i was pretty impressed with the game and i liked it. it was just hard to play sometimes because it's a bit of a death march. not the most uplifting story i've ever been dropped into, that's for sure."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-04-29,i love this game because graphics so realistic and game story very good ai is very good
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-04-25,"most overrated game i've played so far. yeah, the story and the open world are great but the game is still incredibly frustrating to play. many things just don't make sense and don't get explained, npcs and enemies are a huge pain in the ass since the world is absolutely overcrowded with them and they seem to see everything and magically communicate with each other in a matter of seconds, no matter how far apart they are and traveling the long distances by horse which decides to go fast or slow depending on its fing mood or something no matter the stamina is just making me want to close the game to play something better. also, it's not too uncommon to encounter bugs even though the level of detail in the open world is amazing."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-04-19,"rdr2 maybe the most overrated game of all time. i loved rdr1 and bought xbox one for it. but rdr2 is not a game, it's a cowboy simulation. and a very good simulation but not a game. there's no fun in it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-04-18,"i've never commented on a game in my life, but for this game it's just perfect"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-04-11,"red dead redemption 2 is a fantastic game that i would highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of openworld games or westerns. its engrossing story, memorable characters, and immersive world make it an experience that is not to be missed. the game's attention to detail and stunning presentation more than make up for it. in my opinion, it's easily one of the best games of the last decade. 96"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-04-11,"i only started playing the single player four years after release and was impressed by how good it was. compared to other open worlds this one feels lived in, from npc chatter, realistic small towns and cities, the physics and weather engine to flora and fauna, it is an example of how an open world should be constructed in video games. the story keeps you interested, characters have depth and are likeable or not and the game keeps you entertained for at least over 40 hours. if you want to complete everything you can easily spend over 100 hours. with open world games feeling empty and more like a checklist full of icons that you work off one by one this is a prime example of how it should be done and deserves its place in the top 10 of the best games made to date."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2022-09-26,"to be honest, i can not wholeheartedly recommend this expensive aaa game for a few reasons 1. still terrible optimization 772021 unstable and low fps for rtx 2070  i79700k by the way, the graphic still looks like . 2. crappy and clumsy moment i.g walking speed and picking the thing up 3. confusing control. not just countless complicated control layouts but also i am surprised a game can be both over handholding and confusing at the same time. 4. inconsistent control for instance, pointing a gun at someone's face and talking to them is the same button, especially worse when it repeatedly flicking different actions for the same button within a second. it's an overhyped game overall, i would suggest you first pirate the gameborrow this game from a friend just to see the gameplay or how it runs on your computer, then buy it at the discount price. i will come back and edit my review if i change my mind."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2022-09-23,"the game is a veritable masterpiece, it knows how to pull your heart's strings and shatter your ideas and hopes now, a tldr this game is not for everyone, the game rewards exploring and it will be short for an rpg if you just do the main missions in a rush, as you can miss like 50 of the side missions or more if you do not explore, so that might not be for everyone it is highly demanding i have an rtx3080oc, ryzen 9 5900x, 32gb of ram, and an asus rog strix x570e and playing 4k in ultra gives me a slight lag in the biggest city or where there is a lot of things going on at the same time, it is minimal, but it is still noticeablenot game breaking though the characters are well written and superbly acted with very few exceptions that were added to appease certain crowds the gamplay is really in depth and entertaining, aiming without the abilities is hard but not impossible, the story goes from 0 to 100 and back to 0 in a matter of a couple of missions, and that is what makes the game exciting there is a wide array of guns, butand this is one of the bads of the game they are mission locked for the most part, which i highly dislike the small side missions that are introduced as a way to earn money are a let down, you do them for the fun, but they are not going to make you money the game is so in depth and alive, characters go around doing their stuff, you can follow an npc around and he'll go to the saloon, then to a store, stop to talk to someone, go home, etc. there is so much to do all the time, there is fast travel in the game in several obvious and non obvious ways but the greatest experience is when traveling on your own via horse threr are very very many side missions that need specific criteria met, like time of day and such, as well as many of the random encounters, which makes the game more dynamic, and exploration really rewards the biggest downside is the typical rockstar annoying missions get 100 x those are extremely annoying and it is when it shows the lack of care in some thingsminimal,but annoying like the silly mechanic that when there is a mission that says hunt x said x practically goes extinct, you can literally spend weeks playing the game 510 hrs a day, and not see whatever x you are trying to find, which becomes annoying and makes you cheat by checking what you need for those missions beforehand so that you don't spend a month in them silly things there are some minor glitches here and there and some things that are badly made, mostly the law system, if someone robs you and you defend yourself, you get the bouinty and the robber walks away, same with the people that attack you for no reason in some parts, or someone badmouths you and you brawl, but they start the brawl, you still get a wanted level, that is absurd another thing badly thought is that there is a whole area that you cannot access throughout the whole game and after it ends, there are like 5 missions there and that is it, it would have been awesome to have an actual dlc take place there this goes without saying but i will say it anyway because there are parents that do not think straight some times, this is a game for a mature audience, and it has some things that can be traumatizing for kids, most adults cry, sometimes a whole sea, at some points in the game, so imagine what will this do to a kid. do not get them kids this game"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2022-06-03,red dead redemption 2 is 1 of my favourite games. i just wish the developers rockstar games gave it more love. that company has gone down hill since gta v. because they are now making millions by doing little to nothing they don't care for games that don't bring as much success as gta v. the story in red dead 2 is amazin. the physics are also great. guns are perfect and it has the best horse riding i have ever seen in the game. on pc aswell the graphics are more then something to brag about. for an open world game aswell the attention to detail is so good. i really hope with get a 3rd game but likely will never happen unless rockstar chang wtheir ways.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2022-06-03,"easily the best story and game ever made. rdr, in my opinion, is very underrated by many saying that it's slowpaced, although i think it's true this isn't supposed to be a fastpaced gta game, this is a high production interactive film that's ironically better than most if not, all movies that have come out in cinemas in the last couple of years. calling it a cowboy simulator is also offensive because this game was much much more than that, the mechanics, the jawdropping graphical detail, the interesting things and random people you encounter, the hunting and just touring the era that the game is based on make it worth double the full price because i would happily pay more for this type of highquality experience. r somehow rose the bar to an even higher level than when gta 5 came out and as a result, i really cannot enjoy any game because i keep comparing everything back to rdr2. as a result, this game easily deserves the perfect score and hopefully, r made plenty of profit to continue creating excellent games like rdr2. i hope r has a plan like dutch for the future of this series."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2022-04-24,"after the game, i have skeptical emotions. she has a very good plot, a good open world and very good actors. but there are downsides. it has very poor optimization. it will not go steadily at 60 fps on any video card. there are also bugs. for example, when i rode a horse and pressed pause, and then turned on the game again, my horse began to go crazy and did not listen to me at all. and the main disadvantage is that game is very slowly and can be boring for many. but mostly this game is really unique in its own way!"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2022-01-10,"for game play  graphics 2 points story, character development, realism etc and rest 0 points i was trying to play this game calm since it is a rpg. i wanted to murder no one unless it is totally necessary but most of the game gang and you, have to kill people because npcs are trying protect themselves from you or in some cases you kill for no reason at all for the sake of the mission like you go get drunk with your friend and for no reason you start fighting this scenario happens more then it should. in one of missions we have to save one of our friend from jail we ripoff jail bar and whole town start shooting at uswhole town has 1315 building we kill 80100 people and when we turn back we can observe that incident had no impact to town at all. this game lacks realism a rpg must have and relies heavily on mindless killing for sake of game play like call of juarez. don't get me wrong call of juarez is a good game but imagine all the possibilities with a massive open world wild west map and developers decide to make main character a bandit. its such a waste of potential. spoiler in one of the mission we decide to sneak into fort with the help of an old lady who is a traitor. she snuck us inside and decided to ask more money than we have and dutch kills her for a obvious reason that if you don't pay she will rat on us but arthur who killed countless innocent people to that point be like damn dutch are you gonna kill me to spoiler i realize micah will betray us right after he join back to gang. he was the only person who acts like he doesn't care about others and next 2 missions with micah proved that i was right but dutch be like traitor can be anyone but micah and i don't even want to point micah joined gang just 6 months ago. no spoilers at the last parts of the game i realize that i don't give a f about game any more. i tried to not to kill a single innocent person but game and scenario make you commit many crimes even if you don't want to. basically you don't have any choice that changes to flow of the story. i found myself looting and killing and stealing more than i should since missions are forcing you to be careless anyways and then at the end game reward you if you tried to be good guy."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-08-31,"red dead redemption 2 is the second installment in the red dead series serving as a prequel for the famed red dead redemption. genre is action adventure. the expectations for this game were great the fans of the series knew what they could expect and everyone else was brought on by the 250 m spend on marketing alone. that is an incredible sum of money, absurd even. the game was finally released in 2018 with high praises but without a pc version. the version for windows finally came more than year later, but the pc release was very quiet and for a good reason. the pc version of this game is an afterthought at best. virtually nothing got adjusted for the specific condition of a pc gaming and that brings this game down significantly even before you start playing. but once you do start playing and once you get through the unnecessarily long and frankly quite boring introtutorial, things start to get better, much better. lets discuss some of these positives now. first of all the atmosphere. the sheer feeling of belonging in the gang, the feeling of togetherness around a late night campfire, the atmosphere of the wild west meeting the belle poque. that is pure gold, absolute mastery, i do not how to describe it with words, you have to play the game to understand. this atmosphere obviously ties closely with the main storyline. at that is fantastic as well. it is massive in size, maybe a little shorter than witcher 3. but it is also well written and surprisingly for me unpredictable. also the overall mood of the story is getting progressively darker and gloomier as you play, without a happy end. that is also not common for a american mainstream story writing. next thing i must mention is the graphics it is stunningly beautiful with some breathtaking sceneries and great and realistic coloring. one thing stands out though the animations. they are very well done and more importantly there is just so many of them. really you get an animation for every little gesture, every little obscure motion that only happens once in a side quest has got its own animation. it is something i noticed repeatedly and it is where you will realize the incredible cost of this game well worth it in this instance. game font also deserves praise. the music is great, particularly the campfire songs. one thing i cannot mention enough is the sheer size of the game and the versatility of activities you can do around it. or just the hours and hours of optional banter in the camp and in towns. it is just amazing. but not everything in this game is. actually there is a surprisingly long list of things i did not like. i already mentioned the problems of the pc version, but it relates to other problems. one such problem stands and looms over all others though. it is the save system of this game. it is hands down the worst save system i have ever seen in a video game. no saves would be better than this. i cannot possibly understand what compelled the developers to make the game save automatically after you just died and then not save at all for two hours of gameplay. it is truly horrible. the wanted system is nowhere near as bad as the save system, but it could use an overhaul in my opinion. generally it is more bothersome than dangerous and sometimes it does not work as it should. the menus are unnecessarily complicated and confusing same as the in game inventory. i am sure these problems are related to the console version and should have definitely been redone for the pc version. weapons are funny and plentiful, but the constantly get unequipped from you during cutscenes and there is no ability to drop weapons which is kind of stupid. while the graphics is generally really nice, there are some aspects of it i did find lacking in quality, namely rain and leaves. there are no microtransactions in the single player per se, although the special editions are pretty greedy. and finally we get to the sjw. sadly i have to say, it is pretty prevalent throughout the game, the developers took every chance to educate us on the values of progressive society and frankly i do not like being force fed often politically motivated sjw crap. if at least it could be worked into the story so it would feel somewhat natural, but alas almost all these sjw moments are handled with the typically american cuckold mentality. just to name some of these moments the civil war, the slaver, the racist, the klan, the indians, women voting, mr. black and mr. white really? or mrs. sadie adler. i cannot remember hating any character in a video game more than sadie. when she got stabbed in the epilogue, i got my hopes up, but of course, she survived. i do not want to end on a bad note. red dead redemption absolutely deserves praise, certain aspects of it are amazing, genre defining even, but there are indisputable problems and negatives to this game, that rarely get mentioned. i wish i could go higher, but i cannot. final verdict 72"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-08-30,it was boring. the controls weren't good enough to make it a 9. the weapons are more fun to use when automatic and don't have absurd shooting mechanics. movement is poor.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-08-13,"the game suffers from the typical issue of today's gaming too easy to the extent that it offers no challenge whatsoever. the story is relatively good, the graphics are beautiful, but the gameplay itself is tedious. the economy is way out of wack, offering way too many items. that makes the stores redundant, or any of the side quests, hunting, fishing, etc. back in the day, you would do the side quests and minigames as it would help you get items that made the challenge of the game more manageable. now there is no challenge. i don't understand why it's hard for the designers to put in difficulty levels, and ones that are actually challenging. i don't want to play a game so that i yawn all the way through it, as i have done with this one."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-06-15,"rockstar's games feel like another genre of pc games and this has both positive and negative sides. they are very good at smoothing the flow of quests and the story without a gamey feel. although this takes skill i think, it also makes the games feel like walking simulators or interactive movies. also the game controls inventory, journal, map, ingame fighting were very consolelike thus was annoying a little to play on pc. but in the end im glad i spent 150 hours in a beautifully detailed and informative world with characters i felt attached to just like after i finish a good tv series or a good book."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-05-28,"this game is in simple words a masterpiece and work of art. it is even more than a game, it is an experience. the low score on here is laughable... just because of a poor pc launch ppl reviewbombed the game and never changed their ratings later after it was patched, while some unfinished cyberpunk2077  launch was and still is getting 1010s. smh. the story is emotional and groundbreaking, the way the constructed the story over the backdrop of different cultures and nationalities is astounding. arthur morgan is the best game character and his journey of redemption is the best story arc i ever experienced. the depth and attention to detail in insane... the world is living and breathing... random robberies, engaging side quests.. graphics are next gen lvl with the most impressive lighting i have ever seen. the open world is ridiculously immersive, the depiction of the plains, towns and deserts are miraculous. wildlife are numerous and varied, in their own biomes. people actually remember your actions in an area and form an opinion of you. i am still discovering details i never thought existed in this game. combat is deep and among the best of any games out there, you can grapple, tackle, shove, hogtie, stealth kill and various other mechanics. most people have problems with the pacing and the controls. its sad to hear ppl giving subpar reviews cuz of the game being slow paced and 'boring', i just feel ppl nowadays got adhd, the inability to pay attention to detail because of all the instant gratification prevalent in today's media, the need for bright flashy lights and instant response just to stay entertained. the pace and story are perfect for the type of game,... you just have to get into it with a right frame of mind. i am not even into westerns.... but i got this game and i did things i never did in a game b4, i greet npcs, sleep, eat, hunt, play poker, explore. the game shines when you just play it how it was meant to be played. no game up till now and probably into the near future will beat the title of best, most immersive open world rpg until probably gta6, which i don't think will even be a match. it is a marvel both on scale and scope. this game will stand the test of time. it is the pinnacle of game development and storytelling as of date. the best game i ever played hands down. i'm out."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-05-10,"a great story created by an equally great studio, rockstar. but the game should be evaluated not by the developer's label, but by the aspects of the game itself. the plot of the game is excellent, and most importantly adult. late 19th century, wild west, a team of our heroes on the run after a botched robbery. 1. the graphics are simply incredible. as rockstar tried to work on the lighting in the game, i give it my due, this game is one big movie. but there are also disadvantages  rather poor optimization. as you know, rockstar games are famous for good optimization example gta5, but this game is not for any computer. 2. the physics of the horse is worked out at the highest level. the same can be said about the physics of weapons, it is great. 3. the performance of the actors voicing the characters deserves praise. it's just a pity that in games from rockstar there is no localization in terms of voice acting, but the company's own policy is already to blame. the game definitely left a mark on the history of game development, i would put it 10, but problems when starting the game on the pccrashes, fps drops do not allow me to do this. a little bit not finalized"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-05-10,"i didn't encounter any bug like some other users have reported. it is an enjoyable open world game, one the best that i have ever played. my only complaint is it doesn't allow game saving in the middle of a mission."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-05-04,"a game that can be a lot of fun to play. the 93 metascore rating might be a bit of an exaggeration tho. the graphics are good and so is the story. unfortunately tho, the game can also be a bit repetitive and boring, sometimes leaving you to wonder if the game you're currently playing isn't called 'horseback riding and small talk simulator.' but it could still be worth checking out if you like these type of open world games."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-04-19,"okay how do i start this. rdr 2 is a great game, is it a masterpiece? is it the game of the generation? is it a game that truly evolved video games as whole? nooooo story rdr 2 reminds me a bit of tlou because both games are almost entirely carried by story. the characters you see in this game is one of the best written characters ever in a video game. never have i ever cried in a video game until this one. i have not seen anyone thinking this story was bad because it really isn't bad at all. visuals now this is definitely the part of the game that also carries it. this is the most beautiful game i have ever seen with attention to detail 50x more than any other game ever even tried to do. your horse's testicles grow bigger in hot temperature and vice versa, your horse's foot steps leaves different prints in different location, and a lot more insane details in this game that no other open world game has ever done. gameplay now this is the part of the game that really ruins a lot of the parts for me. there are barely any fast travel points so 80 of your playtime is riding a horse. mission designs are extremely restrictive that you can't do anything you want in an open world game. there are so many issues with this, like the honor system barely work, the cover system is broken, the shooting is meh, controlling arthur morgan is very laggy or unresponsive a lot of the times. as an open world game, this isn't that strong tbh. conclusion i know i've been talking negatively about the game but the story is really something you need to behold. i recommend you buy this game but not full price. that's about it, bye"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-04-15,"this game is extremely good. i was shocked how good it looked on my ps4, i was even more shocked how good it looked on my pc. this game is masterpiece in every way possible. i can't wait for gta vi, because they proved with rdr2 what they can do."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-04-14,"this game has everything to be my top 5 favourite games of all time huge open world that feels genuinely alive, very reactive and crazy immersive, beautiful graphics, awesome animations and voice acting, very good story, diversity, reasonable ai outside of combat, mind you, awesome music and a whole lot more. despite all that, it's not even 1010 for me and here is why. this game is so annoying by design! riding from point a to point b takes 5  10 minutes, brewing a stupid coffee takes 2 minutes, heck, even a misclick will cost you 10 seconds in real time. making 140 bullets for my repeater takes like 3 minutes, making each individual one instead of a bunch with one click. looting bodies after shootout is a nightmare due to both camera inaccuracy and a silly design choice to search the bodies one by one, and adding animations every time you do it doesn't make it shorter. this game is always ready to replace your better gun with the weaker one midmission, to change your weapon lineup every time you dismount, to start a shootout in the middle of a town because you misclicked etc. look, i love immersion, but rockstar has gone way too far with this one, sacrificing fun and pleasure you could've had by design. you're so much into realism? cool, but make a toggable option in the menu for auto  looting, auto  cooking, auto  brewing and auto  bullet making and let us decide what we prefer time well  spent or supposedly full immersion. and save system in this game is unacceptable, and again, its by design. you're not explaining me how to do things in the tutorial, so i experiment. it would be nice to save the game before i do that when i'm learning. and to return to the exact spot on the exact time when i'm loading! you string 3 missions together for a 1,5  hour block? great, but let me save the game in the meantime. some folks might not have straight 1,5 hours to play those missions in one sitting, you know? i encounter a glitch, what do i do? in other games, i save and reload my game, but not here, cause i save in point a just to reload in point b for no reason whatsoever. who else, besides rockstar, thinks that teleporting my cowboy in both space and time is immersive? anyone? tldr rockstar created almost a flawless diamond, and then, because of unreasonable design choices, dropped it into mud. why?! by the way rating this game a 6, guys? seriously? it's completely unreasonable, even for the players that didn't like it for one reason or another. i'm sorry, but if you're not seeing this game's value, even of you personally don't like it, then you are a blind man."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-03-11,"incredibly disappointing let's start with the core of any game, the gunplay. the guns and their mechanics are almost from 2001. it's copy pasted from gtav which was copied from max payne 3. and it didn't even keep it at that. it just got worse. i felt no fun at all shooting. all guns are the same almost. secondly the mission design. there is none. half the game is riding your horse. then a cutscene. after the cutscene you'll find a cover, get behind it. use your slow motion thing to get 4 heat shots. repeat until the next cutscene. there's no design at all. some missions you have to stand in an exact place and do an exact thing. you can't do anything other than the game tells you to do. it's like you're just watching the game and occasionally press e or some other button. then there's the world. it looks amazing on the outside. but once you start digging in it you discover it's all empty. all the towns are the same to the point i don't even know their names. except for one city that looks different but by the time i got there i didn't bother explore it cause i was so disappointed by the game so far. it's all just empty areas and animals to hunt which you don't need to hunt cause it's useless and boring. i found an npc with a cool small quest then after an hour i found the same npc with the same quest then discovered it's all copy pasted around the world. the game has cool systems but it ruins it somehow. i liked the honor system until i discovered it's of no consequence and the main mission will just change it for me. and now for the story, anyone who praised the story just didn't complete it. the story is great until chapter 5 then it take a dip in quality that i can compare to got s8. and it never recovers. after that i stopped caring about the story, the characters, everything. and wasn't looking forward to any of the missions because i know i will be just pressing the buttons the developers want me to press till it's over. i had to complete the game because i complete any game i play. but honestly it was more annoying than fun. the graphics of the game are cool but actually playing it isn't fun at all. after 2 cutscenes i just stopped caring."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-02-13,"this game is a masterpiece. it offers a realistic gameplay with great graphics. the atmosphere is truly enormous. their music and cinematic scenes are really high quality. the game makes you feel alive. the conversations of people encountered on the street are like a real life with so many tasks that can be taken from them. the script is really well written. it progresses slowly in the game and gives that feeling until the last moment. the connection is established with the main character of the game. the end of the game and some important scenes change according to your style of play. it is different from the reactions of people to you, to the little dialogues between you and the npcs. i finished the game with a good ending and it was pretty good. there are a few places in the game that i don't like. first, the game has an incredible optimization problem. i played with rtx 2070 and i7 processor and dropped below 30 fps very often with medium graphics. it would be torture if the game wasn't that good. 2. there are quite long horse riding areas until fast travel options arrive. i am definitely not talking about what happened as we progress through the story. there is a lot of trouble going from one task to the next. after a while, but it's getting better. since the game is made for the console, the controls on the pc are really difficult. i had to play with the joystick. my third trouble is the animations are pretty boring. not all of them, but some of them, like looting for people, take quite a long time so it's better to get out instead of looting over 5 person. realism is very good, but not that much. after a fast mission, going and searching people for half an hour kills the whole atmosphere. for those who don't care, the game is really great that i tolerated it and finished it. i did all the side missions etc. as a result, there are some aspects that take time and make the game boring.such as optimizations, animation times. but these are not important for a good scenario and it is not important to the game flow. therefore, if these troubles are not too serious for you, i definitely recommend this game. but let me warn you again, the game is a slow paced game. if features such as scenario are your priority, the right game. if you always think that i will go into fights and let the action hit the ceiling, you should definitely stay away and the game will come to you extremely slowly."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-02-09,"the best game of this generation without a doubt. it has no logic that was not goty in 2018. those awards stopped making sense that year. the game with the best physics, history, characters, graphics and details of this generation the story of arthur and how it is told should be studied in schools, in an authentic masterpiece of history and narrative. a story of redemption of the level of the first part. each chapter of the game introduces you to their world, to the gang, to the end of the west and has an endofage background that they are not aware of. the game has been accused of being boring, slow, and old missions. the game is not boring. from the beginning it starts strong and you meet the villains, already in the first chapter. he takes his time to develop the story that is formed through disjointed missions that form an incredible whole. not like other games that only go straight to the main thing. it is not slow, it is how such a man would move, with realistic physics. if you are used to games like dmc5, bayonetta, etc, it is strange, but it is as it should be in rdr. the missions are now more narrative, mimicking linear games but you actually have more options than in other open world games. in some missions you can make small decisions such as doing it day or night, the dialogues change depending on whether you do a mission before or another or what you do in it, you can decide if you or a partner attack, etc. so you actually have more decisionmaking power than other current games. the world is the most alive seen in a video game with its random events, i.a, physics, narrative, secondary missions, weather effects, it is the most next gen of this generation. and all these details are created, but the game does not point a finger at you like other games that want you to see what they have done for you to see. you can end the game and lose it because you are not at the right time, that makes it real, dynamic, alive, you are not the center of the game, you live in it like any other character. again this saga makes me cry for a character, for a story and also gives us the opportunity to know how everything was just before the first game instead of telling it in a video as other games would. here you play it, you enjoy it. the online may seem scarce compared to gta v but it has had dlc's even in the world situation in which we are. other games with a multiplayer component like gt5 or uncharted had less content and less time of it and there are no complaints. this is not a oneyear game, the dlc's will arrive and there is already more content than many online will have in their life"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-02-08,"visually, this game is outstanding. the environments are incredibly detailed and undeniably beautiful. voice acting is excellent throughout and sound effects are solid but, other than a couple of licensed songs, the soundtrack is forgettable. movement is clumsy and imprecise whether on foot or riding a horse, and for a game that features so much travel time this was a huge detriment to the overall quality of my experience. terrible brawl mechanics, an inventory system that is a pain to use, overuse of button mashing, and tedious looting are just a few of the many nitpicks that combine to spoil what this game could be. bugs such as floating objects, glitched camera angles, ignored button inputs, missing dialogue audio, and conversations that would not progress appeared intermittently. the open world features enormous depth and freedom, contrasting with very linear story missions that don't provide much choice in how to execute objectives. dialogue has been written to a high standard but overall the story is just ok, certainly not worth the 40 hours of horse riding and followescort missions required to progress through it. red dead redemption 2 is a very deliberate experience with many moments and areas worth taking in at a slower pace, but forcing the player to remain at that pace all the time is annoying."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-01-09,"story and characters  710. it's good but not great, you can find better stories. also, this is probably the longest story i have played in any game ever. it just goes on and on and never seems to end. new missions pop up on the map constantly. it's too long even, and the pacing is very slow. i feel that rockstar has overdone it. storytelling  910. the game does a very good job to immerse you in the story and world. graphics, world and gameplay mechanics  910. it's a beautiful game. some areas look and feel basically like real life. the map is huge and has a wide variety of landscapes. incredibly detailed game in every aspect. world is very alive and npcs act like actual human beings instead of being there just for decoration. best open world game to this day. only the next rockstar release will be able to top it. music, voice and sound design  910. i'm not a big fan of the western music genre, but it fits the game very well. i even managed to find few songs to add to my playlist. voice acting is top notch. now, there are few flaws that annoyed me a lot and made the game boring and tedious too often. these flaws alone stopped me from giving the game 9 or 10  basically every mission begins with several minutes of ridingwalking to your destination. during this time characters only talk with each other and nothing else happens. and these sections often happen multiple times during a single mission, which means plenty of time is being wasted on boring the s out of you instead of doing something fun. and what's worst, those trips are unskippable.  you can't run inside camps, most buildings and when the story doesn't want you to. this is super annoying and slows down the already slow game even more.  there is fast travel but fast travel checkpoints are placed very sparsely on the huge map, so you usually still have to ride few minutes to your destination even after you teleport to the nearest checkpoint. this is slightly helped by the fact that there are random events happening often during your trips and they can sometimes made the trip less boring."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-12-20,"it feels like the first game with way too much hanging off it, doing very little. grinding camp stuff with no clear objective, little reward or reason, locks on equipment for no apparent reason, on and on. too much 'busy work', grinding, barf. the controls are clumsy, especially on pc, and there seem to be arbitrary gameplay things number of carcasses, pelts held, etc that to me reek of bleed over from a very controlled multiplayer income environment, designed to frustrate and fleece you. sure, you need to maintain your guns, care for your horse, change your clothes, you can call this realism and sure, it 'sort of' is. it's also functionally a soft lock on how much cash you can earn online. there are many things like this, harder locks would be animal spawn rates, job timers, etc... i shouldn't have to go on about the online. it's a horrible disaster and it has affected the singleplayer significantly. i am 100 percent sure the game was built with online in mind, after all, which is the bigger money maker for them? it's a shame, because there's the potential for a good game here, but it has a nisshin maru worth of factory ship build up around it to process money from whales. if you want to read about gold bars and thousands of bugs, you can find plenty of articles and posts about what's wrong with the online. that isn't my problem, just the overlap. there's a steely, red eyed terminator under the flesh of rdr2, built from the ground up to encourage you to spend actual money and even punish you for not. even if you never go online, it's still present. never forget that and you'll see the subtly of the machine everywhere. but i guess if you like grinding for crap, without much direction, in an open world game, then you might enjoy it. to me however it just feels hollow. end. pelts, once dry, realistically can last as long as the final product if stored properly. for example, in 'the revenant' and the 2015 movie, the fur trappershunters stored their pelts, burying them, marking the location. they might not have returned for months and months, this would not decrease the value of the hides. in rdr2, pelts decay over a day, which is insane. this is contrived grind, a bottle neck. there's no meaningful way to mitigate it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-12-19,"it's a good game although sometimes is way too realistic turning the game in a tedious real life  instance when you want to loot a container, you need to align your character to it, hold e to open it, aim at each single item and hold r to loot them one by one and then hold e again to close the container in order to avoid colliding with the container's  is seriously painful. the same can be said for controls, i find them tedious, clunky and not consistent...sometimes is e, other times is r, then f, then left click, sometimes is tap, others is hold...i spend more time looking at the corner of the screen to read what button i to to press, than at what is actually happening in the game. if you can go past these problems, the game is fine."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-12-16,"i never usually even properly engage with the stories of games, preferring to just skip through the cutscenes and play for the shooting and action scenes, which are becoming ever so rare in video games, without the stress of being headshot through 6 walls in a multiplayer game, before being asked to dump a weeks wages on a loot box. i haven't touched the online portion of this game however, so cannot speak to it. i was therefore surprised when i found myself drawn to the cutscenes and actually enjoying the story, perhaps more than some of the shooting even. i even found myself relating to some of the difficulties faced by the arthur. the open world is absolutely magnificent, and no journey through it feels the same, with random events occurring as you travel around. the vast amount of, and variety of, nature and people around the world, reacting to events as they happen, truly bring it to life in a way which i have never experienced in any other open world game, and perhaps any game altogether. despite the map being smaller than many, including titles such as gta 5, on horseback it feels so much bigger and more varied than the majority of games in a finite world. when i picked up the game at a discount, having heard of how well made it was and browsed a few youtube clips, i was hesitant, it was a departure from the usual setting of video games i enjoy, and one which i did not enjoy in the past. i would therefore never have imagined the range of emotions which the game would make me feel, nor that i would actually have tears brought to my eyes at one point in the story, not for the story itself, but for the memories it evoked. this game has one of, if not the best, open worlds, and has by far the best storyline of any game that i have ever played. i can honestly say that it is the best game i have ever played."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-12-15,"at the time of this writing, december 15, 2020, this is the best game of all time, in my, perhaps subjective, or not, opinion. i have not seen a more developed and richer game world."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-12-15,"the best game i ever played. not perfect though, but still the best. here's why. pros fantastic story, class leading sound design, dialogues and voices, characters and their development, excellent graphics, attention to detail, world beautiful and well used, animations, superbly made animals, huge number of side guests and other activities, choices, cutscenes smart npcs. they react to player's actions or may communicate with you, and a lot more. cons some missions or certain scenes were too epicunrealistic, long loadings, sluggish movementcontrols sometimes, optimization could be better, every time i pressed window button, it changed option from fullscreen to windowed. game performance differs between these two, small bugs and other stuff."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-12-12,"it seems this port to pc had issues when it was first released back in 2019. i'm happy to say that when i played this game earlier this year february 2020, a lot of the issues people were having are fixed. the game ran great on my gtx 980 i76700k system. i played on medium settings at 1080p with a solid 60fps and the game still looked amazing. only experienced one bug throughout my entire 60hour playthrough. red dead redemption 2 is a prequel to red dead redemption 1. you don't have to play the first one to understand this one. i'd say it's a better experience if you haven't played the first one. as is the case with many rockstar games gameplay is not the best. it's practically the same as red dead redemption 1. the shooting isn't that great, the controls are a little clunky, and the cover system is not good. story missions are often on rails and do not offer much freedom in how you tackle them. when you try to be creative you are often met with a mission failed screen. a great video that goes over these issues is by a youtuber named nakeyjakey. the video is titled rockstar's game design is outdated and i recommend watching it. the game offers various side activities such as hunting, fishing, and collected herbs. if you enjoy these side activities you could spend countless hours hunting legendary animals and creating unique clothing with their furs. the world feels very much alive. there are some random encounters you may experience more than once. the first time you experience them it's exciting and adds to the idea that the world is alive. however, when you save the same person from the same thing for a second time, the cracks show. those were the only moments that broke the immersion for me and made me realize that this world is more artificial than i initially thought. the graphics are amazing. with beautiful vistas around every corner, and a cinematic camera mode that will allow you to take it all in when going from point a to point b. the story is what you want to play this game for. the story is the reason this game gets such universal praise. the phenomenal voice acting by every character is a real joy. the voice actors did an amazing job and were given great direction. playing as an outlaw trying to survive in a new world of law and changing times. you'll get to see the relationship between arthur morgan the playable character and the van der linde gang. it's something you have to experience for yourself. i wish i could go back and experience it for the first time again. this is a story about relationships. by the end of the game, you'll sit there reflecting on what's happened, and reminiscing about times that have long past."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-12-08,"for me, almost a 10. it has great graphic, great music and sound, great acting voices played in english and a very good story. it really feels like the far west, and after 330 hours sincked in the game 100 in the online part i feel like suggesting this game for the single player. the story is very good, even for people that didn't playied the first game like me. the bad about this game it's that some actions are really really slow...especially when in the camp, everything take a lot to do, sit, walk, drink a coff ecc. i understand they wanted it to be realistic but it's too much, even when looting there is an animation for every item picked up in the chests, drawers ecc. good thing is the action and shooting parts are not slow, and very well made. and now the bad part, the online it's a buggy mess, full of cheaters, trolls and people that make theyr fun ruining the fun of others. sometimes there are good players too, but this game has a very bad online community. the worst thing of all it's rockstar don't care so much about this game, getting rarely updates the online story mode it's incomplete..., the released updates are nothing new or interesting. at least if you play it often you can have the good things without paying. so, almost a perfect game, with an online mode to don't look at. the boring slow actions are not something so bad but they are really annoying after playing it for a lot of hours."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-12-08,i finally played rdr2 and my mind was blown. the story of arthur was absolutely amazing and the relationship between each character was amazing. the environment and the graphics are extremely realistic and the effects are amazing. right now i'm off to grinding red dead online.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-12-02,"given the excellent writing, great voice acting and spectacular visuals, it's a shame this game takes you out of it again and again with what i would call typical rockstar shenanigans. for example i've just saved a local's life by rushing them to a doctor and witnessed a gruesome amputation  having said goodbye to the doctor, i leave his practice at night and step into the street. on the doorstep is my horse, because i did everything to save this man's life and didn't take the time to park my horse and everyone apparently decided to leave it where i left it. so, i get on. the horse bumps its ass into a lady that's ignoring it. she is offended. i try to get off, but now a 'witness' is running off to report on my 'disturbing the peace', i try to walk after them to talk some sense, but there's police everywhere and they are no longer responding to me, with the witness talking to an officer, my status suddenly becomes investigated, then 'wanted' and then every cop in the street decides i need to be executed where i stand, everyone starts shooting. the end. i wake up on a remote street corner, minus some of my money and my pelts. now, these kinds of ridiculous escalations are funny in a title like gta, all of which is tongue in cheek and you're clearly there to have some zany fun and get the army out after you. but in rdr, i've had a dozen of these situations where the immersion is broken by typical over the top rockstar game mechanics  often losing me some items or the sense that i achieved something and setting me back, leaving me feeling i was punished for merely playing the game. this, combined with glitchiness like teleporting distant horses, disappearing npcs and characters stuck in scenery, make it so i can't really award anything over a 6. given the incredible amount of work which must have gone into this title, it's a damn shame they dropped the ball on playtesting and qa."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-12-02,"rockstar again released a masterpiece, it can be played forever. advantages of red dead redemption 2 1. the developers have put a lot of effort into creating an interesting and exciting story. be sure to pass the story campaign will be very exciting, and the key and secondary characters in this story will surprise you with their elaboration and will definitely be remembered for a long time. 2. welldeveloped, with its own history and thoughtful personality, turned out to be the main character of the gamearthur morgan. however, the plot in rdr2 is not linear, and the player is free to choose the trajectory of its development. the game has several different endings, in addition, the final affects the so  called karma of the herowhat actions he did during the story campaign. this freedom of choice makes it interesting to repeat the game. 3. the world in which the action of red dead redemption develops is also noteworthy. it is truly huge and superbly designed. here you can hardly find repetitive or similar and boring tasks each npc can tell its own unique story and diversify the passage by giving an interesting mission. 4. the graphic features of the game are also amazing the local landscapes and detailed textures and picturesque locations take your breath away. 5. the game process includes a lot of all kinds of entertainment and available activities. so, in addition to participating in gang fights, daring robberies and shootouts, the player can lead a completely peaceful life fishing in the river, hunting animals in magnificent forests, racing horses and even finding gold deposits. you can, however, play the role of a dashing robber and rob ordinary residents, but remember all the actions of your character are reflected in the development of the plot. 6. the gameplay is realistic and thought out to the smallest detail, so you can easily spend several hours in the game, completing various missions or carefully exploring all available locations. even performing routine actions like cooking dinner or caring for a horse looks very boring and entertaining. 7. in the process of exploring the game world, you will certainly come across a lot of interesting details, thanks to which red dead redemption 2 provides a fascinating historical excursion into the world of the wild west and allows you to observe the life of america at the dawn of the 20th century. 8. the game has a multiplayer mode that helps to diversify the passage and gameplay. 9. perfectly implemented technical component  the number of bugs or sagging is minimal, it is almost impossible to stumble upon unloaded textures or some bug. 10. and for dessert great soundtrack, heartfelt soundtrack, perfect for everything that is happening. disadvantages of red dead redemption 2 1. however, for domestic gamers, the main and, perhaps, the only drawback of rdr2 will be its price for their new creation rockstar ask 4000 rubles. 2. do not forget that the game is only available on consoles, so if you are not happy owners of xbox or play station, you will have to forget about passing rdr."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-10-26,"just got this, now that i can actually own it, and it's not what i expected but still a great game. it's certainly story rich but like others have said very double minded main character and gang. these are criminals doing criminal acts but we are constantly presented with the idea that these people and the main character are actually good people, what? we've seen this since at least asphalt jungle, making the bad guys to be good by checkerboard kabbalisticmasonic satanic principles. another aspect is that it takes a village witchcraft communism in full bloom. such nice family of criminals, sure. it's not real or honest, criminals have some positive aspects but they are overwhelmingly evil in real life regardless of braying bribed or ignorant crowds in elite cases. let's just have either overwhelmingly bad or good, this ambiguous kabbalistic in between is devious. dislikes first. another aspect i did not like was the sim chores of taking care of your character and his horse, guns etc i can see the gta san andreas influence here, along with some gtav. it detracts from the gameplay and is not fun for me, thankfully there are trainers that can negate all this stuff for those not into the grind. the controls take a bit of getting used to and i didn't like the whole gun storage aspect, if i equip a handgun and some sort of long gun i want those to be available anytime, i don't want them to be put onto the horse so i have to remember to get them. in battle it's annoying to find that i don't have the weapon i want because the character put it on the horse and didn't automatically take it again when i got off! the camera is ok most of the time but really gets in the way in battle, and the character controls get way too laggy slow when trying to get out of dodge. this is also true of horse controls which are not too good, too sim for me. ac odyssey got them right and tw3 did ok as well, but this game isn't nearly as good there. i feel like the matching trot never truly works and was always fighting with it. give me a toggle one button medium trot and a further button for full speed, no tapping!! character walk and run are pretty slow but that's kinda the way it is, it's an adjustment going from fast cars and automatic weapons from gtav to this. the default graphics colors are washed out and there is no gamma adjustment only brightness, so it's either washed out or too dark. who wants to risk screwing up a 117gb install for reshades? happened for me with a seemingly simple gta4 reshade which forced me to reinstall, but no way risking it on a game that takes 3hrs to install. more built in reshadingcolor options should have been included. graphics settings options are way too much but i'd rather have that then only presets. please we want adaptive vsync!!! this makes another huge game, ac odyssey run smooth for me on mid range laptop 980m. not an option in this game, nor does ncp have it. apart from that it runs well and i can get it looking decent at medlow settings in 1080p, .75 scale, around 50 fps average on vulkan win7. although it's amazing how awesome thehunter cow looks so much better with much more details and higher settings 60fps vsync on the same system! getting to that i wasn't hugely interested in the huntingfishing aspects of this game either, if you really want an awesome hunting game get thehunter cow which is amazingly beautiful and has several maps that make up 200 sq miles of playable areas. much prettier game and more focused. i played using a gamepad and i think that's the way to go, kbm would be a chore. the star of all this to me is the open world old west gameplay which is a rarity on pc. i love the exploring aspects, the random events, just the ability to go anywhere and camp and a decent if vulgar main story missions mixed in. the world is pretty for sure and full of mystery. modding really makes this game shine, thankfully rs made this game like gtav which makes replaying missions and even perhaps new modder made mission packs a possibility. look at skyrim, fallouts, etc and the longevity they have by loving modders, excellent. that makes gaming a true joy really."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-10-26,i played the game for 3 hours and nothing happened. it is the most tedious game i have ever played and fans of the series are just movie watchers who got confused.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-10-24,"ok folks, let's keep it straight graphics game should run at least 3x of the actual framerate, so no, you are wrong about this aspect storyline a deep, profound meh..20 mins riding and chitchatting  things is not fun. anyway, it's a matter of tastes, thats why my score is a 1. dan houser thinks he is tarantino and it's boring as hell. controls well...i'm only going to say that a first week student of unity private academy 3.000   year would code it better...."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-10-23,"1st disclaimer i have to say that this game runs and looks great on my system. so that has nothing to do with my negative score. 2nd disclaimer i want to say a 5 isn't terrible, it's just mediocre. even that isn't the best way to describe this game since it is in a league of its own in some ways, while being pretty awful in a couple ways that spoil it for me. 3rd disclaimer i absolutely loved rdr1. that doesn't have much to do with me disliking this game either, it's just to say that i'm not biased against the wild west rpg shooter formula or anything like that. starting with the pros, then onto the cons its open world is probably the best in any game as of late 2020. horseback travel means you explore the map intimately and that forced r to absolutely cram the world with detail, personality, and variety. they have succeeded without reservation and gone beyond here. the environments aren't quite as characterful and emotively charged to me as, say, mexico in rdr1. but there's no question rdr2's world is bigger, better and realer. saint denis slums, the swamps of lemoyne and annesburg are all very special creations. which brings me onto the next thing rdr2 can boast of immersion. r pulled out all the stops here, and there are many strings to rdr2's bow to talk about the environments really let the developers work their magic to create a real sensation that these are living breathing places that developed without you and will continue without you. you don't feel like every bit of the game is built as a playground. i can't begin to fathom the sheer number of lines of dialogue in this game because i'm pretty sure i'm a way off from hearing them all. while the variety of audio samples is also incredibly impressive, it does make the lack of musical audio cues look pretty poor in contrast. you will hear the same guitar twangs again and again... after rdr1, i was expecting one or two vocal numbers for emotive effect. they were there, but didn't hit the spot. i'm not sure that was achievable given that rdr1's own take on it felt groundbreaking at the time. the wildlife and npcs incredible, not much to say here. at least on pc  i'm not sure how dense and varied these are on console. take a look at the credits for a huge list of facial scans. ai is pretty deep too. finally the characters. they're not the best i've seen, by a long shot. but they are well above industry standards and the side characters especially do their job well as being interesting and unique. the voice acting has its weak spots but is generally top quality. which brings me onto the negatives the main cast is very hard for me to identify with. i like arthur, but playing as him is a frustrating experience when his actions seem to contradict his motivations so often. the game tries to explain this away with loyalty and it doesn't really work when we have no reason to feel loyal. it also doesn't work in the way it does for the last of us, where we hate what we're seeing but we're gripped by the experience. it's just an awkward alongfortheride experience for me. likewise, the story. where is the incentivising event that pushes us forwards through the story? where is the villainous menace of rdr1 creating tension? instead we have a guy, living his life while random things happen with alarming frequency that cause him to leap into action. there are some good storylines here, but they're undeveloped subplots. highlights include mrs edith downes and the plight of the indians. the latter is criminally underexplored and probably should have been the main plot of the game rather than the crummy who'sthebaddy? plot we got. don't get me wrong, i've loved games with far worse plots than this. far worse casts, etc. the problem is that rdr2 commits the cardinal sin of video games it forgets to be fun. in fact, it does worse than forget it actively thwarts your attempts to have fun with oppressive regularity. almost every! mission consists of a long opening horse ride, because pacing be damned and every innovation in videogame storytelling has been lost on the developers here. even then, if you dare to slightly deviate off track, the camera and horse will often be yanked back towards the path the game insists you take. at that point it's just a movie where you're forced to hold the w key. even outside of missions, the game engine is so scared you'll abuse its freedoms that it won't let you turn freely. the shooting mechanics are more fun here than on console, but it's still a fastpaced game that demands singleshot precision in a contradictory way, forcing an overreliance on slomo for most players, hurting pacing yet again. the very last mission is suitably the final nail in the coffin here. if you shoot a sniper before the game wants you to, he's invincible. if you follow a character before the audio prompt, you'll get shot by said sniper. conclusion masterpiece lacking fun."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-10-20,"what can i say. the game is great in all respects, although its hardware requirements are very high"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-10-18,"this game is a genuine chore to play. sluggish, repetitive, and ultimately tedious, the game essentially consists of an endless concatenation of ad nauseam back and forth trips to various shootout locations, intertwined with shallow minigames and telegraphed action prompts. the cowboy simulator aspect is superficial and redundant since it is not required in order to survive or progress the story. on a more positive note the game is gorgeous  perhaps the best looking game of the generation  and the care and attention to detail must be praised. characters, scenario, and overall immersion are above and beyond anything i have played in a long time  but when it is all said and done, i have found that for all of its greatest aspects, it was never enough in redeeming the mediocrity, boredom, and tedium i had to endure in order to reach the end credits."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-10-15,"red dead redemption 2 is the sandbox of the future, almost a perfect wild west simulator, you will never forget this game, the story and its characters will live forever in our best video game memories."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-10-08,"the game is a masterpiece that deserves a perfect 10. i understand why some people are annoyed by the tedious animations and whatnot, but for a gamer like me it's just the perfection. the game's graphics are as beautiful as its mechanics. i just love to watch arthur skin the animals, eat soup, make coffee. i love that i have to change my outfits, pick up your hat, shave. and the story! characters! the game is like a western film, but the plot was perfected. the characters complement each other and the world around them. i really felt i was arthur, i felt his emotions, sadness, happiness, weariness. that is my new standard when it comes to fleshing out the game and detailing the story."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-10-05,"this game is simply amazing in all aspects, from a picture perfect open world, to its gun play and of course its incredible story which will keep you playing the game for hours. the open world is full of life and places you can explore and interact and the story really is perfect. but you definitely need a good pc to run the game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-10-04,"bought the game a year after release hoping the bugs would be fixed, instead i find myself with a buggy mess that cost me 50 euros, after spending hours finding a workaround for the game crashing after loading intro had to reach the first autosave point playing in safe mode. i don't get the people who praise the game's graphics, for me the game looks absolutely awful, the textures are horrible even at ultra, the vegetation is absolutely disgusting and the cloth on your character looks it's made of plastic, and guess what it can't even run at 60 fps on an rtx 2070 super. this game was absolutely not ready to be released, there are much better looking games that run much smoother than this, i don't care about plot or gameplay, it's all worthless if it can't be played. dishonest publisher, revolting experience, never buy a game from rockstar again."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-10-03,"one of the best games i played. the story,graphic,characters are so amazing world feels so  1010 no doubts."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-09-30,"oh man, i put so much into this game at first. i was mentally rping every step of the way, and taking my time in the world. the problem was, the game began to stop me from acting on my natural instinct, constantly making me do specific predefined paths flanking is not an option sometimes. there isn't a true obstacle that makes your plan fail, the game simply ends the encounter. this design may seem old fashioned, but i remember the missions in gta 13 having more freedom. there are other moments where despite being in a dangerous situation, escaping from the law, heist, or burning building, when the character will walk inexplicably. it absolutely takes the pace to a grinding halt. the graphics, the audio, they feel right, but the world feels like disneyland. tons of the open world quests are not well tuned. example  i found an npc in the world that creates a kind of miniquest. we had to sneak up and hunt some animal that had stolen something from them or something. his lines were saying there he is, ok, lets sneak up on him.. something to that effect... and though i'm crouched and sneaking this npc is just walking normally in front of me toward the prey. this was a random quest late game in the mountain area. the minigame button mashing is extremely false feeling. it doesn't feel like youre really doing that activity when youre holding r2 and spamming x or whatever it is. you will use your ingame money to purchase weapons, customize them, set up your loadout, etc, and go to a mission, and then the mission begins and you suddenly are completely regeared, and you arent with your horse. just the default pistol with no rifle or shotgun... i dont understand why this would ever be done. the best part of this, and i am being totally serious, is red dead online poker. i have played a lot of online video poker games, and this is one of the most immersive and fun pvp poker games i've played no joke. its awesome that you are your character, and your winnings are going toward your rp journey.. its kind of awesome honestly, ive made a bunch of money to buy  in rdo thru the poker haha... im truly exhausted by the story, and when you finish a mission you will often be at a point really far from your next mission spot... you can fast travel, it takes a minute to crouch and set up camp, and often it will say cannot fast travel with activities nearby but i don't see anything on my radar... it happens so much that i dont even bother taking the time to get off my horse, crouch, camp, etc it takes a while and says 'activities nearby' about 75 of the time. i spend so much time riding horses across spaces... overall the story arc is also badly paced. i dont want to spoil anything, but just as the game is coming to a climax not only in plot points but in characters, where they are kind of at each others' throats, then you spend a long final act in a side story... it should have been incorporated into the main story far earlier, and the side story been its own climax instead of something tacked onto the end. i dont look forward to the famously boring epilogue, and i feel dead inside trying to finish and then i'm in a situation stuck walking, or i fail a section because i try to be slightly creative with my approach... i have to give a rating based on what the studio should be able to accomplish. we shouldn't be easy on one of the most profit making companies in the business. lets be honest about the quality of the narrative, the lack ofnovelty of the systems, the cover combat that was new in 2006 gears of war. graphics cant carry a game, graphics naturally get better, we cant clap our hands everytime it gets shinier and give it 1010... cmon. when you see the user rating vs critic rating, you wonder do they even play games?... not a single mixed review? nobody thought it felt weird to steal 6,000 in government bonds and then walk casually out of the building, like youre just casually walking out of a saloon? or did anyone else run into that activities nearby issue where you cannot fast travel? what about failing a mission because you decided to go around the side of a building instead of the main street? the extremely linear missions are anachronistic alongside their open world... what a missed opportunity!"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-09-24,"red dead redemption 2 is a must play if you care about singleplayer gaming at all. i played it first at ps4 then now a few years later on pc. i usually enjoy playing on pc much more, but with this game it was pretty even actually. a beautiful open world, fantastic array of characters, lovely textures, sounds and about as realistic a game can get today. the story is also pretty good, but towards the end everything becomes so negative, unlike any other game i've played, it just leaves a bad taste which is sad. it's interesting because i've always wondered why not have negativebad endings in movies, but i realize now that it's just better if it's positive. i also need to comment on arthur, perhaps the worst choice in gaming i can think of. irritating, negative and sick old man with no sense of humor, i cannot understand how that choice came about as it would be good idea to actually like the main character as you play him for hours upon hours. he is simply depressing to be. nonetheless it's no lower than 810 for an amazing experience as a cowboy outlaw. btw, there was absolutely no bugs when i played it now, so it's pretty sad that over 1000 negative ratings here are simply because of the bugs in the start, which now have ceased to exist, making the average score pointless.."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-08-31,"i don't think i've ever been so disappointed in a developer. i love all of the gta games, and gta 5 was my favorite game for years. i just purchased a gaming pc with a high end gpu rtx 2060 and the newest intel cpu. i did so with the sole intent to play rdr2, because my other pc couldn't handle it. now i've spent a little over 20 hours in this game with probably around 17 hours altering graphics settings and reading reddit threads just trying to get this game to run. it's so buggy. it crashes reliably once an hour, and usually more frequently than that. i don't think i ever want to support rockstar again after this horribly optimized game. and it really  because i can tell just how beautiful of a piece of art this is. i've reached out to rockstar support with little help from them. it's a damn shame."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-08-27,"okay, where to start. unfinished and unpolished. the storyline is fine, and the graphics are also okay for this era. but many aspects of the game still lacking a proper level of quality compared to other games of this era. might have better potential when bugs and illogical situations are fixed for good. firstly, the controls feel very very heavy and slow, it feels like steering a huge stubborn elephant through woody mountainous terrain. furthermore, the ingame guide's and tips are really useless, lame and noninformative. you constantly need to google very simply stuff just to understand the control mechanisms and how to actually do things. simple idiotic situations, such as your horse running into a tree stump or a rock thereby killing you, can ruin your gameplay or a chaseescape, taking away the pleasure, leaving you with a wtf just happened feeling. you have no idea or sense about your skills, health, energy or ammo level. you have to figure out this by yourself within different menus. hell, i've been playing for many hours now, i still don't know how to change clothes to warm or cold weather... my guess is i need to go to the camp or a shop... who knows? anyways, if you survive the torturous and patiencetesting controls and illogical setup, you might start enjoying parts of the game when you get used to it. but this is really a requirement. well... good luck discovering for yourself. my review is quite obvious, don't waste your money and avoid this developer. btw.. written by a passionate gamer."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-08-24,"gorgeous graphics ruined by boring gameplay! my steam version runs well but the controls are not optimized for a pc and just plain monotonous! as you play you need to look to the right to see what different button to use to interact with  about e for everything, plants, horses, npcs? also, should be quick draw right mouse whatever in the tab menu as the chosen weapon, and left click mouse to shoot. in the beginning, are we supposed to believe a seasoned outlaw doesn't know how to fight with his fists or shoot well already? it's a chore to even draw a pistol. they took the fun action out of it. if you so much accidentally bump into a npc with these clunky controls they will want to fight, and apparently this dumb law system knows wherever you are and comes after you even if a npc steps in front of your horse. they made everything so tedious it's boring. 2 for great graphics, 0 for boring gameplay. it's a shame, it should've been max payne 2 with cowboys action from start to finish. this is a horse riding simulator, not outlaw jose wales."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-08-11,"objectively a masterpiece from a technical standpoint but is weak in terms of its story, gameplay and multiplayer. story wise i think they made a huge mistake having it be about dutch and his gang as if you have played the first game you pretty much know what characters are safe and which are likely to die. this removes tension and makes story arguments to paint characters as sympathetic useless as it comes across as shooting an arrow at a tree and then painting a bullseye around it. that makes it come off as lazy writing. the gameplay is not great as they tried to go for realism in many areas which normally i would like that slows things down to a crawl. looting dead bodies and searching containers require you to individually go through each drawer and pick up each item, a process so slow i don't loot anything in the game. fast travel is crippled in this game and you need to either travel there yourself or use a fast travel to a town instead of being able to travel to your waypoint. i tend to leave the room now while the game goes on auto pilot to my destination as its not fun traveling after a few hours of play. story missions are still the same rockstar style missions where you meet a character, travel for 10 minutes to a spot, get into a short and easy fight you where promised wouldnt happen by the character that give you the mission and thats it. i actually wonder how many of the 107 story missions are just carbon copys of themselves. lastly there is multiplayer which is probably the worst part of the game as it is a clone of gta v but with minimal effort put in. the world feels dead, missions are weak and require 4 people to play. you cant host a private session or one with friends and the roles in the game are direct copy's of gta vs businesses to the point that im am willing to bet good money the code is copied from gta directly. despite all my criticisms in this review i dont think the game is terrible and if you buy the game it should be for the singleplayer which you can sink a lot of hours into and get lost in, just be aware of the issues i have brought up and you wont feel cheated in areas and will be prepared in others. would not recommend at full price especially since they are charging more for this game than any prior at 65. if you can get it at 30 off at least you shouldn't feel too ripped off."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-26,i can see that the whole reviews are about the technical issues but this game is masterpiece and you cant avoid it just give it a chance and play it i run it at gtx1050 on 1080p ultra texture30fps
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-26,"this is going to be a bit hard to rate as there are a number of factors here that each alone deserve its own category, for the sake of writing a review this will be about the singleplayer and story only. as to be expected from rockstar singleplayer games its is a well crafted highly polished very long lasting experience that takes you onto a great immersive journey through the good ol wild west. the world is massive and filled to the brim with detail, the towns and cities feel lively and the forrest are full of animals so nothing feel barren or empty, there are hundreds of main missions and even side missions so the game will keep you busy for quite some time and over the course of that time you will greatly bond with the main character and his story. overall for the story alone i cannot recommend this game enough, it really is a must play title like the witcher 3 for example and everyone that is able to should get their hands on it. while i said that i will only take the game and story itself to base my score i still want to address the other issues with the game, yes the pc launch was botched and the game struggled for months with crashes, poor performance and many pc related bugs which since then have mostly been fixed now. nonetheless it has to be addressed how rockstar deals with these issues in general which is mostly a whole lot of silence, i love their games and they are usually greatly polished and well made games but their terrible business practices cannot go on like that, it is simply unacceptable to treat your customers like that! i said its hard to decide on how to rate this game but i think it would not be fair to give this game a bad review based on how badly the publisher handled the last few months, its not the games nor the devs fault and thus i decided to give it a 1010 because if you look past the technical issues this truly is an amazing game that will be remembered for years to come!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-25,"the game ran for me from day one, lower than hoped for fps but looks great on gsync. simply put this game is a masterpiece."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-25,a truly atmospheric game. i would like to relax in it. i highly recommend it to those who just want to enjoy the american atmosphere of their age.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-25,"rockstar games knows how to create a good game. yes it is slow, to move from one place to another on horseback, but the game is so jampacked with detailed side missions, hidden features and extremely detailed story missions, it's all worth it in the end for me. it's one of the most beautiful games i've ever seen, in terms of quality. it's incredibly realistic, more than most games out there. like gta v, rockstar really stepped it up with the quality and the storytelling, compared to their previous games, with it even better in this game. they built such an intricate and fascinating life history to all the characters, and you find out as the story progresses. you find yourself almost building an emotional connection to the majority of the main characters by the end. and of course, they made the story perfect as a prequel to the first rdr, blackwater and new austin is very close to being identical to the first game, which makes it all the better. as i said before, it's just incredible the amount of detail that went into this game. in terms of online... it's constantly improving as time goes on. it hasn't gone off the walls like gta online has, and you actually get money return from online missions that you play, unlike gta online. as i said, it's continuing to get better and better, with new missions, and businesses, it's a similar idea to gta online's businesses except the rdr online businesses won't cost you a small fortune in shark cards or whatever. everything fits in perfectly for an outlaw out in the country of america, in 1899. just like gta online, rdr online is set a month or so before the story starts. also, the amount of maturity among players on online compared to gta online is staggering. there is much less griefing, and players are a hell of a lot more respectful than they are in gta online. i give this game a 1010, it's a really good one. and give online a chance as well, it'll just get better and better."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-25,amazing game all round. beautiful graphics with a great story. probably my favourite game on the ps4 so far
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-24,"a strong 710. beautiful craftsmanship held back by a weak and poorly paced narrative and some outdated mechanics. starting a story in medias res is a common approach. trying to introduce a full troupe of important characters that the main protagonist already knows is much less common, for very good reason. the start and subsequent 15 hours of rdr2 could be compared to trying to start one of the mass effect games with the full crew already assembled and all personal relationships already established, while simultaneously failing to introduce a clear overarching goal such as defeating the reapers. only the comparison isn't really fair as the characters in rdr2, for the completely valid sake of realism, are far less colorful than most of the main characters in mass effect, making it even harder to engage with the narrative. this hardtoengagewith story also turns out to be far too long with two separate finales not based on choice, two inevitable events, both of which come up somewhat short in terms of feelings of satisfaction. on the positive side most of the acting is excellent and there are plenty of glimmers of narrative brilliance, especially in the epilogue. graphically the game is mostly excellent. the environments are gorgeous and the volumetric lighting is very impressive. towns, horses, trains and wildlife all look great. being able to switch between first and third person is great. human hair is a weakness, with some characters looking like they've got quite a bit of glue in their locks. mechanically the game shines when you're on your own doing something of your own choice, such as hunting for food, collecting a debt or shooting some wouldbe robbers. unfortunately these moments are almost never part of the main story content. the riding mechanics are very good, and the autoriding works well a time skip fasttravel button would be nice, though. the coverbased shooting parts of the game are generally fine, although the weapon variety is pretty limited, again for the valid sake of realism. the low points will be in some of the many scripted mission sequences which often feel simultaneously condescending and braindead. you will be told to take cover behind a rock, but not any rock will do. there will be a specific, scripted rock that you must cover behind in order for the game to progress. similarly, you will be told to stand on an outcrop and survey a camp using binoculars, and again there is a specific scripted spot. the game will simply not recognize you surveying the camp from any other location even though this is perfectly possible. another baffling aspect is the tendency for characters to have voice lines instructing you to do the most basic thing even after some 40 hours of gameplay, such as hitch your horse here. here's hoping rockstar can move beyond this ridiculously outdated handholding paintbynumbers mission structure in the future. some further minor complaints include an overuse of having to hold a button to perform an action, an overuse of forcing the player to walk rather than run, the fact that the conversationfocus button is also be the button that draws your weapon and a general arbitrariness of controls to pick up something off the ground you press x, unless it's your hat, in which case you press y, or a weapon, in which case you press lb. performance on pc seems a bit off, especially with the default settings. thankfully there are tons of settings and it is possible to get a stable 60 fps with the game looking great. i had three crashes, none of which caused any significant loss of progress."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-24,it's a great game with huge attention to the details.  a great story. 9 out of 10
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-23,"there was some problems at the begining, but i was not witnessed it. for me game are great. masterpiece."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-23,the best game ever i played. i love to see the details and the endless possibility in the game engine. i played for almost 100 hours and i could spend another 100 if i want.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-19,"no s que decir de este juego, para mi es el mejor juego de la generacin, tanto grficamente, como en historia, como en contenido. la cantidad de detalles que mete rockstar a sus juegos es enfermiza. algo para resumir este juego es que es un 'western simulator una vez entres en el juego te vas a convertir en un vaquero de finales del siglo xix, todas las armas recreadas como las de la poca con un tremendo detalle salvo algunas licencias que no habrn podido conseguir en el nombre ese rifle lancaster es el mtico winchester. todo el tema de la recoleccin y crafting est bien construido, la caza es muy realista y tienes tu compendio que hace las veces de pokedex de los animales que vas cazando. si no te atrae mucho el mundillo del wester debes jugarlo, pero si s que te atrae es algo obligatorio."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-19,"voy a resumir la excelencia de este juego en una sola frase absurdamente enfermo. empec a jugarlo a la par que vea la serie westworld y cuando estaba jugando a rdr2 no saba si ese mundo y sus personajes eran ms reales incluso que los de la serie. es realmente enfermizo el nivel de detalle en todos sus aspectos. sus puntos negativos son  el detalle facial creo que es bastante mejorable y desentonan con el resto de elementos grficos, pero tambin entiendo que son cientos de personajes nicos, lo cul lo justifica.  su gunplay. es bastante similar al de gta5 y e esperaba algo ms elaborado. funciona, pero no est a la altura del resto del juego."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-16,"este es el mejor jeugo de rockstar games, y es dificil superar a esa obra maestra de gta sa y rdr 1. este rdr 2 es mi top 2 de la historia, pero me duele que cuando saliera en pc el ao pasado estuviera roto, una pena que un juego de 10 que roza lo enfermizo en detalles, calidad tcnica y animaciones tuviera un port de mierda tan poco trabajado en pc, y no es la primera vez que hace esto rockstar o take two no s quien ser aqu el verdadero culpable, pero con juegos como gta iv el port en pc era basura, con el gta v se quitaron los mods y la comunidad de pc habl y tuvieron que hacer regresar eso, en este caso el rdr 2 tuvo un port da uno lamentable que yo pude experimentar, con congelaciones, cadas de frames y crasheos constantes la primera semana, aunque luego en unas semanas se solucion esa cantidad de problemas en pc no puedo olvidar como iba esos das, aunque no supera el port de mierda de gta iv, ese port era peor an. la historia de este juego, los personajes, la ambientacin, las fsicas, los detalles, los grficos, uy un largo etc son de otro nivel, y todo siendo mundo abierto, casi 600 horas jugadas cuando estoy escribiendo esto y esas horas subirn est claro. una obra mestra que rockstar casi destroza por el cutreport en pc. el juego es un 10 en todo, vale cada cntimo, pero en pc por culpa del port no merece ese 10, porque lleg a afectar esos primeros das a la experiencia de forma negativa, por lo cual ya dije, es mi top 2 de la historia de los videojuegos, y el juego en si es un 10."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-14,this is the best game have ever made by rockstar i really loved it. the graphic was brilliant and the story was great. the controles was nice and easy. you can play the game in the view of 5 cameras that actually is 1st person and 3rd person. after all it was the best game i have ever played. hope you enjoy it.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-13,guys now you can play it on pc without any issues or errors after a few patches it's greatly optimised and the story and graphics are fantastic. running smoothly on my rx560x ryzen 5 2500u. i've never seen such a masterpiece  so long...... better optimisation than assassin's creed odyssey and better story than the last of us part 2

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-02,"they've patched most of the issues. i've played it on both ps4 pro and now on pc and it's a masterpiece on either. i have played basicay every aaa open world game, but not a single one has ever created a world that feels so alive and dynamic except maybe botw while having one of the greatest character stories ever told in a video game. let me explain as good as many open world games are, they often feel like giant hub worlds with mission starts and collectibles to get. things can happen but it still feels like you're almost in a glorified level select with npcs. but in rdr2, nothing feels like a checklist, and there is just so much detail and rockstar have found a way to implement it so fluidly you'll lose all your time to just exploring and living in it. just getting on your horse and going to an area you haven't been is inherintly rewarding bc you never know what you find. it isn't an rpg so stats and upgrade items are really a thing, what you'll find are unique and interesting landmarks or stories. you may come across the remains of a suicide cult, a haunted house, a lonely woman learning to brave the wilderness on her own after her husband died, bumbling kkk idiots you can firebomb, etc. all incredibly written, voice acted, or just told through the scenery and notes. and this goes for the entire game. everything is done to most excruciating level of detail, whether it's the jaw dropping graphics, the unparraeled quaility of voice acting, or basic mechanics on how characters and animals move and interact with the world. you'll see a lot of reviews saying how the over concentraction on realism hurts the momentum, but trust me, as someone with little patience, once you get into it it truly all adds to what makes the world feel alive and real in an engaging and fun way. yes it's still the same rockstar gun mechanics, but i found it satisfying as all hell bc of the dead eye mechanic and the outstanding sound design that make the shootouts intense and visceral. and it also does have kind of a morality based mechanic effecting the narrative but done in a way that's entirely baked into the game and effecting by how you play vs a shallow pick and choose the best i can compare it to is silent hill 2 that really ties what happens to the person you made arthur to be. so i cried like a gosh darn baby at the end of my first playthrough bc you feel so attached to everything. you are arthur morgan, the horse you choose is your best friend, and this is your story. while there are games that are amazing bc they feel very gamey and i wouldn't want every game to try to be like this, i believe this is an evolution in games as an art, using the medium to immerse you in a way no film or book can. side notes there are still one or 2 wrinkles compared to the console version of this game. very rarely i saw broken shadows or some textures not completely loading in. also i'd suggest not even trying for 60fps, focus on fidelity first, the game was originally built to be 4k and run at 30fps and it really is a smooth experience choosing that over lower settings"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-06-18,"amazing graphics, terrible controls keyboard and mouse, and a game that tries to be too many different things at once and fails. one second the game is trying to be realistic and your character lurches all over the place with lengthly animations to open drawers, the next you are in a gunfight with hordes of enemies, none of which can aim. one minute you are stealthily hunting an animal after tracking it through the wilderness, the next a ride comes past spooking it off. paths in the frozen wilderness are treated like minor roads in a city with people riding past every few minutes. if i want to kill 50 enemies in every gunfight i can play borderlands 3 which has the mechanics that make that style work, and is also a much better shooter and is good, zany fun. adding these elements into a quasirealistic wildwest just doesn't work. i would rather have played a quasirealistic shooter with shooting at maybe less than 10 people in a large gunfight and less in others. the mix of realism with overthetop less serious gamey elements that are often poorly done is jarring, and makes for a game both janky and also dull. very good graphics though. absolutely stunning. the tracks especially are amazing. they are the only reason i don't completely regret buying the game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-06-17,"one of the most boring game in history . 800 m usd of budget for that ? for hold whateverthekey to change the wheel is this a joke ? in this game, sometime, left click will be use to aim, is this a joke ? i timed myself, in order to do two quests, i spent 45 minutes on horse and 15 minutes actually playing and making the quest there is no fast travel, at least not like any other normal game this game thinks of itself as a simulation and therefore forgets to be a game. it's boring, it's one of the most boring game ever. even a walking simulator is less boring than this game. and it's so much scripted, it's insane. the first bounty hunting mission, you need to find a fake doctor. you find him near a river on a cliff. you arrest him, he falls in the river. you go on your horse to save him. you can see the guy moving in the river, suddenly you see a junction where you think you can catch the guy . you  wait, he does not appear and you fail the mission, but why ? i was sure i saw the guy, he's suppose to come here. well well, on second attempt you can clearly see the guy passing behing a huge rock but if you are at a right angle, you can see he's being teleported, his position changes instantly, why ? because rockstar does not want you to use the junction to stop him, they want you to follow their gentle script and get the guy where they want you to get him. i can't stand that anymore, i want freedom in a video game, i want to be put infront of a problem and find a way to solve it by myself, the junction should have worked in my example and they destroyed that option on purpose. this game is just so bad. 800m usd of budget for something than even a game made by students can beat easily in terms of gameplay . what a shame..."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-06-03,"i, like many others, bought this game upon release. i put about 40 hours into it before i bailed. its not that it was a bad game, it just felt boring to me. i didnt get it. but, in june of 2019, i started over on the ps4. since then, i have put over 1000 hours into both the story mode and online. i have 100 in story mode and i havent played any other game since. for about 6 years, i was playing exclusively fromsoftware games as they were the only games that held my attention. somewhere after a few dozen hours, everything just clicks. the tedious, silly tasks no longer seem tedious. everything seems to have purpose. it is, quite literally, the greatest video game ever created. from the amazing story to the insane graphics. i just get lost in the world. at this point, i can navigate with only a compass. i understand why so many gave up and thought it was boring. for those folks, if you have any interest in video games, give it another try. it has earned the top spot in my mind that was previously held by final fantasy vii since 1997. this game is the greatest game of all time. it sets out to do everything a video game is meant to do and does it all. this is the ultimate playground. dont let it pass you by."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-05-04,"while the game is beautiful at times with amazing detail and plenty of things to do, its just unfortunate the technical team over at rockstar isn't as skilled as their art team. its a console port that forces you to get a new cpu because optimization wasn't as important as making sure the minigame of poker was intentionally coded to make you lose. ui wasn't even looked at, there isn't a single menu that houses the rest of the menus so each menu has its own individual hot key. the ui is massive and totally counter intuitive to keyboard and mouse users. if you want to change a hot key you need to scroll through pages and pages of other keys. the mouse ui sometimes completely breaks and the only way to use the menus again is to use the keyboard. but at least your horse poops every time you dismount. such detail, much game design. what would be amazing is if a studio made a game this detailed and beautiful but actually cared about the consumer more than just seeing them as potential microtransactions. that way we would get a masterpiece not ruined by bugs, crashes and bad optimization just because fixing bugs and poor optimization cost more to fix than they bring in money. also the trigger hoops the game forces you to jump through are so ridiculous, they are evident at every corner and it culminates in me being unable to even finish the epilogue, i just stand there in place glitched out. if they wanted to make a game on rails they should skip the trying to make an open world. i really wish the rockstar that made san andreas still existed, so that we would get a worth wile satirization of the piss poor state that current rockstar devolved into final note, as someone who lives in a desert other than the mojave or sonora it is annoying how over represented the saguaro cactus is. the cactus is found in one desert in arizona and that is it, but in this game it's in every desert except the one based on the mojave. it's also annoying there is a massive section of the map covered in saguaro cactus that isn't even used in the storyline, when the game cannot push a stable 60fps on a 3440x1440 monitor in the parts of the map you do use."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-04-19,"hello everyone! tldr  bad first impression because of the technical issues, but what an amazing game! rdr2 is probably the best game since mafia i. after a bad first encounter with rdr2 pc, i finally started playing it seriously in the last couple of weeks. i have to admit that before this it gave me headaches, i even contacted the rockstar support and had a furious email exchange with them. i was so frustrated with my experience with this game that i wasn't sure i will ever play it again. it is not allright paying the bill for a aaa title and having stability and performance issues. it ruined my first impression and i had to wait almost 4 months to give it a second try, and boy was it worth it! this is probably the best pc game since mafia i, at least for me. it offers the same level of immersion, character development, but with impressive graphics and a more compelling open world than any other game i have played. and the story is looong and does not feel exagerated, nor boring. it is a cinemalike experience and i confess i took so many screenshots with the photo mode that i have reached social club's limit of 200 photos. luckily for me amd offers good screen capturing without limit let the photos go on! issues i had with rdr2 pc  issues using hdr on my sony xf90 tv  i had to setup amd display hdr color output, tinker with the tv settings and with the ingame hdr settings too in order to have good output plus, for some reason if i keep my tv as a seconday display i sometimes lose hdr. my solution is to set the tv as the only display when i am playing win10, notifications button, project, second screen only  performance issues  had to watch more than half an hour of tutorials and adjust each and every graphic setting individually to be able to run the title at 2k 60fps with good visuals running on a ryzen 7 2700x 3.7ghz 8core16thread, 16gb ram 3000mhz, sx8200pro nvme ssd, amd rx5700xt 8gb gpu  the title is unstable on my rig when using the dx12 instead of vulkan tried dx12 and had 2 crashes in 4 hours, had to revert to vulkan which from all benchmarks i've seen appears to have more fps drops those 0.1 and 1 lows  i keep receiving a warning message each time i continue the story  an autosave already exists, overwrite it? no clue why or how to fix this, but it did not affect me so far, just a small nuisance. all in all, i forgive rockstar for the issues this game had and still has. it is a master piece that every pc gamer out there should try. if you get past the first few hours of rdr2 you will never give it up. an unbelievable achievement, and already one of my fav all time games. i am currently around 54 of the story and i am hooked! if you were disappointed at first like i was, give it another go. you won't regret it. enjoy!"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-04-18,"i'm so confused about the amount of negative reviews for this game. i have had no problems with the game. no crashes, no low fps, no glitches, and certainly have never had a problem with the rockstar launcher or poor optimization of the game. the game itself is amazing, the gameplay feels great, the story is by far the best part, the graphics are unbelievable, and the online portion is way better than anything that gta online ever had to offer. optimization is fine on my brother's 1060 and 6600k, my wife's 5700xt and 2600, and my 9900k and 2080ti none of those are oc'd in any way. you barely have to interact with the rockstar game launcher that everyone claims is a plague on this game. this is your interaction with said launcher hit play on either steam or epic launcher, the rockstar launcher opens a small window for roughly five seconds, then it goes away and the game launches. in summation, give it a shot if you have the money, if it's not what you're into then make like the rest of these people and get yourself a refund while you write negative reviews."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-04-09,"this game has wonderfully graphic, and this is everything positive i can say about it. i spent 40 hours in this game and was still in the second chapter because i love to explore and do side quests instead of pushing the main story in all that i play games. but this game makes angry ass hell. 1 it's unstable, and i don't care about frames per second. i have a good enough rig to handle it. but it hangs or quit to windows eight times per my whole 40h of gameplay. 2 game controls i use keyboard and mouse because it's pc were terribly designed. even 1 after remapping keys to handle the most important actions by one hand. even 2 if you move hud closer to the center you need to observe right corner by the entire game for crafting for hunting for talking for interact with petshorses for looting for trading that is stupid, especially on an ultrawide monitor. and even 3 that you never know what arthur will do. for example, i always kick to dead tied people instead of releasing them because this action was triggered by this same button! you can expect random shots or punch during a conversation. 3 physic is a big joke. riding a horse or running was uncomfortable keybindings also doesn't help in this area. everything is swimming in this world and you can expect many impossible ragdolls which results in sudden death. 4 you cannot trust your inventory. items like to disappear. it will be acceptable if there is some lost and found system, but there isn't. for example, i found a pretty civil war knife in an abandoned fort. and after a while, it disappears, i cannot loot it again, found in my knives select menu or repurchase it from someone it vanished from the entire game. 5 stupid bounty system. why the hell arthur takes off the mask on every cutscene. and how law enforcement recognizes you in disguise. because of this, the mask is useless. 6 missions and npc quick load festival not only because of terrible handling but because your stupid folks don't wait for you and rush on the enemy. npc was broken! in stealth tutorial, every time when i silently kill a target, never mind if with throwing knife or by stabbing him. all other npc starts shooting even when they cannot see whats happened. in cities, you need to fight with controls to don't touch anybody it results with bounty or quick load. 7 tutorials the game doesn't tell you about important mechanics. you need to search on the internet how bounty works, how to save game, how to use quick travel in the middle of nothing. or why you cannot get a bunny perfect pelt. or even if it tells there are too many actions on the bottom right to read all tooltips when they appear."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-03-31,"wow. this is the best game i have played so far in my life. open world and story driven games are my favourite games so of course i'm going to love this. if you don't enjoy story games then you wont like this. because  the story  amazing, long and detailed. the acting  amazing and i dont say that often, i can pick up a  actor on tv etc instantly and they often ruin it for me the graphics amazing and even the movements and facial expressions of arthur, your horse and the other characters even npcs and wild animals too are fantastic. the hunting system is great, its difficult to kill some tiny animals with a bloody bow and arrow but it makes it fun, so if you dont fancy doing some missions for a bit you can go hunting or do some challenges. the cookingcrafting system was strange at first but it makes sense and is quite simple really and quite enjoyable. this game is so realistic. it can be a very hard learning curve at the start and to be honest i nearly gave up this game after the first hour it really got on my nerves, specially when riding through towns and i kept knocking people over and getting bounties and witnesses to minor crimes that was the most annoying bit throughout the game in all honesty however i persevered and after a day or 2 i had learnt all the controls and nuances and i'm so glad i did. the missions are most of the time, different, and unexpected things happen in them. they can also be really long. the last few took me a week to complete, in fact i've been playing this game for the last 7 months, pretty much every other day with maybe the odd week break and that is how long its taken me to complete it  ive not got 100 im at 86.5 or something but ive done all the stranger and side missions that i have found, got all but the last legendary animal, done around half the challenges and explored the total map. storywise  arthur has been the best character i have seen in any video game. theres so many funny lines that he says throughout the game aswell  he is a sarcastic lovable character. i think the most fun mission for me in this game is the one in the bar in valentine with lennie. after the game ended i had to watch this again. yes it has some negatives, i think overall its an easy game to beat and maybe some difficulty settings would have been better here. also the wanted system is very annoying, especially when committing train robberies  you have a bag over your head in a long underground train tunnel yet no lawmen are there and they somehow know its you before they even arrive. nearly every time i have tried a train robbery my bounty was more than what i earned from it. this game is about a gang of criminals and the game makes it totally difficult to commit any crimes at all, if not even trying to steer you away from doing that. i suppose it makes sense given the various endings though but still. as a female i would have liked more female lead characters having a bigger role. yeh its set in the late 1700s and yes women were left behind in that era however the game was made in 2018. i thought sadie was a great character and would have loved a bit more of that. not even many stranger missions or encounters were from females. apart from the ones that always needed saving, so rockstar this would have been more ideal. lack of fast travel for the most part of this game was quite annoying too  and made the game take so long. only near the end of the game i bought it 2nd hand rockstar introduced the fast travel and photo mode which is fun too it should have been in the game from the start. the auto equipping of weapons is annoying too. i would put some guns on my back ready for something, id get off the horse because i would come across someone that needs saving, id get there then i would have no guns on me! the game takes them off you for some reason if your still sat on your horse. its similar for missions too and loads you up with random ones and not the ones you want. another main annoyance is that half of the map is unexplorable until the main story ends and there is only one stranger mission that i have encountered here and ive ran around everywhere on this side of the map. bit of a waste really and 3 legendary animals are on this side aswell which seems pointless as you can make trinkets out of them but dont really have any use of them for many missions. a very minor thing that i would have liked is that arthurs hair doesn't have a length limit! why does it when everything else in the game is so detailed. even your horse has different hair lengths and colours to choose from lol in conclusion, despite the negatives i'm really sad that i have finished the game now i wish it would carry on and on and on haha. well done to rockstar for this game, please make your next one as good as this  storywise especially. arthur will always have a special place in my heart hahahah"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-03-29,"my friends, this is the pinnacle of gaming. all these frustrations at the start of the pc port are not relevant anymore. game runs perfectly i'm on vulkan. i've never played a game where you can feel the love, care and attention more than in red dead redemption 2 only equaled by the witcher 3. it's a world, human, warm, bitter, exiting, calming, tense and immersive. just play it. only concern i have is that it's really hard to go back to the average quality level of most other games out there."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-03-22,i have to force myself to finish this game as it feels like a chore. the controls are extremely clunky. the game play is quite boring barring a few set pieces for which i gave these 2 stars. the game has innumerable glitches and the main campaign is ruined with worthless filler. the whole experience feels like watching a mundane interactive movie rather than playing an actual video game. the online game locks story missions behind purchasable property which can only be unlocked by gold bars. one can either spend some more real money or grind numerous boring missions in order to gain these gold bars. this is perfectly in line with the micro transaction formula seen in grand theft auto online.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-02-29,"amazing graphics and attention to detail but if you want good gameplay and fluid controls, you probably won't like this. this has the best graphics i've ever seen in a game and it doesn't run tooo badly with that in mind. a mix of ultra and medium settings i get 70 to 110 fps on 1440p with a rtx 2080. sound design is great although there is a lack of audio settings, user interface is terrible if you want to use your mouse as well as the map at least in my opinion has a lot to be desired. controls and movement, just like in gta v, only worse, are incredibly clunky and annoying to use. you will constantly get stuck, jump onto things you walk near, walk too far or walk too slowly. this game may be great if you can over all the incredibly annoying things about this game but i would not recommend it, especially at full price. also only buy the standard edition"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-02-26,"a gem  that refuses to allow you to control the main character in any way. you will start to find yourself lost in this game, drawn in, thrilled by what it has to offer. then the horrific control system kicks in and you are reminded very very harshly that you are just playing a video game. couple that with a ridiculously outdated save system from ps1 times, any and all hiccups on account of the game are magnified tenfold due to the backtracking needed to be done. you are constantly fighting the game just to play the game. how any of the professional reviewers overlooked this huge blemish on the game is beyond me. it is your connection to the game, your physical connection through the keyboard and controller. every time the character decides to do something different to what you expect as the past 20 times you pressed that button it did one thing it rips your right out of any immersion you may have. here are some examples 1 the button to untie hostage and kick hostage to death is the same button relevant to how close to the target you are. 2 the game will sometimes aim a weapon when left trigger is pulled, sometimes it will request you also them press the right trigger to aim a weapon. 3 auto aim will prefer to target characters you can speak to, not characters you can shoot. 4 at one point x accepts an offer and b rejects it, then just minutes later with the same character x becomes reject, and b becomes accept. the game is a ferrari with no wheels. yeah, you have a ferrari but you cant do anything with it except leave it out of gear and rev the engine while its still inside your garage."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-02-02,"does greed pay? it probably does in most things nowadays but when you screw your community over and over it will come back at you. gta5 online has been crashing for months without fixes, so you might think they were probably putting all their resources on rdr2, and once released you find out it won't start for most people, it's full of bugs and poorly optimized. after months from the release an incredible amount of people still struggle to even play the game. personally i have the tree shaking bug if i play with dx12 and crashed every 1520 min if i play with vulkan. like they are doing for gta, rather than fixing the game they add more online content hoping for players to spend more money. aren't they making enough money to understand that this will not pay off? that it's worth earning a bit less to keep your community satisfied with the products? it's a shame because, obviously, the game could be great. 910 to the game, 010 to rockstar."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-02-02,"i did not think any game could be a worthy successor to red dead redemption 1, a game which i consider to be one of the best games of that console generation. but they did it. extremely rewarding and lengthy experience i came in a just over 100 hours played after finishing the campaign. if you like a more slower paced methodical western epic, buy asap. if you have the attention span  maybe stay away. the game also ran fine on my aging machine i5 4670, 8gb ram, gtx10606gb. some slowdown in large campaign shootouts and a total of 3 crashes during missions but other than that no problems."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-02-02,"red dead redemption 2 has finally come to steam. after being delayed for the mediocre epic store, has the wait been worth it? sadly the answer is yes and no. the game itself is just as fantastic as it was on ps4 when i played it to completion there.  steam release appears to be just as rough as it's initial pc release. in essence rockstar have now flubbed two launches of the same game. now personally? i have not run into issues that others have, but that isn't to say those folks who are having issues are wrong. i can only comment on my own experience and feel it's worth noting that my specs exceed the recommended specs. my gtx 1070 is a step above the 1060 the recommended calls for for instance. i have been able to run the game between 4050 fps with a mix of mostly ultra and some high settings at 1080p. as noted others have issues which may be in part to the rockstar launcher which shouldn't even be needed to be honest. yes we knew this was coming and they pulled this with gtav despite the fact many had already bought it on steam and were now subject to yet another needless launcherclient. some have noted that the game hard crashes but that this may be due to having a controller. if this occurs try disconnecting your controller and reconnecting it after the game has launched. i have also had hard crashes myself in game without a controller connected.  with the technical issues out of the way let's talk about the actual game. red dead redemption 2 is a story driven game telling the story of the taming of the old west and how the dutch van der linde gang and protagonist arthur morgan deal with the encroaching civilization. there is an obsessive attention to detail with luxurious animations for almost everything. the characters are well voice acted. due to this it makes them feel real and driven by their own desiresmotivations which makes the interplay between them interesting to watch. a wide variety of content exists for you to engage with. collect plants, etc. fill out your compendium of wildlife and craft new clothing and accessories from hunting them. the customization as i touched on just above, is robust. you can customize your horse, outfit, and yes even your guns. if there is one achilles heel of red dead 2? it's it's lack of an efficient fast travel system. be prepared to spend a lot of time riding your horse to get to where you want to go. i could understand if they wanted you to see the scenery, but once you've visited a town? you should be able to fast travel from a sign post akin to witcher 3. because of this? there are moments where the game feels like it doesn't respect your time. one of the problems on ps4 was you might inadvertently hit the wrong button or due to the contextual nature of some interactions? maybe you haul off and slug someone when what you really wanted to do mount your horse or something. this is a problem here as well due to some actions being context sensitive. is red dead 2 a game worth buying? yes,  just be aware that you may have to contend with some bugs."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-02-01,"i am giving this game a 210 because it is a beautiful and immersive game when you can play, however, you're more likely to become an actual rockstar than finish story mode. it was completely unplayable for nearly 2 weeks after release and now, months later and 44 through the single player campaign, it is again completely unplayable. i was enjoying the game normally on a tuesday night, but i took a break to hit the gym and go to work the next morning anticipating another night of play on wednesday. wednesday night came and i found that my autosave crashed to desktop. there is no way to access your manual saves from the start menu. seriously, that isn't hyperbole, you literally can't load a game from the menu. to load a manual save you must load into an autosave or into multiplayer. great. so i started multiplayer and, as soon as it loaded in, i attempted to load all of my saves one at a time. the autosave continues to crash the game to desktop and all other saves load indefinitely, never starting the game. i followed all of rockstar's canned fixes and none of them have done a thing to resolve this issue. i submitted a ticket, set to be responded to in 24 hours, and received zero response. finally, as i have invested time and money into the game, i attempted to start a new game from the beginning. this is also not possible from the menu. you must load into an autosave or online server to access the story menu. except i still cannot start a new game, even after loading into online mode. the menu says new game is unavailable at this time or something along those lines. i assume that if i sat through the opening tutorial of online play that i would be able to finally get back to the game i want to play, but i am fed up. do not buy this game."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-01-18,"there's a lot to like in rdr2. the story takes a while to warm up, but it gets to you, as it changes from wild west superficial shooter to an existencial crisis. the world is beautiful and feels alive, with animals scurrying about and settlements with people wandering around, plenty of random interactions. it is fun to spend a lot of this time running around with our horse, shooting and lassoing people. but... gameplay is really not amazing. maybe i'm getting old, but shooting just felt clunky. and the whole mechanics of it were off. sure, it's not the game to be hyper realistic, but it made shooting be a race for headshots rather than a proper competition between you and other gunslingers. you can take at least 20 times more shots than all your other enemies, yet you're always outnumbered 1 to 20, 30, 40... which honestly makes it feel like a super hero game, rather than a wild west shooter. if you have less than 10 enemies, it's even possible to knock them all out just using punches. at least that made it a challenge. then, horse riding and hunting is kinda fun... for 5 minutes. then hunting is apparently just a decoration with no real use. and horse riding, well, since that's your main means of transport in a region with sparse fast travel points... it becomes a chore. then, what another reviewer pointed out nicely, the missions are mostly crap. not only because of the shooting, but really the flow is always the same get to some place, get attacked by 50 people, run away and kill some more on the way out. what is really a shame for me is that the story would be enough for me to keep playing i did finish it!  so it's really a waste of potential to not go deeper into all the characters. they all had so many interactions between each other and hanging out at camp... so why not have more missions with them, where something meaningful might or not happen? why not give them more leading roles in the story? and above all, i'd really appreciate a tiny bit more realism  less mass genocide would go a long way in both gameplay, story and missions."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-01-18,"i really wish i could give this game a higher score. the story is amazing, the gunplay is snappy and satisfying with keyboard and mouse, and the world is so expansive and has so much content that it takes hundreds of hours to see and do everything the game has to offer. the problem is that this game is so goddamn buggy that you can hardly go five meters without some new gamebreaking glitch popping up and forcing a reload. enemies getting full auto bottomless mags when entering dead eye, the clumsy cover system locking you to the exposed side of cover instead of the side you were approaching, infinite loading screens, dialogue going silent suddenly and randomly, ai spawning in the most secluded corner of the map just to witness you roping the last guy who spawned into the middle of nowhere just to witness you roping the last guy who spawned into the middle of nowhere just to witness you roping the last guy who... etc, etc. the controls are clumsy and every button has like five different actions attached to it and selected weapons are never saved and frequently go back to your horse for no reason, so something as simple as pulling out your gun is made into a huge mess where, unless you manually go into your weapon wheel and select the weapon you want to use, chances are you'll just stand there like an idiot staring at the dude pumping you full of lead. animations for looting and skinning are excessive, to put it lightly, and are obligatory time sinks that exist solely to build immersion, which is promptly broken when some guy just starts endlessly walking into a chair because his pathfinding is broken. online is a joke. you'll be staring at alert you have been disconnected from red dead online due to a fault in rockstar game services. error 0x20010006 more often than you play it, and the experience is so disgustingly obviously set up to gouge as much money out of you to buy gold as possible. framerate is terrible for visuals that look pretty average, all things considered. this is all compounded by a total lack of communication regarding these issues from rockstar. they seem to just want to brush all of this under the rug while advertising new content that does nothing but break all the existing content even further. avoid this game until they fix it. the story is really good, and the gunplay is really fun, and there's tons of content, but it's all brought down by just an utter lack of care. they simply didn't care about actually being able to play the game, they just wanted to spend all their time putting in all of these little details instead of building a playable game. edit i'm actually going to lower my score for this game from a 6 to a 3. more and more bugs are made apparent the more the game is played, and as i'm playing more of the online mode, the more i feel the online actively detracts from the whole experience. like, you can only have 10 horse slots, character customization as woefully basic as it is, and exclusive horses in the online mode, but online is so painful to subject yourself to that the extra enjoyment is vastly outweighed by the extra frustration. they could have implemented all of this free dlc as a tiein to the single player mode, which at the very least has a fantastic story and character lineup. and please, with the limited storybased content in the online mode, hire some voice actors for the player characters and overhaul the cutscenes to accommodate this. being a mute is such a lazy excuse for a company with as many resources as rockstar."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-01-12,"short good, but not great. definitely not a mustplay. technical problems. i. technical.  game does not have a bad optimization. however, setting are too complex more than 20 variables and autochoice is bad. after an optimization guide i've got a best looking pc game running on stable 60 fps.  drm. well, i suppose it's drm causing problems. i've got crashes from the game and just before the crash i was seeing on a screen the situation where i was like 20 minutes ago. also, i bought at egs i was receiving save files conflict, where save at the cloud was more recent than local. many stuff is serverbased here, i guess. ii. singleplayer.  there are 3 games with longest story, that i have played the witcher iii, gta v and rdr ii. i am not keen on fantasy, but after wiii's 120 hours i've read not only witcher's books but all author's bibliography and now have a high regard of polish fantasy writers. i am not superfan of criminal drama, but after gta v's 50 hours i've searched and looked every scorcese's, de palma's and mann's overlooked masterpieces and some of 80's action movies. i am super big fan of western genre from stagecoach to the shootist, from django to django unchained i've watched every notable western movie, blackwhite, color and of course, technicolor. and after rdrii's 80 hours i am kinda meh  yeah, it's 1899, almost end of the wild west in usa 1st period is before telegraph and railroads, 2nd is circa civil war, 3rd is afterwards, 4th is mexican revolution, so it does hurt an atmosphere, it is lacking golden age shenanigans.  some missions are great, direct quotations from great movies, but there many just soulless stuff copypasted from gta.  weapons are great and bad simultaneously. rockstar did a great job and spoiled it after. great reloading animations were done and than speed up, idk, in 100 times. so, your game hero reload gateloading colt or even cap and ball with amount of time required to reload modern pistol. it downs an importance of each shot to a meh i'll just reload in 2 seconds. there are btw world's first pistols and some newer weapons, not really common at that time in those places, and it's hurting atmosphere too, really bad. making a western into gta is a bad thing.  you travel with a gang, there are plenty of characters, half of the names of those you won't remember in the end of the game. also, many other characters are flat, only serving some purpose. for example, there are indians, and indians' quests, but it's feels like just so r can say we have indians in our western. guys, for example, there are too few mexicans. so what? western can tell many stories, the overall percent coverage of all possible topics is not what is important, it's theirs quality, and game lacks it, really bad.  your actions affect your story based on your honor level. however, it's too easy to be good. unless, you murder folks for 5 . or doesn't confess your sins to reverend fish. just let it go, off the hook, my son.  and yet, game is too long, twice longer than gta v, and exact same length too long. overall, scriptwriting is worse than in gta v. i kinda guess, after all those years with modern criminal plots they've achieved some skills and trying to use these skills everywhere.  economy is broken. missions propose you hard choices about taking or not taking like 20  from a poor fellow. c'mon, just go find some gold bars, 500  each and you will not have any problems with money, just frustration from unsatisfying dull unrewarding copypasted repeating quests.  open world works on scripts. when they work it's impressive as hell. but they tend to broke. imho, it could've been a firts r rpg easily, with like plus 25 efforts added to all of this, but meh. iii. online. i am not really a modern online gamer, nor have i played a rdo much, but it does feel good. there are paytowin, but it works only in pvp. mundane, unpolished and easily avoidable pvp in mostly pvefocused game with roleplaying flavor. however, drm p.i can crash your game just when you were doing your mission, or having a good hand in poker. in singleplayer i just reload, it's not a big deal, but it's a lot of pain in online, because you must do it again from the very start. an of course, you do grinding a lot. protagonists of rdo are mute. all of them. it feels strange and awkward. from all minigames from single you can play only poker. in the end, after writing this review, i still can't recommend to buy or to avoid this game, even if you like westerns. if you don't have anything other to play, maybe?"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-01-11,"this game is an absolute masterpiece. i really dont know where to start. throughout the game, i feel like i have really bonded with arthur morgan, he is by far rockstars best protagonist. the graphics are absolutely beautiful, especially on pc with the settings cranked up. the story is interesting and fun, with many memorable characters. i like that you can go at your own pace and take in this games beautiful world, because it is massive and jaw dropping. the voice acting and animations are superb, especially arthurs. and i actually gave a crap about the characters. the gameplay mechanics are awesome, horse riding is awesome, action is exciting and fun. the ending is sad, but equally satisfying no spoilers. i really dont have anything negative to say about this game, it is the best game i have ever played."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-01-11,"broken saves, broken dead eye shooting, weird and sluggish movement in first person, buggy riding... trying to play this game on pc is frustrating. avoid."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-01-10,"for anyone that is listening to all the bs people have spouted on here bringing this rating way down, ignore them. i have an older i7 2600k with a gtx 1070 and the game runs perfect. sure, it took them a couple weeks to get it ironed out but big deal. this game is simply amazing and deserves top honors. easily one of the best games ever made."
