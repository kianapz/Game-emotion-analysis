Everonfan,2025-02-26,80,"Few games put you in the shoes of a killer as efficiently and brutally as The Last of Us Part I, where you play as two characters who kill hundreds of people—both guilty and innocent—just to survive. But despite being morally reprehensible, it's hard to deny that the game's technical execution is stunning, and the gameplay is highly satisfying. My rating: ****"
polakus77,2025-02-23,50,"gioco super deludente , avevo capito la storia(il finale) dopo 4 ore sinceramente. il gameplay è inesistente , stai in ginocchia tutto il tempo ...boh non vedo il piacere . Non metto meno di 5 perché capisco che per una generazione che non abbia mai letto mezzo libro o che guarda solo tik tok è reality vari il gioco possa piacere !!!!"
environment,2025-02-21,40,"Good game but I don't recommend it due to poor optimization, it crashes all the time."
gufan,2025-02-14,90,出色的电影化叙事，比如山姆和他兄弟的结局。逼真的枪支改造，让我感觉真的对一把枪做了改进，不像其他游戏只是简单增加数值。整体战斗难度系数不大，但是资源很少。地图设计也不会让我经常迷路。
seriousboris,2025-02-10,70,"Прошёл the last of us part 1 2023 года на пк. С 2013 года я пытался ограничивать себя от потребления любого контента с этой игрой, дабы не словить спойлеров, но это невозможно. Так что по итогу я представлял примерно, что будет в концовке, кто там выживет, а кто нет, но вся остальная игра по сути для меня была неведома. Как же игрожур надрачивал на неё (Логвинов эякулировал фонтаном), и до сих пор игра считается одним из самых удачных/успешных проектов за всю историю. Кинцо в игре по итогу хорошее, но крайне клишированное (и даже, как сказал бы Папич – нереалистичное), на меня такое не действует, однако концовка очень понравилась. Даже если допустить, что история в игре на 10/10, то геймплей точно проседает. По геймплею игра очень средний заскриптованный сурвайвл хоррор. Менеджмент ресурсов сломанный, так как игра сама подстраивается под твой инвентарь и по сути сама распоряжается твоими ресурсами, такого быть не должно. Игра очень хочет, чтобы ты как можно больше играть стелсом, и к сожалению, очень много игр потом пытались копировать здешний стелс, а меня уже трясёт от того что в каждую игру просто по приколу вставляют его, тем более такой как здешний. Мили боёвка просто умора, и со здешним менеджментом ресурсов есть смысл её как можно чаще использовать, и в итоге игра превращается в бокс с зомбями, вся серьёзность в этот момент уходит. Раз 6 за игру надо плыть за плотом и сажать на него элли, с каждым разом становится все более потешно, на третьем плоту уже ловишь кринж с происходящего. Прокачка отстой полный, толковых апгрейдов нет почти. Также, в игре АЖ 6 СУКА уровне сложности, это просто бредик какой-то, я играл на 4 из 6, было бы их три я бы выбрал третий, самый сложный, но их сука 6… К графике претензий нет, очень качественно. Музыка, звуки и прочее тоже хороши. Не жалею, что ждал 12 лет, и ограждал себя от любого контента с the last of us, игра хорошая, но понятное дело переоценённая. Я понимаю, что для многих это игра детства/юношества поэтому они очень её любят, вспоминая как будучи малютками они играли в неё на третьей плоечке. Я однако, ставлю 7/10."
assiscmp,2025-02-05,100,"otimo jogo! , um dos poucos que me deu voltando de pegar platina! , recomendo a todos jogarem essa obra de arte"
Laranja3321,2025-01-30,90,"Bom, todo mundo já sabe o quão bom esse jogo é e o que ele representa pra indústria de jogos atualmente. O que ele fez em 2013 em trazer um jogo com uma história tão potente de sentido e corajosa em inovação é impressionante. Gustavo Santaolalla simplesmente criou uma das trilhas temas mais poderosas desse meio, e todo o trabalho que o jogo faz utilizando de suas OSTs é o que deixa essa experiência tão incrível. Infelizmente o jogo teve um péssimo porte feito para o PC e em seu lançamento era uma bomba de bugs, mas a espera valeu a pena, 3 anos depois o jogo está belo como deveria estar, e com toda certeza quem nunca teve a oportunidade de jogar quando era exclusivo deve dar uma chance para essa obra."
WigoryaN,2025-01-17,90,"The Last of Us Part I, en iyi zombi oyunlarında ilk 5'ime girer. Joel ve Ellie arasındaki bağ, hikayenin her geçen dakikasında daha da artıyor. Oyunun sonu da dahil olmak üzere beni kendine çok iyi bağladı. Hikayede verilmek istenen duygu, çok iyi yansıtılmış. Naughty Dog'u tebrik ediyorum. Hem Türkçe dublaj yapan sayılı şirketlerden biri hem de ortaya koyduğu iş muazzam. Ben sıkıntı yaşamasam da bazı oyuncular oyunu oynarken optimizasyon sorunları yaşamış. Umarım bu sorunlar giderilmiştir."
Nik252525,2025-01-14,100,"Having completed the game, I can confidently say that even after so many years since its release, The Last of Us remains one of the strongest, deepest and most beautiful games. Despite the fact that I watched the walkthrough when I was still a small schoolboy in the wild 2014, and I remember the whole plot perfectly well, the game caused a whole storm of different emotions and feelings. The Last of Us is incredibly cinematic: beautiful cutscenes, amazing dialogues and animation of the characters (both facial and animation of battles, movement, interaction with the environment), beautifully staged action, an amazing soundtrack and simply atmospheric, memorable scenes. Throughout the entire walkthrough, you never for a second leave the feeling that you are watching an Oscar-winning film. I have not experienced such a level of immersion from games for a long time. I would like to separately note the excellent dubbing, I take my hat off to the voice actors. Ellie and Joel themselves are certainly some of the brightest and most lively characters in the history of games. It is interesting to watch them, they react to every little thing and detail of the world around them, constantly interact with each other and comment on the environment. Each dialogue that the player can stumble upon completely by accident is written and worked out at the level of the main plot. Ellie herself does not feel like a dumb dunce crawling after the player. Throughout the game, it is interesting to watch her and her reaction to the player's actions or a specific situation. Although the gameplay feels simple and works on the principle of ""room with enemies - room with resources - repeat"", the gameplay itself is competently verified and does not get boring. I will also note the excellent work with the sound - pleasant sound of weapons, monsters, lively dialogues of opponents, and in general - the game has a very pleasant, well-developed **** also pleased - as a nice bonus to the finale of the game, it tells an interesting story filled with memorable, tragic, cute and atmospheric moments. But besides the pros, the game has a huge minus - a bad port to PC. For this great game you will have to pay with long loading times of 3-5 minutes, constant FPS drops and other delights of bad optimization. But still, a bad port does not cancel the fact that The Last of Us is one of the best and most inspiring games I have played, it gave a touching story that will hook everyone and leave a mark. Thanks to the developers for this wonderful experience! I highly recommend it."
mosaadjr,2025-01-08,100,"dunno know what else could've been done. For me, this can lowkey be the best game I've ever played. I've never been so immersed in a game like this and so excited to know what will happen. The story, the dialogues, the main and side characters—everything here was the closest I've seen to perfectionism. Simply a masterpiece."
basic12345,2024-12-31,90,"Many people rate this game bad just because of the price. But the game itself is still a very good remaster of the original game. If you dont like the price, just wait a few months."
ZzTopNemesis,2024-12-27,80,"Score: 8.8 One of the best stories i've experienced on a videogame Gameplay is very fun, can be **** tense at times The set pieces and environment are beautiful Voice performances are craaaaazy, this entire game puts most of Hollywood's movies/series to shame I can't wait to play part two and experience more time with Joel....... :'( Performance wise, i had no issues but i've played this i think more than 1 year after release on PC soo most of the issues other reviews reported have probably been fixed 100% recomended"
Vitaliy21,2024-11-25,100,"One of the best games I've ever played. Great story with immersive atmosphere. I think the first part is the best in the series. I really like the gameplay in the game, it's a really good system that makes the game more interesting. Of the shortcomings only bad otpimizatsiya on the PC, in principle, you can close your eyes to this, because the game was released on this platform for less than two years, I believe that soon the optimization will be made better. I highly recommend the game for the passage. A masterpiece!"

SSghost,2024-11-03,100,"Um dos meus jogos favoritos, a história é cativante do começo ao fim, fazendo a gente se ligar aos personagens e mostrando que não existe vilões ou herói, apenas sobreviventes"
imypabloxeonalv,2024-10-29,100,"A good remake of a awesome game, needed graphic enhancement, one of the best histories"
PurbleBuff,2024-10-24,10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
tapok_tv,2024-10-16,100,"Хорошей игре, хороший ремастер. Впервые сыграла на ps3, потом перепрошла на ps4, и на выходи прошла на ПК."
ddycide,2024-10-16,90,"За оптимизацию снизил, а так в целом НАСТОЯЩИЙ балл стоит на оригинале блин"
VladMakarov,2024-10-05,100,Bu oyun bir başyapıt. Hikayesi ve hikaye sunumunu beğendim. Müzikler şahane. Aksiyon mükemmel. Bu kadar düşük puan alması pc portunun optimizasyonunun bozuk olduğundan kaynaklıdır. Yeni gelen patchlerle git gide düzeltilir diye umuyorum. Kesinlikle oynayın derim.
antonsalogvinov,2024-10-04,90,"Наконец дошли руки до этой игры. Она действительно прекрасна, за исключением пары технических проблемок, которые мне встретились. Прошел залпом, сюжет и персонажи зацепили, бегать, стелсить, стреляться и собирать ресы тоже было интересно. Пока что лучший пс эксклюзив релизнутый на пека."
Ahmet147,2024-09-30,60,"the story is enjoyable and relaxing I finished the game 3 times, played for 60 hours, but the biggest problem for the pc side was the optimization, playing with the gtx 1650 was like a grind, I played without contraction through some programs, it was very nice for me that the game included a Turkish dub, but some scenes are very unnecessary, I think it's a waste of time"
ErayTellezi,2024-09-17,90,PS4 versiyonuna uzun uzun yorum yapmıştım. İyi grafiklerle bir kez daha oynamak istedim. Tabii ki aynı tadı vermedi hikayeyi bildiğim için. Ama hala destansı bir iş. Modern dönem trajedisi.
deividb01,2024-09-15,30,"Running out of memory! The game is still poorly optimized. As a game programmer, I know porting is hard, especially for PC. They've had enough time to get this game running properly. I feel quite disappointed."
LUKSlion,2024-09-11,100,"um dos jogos mais lindos mais cativantes e de melhor história que já joguei, tudo nele é bonito demais, desde os gráficos até os personagens e suas interações cada detalhe desse jogo é lindo de ver, incrível"
viqili,2024-09-03,90,The game gives us a magnificent linear story and graphics with good fighting mechanics.
Andante,2024-09-03,70,"The Last of Us Part 1 is a decent game. I am quiet hesitant with modern games because most of them disappoint me, but not this game. Its been a long time since a game managed to immerse me, make me want to play it and actually until the very end. While the game suffers a lot from the modern trend of making women and little girls appear like superheroes it still somehow managed to keep my interest and make me want to finish it. The game has overwhelming violence and tension and a dark feeling which may not appeal to some players but the overall presentation of this post apocalyptic world is satisfying and believable. The long silences and exploration sequences where you just search the environment and are unsure if someone waits for you in the next corner were some of the best moments of the game. The producers really know how to play with tension and this gives to the game an almost pure horror game quality. Unfortunately after the protagonist gets seriously injured the game makes a lot of mistakes. Turning this little girl lnto a psychopathic superhero and slaughtering groups of grown men was not my cup of tea...."
RodrigoKosteski,2024-09-02,100,Perfeito! Obra prima! Gostoso! Não tem o que dizer mais do que isso apenas joguem!
codeMustafa,2024-07-29,80,The Last Of Us 1 İn pc ye uyarlanmış remake versiyonu ortaya güzel bir iş çıkmış grafiklerden hoşnut olmayanlar remake versiyondan tatmin olabilirler optimizasyonuda fena değil.
Kuzya_Zeleniy,2024-07-21,90,"I saw a lot of positive reviews about this game. Therefore, I was really waiting for this game to be released on PC. I love Sony games, so I really wanted to try this. By the time the game hit Steam, it was unplayable. The game wouldn't even start. So I decided to wait. And now a year has passed since the release of the game on PC, and I decided to try again. This time the game started for me. But had to wait 2 hours for the shaders to load. And although these shaders take a long time to load, it's worth it. The graphics in the game are simply gorgeous. Design of characters, locations, perfectly expressed emotions on the faces of the characters. As if you are not playing a game, but watching a real movie. The plot here is not so creative, but it is told very well. The main characters, along with the secondary characters, are very charismatic. Even in the characters that appear in the game for a short time, the character, thoughts, and motives are perfectly depicted. The gameplay isn't that great though. The first half of the game made me bored, everything seemed very monotonous and just boring. But the second half of the game looks more intense. New ideas, new quests appear, and the game becomes interesting to play again. There are a lot of small details in the game that players don't always pay attention to. I can't even imagine how many sleepless nights the developers spent creating this. And after playing the game, I will not say that this game is a masterpiece for me. It is very good, with a great story, but at some points I was just bored. But that not takes away from this game's credit for what it brought to the world of video games."
Mixailch,2024-06-30,80,"Возможно, ненужный ремейк, но приятный и хороший способ открыть для себя шедевр."
Chatongarou,2024-06-20,100,"Malgré les critiques mitigé sur pc, j'ai attendu prés de 10 ans pour faire cette masterclass sur pc (le plaisir des joystick de la ps3 face à un claqueur) et à l'heure actuelle aucun problèmes graphiques, aucun crash, un jeux qui tourne en Ultra sans raytracing avec ma 2060 en 50 fps constant. Faite ce jeux par pitié"
psyGressiw,2024-06-18,40,"Where's the wow story everyone's talking about. It's flat, boring and predictable along with all the characters. Most of the time you hear generic bs about who and how much someone lost, and that someone's sorry. YAWN. 4/10 just for giraffes."
wxuua,2024-05-18,100,My God! It was the best game I've ever played. I completed it 3 times and did not regret the time spent. I will play through it over and over again until The Last of Us Part II comes out on PC.
B0RN,2024-04-20,90,"A masterpiece, it ran flawlessly from day one on my rtx 3070, no crash, it stuttered once, no bugs. Emotional story, combat mechanics are good, level design is good, characters are deep, definitely a must play game"
Alhn,2024-04-18,90,"TLOU game is a very beautiful game with fine details, but the main problem is that it is not optimized on the computer and there are a few bugs that can be solved in the above systems, and I can play it on I9 11900k RX 6800 xt Nitro plus ram 32 easily with I get the highest quality of 80 frames per second and I hope it will be optimized so that everyone can experience the masterpiece"
Dave321,2024-04-18,80,Great game and story but kinda expensive for a remaster i liked the gmeplay and mechanics are also good and easy to learn
LegionNSeven7,2024-04-07,0,"Um LIXO superestimado, não vão na onde de jornalecos e midia que se diz especializada. Jogo é bem merda."
Kipperfaust,2024-03-26,100,This is a masterpiece. The Last of Us is far and away superior to any other PlayStation first-party franchise they have ever put out.
Konstantinos77,2024-03-24,0,"Arcade - Adventures are the games that i love!! I'm gamer for over ~36 years!! Ok, nice graphics, sound, gameplay... But the story it's sooo Boring!!! A usual zombie story..."
Earlchaos,2024-03-17,70,"It's a great game but it also has it's flaws. Graphics looks great. Basically every area is a big tunnel. You cannot turn left or right, follow the path we laid out for you, if you like it or not. Which is a waste in my opinion while i'm aware, that it's not an open world game. There are no decisions to make, the story is also a tunnel, you have to follow it. The only decision you can do is if you want to use a shotgun, a rifle or a pistole. The game gets in moderate difficulty at least often unfair. You scan everything, walk through a door and bam you're swarmed by 5 enemies while you have 5 bullets. Overall the scarcity of ammo is really annoying. Almost every human you met unloads 2 mags onto you if you let them but if you loot them, you get a few shots. Really? And apart from that upgrade material is also scarce - whoever came up with the ideas for the animations when upgrading weapons really liked his animations and they're pushed onto you until you fall asleep. 5% more damage - ok, watch this 15s unskippable sequence of wiggle wiggle. 10% faster reload speed? Another 20s unskippable useless sequence. I get it, you want to give me a way to improve but the pills would've been enough. I have played with controller for 5 minutes but i can't stand this. Switched to keyboard and mouse as that's my preferred way in like 98% of the games (and 100% of shooters) but i can't aim straight for 2 seconds. My cursor is wiggling like a clicker and when i give it a little move it's like three meters off.. I got the game at a deal for 30€ (around 33$) so it's ok but i wouldn't have wanted to pay 70 bucks for it. I give the game 7.5 out of ten. It's good but could be much better if the creators didn't insist on making an interactive movie where the interaction is looting and shooting. P.S.: I didn't have any technical issues or crashes with my 2 year old computer with RTX3080 and Intel I9 10900K, lots of memory and SSDs, game runs decent for me. P.S.: I've learned more about the reason of the outbreak watching 10 minutes of making of than in 15 hours of my first playthrough (you probably need to deduct 30minutes for shaders building wtf.)"
k1erx,2024-03-15,100,"очень крутая и проработаная игра советуювсем пройтив игре очень хороший сюжет и геймплей, очень хорошая игра в стиле зомби"
xgdy,2024-03-14,80,"Story, gameplay - awesome but the optimization on older gpus like mine is honestly really bad."
gwynbleidd27,2024-02-24,100,"I have been waiting for this game to come on pc for a long time because of how much people talked about it. It usually ends in a disappointment in most games but not this one. I really loved this game, story is very interesting with very fun gameplay. Graphics and enviroments are insane, I have not faced any performance issues on my RTX 3060 (High settings with DLSS Quality). This is one of my favorite games, totally recommended!"
aitorsibo,2024-02-24,100,"My favourite game. Totally in love with the characters, Joel and Ellie and its relationship. Immersive, grounded world, exhilarating story full of love, terrific OST. Level design is to be praised. Beautiful environments. Stealth, combat and resource management are very grounded and may feel too simple for some. Simple and few abilities/weapons. Bad release on PC with lots of bugs but hopefully will get fixed over **** game is a rollercoaster of emotions, a must play."
Quidden,2024-02-22,50,"This assessment is due to the fact that the port on PC is not optimized at all, so much to fail the game, and please note a very good game, not the best in terms of story, mechanics, world, it takes **** general, 5 only because I liked the game itself, would be a really good port would be 7-9 pointsMy PC is not the weakest and so far I haven't found a game that would lag and work so badly, but TLOUp1 was the first.Translated with ****/Translator (free version)"
Rafky02,2024-02-21,100,Esto es un texto que necesito colocar para que el juego aparezca en mi perfil.
Jester87,2024-02-19,100,"I was very late to the party, never played it on console and didn't play it when it first released on pc. But have now played it through to completion on my pc twice and the additional ""left behind"" game content and I have to say, this is a masterpiece in visual story telling...I have been playing video games since the original arcades of the 80's and this is one of the best games I have ever played."
RustY420,2024-02-16,80,"The Last of Us Part I is an amazing game with a great story, nice graphics and AI. The gameplay starts to be boring after the 2 hours, of walking, sneaking, and doing puzzles. Either you push, carry a ladder or a plank, or look for a way. This game has one of the worst map designs. I constantly have to look for YouTube videos on proceeding with the game. And the sneaking is not fun in this game. The clickers are literally one shooting the player. They go near you and boom dead. When you drop a bottle to make the runners go away, they still see you after a while. Completely making that thing useless. It's been 2-2 and a half hour of gaming and im struggling to keep on going. I will because its an okay game. Overrated."
Washak,2024-02-15,100,Exceptional game. I have not felt drawn to a game like this after so many years of gaming. 10/10 Perhaps there were bugs once and therefore the bad ratings but I could not find many anymore. Kudos to Naughty Dog for bringing this for PC.
