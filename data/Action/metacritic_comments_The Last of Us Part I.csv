Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-03-16,"an incredible story, slow gameplay, really one of the best games in history for me"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-26,"few games put you in the shoes of a killer as efficiently and brutally as the last of us part i, where you play as two characters who kill hundreds of peopleboth guilty and innocentjust to survive. but despite being morally reprehensible, it's hard to deny that the game's technical execution is stunning, and the gameplay is highly satisfying. my rating"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-02-23,"gioco super deludente , avevo capito la storiail finale dopo 4 ore sinceramente. il gameplay  inesistente , stai in ginocchia tutto il tempo ...boh non vedo il piacere . non metto meno di 5 perch capisco che per una generazione che non abbia mai letto mezzo libro o che guarda solo tik tok  reality vari il gioco possa piacere !!!!"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-17,"the last of us part i, en iyi zombi oyunlarnda ilk 5'ime girer. joel ve ellie arasndaki ba, hikayenin her geen dakikasnda daha da artyor. oyunun sonu da dahil olmak zere beni kendine ok iyi balad. hikayede verilmek istenen duygu, ok iyi yanstlm. naughty dog'u tebrik ediyorum. hem trke dublaj yapan sayl irketlerden biri hem de ortaya koyduu i muazzam. ben sknt yaamasam da baz oyuncular oyunu oynarken optimizasyon sorunlar yaam. umarm bu sorunlar giderilmitir."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-14,"having completed the game, i can confidently say that even after so many years since its release, the last of us remains one of the strongest, deepest and most beautiful games. despite the fact that i watched the walkthrough when i was still a small schoolboy in the wild 2014, and i remember the whole plot perfectly well, the game caused a whole storm of different emotions and feelings. the last of us is incredibly cinematic beautiful cutscenes, amazing dialogues and animation of the characters both facial and animation of battles, movement, interaction with the environment, beautifully staged action, an amazing soundtrack and simply atmospheric, memorable scenes. throughout the entire walkthrough, you never for a second leave the feeling that you are watching an oscarwinning film. i have not experienced such a level of immersion from games for a long time. i would like to separately note the excellent dubbing, i take my hat off to the voice actors. ellie and joel themselves are certainly some of the brightest and most lively characters in the history of games. it is interesting to watch them, they react to every little thing and detail of the world around them, constantly interact with each other and comment on the environment. each dialogue that the player can stumble upon completely by accident is written and worked out at the level of the main plot. ellie herself does not feel like a dumb dunce crawling after the player. throughout the game, it is interesting to watch her and her reaction to the player's actions or a specific situation. although the gameplay feels simple and works on the principle of room with enemies  room with resources  repeat, the gameplay itself is competently verified and does not get boring. i will also note the excellent work with the sound  pleasant sound of weapons, monsters, lively dialogues of opponents, and in general  the game has a very pleasant, welldeveloped  also pleased  as a nice bonus to the finale of the game, it tells an interesting story filled with memorable, tragic, cute and atmospheric moments. but besides the pros, the game has a huge minus  a bad port to pc. for this great game you will have to pay with long loading times of 35 minutes, constant fps drops and other delights of bad optimization. but still, a bad port does not cancel the fact that the last of us is one of the best and most inspiring games i have played, it gave a touching story that will hook everyone and leave a mark. thanks to the developers for this wonderful experience! i highly recommend it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2025-01-08,"dunno know what else could've been done. for me, this can lowkey be the best game i've ever played. i've never been so immersed in a game like this and so excited to know what will happen. the story, the dialogues, the main and side characterseverything here was the closest i've seen to perfectionism. simply a masterpiece."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-31,"many people rate this game bad just because of the price. but the game itself is still a very good remaster of the original game. if you dont like the price, just wait a few months."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-12-27,"score 8.8 one of the best stories i've experienced on a videogame gameplay is very fun, can be  tense at times the set pieces and environment are beautiful voice performances are craaaaazy, this entire game puts most of hollywood's moviesseries to shame i can't wait to play part two and experience more time with joel....... ' performance wise, i had no issues but i've played this i think more than 1 year after release on pc soo most of the issues other reviews reported have probably been fixed 100 recomended"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-11-25,"one of the best games i've ever played. great story with immersive atmosphere. i think the first part is the best in the series. i really like the gameplay in the game, it's a really good system that makes the game more interesting. of the shortcomings only bad otpimizatsiya on the pc, in principle, you can close your eyes to this, because the game was released on this platform for less than two years, i believe that soon the optimization will be made better. i highly recommend the game for the passage. a masterpiece!"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-03,the game gives us a magnificent linear story and graphics with good fighting mechanics.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-09-03,"the last of us part 1 is a decent game. i am quiet hesitant with modern games because most of them disappoint me, but not this game. its been a long time since a game managed to immerse me, make me want to play it and actually until the very end. while the game suffers a lot from the modern trend of making women and little girls appear like superheroes it still somehow managed to keep my interest and make me want to finish it. the game has overwhelming violence and tension and a dark feeling which may not appeal to some players but the overall presentation of this post apocalyptic world is satisfying and believable. the long silences and exploration sequences where you just search the environment and are unsure if someone waits for you in the next corner were some of the best moments of the game. the producers really know how to play with tension and this gives to the game an almost pure horror game quality. unfortunately after the protagonist gets seriously injured the game makes a lot of mistakes. turning this little girl lnto a psychopathic superhero and slaughtering groups of grown men was not my cup of tea...."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-07-21,"i saw a lot of positive reviews about this game. therefore, i was really waiting for this game to be released on pc. i love sony games, so i really wanted to try this. by the time the game hit steam, it was unplayable. the game wouldn't even start. so i decided to wait. and now a year has passed since the release of the game on pc, and i decided to try again. this time the game started for me. but had to wait 2 hours for the shaders to load. and although these shaders take a long time to load, it's worth it. the graphics in the game are simply gorgeous. design of characters, locations, perfectly expressed emotions on the faces of the characters. as if you are not playing a game, but watching a real movie. the plot here is not so creative, but it is told very well. the main characters, along with the secondary characters, are very charismatic. even in the characters that appear in the game for a short time, the character, thoughts, and motives are perfectly depicted. the gameplay isn't that great though. the first half of the game made me bored, everything seemed very monotonous and just boring. but the second half of the game looks more intense. new ideas, new quests appear, and the game becomes interesting to play again. there are a lot of small details in the game that players don't always pay attention to. i can't even imagine how many sleepless nights the developers spent creating this. and after playing the game, i will not say that this game is a masterpiece for me. it is very good, with a great story, but at some points i was just bored. but that not takes away from this game's credit for what it brought to the world of video games."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-05-18,my god! it was the best game i've ever played. i completed it 3 times and did not regret the time spent. i will play through it over and over again until the last of us part ii comes out on pc.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-04-18,"tlou game is a very beautiful game with fine details, but the main problem is that it is not optimized on the computer and there are a few bugs that can be solved in the above systems, and i can play it on i9 11900k rx 6800 xt nitro plus ram 32 easily with i get the highest quality of 80 frames per second and i hope it will be optimized so that everyone can experience the masterpiece"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-26,this is a masterpiece. the last of us is far and away superior to any other playstation firstparty franchise they have ever put out.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-24,"arcade  adventures are the games that i love!! i'm gamer for over 36 years!! ok, nice graphics, sound, gameplay... but the story it's sooo boring!!! a usual zombie story..."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-03-17,"it's a great game but it also has it's flaws. graphics looks great. basically every area is a big tunnel. you cannot turn left or right, follow the path we laid out for you, if you like it or not. which is a waste in my opinion while i'm aware, that it's not an open world game. there are no decisions to make, the story is also a tunnel, you have to follow it. the only decision you can do is if you want to use a shotgun, a rifle or a pistole. the game gets in moderate difficulty at least often unfair. you scan everything, walk through a door and bam you're swarmed by 5 enemies while you have 5 bullets. overall the scarcity of ammo is really annoying. almost every human you met unloads 2 mags onto you if you let them but if you loot them, you get a few shots. really? and apart from that upgrade material is also scarce  whoever came up with the ideas for the animations when upgrading weapons really liked his animations and they're pushed onto you until you fall asleep. 5 more damage  ok, watch this 15s unskippable sequence of wiggle wiggle. 10 faster reload speed? another 20s unskippable useless sequence. i get it, you want to give me a way to improve but the pills would've been enough. i have played with controller for 5 minutes but i can't stand this. switched to keyboard and mouse as that's my preferred way in like 98 of the games and 100 of shooters but i can't aim straight for 2 seconds. my cursor is wiggling like a clicker and when i give it a little move it's like three meters off.. i got the game at a deal for 30 around 33 so it's ok but i wouldn't have wanted to pay 70 bucks for it. i give the game 7.5 out of ten. it's good but could be much better if the creators didn't insist on making an interactive movie where the interaction is looting and shooting. p.s. i didn't have any technical issues or crashes with my 2 year old computer with rtx3080 and intel i9 10900k, lots of memory and ssds, game runs decent for me. p.s. i've learned more about the reason of the outbreak watching 10 minutes of making of than in 15 hours of my first playthrough you probably need to deduct 30minutes for shaders building wtf."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-24,"my favourite game. totally in love with the characters, joel and ellie and its relationship. immersive, grounded world, exhilarating story full of love, terrific ost. level design is to be praised. beautiful environments. stealth, combat and resource management are very grounded and may feel too simple for some. simple and few abilitiesweapons. bad release on pc with lots of bugs but hopefully will get fixed over  game is a rollercoaster of emotions, a must play."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-22,"this assessment is due to the fact that the port on pc is not optimized at all, so much to fail the game, and please note a very good game, not the best in terms of story, mechanics, world, it takes  general, 5 only because i liked the game itself, would be a really good port would be 79 pointsmy pc is not the weakest and so far i haven't found a game that would lag and work so badly, but tloup1 was the first.translated with translator free version"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-16,"the last of us part i is an amazing game with a great story, nice graphics and ai. the gameplay starts to be boring after the 2 hours, of walking, sneaking, and doing puzzles. either you push, carry a ladder or a plank, or look for a way. this game has one of the worst map designs. i constantly have to look for youtube videos on proceeding with the game. and the sneaking is not fun in this game. the clickers are literally one shooting the player. they go near you and boom dead. when you drop a bottle to make the runners go away, they still see you after a while. completely making that thing useless. it's been 22 and a half hour of gaming and im struggling to keep on going. i will because its an okay game. overrated."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-15,exceptional game. i have not felt drawn to a game like this after so many years of gaming. 1010 perhaps there were bugs once and therefore the bad ratings but i could not find many anymore. kudos to naughty dog for bringing this for pc.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2024-02-11,"would have been an 8  8.5 without the technical stuff. first off this was my first time playing the game, and it was amazing. the story is great, the missions are fun and interesting and the environment is beautiful. this game definitely deserves its legendary status. however, im sick of publishers releasing betas as a finished product, and unfortunately, it has happened again. the port . while i was late enough to the party to not experience too many crashes only two, the game is still very poorly optimized. i dont have the most amazing pc, but its far above minimum requirements and had a really tough crunch running the game at lowest settings, with fsr i could at least turn them from very low to low. and thats just not the kind of polish for a game that costs as much as any brand new aaa game. i would love to see part 2 on pc. and i can recommend anyone play this game. however, maybe not when its not on sale. just as a little middle finger towards sony for the poor release"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-12-03,"story is meh, choice of characters is excellent, because characters are not, and that adds to the realism aspect. story is quite ordinary for a post apocalyptic zombie scenario but the story telling is oscar worthy. one of the best of all times. the animations, face mimics and easily ignorable or insignificant details in the game have really been worked on and cared with such love, even that alone makes me drop a tear. but i am so sick of people getting offended by things, and rights and drawing attention to minorities and stuff, it just disgusts me. that entirely defecates on the great experience this game offers. if you are gonna take attention to something go do it the right way, not in a game. this is so meaningless and frustrating. i won't say what it is so review doesn't contain spoilers, but it is complete nonsense. like a girl's biggest problem is her breast size in a post apocalyptic world. or a man's problem is he is uncomfortable around girls while he hasn't even seen a single girl in 15 years. i don't hate it, but enough is enough, leave such stuff out of the innocent games."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-30,"it's a very quality realistic dramatic game of postapocalypse time and the start of it. with settings that allow you to play unfair grounded  tactics stealth survival action shooter or very simply just shoot everyone and finish the game. in terms of gameplay, combat, timings, the characters obedience to the player in all situations, plus the settings for all of this that are in the game  the game is ideal for today and the developers should learn from this game  extremely plausible, fair, comfortable, easy control, camera, aim, combat, actions, movements, walking, running, realistic and at the same time fast, not meticulous and high quality, based on the players skills, and not on replaying and healing potions, using what you come across, some bricks, bottles, various cold and hot weapons with limited ammunition. various unusual locations, such as flooded semidestroyed buildings, etc., and tasty puzzles. the graphics, realistic proportions of the environment, facial animations and movements, atmosphere, approach, characters, english voice acting and gameplay are a masterpiece. games like this are very rare. there are many mistakes too even on easy difficulty not perfect game unlike tomb raider trilogy u dnt hv adjust, no dodge, many places unfairly take damage because of the aim, etc. it is clear that the first difficulties or the decrease in the accuracy of enemies and the ability to surround you are the only option that is realistic and fair play towards you. a game you want to play again. convenient frequent saving and ng. but in terms of the plot  emotions, cutscenes are rather weak, not enough. i didnt feel at all that they had crossed the whole country and gone through a lot together, i felt that a couple of days had passed. plus agendas in the game, immoral moves, mistakes, for example, the zombie problem is not dangerous at all, it is unclear why they have an apocalypse. it was stupid that joel didnt tell her the truth, he would have told her and correctly explained how it is  that you cant kill for the sake of another, that it is unlikely that a vaccine will be made, that you need to look for other solutions. amazing soundtrack but the sound can also be made better, it is not immersive like in daymare 1994 2023 for example. technical part  there are slideshows in the game as if the location is loading and requires dlss for 60 fps due to insufficient optimization. the pc version is necessary if you have a large screen 70, true 4k resolution is necessary in the game, i dont know this for 55 but 65 you need pc version. on ps5, dont look at what sony writes on their boxes, most of the games there is a maximum of 2k, look bad even on small screens, and its impossible to play at 30 fps, so its not even 2k, but often 720p on 60 fps. optimization... it works well, but the requirements are too high. shader compilation happens again if you haven't launched the game for several days. its a huge disadvantage that this compilation exists at all. there is also fsr which works on all video cards and dlss, they add about 20 fps, but the image is not exactly the same 100. that is, dlss and fsr are not real, why do i need them if i can lower the resolution anyway? the second part, on ps5, is an emotional trap where i think the developer disrespected the fans and did something that should not have been done, and besides, he replaced the plot with a very stupid plot without any connection even to disrespect and cruelty to the fans and thats why the second part is simply very boring and annoying. the problem began much earlier, the author's thinking, in the part 1, in the main plot with strange ideas, mistakes as i wrote and in the dlc, in which they inserted a strange agenda and glued together other episodes as manipulation. if you take my character, the hero, the essence of the series and throw it in the trash, then why and how would i play this game or watch this movie? why watch spiderman 2 without spiderman? this is extremely stupid and cruel. people came to play, have fun, to get something useful, and not to be tortured like that. and in the case of the second part of this game, this, to put it mildly, does not work. the second part is an aggressive, undisguised manipulation, and not a plausible realistic tragedy genre which is perceived normally. a shame. and force you to believe the wrong things, force you to love characters that are impossible to love, they are not interesting, bad and stupid. and i repeat, why hurt people who came to play your game? if you really want to get into drama, then do it without hurting people, and besides, they paid money for the game and there is a very quality gameplay. you force them to endure this disgusting script. the question at the end of the first part is actually very simple, joel did everything right. the fact that abby is an antagonist is simple, which also looks very unpleasant even harmful, why play as an antagonist a 5000 limit gamespot s."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-19,"30 mins for shaders esch start, freezing every 2 mins, crashes and restart pc every attempt to playclose. i'm sure that the plot is immersive and game good to play, if only i could play it. to play it is not enough a rtx 4070 and a last gen cpu. dements dev"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-11-02,this game is a mediocorely mess 5 of out 10.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-20,"jugue la versin de pc desde salida y era injugable, pero ahora que te metes es perfectamente disfrutable de principio a fin, le doy 7 sobre 10 porque debio de haber sido as desde el da 1, los desarrolladores tuvieron un montn de tiempo para sacar un buen port y no fue el caso."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-19,"es uno de los mejores videojuegos de la historia, eso sin duda. pero el miserable trato que le dieron el port a pc hace que le baje nota. obviando eso, los grficos, escenarios, historia y su desarrollo de personajes hacen que todo lo malo del port a pc lo ignore completamente. la perdida de joel y como este le sigue afectando tras los aos te hace empatizar con el personaje y sus acciones. repito, uno de los mejores videojuegos que he jugado."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-17,the game is very linear and too repetitive it gets boring in the latter part.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-15,"game completely bugged, practically unplayable. the media, which always favors sony, relieves it and keeps making excuses. but, if it was a microsoft exclusive game, the media would be rating the game as very bad!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-13,"este juego lo jugu en su versin original de ps3 y no lo he vuelto tocar hasta ahora que sali el remake en pc, es cierto que es un remake que no es necesario teniendo un remaster de ps4 que ya se ve muy bien pero es verdad que le sienta muy bien a este juego, las caras se ven espectacular, prcticamente igual que al nivel del tlou parte 2. el tema gameplay la ia sigue siendo la misma de ps3, lo cual es un punto malo ah, al menos yo no he notado una mejora respecto a dicha versin, el gameplay es el mismo tambin pero sigue siendo igual de satisfactorio y disfrutable que el original, se hubiese agradecido que le hubiesen puesto detalles de la parte 2. el tema de bugs en mi caso he esperado un tiempo a que lo arreglasen para comprarlo y mi experiencia ha sido muy buena, 0 bugs y de rendimiento ha ido muy fino. si no lo has jugado nunca y tienes un pc que lo corra bien, merece muchsimo la pena, es muy fiel al original."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-13,its amazing game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-13,"six months after release and it still takes you 20 minutes to be able to play after installation because the damn game has to compile shaders. hey devs, what if you compile god damn shaders during installation? performance is terrible and game looks like  on older hardware, and somehow i feel nausea while playing because the camera scrolling around feels weird. ugh. i waited a decade to play tlou in my pc to get this as a reward and wase my hardearned money."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-13,great game
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-10-05,the best video game story ever created and probably the best game ever
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-23,optimizasyon problemini saymazsak mthi oyun
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-21,"it's a game with the worst optimization i've ever seen. the story is really good but it can't be played on the computer due to fps drops, only buy it if you have a playstation otherwise you will regret it."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-18,the pc port is still pretty messed up months after release i can definitely run the game but it uses up an insane amount of memory and i have a pc that is more than capable of running it at atleast 75 fps with maybe 60 ram usage but it uses up 100 ram and runs at an average of 45 fps
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-07,"the release of this masterpiece on pc has been a disappointment. people have experienced a lot of crashes, bugs and optimization issues. i feel like a bad port messed up everything but they have been working on it and i feel like the game runs better now. the last of us itself is full of emotions, beautiful graphics, awesome story and memorable journey that will always have a special place in my heart."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-09-06,"great graphics, detailed landscape designe, and animations, smart ai behaviour, meaty combats, lots of weapon, loot system. slight upgrages  all of these are making the game for me but too bad that there's much less of a story and action gameplay than just wandering around through or beyond the obstacles. its boring, too low paced and there are not a lot of interesting dialogues between the characters while you're going and going. the walking dead tv series had so much more in the story that this game can't overcome to impress any more."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-29,"there are two good things about remakes. you can play the game as you remembered it and you can introduce new generations to masterpieces and i think this release does both things really well. graphics and physics are great, story is superb, ai and repetitiveness of fights later on are getting boring."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-23,"played day one on playstation 3, replayed on playstation 4 with the remastered and finally decided to get the remake on pc as well. despite playing it on day one and despite several technical issues plaguing the pc version upon release, i had no problems finishing it for two reasons. first i have a highend pc  rtx 3080ti  i7 11700k  32gb of ram . second i let the shader load finish before starting it, which a lot of people didn't. that said, the situation today is quite different, the game has received several fixes and currently has no problems. i give it a 9 only because part 2 exists which as far as i'm concerned is superior in everything. if you haven't played it, get it back, whether it's ps5 or pc, the last of us part 1 is a masterpiece."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-18,even tho the game was published on with issues now it works great. its one of the games that gave me difficult feelings and vibes. i was easily taken into the story and it felt like im in their world. words arent enough to explain how great story the game contains.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-14,"yeah, that game was horrible when it came out on pc. it is good now though. for me the last of us is one of the best games ever made, and is amazing to see it on my favourite platform."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-14,
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-13,"i am running with the following specs intel i78700, nvidia geforce rtx 2070, and did not encounter any performance issues up until now. the content of the game is amazing, especially the movement and voice acting is superb if you ask me"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-05,played with the 1.1.0.0. and 3070. somewhat playable at not so high settings. the real pro of this game is it's story. combat is average and i really hate the limited supply of ammo while enemies have infinite ammo. they also rarely drops ammo when killed.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-05,"i liked the story, the beautiful world with attention to detail, the designers really put effort into it. enhanced by pleasant music and nice ambient sounds. i'm not a fan of stealth, and it's a shame that due to the lack of ammo, a more direct approach wasn't possible, but i understand it's for the sake of the story. over time, it started to bother me to search through empty rooms just to find 2 bullets. i actually grew fond of joel, but ellie was too foulmouthed for my taste. if 14yearolds behave like that in the usa, then god help them. i'm not sure if i missed some bestiary, but i would have liked more explanation about the mutants. even considering the state of the world, i missed at least one positive character. the technical state was dreadful. first, it took over an hour to compile shaders. it probably didn't handle ram well because after a while, the game started lagging, and i had to restart it. also, it's quite audacious to charge a full price for a 10yearold game in such a condition."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-08-02,"well after a lot of patches and with still bad performance i finally played the game, its a good game. the story is good, the gameplay is fine. it has some good moments but this game is nowhere near of best game ever or masterpiece that its fans claimed all these years just like they do with every ps game. the where is the ladder or take me to the other side gets old very quick but since is not a long game i guess is not that bad. there are no puzzles and lacks enemy variety. instead of doing all those weapon upgrades customization they should have put more effort into that especially since this is a remake and they could have made the game a far lot better instead of just a graphics upgrade."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-29,"aps lanarem varios patchs de correes de bugs e otimazao o jogo se encontra excelente para jogar, levei 20 horas para zerar o jogo e a dlc e gostei muito, que venha a parte 2 agora."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-25,iiiiiiiiii game score  85 iiiiiiiiii
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-24,"good game, ran pretty descent on my old 1080 ti in 1440p with fsr but nowdays on 3080 ti it just flies on max details and graphics are pretty amazing. story, atmosphere and gameplay are solid and the game is enjoyable. cant wait for part 2"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-19,"even without the horrible performance issues, the game just... isn't that good? it would make a great movie or tv show imagine that! but the actual game parts of the game . the graphics are amazing and detailed, the characters and dialogue and story are intriguing, but it all keeps getting interrupted by a completely runofthemill cover shooter with some stealth elements. there is only 1 part in the game i would even consider a boss fight, and it's nowhere near the end of the game. there are no puzzles, unless you count there's a ledge you can't reach, find the ladder conveniently placed somewhere nearby to continue as a puzzle, because there about a dozen of those. when the gameplay  is the worst part of the game, it gets a low score from me no matter how good the rest might be. after hearing for years about what a masterpiece this game was, and finally being able to play it for myself i've never owned a playstation it did not live up to the hype at all."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-15,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-07-02,the game itself is a masterpiece but on pc i had some problems like crashes lagging textures and it was very often at the start
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-30,"as of patch 1.1 the game is running great on max settings 1080p ultra with a 8gb vid card. sadly they had a bad launch, i got the game from buying an amd card and i started playing on the 1.1 version of the game. shaders are a pain but it only takes 13 mins. the game is gorgeous, gameplay is better than tlou2 on ps5. if you want to experience tlou1 or reexperience it with godly graphics and gameplay, it's the best way to do it. 1010. way better than tlou2."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-27,un lancement assez difficile sur pc avec une optimisation dsastreuse qui a rendu mon exprience sur ce portage assez mitig. pourtant j'ai tout de mme apprcier mon aventure avec joel et ellie.  graphiquement une merveille.  histoire trs prenante.  gameplay plutt sympa. malgr l'optimisation j'ai termin le jeux et j'ai ador l'univers. malheureusement le portage pc est catastrophique au niveau de l'optimisation. j'espre que la 2me partie sera mieux travaill.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-26,"such a great story,gameplay and  play the game was a pain when it was first released but fixed after a week or  best zombie themed game ever"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-24,"i refunded when i first bought a few months ago. i bought again a couple days back and so far it plays fine, the june patch seems to have worked great. shader cache didn't take as long as i thought it would. graphics are beautiful and it plays smoothly on my system, only jitters during loading screens or sections which is normal. made it through quite a few sections on grounded which means lots of restarting checkpoints and dying for me, but no crashes so far. i'll update when i'm done with the experience, but i just wish it were released in this condition in the first place! why didn't they just delay it three months?!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-24,"i will list my pros  and cons  separately. disclaimer, the game has been patched many times. the review will reflect on the game on at the time its latest version. pros  same good story, now with even better visuals.  atmosphere in the game is top notch.  soundtrack is excellent.  voice acting is top notch. cons  i expected more gameplay improvements  the performance on pc still needs some work but it is greatly improved over the launch! so if you have the game and have not played it after launch, give it a try."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-21,"this game is worse than tomb raider by a mile. it's worse than days gone even. the only reason people praise this game is because it baits you into feeling sad? see this person? what if they were real nice, and then we killed them. woah. amazing. go kill zombies. deep"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-18,broken port. the game was full of bugs and glitches on release day. performance issues.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-14,"talking about survival story . it is very important to craft weaponry by yourself , but this game is just like fool me around like treating child . of course you can reload faster 50 by cleaning barrel with rag . the game is normally playable but not good enough . i can feel the battle phrase like playing turnbase game . it is satisfied to see ellie has her girlfriend ."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-10,"70 for a game that takes 3090 minutes to build the shader. so far, every patch has required a full rebuild, as well. i have 5 hours playtime on steam and over half of that has been spent waiting at the main menu for the shader to build. support says it's a known issue but say nothing about whether they're actually going to fix it. the framerate also swings wildly 20 to 100 fps, even in static scenes. eventually, this game may be worth recommending. given that iron galaxy are also partially responsible for fallout 76 and arkham knight, though, i wouldn't bet on that happening any time soon."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-10,"poor optimization for pc , you can not get smooth 60 fps all the time in 1080p with rtx 3070 , the game vram usage is insane if you use higher streaming quality , the game updates are almost trash and didn't fix issues as much as their should game itself is very good, gameplay , gunplay and story were great i could rate 89 if the game didn't have optimization issues"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-09,"gameplay tlou  2ps5 it's a welldeserved masterpiece,a perfect combination of performance,gameplay and narrative. compared with the drama version,the emotion of the story created through blank space is more subtle and undiminished. tlou proofs that cinematic games are undoubtedly a feasible  this route,i think it is not only better than detroit but also better than games such as death stranding. despite any negative opinions, it is important for sony to remain in existence. i really want to play 2, make a wish and go out and pick up a ps5."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-08,"yes, for game rendering time, minus 2 points. very good game just like the original."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-04,"based on the gameplay, graphics, sound, content, and originality of the game, i will give it a rating of 10."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-06-03,"this game is probably top 3 of the most beatiful game i have played on pc. the story and characters are great. the atmosphere is awsome. i love the game from the beginning to the end. the only thing is that this game require a monster of a computer, but if you have it you can enjoy this game as it should be."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-25,"so many people worked on this game, so much money, the rating because of that should be aaaaaaaaaa but the quaiity is like cybescam2077 or even worse. it deserves more hate than everything else for lase few years. this is so very bad made game, who cars that is has less bugs on ps5. it is still supercrap."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-23,good the character writing is phenomenal some of the locations look amazing on pc. bad performance issues make it unplayable the shader caching process takes a long time to complete. thoughts the last of us is a critically acclaimed title across three generations of hardware and its disappointing to see the current state of the pc version. heres hoping that the developers get their act together and fix the game in the future.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-18,"i5 10gen  16gb  rtx 3060 and 1.0.5 game version. these guys from iron galaxy have done it again, yes sir, incredible but true. i can not understand why naughty crew is still working with this people after the uncharted 4 disaster. very poor performance considering that this is a game from more than 10 years ago, only with new beautiful skins. i usually play heavy games on highultra without any problem atomic heart, valhalla, rdr2, etc. and the real point here is not that i have to play it at 3040 fps, it's not that dramatic to imagine that i have an old console instead of a decent computer, the really annoying thing are the sudden drops during epic cinematic sequences. simply unacceptable for the price it costs."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-17,i have never seen a game that looks good as this its  beautiful. performance is a mess but sill i get around 60 fps with a 6600 at high settings game is very cpu bounded. story is amazing
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-14,"man... this game hits you hard. i was not expecting such a deep plot. the character's development is really impressive. the script uses all elements of cinema and gaming to reach its point. also, the improved facial expressions due to its new engine elevate the details expressed by the acting. obviously, it won't matter if the overall direction is not that good. i loved the dialog and was really into it. feel so real that everything looks unclear  in a surprising way. the graphics are amazing. i was getting impressed almost every time, due to the art direction in the streets or the expressions. water, grass, sky, and textures, and more aligned with the audio design, adding a lot to the atmosphere factor. the gameplay could be a little better since the dual sense controller's sensitivity was a little slow. but i liked the challenge overall since you must learn how to be stealthy to mitigate ammo. anyway, i highly recommend it. but be aware. the pc port is not good right now. i did not consider it in that score, which would reduce it significantly."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-14,encore un portage foireux sur pc

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-08,"one of the greatest games of all time gets completely  on with a lot of fails, glitches, crashes, and general shenanigans. but if you have a good pc, it works the best. edit even with the best pcs, it is still a legit mess."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-07,"i really enjoyed this title, had to wait a few patches but now runs great on my rig. so glad it got ported over, i couldnt justify buying a whole console for one game."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-07,una mierda de optimizacin un lo que es bueno no se toca porque siempre lo daan
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-07,"let's talk about the whole game's performance first. without the patches, this game was a complete mess. i could not play it at all. every minute there was a please wait loading screen. cpu was 100 all the time even after lowering cpuintensive settings. it wasn't enjoyable. but when the 4.0 patch came in, it became very stable to the point of being playable. not super smooth but playable. i completed the game at that patch. please wait loading screen was there but not every minute. it showed up maybe once every hour. cpu did not reach 100 in this patch. rather capped at 90. it was good enough. surprisingly i did not face any bugs in this game. now about the game... damn, the story is  good. like holy fk. did not expect the story to crawl up like that. did not see it coming. for the first few hours, i was not able to connect to the story. it felt like i was just shooting people without any context. but then something happened and i was hooked for good. the combat was really good. really liked the stealth mechanic in this game. crafting felt real and needed. everything according to me felt aaa. i enjoyed it. i hope people can get past this bad port optimization and enjoy this brilliant story of a dad and daughter."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-05,"this is a review of version 1.0.4.1 on my pc r5 3600, rx 5700 xt. i was surprised to find out that my pc is exactly the recommended specs on steam. the shaders take about 45 minutes to prepare. then begins the nightmare it stutters like hell, although i'm running 1080p with fsr 2.0 performance mode. when you are fighting zombies, if you turn the camera, it will hiccup and you lose your bearing, then get killed. that is only half the misery, every time when i start the game, it takes up to 10 minutes on the loading screen. it's definitely in an unplayable state. and don't trust the positive reviews on steam, because obviously sony fanboys heard about the game's failure on pc, and they come to the rescue, with a lot of them leaving a cultish praising review for the game after merely 2 hours of play. tse tse. sony tried to block microsoft's activision acquisition because sony is afraid that microsoft may deliberately make the ps version of cod worse so people will rush to buy an xbox. i have an urge to buy a ps version of tlou right now, is this what you meant, sony scumbags?"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-02,"such disappointment the ruined the game ,bad graphics, lot of bugs , glitches taking forever to load shaders and taking so much memory from gpu bad optimized and they put it 60 game lol rip modern gaming most of games released as cyberpunk!"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-02,"the worst game ever, as long as it is iron galaxy then it . sony should be ashamed to themselves for not using its own port company nixxes. what an irony messing this flagship and ip on a bad and incompetent company like iron galaxy. sony you deserve this. congratfulations."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-02,"i had been waiting for a pc port for a long time, since i had never had the chance to play the game. i was very hyped. unfortunately, i encountered a lot of bugs while playing. i have a midend pc that can run most games in high or ultra quality but this game just eats up all the vram and the optimization is terrible... had to play it with very low settings and it worsened the experience."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-05-01,"quick edit the game no longer wants to run on my pc, basically crashes all the time now, very cool, yeah this is a bad port so i' will be decreasing the rating, i don't care if naughty dog fixes everything, my review will now represent the state that it is from when i have lost interest in trying to run this game. you are at a 310 now, congratulations. it only gets a 3 because i played through some of the content. i leave first impressions below i finally got to play the remake of the last of us on pc to see the juicy graphics and enhanced gameplay. i played the last of us on the ps3, the remastered on ps4, and now we are at the remake. i have to say, this is the worst port to pc i have ever seen, the game stutters for me a lot, i am yet to see any crashes, and the shader compilation took over 2 hours?! my specs  ryzen 5 3600  16gb ddr4  hdd  rtx 3060 12g i tested the game  1440p and 1080p with dlss on all quality modes, on high graphics, it runs at 60fps but can't maintain a constant locked framerate, and stutters a lot, especially during combat sections. as for the price, there is no reason for this game to be full price, if you're going to buy this, don't. wait 6 months, and make sure your pc is beefed up. i'd pay around 30 for a game that was already released 10 years ago with fancy graphics, and no multiplayer. the enhancements of this game are pretty poor for a remake, joel may be old but give the man a dodge mechanic. i expected that to be added because damn it's pretty tough to play after being exposed to part 2s mechanics. yes, yes crafting table, whatever, it's just a flashy weapon upgrade screen. clearly, sony, naughty dog and iron galaxy did not test this game properly or at all and decided to take shortcuts. i love playstation games, but this port hurts a lot, especially towards pc players. i want more ports from sony but if they are going to be like this, i don't want them, i'd rather not waste my time and not support them. it's a 610, somewhat playable, but with bad stuttering at least for me, no multiplayer, and no actual or useful enhancements. a 610 in my book means you don't need to get this immediately, just wait for a sale on steam. how the mighty, have fallen. personal message to playstation if an employee ever reads this you guys make good games, i've been a fan for more than 15 years but from what i've seen recently you have forgotten that quality is better than quantity. while yes you have delivered good ports of other games so far, the last of us is one of your biggest properties and should have been polished from day one. one day i hope to work for playstation but if this is going to be the direction you'll be taking, shortcuts, following trends and making poor decisions, i would say i'm better off at ea or ubisoft. good luck and happy developing, also please give us a bloodborne remake, and a demon souls port, it is time."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-30,sadly another pc port that suffers no end of performance problems. both iron galaxy and naughty dog are responsible for this rushed out abomination  game which chugs and splutters on modern hardware if you can get that far without it crashing for the millionth time!. they should hang their heads in shame for the lack of any quality control and appeasing their shareholder overlords instead of releasing a finished product. shame!
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-30,"don't waste your money. this game is the remastered of the remastered, not a remake. the pc port is terrible, under 60 fps with a 4090 and a lot of bugs. save your money."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-27,"el juego en si es buenisimo, lo terriblemente asqueroso es la optimizacion, es injugable, incluso despues de dos parches sigue estando horrible, con una rx 6650 xt simplemente no se puede tener una buena experiencia. minimo supongo debes de tener una 4070, 32gb de ram y tenerlo instalado en un m.2 si no, vas a sufrir mucho."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-25,"i liked this game. the story is very good. the dialogues are very powerful. the gameplay is good but it is little bit old. i expected to add more mechanics but it is like the old  optimization is horrible. graphics are meh. this game has a lot of walking. after the first half, you feels like you are in the walking simulator. but in the summary, this game is good for the other games. but you need to know that this is an old game and this is maded by people who don't have a playstation."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-25,"my pc fans are literally crying and sometime i felt my pc will blast. when i touched my pc it was heating like begging me to switch to different game. pc specs  mb  z590, core i9, 32gb ram, rtx 3070ti, gen4 ssd wd850, 4k 144hz monitor what is this game a conspiracy between pc hardware seller and game developer after shaders installation which took 1 hour i turned down the resolution to 1440p and game was lagging really bad with constant fps drop to almost 10fps i had to turn off this game to save my system tbh and i am so afraid to run it again edit  uninstalled the game"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-25,"my computer is by no means bad, although its far from the kind of beasts some people here are running, and i expected to play the game on medium settings. however when i started up the game it started loading shaders, and slowly but surely my computer caught fire and eventually exploded. having awoken from the explosion induced coma, i took another look at the computer which miraculously survived, and the shaders were still loading. at least the eventual and unavoidable crash was some kind of change to the circumstances. the game is a 1010 the port is a 010 i guess that makes a 510? or would i be dividing by zero? in any case, i recommend this game to my future self, not my present self."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-25,"i'm giving this game 310 because of its poor performance . to this day they still haven't fixed the memory leak issue and the high cpu, gpu usage. if you hate your hardware so much and want to grill your pc, then play this game . it's so sad because the game is not bad but the optimization kills any hope for me to play this bad pc port."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-21,the game made me create metacritic account. this game taught me that such a best story can become an  game with   optimization.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-20,"im just through the whole game and im glad that its over. i really cant understand all the praising for the game. maybe it was an okay game when it released but the story is really bad, gameplay is what i would expect from an older game. the only good thing was the graphics. highly overrated game."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-18,"terrible technical condition of the game. it is simply impossible to play when the fps suddenly drops from 60 to 5 and does not recover. i have to restart the game, but after a few minutes the fps drops again. several released patches do not fix the situation, but only make it worse. just a mediocre team of complete bums did the porting of the game."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-17,"it's a clumsy port, but honestly guys, this outrage over the optimization has gone too far and all in all, it's a completely bearable experience for the pc users to experience the legendary game. the game, after some 15 hours in, crashed twice, what is not such a terrible record. my feeling is that the video settings is a bit too detailed and complicated, and most of all the presets are a bit overstated. indeed it feels bad if you have a 3070 rtx laptop with 8gb where most of the games play well on highultra, but tlou requires you to put tweak all down to medium to get a playable experience. and some details aside, it still looks and feels pretty good. i guess the optimization of all game should think more about running fluidly on midrange machines than to get all the possible visual thrills at 4090."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-16,"a great game, but a disastrously bad and unacceptable pc port. unfortunately there is still no improvement."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-15,"a lot of the initial bugs were fixed now. i can play the game without it crashing. however, as my first play through of the last of us, i feel it is extremely overrated. it happens to be an amazing story that happens to be an annoying and dated gameplay between cutscenes. stick to the tv show. you'll get the amazing story without the weird gameplay."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-15,"ah yes the game that has tlou r and tlou ii assets into the tlou ii engine and has a 60 price tag like it is a brand new game and that's for the ps5 version, now talking about the atrocious pc port, the worst of its kind, asking for a 4080 when the ps5 igpu is barely a freaking gtx 1070 with ray tracing, dont buy this pile of trash, people out there already fixed a lot of the issues in day 1 that naughty dog is still trying to fix to this day"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-15,"this game deserves an absolute zero. absolute zero. zero, zero, zero! this is a game that you may not be able to actually run at all. not only that, it is adept at freezing your entire pc. you either won't run it or crash all the time. the game is an absolute trash heap. if you have an 6600, 6600xt or 6650xt, the game cannot run and will freeze your system. some users blame the hardware of others, even though the game may not run if you have a 4090 in some cases. the game also can crash steam because it has a bug with steam overlay disable steam overlay if you can get it to run but crash alot and see if it helps. there really are no words. i got the game for free with my amd gpu and i paid too much for it. metacritic better not purge valid criticism of the game. tldr the game literally does not run. run, do not buy."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-11,"the good the tlou remaster comes to pc the bad it is full of errors, bugs and crashes. there are texture loading glitches, there are polygon collision glitches. there are pop uppopping problems. they already have 5 patches and they fix some bugs and accidentally or on purpose create other bugs. in medium pc configurations it is not recommended although the requirements and compatibility table seems to be wrong. it is noticeable that they wanted to squeeze the success of the tv series with a very hasty port the meh! if they didn't want to release this game on pc they shouldn't have forced or tried to push the matter forward. it is seen that in this port they put their hands a lot because releasing patches to fix something and damaging other parts is not normal. there is a selfsabotage or a hint of doubt of wanting to do it wrong on purpose to make pcs feel bad. this game costs real money and is in very bad shape, you should take it out of the store"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-10,"ps45 reviews overhyped  runs ok on older pc  don't watch hbo show all the hate aout pc performance is unwarranted. my older i710750h, rtx 2040 and 16gb ram runs it well enough with just one crash. the worldstorycharacters are good but not the over 9.2 users here gave it. it's depressing from beginning to end. i watched the hbo series before playing and it spoiled the story but it was still fun."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-10,i can't agree with the 0 score reviews. i played the game with a 4gb geforce gtx 1050 ti in hd resolution windowed mode. only at some maps i had performance problems but in the end it's more like a movie than a game so you can't miss anything. once i played it on a ps4 i bought the ps4 just for this game but i don't like to play with a controller so i was curious to see how it works on a pc with keyboard and mouse and it works. the game play though was getting old. when it was released on ps3 in 2013 it was ground breaking but now you see it can be done better. now i want to have influence on the story but here the game fails. this could have been changed to make it more interesting. stop whining and trust sony  naughty dog to release more bug fixes as they always do. blame yourself for buying a game before it is stable. for me it was stable enough and i care more for the game play than latest visual effects i wouldn't play pixelized games though. i can only complain about the sound effects where i had only stereo on my 5.1 surround system.
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-09,"worst pc port ever made for an expensive but cheaply made remake of a ps3 game. after several patches it still suffers from crashes, has memory leaks, bad performance, lost steamdeck support, etc. naughty dog  sony should be embarrassed."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-09,"to be honest, you shouldn't be allowed to review unless you played it. i get that people are still having issues but i didn't have any, at all. same with steam reviews, most negative ones are people that played less than 3 hours. wait for the patches guys. the remake is astounding with new gui, new models, reworked environments. i just hope nd tank the negativity until the game is patched and nvidia pull their pants up. 1010 absolute masterpiece"

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-06,"most overrated game of all time? unless you're a cod gamer or a female who has never experienced good games before, this is just as average as it gets. after finishing it again now i was left with the same thoughts as when i first played it like 10 years ago, is there a single arc i enjoyed in it? most of it is just a hassle, which it is designed to be, but aside from nice graphics and somewhat good cutscenes it's just all negative. the combat is decent, the graphics are nice though it runs pretty bad, barely 100 fps on mostly high 4070ti, 13600k. the story is above average but it's very obvious as well as negative, too negative, uneccessarily so. if you compare this is days gone i don't know anyone in their right mind who would pick this over the other. same setting, zombies, drama, open world in dg, better graphics in dg, endlessly more quest and content in dg, far more twisting story in dg and much more advanced combat. this game is probably worth to play, but to say its anything more than that says more of you as a socalled gamer lets try to be objective at least, this is not a 010 because of glitches and whatnot i didn't have any, it's not a 1010, it's slightly better than average i think most would agree so giving it a 6.510 btw, the hbo series is trash. the price should be 20 usd."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-06,"of course, we all understand that beta testing on consoles was not in vain! sony loves pc players very much and has taken optimization issues very seriously! no, but seriously, they sold the original game, they sold the remaster, it's time to make money on the pc. but could you make an effort? the game is not just poorly optimized, but made so poorly that the recommended system requirements are at the minimum level! plus, it crashes all the time! we hope that talented game crackers will come up with something with optimization! it's better not to expect anything from sony, it's useless..."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-06,"absolute masterpiece, dont listen to those who complain, i just waited for the shaders to compile less than 1 hour before starting a new game and thats it. no crashes, no visual bugs. the game runs at stable 60 fps on max settings on my relatively old 2019 pc. but of course that's all secondary, the main aspects of this game are the story and the visuals, and they are of the highest calibre. literally the first game in years that i can't stop playing after many hours in a row. i cannot believe how much i, as a pc gamer, have been missing all this time."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-03,"well, we reached that wonderful moment for all gamers, when a great game  the last of us in the russian localization  one of us  made its way to the pc. it took only 10 years for the game, having undergone a series of improvements and having passed the way from a game of format 2013 to the version of the sample part i, reached the hands of pcboyars on the most orthodox platform. it would seem that how can a seasoned player be surprised by a trivial plot format journey in a postapocalyptic world from point a to point b? as it turns out, it can and how. the story told in one of us. part i, although first told 10 years ago, is still capable of touching, surprising, giving hope and telling one of the best video game stories in 2023. the development of the relationships between the main characters is interesting to watch, the secondary characters are welldiscovered and their story is interestingly presented. the visuals of the game in 2013 were pretty good even for 2023, but in the part i version, after the introduction of modern graphics technology in general is fire. separately, i want to draw attention to the concept of the green apocalypse, when the nature begins to regain its previously lost ground on the ruins of human civilization  it's very aesthetic in itself, and the game is also very stylishly depicted. i also want to note the attention to the approach in the design of the locations  if you went into an abandoned apartment, the setting, the interior, the small details of design, etc.  everything literally immerses you in the atmosphere of the game. great game lore, which is conveyed through the dialogues of the characters, the environment around, notes, and the overall story  can not leave anyone indifferent. if you, like me, love a heartwarming story, welldescribed characters, postapocalyptic atmosphere, and an interesting world, then i can congratulate you  this game will be a godsend. you can't escape or hide from the past. it will catch up with you anyway, because it's part of you...  ps the game has been run with intel core i910900f, 32gb ddr4, geforce rtx 4080 16gb ventus 3x oc, ssd, so i have no complaints about the optimization."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-04-02,"as usual, i take user reviews with a huge grain of salt due to the sheer number of idiots review bombing them for political agendas, but the average score of under 2.0 is pretty apt. when i bought the game, the first annoyance was the shader building, which, my best guess.... took 2 hours. the game is almost 10 years old yet utilized half of my rtx 3060's capability and had my i510400 pinned to the max. i'm not sure if this is physics or something that requires the engine to be cpu bound, but it runs at a barely acceptable 30fps with my setup no matter how much i've tweaked the settings. i'm holding some faith this will eventually get resolved in a future update but i would have to say the launch was a pure disaster. if i could get a refund i would, but due to the time it took for the shader building and just giving up playing it at 30fps, that's now too late bought through the epic store, not steam there's little to no chance i'm going to upgrade my machine's cpu for some marginal gain, so i guess i'm stuck with a 60 doorstop."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-31,"for some reason my 12600k sits at 90100 usage while my 3070ti chills somewhere below 60 and cant even put texture on anything above lowest settings at 1440p. watch the show instead, its better. the only positive thing about this port is that it precompiles shaders and they somehow even messed that up at launch."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-31,"extremely poorly made game with an r5 7600x and an rtx 3070 with 32gb of ram, crashing and closing the game even at 1080p on medium bursting the use of vram on an 8gb card that on medium and unbelievable what this game got even worse that cyberpunk because cyberpunk didn't crash and it didn't even burst the vram of the video cards anyway, i'll never buy a sony game again."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-31,average 10 of gamers with an actual 12gb vram gpu be like...duh you got to let your shaders load all the way duh...like its common for a game to load shaders for 2 hours and still run like crap after.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-30,"this game is still an absolute huge steaming pile of garbage. the greedy developers are charging 60 for this poorly optimized reremaster. i didn't know naughty dog still make crash games, because that's basically what this joke  is. it's just crash after crash. this broken piece of garbage is full of screen tearing and fps drops. i don't even want to hear how this is iron galaxy's fault. if naughty dog hadn't been so cheap and lazy to do the port themselves, then there would be no reason to outsource this game to those garbage developers in the first place. i have made the decision to refund this garbage. naughty dog never fails to amaze me on how greedy and lazy they are. to make matters worse, this doesn't even have the multiplayer. lazy developers only had to work on half of the game and they still couldn't get the job done. ever since bruce straley left naughty dog, these lazy and greedy developers have not released any multiplayer, let alone a new game that's actually finished. tlou2 doesn't count as it's still an unfinished game. it's been almost 3 years and i still haven't gotten multiplayer for tlou2. not even capcom took that long to give me re8 online, and that game came after tlou2. that's embarrassing. at this rate, re4 remake will have online before tlou2. seeing how ridiculously long naughty dog is taking with factions 2, i will have high expectations for tlou2 multiplayer. you better not disappoint me naughty dog. i don't recommend this cash grab garbage game at all."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-30,this game is no less than a 1010 on the original 201314 game and 710 on the 20222023 remakes. the story is impeccable and the animation the best of its kind and generally the perfect game of its genre for 2013. the thing with the remakes is that they are mostly cash grabs the retain a gameplay which is dated for their year they basically reskin the graphics for the most part which isn't the only part that turned the original into a masterpiece.

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-30,"the only reason i'm not giving this a 0 is because this game has a great story. the problem here is the awful otimization and bugs aswell as some clunky controls, specially if you're using mouse and keyboard which 90 of people will use since this is a pc port. it's very hard to get immersed on the story with all the bugs, crashes and textures loading out of nowhere or simply not loading at all. if you play on a ps3 you'll have a better experience."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-30,"this game has one of the best storylines in games, the game has very good graphics, and the game is so damn beautiful. the game pulled me in, despite the awful optimization. fortunately, the shader build was successful and there were no crashes. but the game has a lot of freezes, fps is not stable. a little later i noticed that my graphics card is loaded to 80100 percent, and the processor at most 10. for example, rdr2, cyberpunk 2077, or that uncharted 4 easily go with 60 fps on ultra settings without dlss. in the last of us a constant drop in fps, constant freezes do not allow you to play the game normally. the game takes longer to launch on ssd than spiderman and uncharted 4 together on hdd, it's impossible not to criticize. as far as i'm concerned, this is the worst port of this decade, and the worst among sony games. one of the most important sony exclusives came out very bad, no one expected this, but i hope that the optimization will be fixed as soon as possible, the sooner the better. i think that the bad scores that players are giving now are fully deserved, because the game is now difficult or even impossible to play because of horrible optimization. i'm sure the optimization will be fixed, and soon people will love it. it's good that a lot of people noticed this failure and didn't buy the game and spoil their opinion, and now they are waiting for patches. it's a pity of course that such a good game came out so unsuccessfully."

Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,"well, naughty dog did it again. they released another cutreport to pc, and not only that, but they fully intend to charge you extra for chets and time savers as well as the expansion that was launched for the game, 10 years ago. yeah... no... naughty dog, stop. think on what you are doing, you sck, and you didn't before. go back, start thinking what you are doing, and start doing it right god dammit."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,"how can sony release this in such bad condition ??? , iron galaxy are complete amateurs , performance optimization is bad , 60 euros  10 euros for cosmetic nonsense, that's a steal xdd xdd"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,"es injugable, pattico el robo que hace sony. raro que ningn medio haya hecho ya una resea con este gran problema."
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,"the game is a masterpiece in terms of gameplay, story and graphics i wish it had better optimization"
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,vanlig spill med sm tekniske optimaliseringsproblemer en straff for spillet
Action,The Last of Us Part I,2023-03-29,"broken game. a port to pc that right now needs a lot of optimization. if you do not have a good pc, you will notice it a lot. if you are interested in the title, wait for future patches to enjoy it better. worse launch than cyberpunk 2077."
