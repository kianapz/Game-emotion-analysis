It is unlike any other action shooter game I have ever played. 

The cinematography, characters, and wildlife are so spectacular!  

I have been reluctant to watch any videos, but there is so much to learn.  Learning how to navigate the controls (controller) is a task in itself. You have Satchel, supplies, weapon choices, greetings, etc.  

Thanks for the insight.  You provided just enough information and tips, without spoiling the storyline.",5

Yq6opQZvN8U,@Rekaert,2024-12-24T11:47:59Z,"One of the things I love about it is how some encounters organically lead into another. Case in point ...

So I happened up on a deal going down, four men haggling about what appeared to be a stolen wagon. It was night, so I slid over and took a good position behind an old stone wall. The men started arguing, guns were drawn, and in no time at all two of them were dead, one being coldly executed once down with a shot to the head.

I figured these were probably not the nicest of men, so decided to take them out. As it happens I had my new Winchester rifle that I stole whilst rescuing a store owner's male sex slave, (whole different story), and I dropped both scumbags pretty quickly.

Then I figured there's me, four dead men, and one wagon that's very likely stolen anyway, so hell, I may as well take the wagon and sell it to a fence at Emerald Ranch. Whilst in that neck of the woods and with more cash than I had before, I remembered that Marston had a plan to take down a train.

For someone who left camp to go hunt a wolf, things really seemed to spiral out of control.",1

sUOykFAsx1Y,@theycallmerobb,2024-06-03T23:06:00Z,"It is crazy that so many do not know these and more‚Ä¶like:
The gold bar at Limpany and later Braithwaite Manor respawn if you close the box. This is also true of large jewelry bags and cash in the abandoned church and at the edge of the swamp near Shady Hollow, the chest near the split in the train tracks near the north end of the swamp near Saint Denis. Gold nuggets and cash in the abandoned fort, free respawning tomahawks and throwing knives at 6 point cabin, the two gold bars in the fallen rail cars respawn for you as John in the epilogue, and of course that Hanging Dog and Chez Porter have respawning cash stacks of $110 and a Jewelry bag (Chez) every couple of days. But a ton of things respawn if you close the box or drawers.
You can easily have 10+ gold bars before you ever unlock the fence by revisiting Limpany every time you pass to check. 
Once in the epilogue money is too easy. If you were smart and sold everything and played Aberdeen Pig Farm right before the last Arthur mission, and didn‚Äôt go back for the cash you have about 80-100k after buying everything as Arthur. 
Go get the respawning shotguns at Watson‚Äôs Cabin and Chez and then run into horse riders between the two to get a Litchfield Repeater and Schofield, head to Fort Riggs and take on the Skinner ambush and you can get the bow and arrows to complete anything left over as John, without waiting for Arthur‚Äôs weapons‚Ä¶all the while visiting places like Lobos camps and Rigwood Farm for cash, ammo, weapons and unlimited gold ingots without even opening the box (with only short rides to the train tracks north to force respawn).

Money, weapons and gear are the least of your problems in RDR2 or any Rockstar game for that matter‚Ä¶

Getting Gold Medals in 70 missions and Guarma compendium animals is far harder than money/gear. That stuff is free. You never need to buy a weapon in RDR2 except for those sold at the fence.",0
sUOykFAsx1Y,@RIPV-o2x,2024-06-02T03:29:20Z,another tip: go to the west side of lake Isabella in the grizzlies west in ambirino there you will find the best horse in the game if kept for a while you can sell it for a lot of money up to 450,0

IMeYpHt18QI,@RibeyeRob,2024-11-13T11:40:31Z,"You should absolutely buy RDR 2 no matter what year it is. I have been playing it for about two years now and am 97% through. I have finished the story but still have stuff to find south of Blackwater.

I was in no rush to complete this game and have had breaks over the last two years. I wanted it to last as long as possible as it will be years before RDR 3 comes out. I have tried to do everything there is to do and find all the collectables which I am proud to say I have nearly achieved without the use of any guides or googling.

I have put around 2000 hours in to the game so far and from the start I have been using the in-game camera to capture glorious images of the world and many action scenes along with all the missions. I have nearly 9,000 images so far and plan to put them in a video when I complete the game with music from the RDR 2 album playing throughout the video. My current guess if I display each image for 4 seconds with a fade in and out means the end video will be around 16 hours long which I will have to split in two videos due to YouTubes upload limit of 12 hours.

I am guessing nobody has made a video like this of RDR 2 so it will be my tribute to what is in my opinion the greatest video game ever made. I hope to finish the game and have the two videos made and uploaded sometime in 2025 so keep an eye on my channel if that's something you'd enjoy watching. ü§†",32

1 of the best thing i noticed the 1st day i played this game was a simple ride can end up in animal attacks and a cougar is not fun at all if not used to the controls ha,ha,ahhaa
also bandit camps and stuff is my favorite happenings in this game(sadly there should have been alot more of this i think)

This game would have benefited to have some expansions i think
is it worth the money?? Yes

I would love if the best part of GTAVI was actually just connecting back to the living world, would at least mean SOMETHING in that world is worth saving and caring about.

My issue with RDR1 over RDR2 is exactly the ""GTA"" problem...aka, everyone you meet is a crazy jerk no good person except the 4 people you're supposed to like...90% of the characters are genuinely annoying to witness and interact with. RDR2 cares about almost all of its characters, good and bad...except Micah, Micah is just 100% the worst written thing in the game.",0

The Halloween wave based zombie event they do is great fun when it's actually here. I don't quite remember exactly how reminiscent it is to undead nightmare but really gives me the vibe.

Jskq4jLQ7go,@RIP_Greedo,2025-01-20T00:02:22Z,"What's great about Red Dead is that, while GTA is a vulgar satire of contemporary American culture that honestly gets a little old, Red Dead (especially 2) has a deep, mature appreciation of its setting. The landscape, the animals are brought to live in a realistic (seeming) way. The soundtrack is an incredible evocation of American folk music forms. There is so much to experience in this game just observing and taking in the environment. While GTA wrings a laugh out an annoying NPC being kicked in the head, Red Dead invites you to listen and watch as moose takes a drink in a stream. Or in reading Arthur's journal and seeing his drawings (and his appreciation) of the things he (you) sees in the world. The frontier spirit is well captured not in Dutch's gang, but in all the civilians they come across. The dramatic irony of the game (which Arthur comes to realize as the plot progresses) is that most of the people the gang encounters (and usually robs) are just trying to make a living in a difficult environment and that the gang, while itself being a sort of family, is an anti-social force in this environment. This is by far the best game I've ever played in my 38 years of life.",48

aQoQMyXtIDg,@Reaper74928,2025-01-10T02:08:05Z,theyre activively looking for the most extreme violent cases you can find in the game and the beauty in this game is it portrays emotions so well that itll make you feel bed. unlike gta where its much less personal,0
aQoQMyXtIDg,@ALX65,2025-01-09T17:21:16Z,"To be fair, rdr2 is an adult game set in the wild west‚Ä¶like did you expect rainbows and ponies? Of course back in the 1800s it was way worse than today. So the argument here shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúdid they make rdr2 too intense,‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúshould have they made it in the first place.‚Äù All that said, it‚Äôs my favourite game so far. When you yourself are a moral person, sure you‚Äôll mess around a bit with the NPC‚Äôs and physics and occasionally try dumb stuff you ask yourself like ‚Äúwhat happens if you tie an NPC on a train track.‚Äù You know what would happen in real life but your just testing the game‚Äôs physics. Feeding the women rights protestor to an alligator or skinning a dog in front of it‚Äôs owner was kind of too much. I‚Äôd feel bad doing that in the game. I do like the fact that you actually have the option and freedom to do these things though, because the more realistic the game is to real life, the less i want to do bad things in it, cause it‚Äôs so realistic. Like if the shooting physics was 100% realistic, and the NPC‚Äôs react based on where you shoot them, and suffer, I‚Äôd feel bad shooting people. Rdr2 has a bit of those physics but not too crazy. Same goes with the animals in the game. Like if it‚Äôs Minecraft for example, i can easily plow through a herd of cows and villagers like it was nothin‚Äô cause they are block people and animals who have like 1 animation eachüòÇ The real issue here is the IMMORAL players who are gonna do some crazy bad things in realistic games for the FUN of it. If you don‚Äôt feel bad doing that in realistic games chances are your generally a tough person in real life.",1

soj1nnWQYNE,@Luna_moon_1127,2024-12-26T07:43:06Z,"Honestly, before anyone judges me for this trust me, read the whole comment I really like horse games as someone who rides horses in real life and I like looking for realistic details in horse games. I am aware that this game is not specifically a horse game but the fact that there are so many realistic elements to the horses, behaviour and animations is amazing to me. I really like that you have to actually care for the horse in order to maintain their health and stamina. I really like how the horses will spook when they come across predators I like how sometimes even when you fire your gun in the game the horse will spook depending on the horse that you have. I have some horses that will completely stop running if I fire a gun and spook a little bit and I have another horse that will just keep running and doesn‚Äôt even care when I fire the gun. so, even though I started originally playing this game as I kinda just played it in a free mode version, and it just rode around and caught wild horses and teamed them, and sold them that kind of thing and I did like a little bit of hunting now I‚Äôm actually getting into playing the story mode of the game but like I said, there are so many realistic details to the horses like the fact that if you leave them in water and get off them, they‚Äôll get out of the water the fact that they will have steam cum off them if you come from a cold area to a hot area or it might be vice versa I‚Äôm not sure the fact that when it rains you can see your horses coat visibly get wet when you ride through muddy areas your horse visibly gets dirty. All of these things are so realistic but there‚Äôs such small details I just really like that they put into it and it even though I‚Äôm not. Just playing the game for the horse mechanics anymore like I was I still very much I do appreciate them and there are times where I just played free mode and I‚Äôll just go and tame a bunch of wild horses and sell them or I‚Äôll just ride around on my horse and do you like trail rides around the area because I do really like the graphics of the game as well. All in all the behaviour for the horses in the second game is just a lot better compared to the first one from what I can see in this one, and I absolutely love the behaviors, the graphics the details that they add to the horses is just perfect.Ôøº",4

I just went to blockbuster 1 day browsing & a guy saw me reqading the back of the game & he told me i should get it, its really good. Its like GTA in the western days. It has been in my top 3 games since. I dont usually replay games but ive replayed RDR1 so many times over the years. I remember them saying there wasnt goin to be another RDR. I always felt like the true ending of RDR1 shouldve been a game b/c i spent aloooot of time playing as Jack as an adult being a bounty hunter after i had gotten revenge for John Marston. I used to leave the house & head to blackwater early in the morning and wait at the train station until the police comes and nails up the bounty. I would do maybe 3 bounties a day until it started getting dark and i would go back to the house and sleep and wake up the next day and do it again lol. Sometimes i used to go to mexico and do bounties there for a little while when i wanted a change in scenery",0

The last of us 1 & 2 are the closest thing to give me the same feeling but it‚Äôs still not the same exact feeling. red dead redemption 2  gives me this warm and happy feeling when I play. Like you said, it‚Äôs so immersive that you can‚Äôt help but play the game as if you are really in it. The open world is so beautiful especially when in the wild, on some mountains looking around. The story line is absolutely amazing, and hunting is also amazing. The world is huge and you come across something new all the time. It‚Äôs actually really sad that rock star hasn‚Äôt made any DLCs for the game. I mean I know so much work , time, and money went into making this beautiful game. And for them to just not create new storylines for us to play is just so frustrating to me. But with that all said, this game is THEE best most beautiful game I have ever played and nothing else can give me the same exact feeling.

Missions are so restrictive you can't think out of the box you have to do everything as the game tells you. Every mission is the same -  cutsene- talking ,ride a horse( ridinga horse is 80% of the mission (tapping x is a torture)- more talking get to the place- more talking- something goes wrong- shooting- killing 
everyone- then running away. - back to the camp. And the worst thing ever YOU CAN'T EVEN  BUY A PONCHO ! i bought this game only to roleplay as a Clint's eastwood charachter- man with no name from the greatest western ever made- the good the bad and the ugly.  I hate this game so much because it could have been a masterpiece if the player could have a little freedom.  And i can't stand retarded fanbase of this game that protect this shit game to death.  Even walking in this game is hell WALKING ! And the honor system is a joke. Arthur gets Tuberculosis even if he is a good guy.  Ok you will get a different cutscene at the end but id doesn't matter because Arthur dies like a bitch anyway . He dies not because of player's skills but because it was written that way. You can't even kill Micah. You just die like a bitch high or low honor it doesn't matter.

You get to learn the crew, you receive just enough information about the Blackwater job to grab your interest, you're given time to learn the controls. Guarma, on the other hand, I could never learn to like that part of the game. It felt so out of place. 

I think I still love RDR more than RDR2, but it's extremely close. 2 improved on the first in every way, but 1 absolutely blew me away when it came out. My life was consumed by it. 

If every AAA game was equal in quality to RDR2, I'd happily pay $100 for all of them. Lastly, I genuinely hope to get a third game in the series, but I'm not sure who the story would follow. It wouldn't be the same without the Van Der Linde gang.",0

v6Nnin9mDjo,@LinweAifhyl,2024-11-25T15:13:57Z,"The turning point that made me start to love Arthur was reading his journal. Before that, Arthur was for me kind of a mindless brute, always choosing violence over words and being unapologetic for it. The story was interesting but the main character was meh.

But then, after Arthur goes collecting the money people owe you (around the beginning of the game), I randomly explored the camp and found Arthur's journal and started reading it.
The journal retraces the main story point but adds Arthur inner thoughts about what happened. And it changed my entire view of the character because he writes about how he always has violent impulse and he doesn't know why and he wishes he didn't and how affected he is about everything. He talks about his doubts and worries and things you don't really get when you just play him, even on high honor. 
There's also a bunch of sketches he drew from places, animal and plants you discover in the world and I found it endearing to imagine a man I thought was a dumb brute, sitting down to sketch a squirrel.

I know Arthur has a redemption arc and you see more and more of this caring, non-violent side and I would've eventually start to like him but reading his journal changed my entire perspective really early in the game and i'm so glad I read it and continued to read it throughout the story to know his opinion on Dutch's decline.

Arthur Morgan is easily my favorite video game character now.",0

But after i finished 1st playthrough n started up again it felt just like i had come home..so the difference is pretty big comparing 1st n 2nd playthrough start location(snow n cold could almost feel it!)

1 of the greates thing w this game has to be when i found a video with VR playthrough...Just amazing to use VR+vr mod so it can be played w VR to begin with""sadly out of my wallets size!""

Just look it up whre a gamer talks about rdr2 and how great it was in VR w a few settings changed so there were no easier way to explore then to know the map and a part of that VR video was the story he had about when he jumped into a canoe n started paddeling down the river""it was supposed to be a short trip!"" But it took several days and things that happened during that ride on the river is things that rdr2 is probably alone to have in this great world.....Hard to explaine but it all looked n felt so amazing",0

RDR2 appeals to a MUCH wider demographic and offers depth the likes of wich The Last of us could only dream of. 

Not to mention the last of us is a game specifically paid to exclude 94% OF ALL GAMERS (since playstation represents a WHOPPING 6% of the market share).  <--This makes it even funnier that a game which could be accessed by 6% of all gamers worldwide received ""game of the year"" that year and 2023. Apparently gamers being able to OWN and PLAY a copy of a game is not a metric considered when determining ""game of the year"". Kind of like Wu Tangs ""Once Upon a Time in Shaolin""; It might just be the best hip hop album EVER released but who gives a fu*k because only 1 copy was ever produced (and then sold for 2 million dollars).",0

v6Nnin9mDjo,@angryclown1990,2024-11-14T17:51:17Z,"There should not, and will not, be a Red Dead Redeption 3. That story is over. There is nowhere else to go with it, there is no way to explore that story or any of its characters further that will not ruin and insult the legacy of those two games. 

However, there WILL be another Red Dead game. Other than GTA it's one of Rockstar's biggest titles. Between RDR1&2 and Red Dead Revolver, Rockstar has helped keep the Western alive in video games. The next Red Dead game has no choice but to go back in time, which is a good thing. The next story needs to be set some time around the Civil War, or during the days of railroad construction, or the wars with the native nations. Maybe explore the conflict between cattle barons and sod busters. Give us a female character to play as. Let us play as a black, native, Hispanic, Chinese or mixed race character. Tell wild west story from their ethnic perspectives. The naming convention even has a lot of meat still on it. 

Red Dead Railroad
Red Dead Revenge
Red Dead Roundup 
Red Dead Reconing
Red Dead Resolve
Red Dead Ruin

The story of Red Dead Redemption is over, there's nothing more that needs to be said there. No, other characters  in that story don't need their own game. We don't need all the questions answered, we don't need more of their history explored. Redemption is done, over. Let it go. 

But Rockstar hasn't even scratched the surface of this incredible western setting they have created. There are literally unlimited stories to tell, and if they want to make lots of money, we will return to the western world of Red Dead in a completely new story.",0

I wanted to see him again and I didn't get to. All I see of him in Epilogue is a newspaper article about him in New York.",0

I actually don't care your opinion is wrong",2

Fn3g25ZEbak,@SceneXtube,2024-01-09T17:36:39Z,The cover system was absolutely ass that is often times just drank a potent health cure and went head first guns blazing to just get it over with. Driving stage coaches was probably the least fun thing to do and you do it often and i think it‚Äôs a shame you can miss side quests if you continue the story first. Other than that though i realllyyy enjoyed this game. The ending did feel a little rushed and strange though and i really did not care for Eagle Flys ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,0
Fn3g25ZEbak,@pixstudios7708,2024-01-07T19:00:34Z,it got weak around the guarma and a bit after that but the ending of arthurs story and all of johns was the game at its prime,0
Fn3g25ZEbak,@t3hpoopsmith,2024-01-06T21:25:33Z,"Biggest problem with the game was the juxtaposition between the campaign and open world.   Everything is open and sandboxy except the actual game itself.  When you actually want to make progress in the game you are given no agency or choice and how to go about it.  You have to do exactly what the screen says or you fail the mission.   What's the point in designing all these crazy physics and open world mechanics if they cannot be used in the actual campaign?   

A lot of the controls were also clunky and the details that were initially impressive became kind of a slog that would slow the game down.  

The story was decent. But at the end of the day Even the best video game stories are not as good as movies or books and I play for gameplay.",2

Dutch is fully unhinged and the mission he sends you have you become more disillusioned to what his plan is for both Arthus and the player. The finale is Arthur finally having enough and trying to give John a last shot at redemption.,1

That Dutch was not the biggest bad guy but Micah was playing mind games to FOURCE his sense of mind in the evil direction. Dutch had brought Arthur to life and would never have left his side. That because the band broke up does not mean that the old band won‚Äôt have children to make another band. Aurthur might be dead but his spirit still lurks and his sacrifice brings to new beginnings. Micah was never in our side but the back stabbed against the law and everyone else in the country. That even though there is going to be a 4th RDR, there still might be no band. And although there is no band, does not mean we are on the same team with the law. We might become John‚Äôs kid and then we make another band and become the new Dutch. Hope this helps guys!!!",0

But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes-, six minutes-)
Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpi√®ce
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Œô have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""Bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay, I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!"" That's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""Way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""Hell, yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause-
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton-, no, Asgard, Asgard
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a .9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24-7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything
You say is ricochetin' off of me, and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop, "" 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head, there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?",0

La cantidad de fibras que mueve este juego es inmesurable, y lo inmersivo que puede llegar a ser es fascinante, creo que el hecho de que sea lento al principio no te deja apreciar ese incio, y capaz hasta te pierdas una que otra info importante.

Gracias por este video, llor√© como una ni√±a nuevamente al verlo, y al ser s√≥lo expectadora y no jugadora, pude apreciar la historia a√∫n mas. Sigo tu canal desde facebook, fan de tu voz y la manera en que narras las historias.
