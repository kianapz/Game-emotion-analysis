Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-16,"it's really better than most games released today, 6 years later."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-29,i'm a 44 year old dad of 2 sons and they both played this so now it's my time to grind and shine.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-01,"played this game for the first time 3 years after it was released. i stuck with the main story, and it was a blast. i put the game down after i beat it. and now, in 2025, i'm starting a brand new playthrough, and this time, i wanna do everything."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-28,i just bought this on steam for 20.00. i hear it's a good game so i thought i'd give it a try this winter. yours is the first guide on it i've watched. i'll be back..
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-02,"i remember a while ago watching your gta vids and saying idk why he even posts these since the viewer count was lower on these compared to the gta videos. i just bought it and completed chapter one in like 34 hours, it seems like these videos comes from the heart and passion. thank you"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-17,"your tenacity, enjoyment and endurance of rdr2 are admirable haz, i dont play as much, but, still enjoy your content."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-21,"i've owned this game for a few years and loved it so much over the first couple chapters that i stopped playing.... like, keeping it in my back pocket until i thought i could give it the attention and appreciation it deserves. thanks for the vid"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-09,"i always play a semi bad to middle ground arthur until i get tb, then he reforms becoming high honour. i love my arthur to have reflected on the diagnosis, feels the most right."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-24,"just started playing a month ago because my 13 year old said i was uncultured swine for never giving rd2 a chance. my advice for early game success would be, find the white arabian, explore and find treasures and special guns to get money fast and uprade guns and camp. pay attention to the 10 challenges as early as possible especially chapter 3. make satchel of the east an early goal. some special treasure are very important and can craft trinkets for upgrades. despite what your jealous 13 year old says, dont sell said special items. gensing exlixer, valerian root and aged pirate rum increase your stats, i didnt know. was just carrying all of it aroun til i figured out they give you boosts. i just started chapter 3 and having a blast just hunting and trying to find rare wild horses atm."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-14,"my son bought me a steam deck for christmas this past year. i have maybe 10 hours total on rdr2. it is unlike any other action shooter game i have ever played. the cinematography, characters, and wildlife are so spectacular! i have been reluctant to watch any videos, but there is so much to learn. learning how to navigate the controls controller is a task in itself. you have satchel, supplies, weapon choices, greetings, etc. thanks for the insight. you provided just enough information and tips, without spoiling the storyline."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,"this is the perfect example of what future gaming was supposed to look like. straight up. i do get tired of seeing comments like this, but this is just a fact dude."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-10,"the van horn mansion glitch still works and it also works with the little cabin at fairyvale shanty...basically loot the location, save the game, reload that save, wash rinse repeat."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-14,"another tip that i just discovered last night, you can craft special bullets or arrows while riding your horse. i never knew that but for me it's a game changer as you can just craft small game arrows or split point bullets while you roam towards your preys, four legs or two. i used to stop just to do those while hunting."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-13,"for split point rounds, instead of waiting for arthur to bring out a bullet, split, and put it back, you can instead hold x or any relevant button and it will craft it at a much quicker rate, almost 60 split points a minute"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-21,he's british of course is my favorite strangers and freaks mission
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-24,"one of the things i love about it is how some encounters organically lead into another. case in point ... so i happened up on a deal going down, four men haggling about what appeared to be a stolen wagon. it was night, so i slid over and took a good position behind an old stone wall. the men started arguing, guns were drawn, and in no time at all two of them were dead, one being coldly executed once down with a shot to the head. i figured these were probably not the nicest of men, so decided to take them out. as it happens i had my new winchester rifle that i stole whilst rescuing a store owner's male sex slave, whole different story, and i dropped both scumbags pretty quickly. then i figured there's me, four dead men, and one wagon that's very likely stolen anyway, so hell, i may as well take the wagon and sell it to a fence at emerald ranch. whilst in that neck of the woods and with more cash than i had before, i remembered that marston had a plan to take down a train. for someone who left camp to go hunt a wolf, things really seemed to spiral out of control."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"on my second attempt with this game. i had to shelf it years ago out of boredom. it just doesnt compare to the first game. rd2 is just so clunky, rd1 was far smoother. im referring to the controls, by the way. rd1 was a blast to play because the controls worked so smoothly. this is something they failed to duplicate in rd2"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-12-30,"go,and tame the arabian horse as early as you can, its a bit tricky to do but save your game beforehand and you can just try again if it rums away. its free and it has the best stats of any horse in the game, if you bond with it and use it the whole game by chapter 5 or so itll be maxed out. also, buy the best stirrups, they make the horses stamina drain 50 slower."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-12-04,"important tip when you're out in the world, you can fast travel by setting up a campfire. took me a long time to figure that one out, and i was just riding everywhere like a loser."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-10-14,this is what to do first look up a guide to unlocking the legend of the east satchel it will take a while and a bit of money but it will allow you to hold 99 of most items such as fishing bait and tonics. secondgo to lemoyne and find some gators they give 4 big game meat which fills all cores to the max and you can season them to give golden rings third now that you have the satchel you can hold 99 big game meat and also 99 hay for your horse so now you should always have full cores. fourth unlock the fence and the off hand holster look up treasure map guides and follow them to get a few thousand dollars then get 2 cattleman revolvers as they are the best revolvers in the game once fully upgraded. fifth go to lake isabella and tame the rare white arabian horse it is a great horse early on and very fast but is quite skittish if you dont like it just above big valley there is a small plains once there you will see a fully black through bred it is also a great horse once fully bonded. six enjoy the game hope this helps

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-10-27,"imagine being at the rockstar meeting at the beginning when someone said  ok folks, let's make a list of features we wanna put in the game... they're probably still writing it now!!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-01-11,first things to do my tips. gather recipes and gather gold ingots and sell. craft recipes and gather plants and herbs. hunt animals that are easy to hunt like deer and pronghorns. find weapons dont rely just on buying weapons. buy hunting spring field rifle and hunt for pelts as well as varmint rifle for small critters. craft enhanced arrows and small game arrows for your bow it will really help when you get hit by larger animals. craft health items and stamina items with dead eye items. hunt pelts to upgrade your satchel and complete challenges to unlock new gear.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-08-18,the fence in rhodes is unlocked as soon as you begin chapter 2!!! i played 3 times before i ever came across that. extremely helpful !
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-10-26,they actually show him skinning his kills?! this is the best the best game ever
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-03-12,"there's a working way to get 15,000 off that gold bar in limpony or wherever. recommend saving before trying if you're intent on getting the money, and expect to spend about an hr to get the full 15g all you have to do is pick it up, before you actually put it in your pocket but after it give the little  item pause, save, then immediately load that save. you should then have that gold bar and one in the box still. just repeat until you have thirty of them."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-10-29,"love it! i haven't been following main story to much at the time.. just exploring , hunting, did some main quests but mainly exploring ! and i didnt even know fast travel was possible, in red dead 2! but now because of you i know!...i won't ever use it though, i love traveling by horse, the amazing views and then random moments...like seen a guy get killed by his own horse haha."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-10-25,can't wait to play this tomorrow.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-17,"i feel so lucky to have grown up on cod4 and halo3, then as a young adult, get to play such an amazing game in rdr2!"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-10-26,the gold brick is in the southwest of horseshoe overlook! limpany you can see a few houses near the river on the map. you can only sell it in the blackmarket which appears in the main story by time.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-06-03,"it is crazy that so many do not know these and morelike the gold bar at limpany and later braithwaite manor respawn if you close the box. this is also true of large jewelry bags and cash in the abandoned church and at the edge of the swamp near shady hollow, the chest near the split in the train tracks near the north end of the swamp near saint denis. gold nuggets and cash in the abandoned fort, free respawning tomahawks and throwing knives at 6 point cabin, the two gold bars in the fallen rail cars respawn for you as john in the epilogue, and of course that hanging dog and chez porter have respawning cash stacks of 110 and a jewelry bag chez every couple of days. but a ton of things respawn if you close the box or drawers. you can easily have 10 gold bars before you ever unlock the fence by revisiting limpany every time you pass to check. once in the epilogue money is too easy. if you were smart and sold everything and played aberdeen pig farm right before the last arthur mission, and didnt go back for the cash you have about 80100k after buying everything as arthur. go get the respawning shotguns at watsons cabin and chez and then run into horse riders between the two to get a litchfield repeater and schofield, head to fort riggs and take on the skinner ambush and you can get the bow and arrows to complete anything left over as john, without waiting for arthurs weaponsall the while visiting places like lobos camps and rigwood farm for cash, ammo, weapons and unlimited gold ingots without even opening the box with only short rides to the train tracks north to force respawn. money, weapons and gear are the least of your problems in rdr2 or any rockstar game for that matter getting gold medals in 70 missions and guarma compendium animals is far harder than moneygear. that stuff is free. you never need to buy a weapon in rdr2 except for those sold at the fence."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-10-27,burned town is southwest of horseshoe not southeast
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-08-24,"i want to relive the first moments leading up to my first time playing. sadly i was away for the first few days of release, but after that was some of the purest mix of emotions ive ever felt. i guess i wouldnt want to relive the heart wrenching wait until i finally got to play after the 100gb download."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-03-26,rdr2  gta5
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-09-21,first things to do is... collect as many plants and herbs as you can for crafting tonics to survive. hunt for meat and animal pelts first. hand in all your hunting pelts to the trapper and camp. explore and find out the new missions you can do. buy weapon hardware. find weapons in the wilderness. start upgrading your camp. buy a hunting rifle and buy express ammo and high capacity ammo for your rifle. your hunting rifle and varmint rifle helps you hunt those pelts. and your bow. craft game hunting arrows for those smaller critters. craft an improved arrow for those larger beasts.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-10-25,first thing to do is to enjoy the game for ur own experience
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-01,"on my last mission with arthur, i made the mistake of taking buell, hamish sinclair's old horse, and ive never regretted anything more in a videogame, i was so sad, btw hamish is the veteran in the hunting cabin just east, northeast of valentine and west of beaver hollow"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-04-06,"once your in chapter 2. my first thing, get the wreck train goldbars and statue gold bars. take train to rhodes get lancaster from gunsmith and sell gold. the fence in rhodes is already open. unlike emerald ranch. and after u get lancaster empty till. go to fence return to store and go in side door, rob all the ammo. lowers honor but your just starting. so you'll have full ammo for 0. and tons of money from the gold bars. from here it's all you. buy hunting gun or whatever. unlock a few of the 1st challenges one will give you the way to buy an off hand holster immediately long before rescuing micah. so in a few moves your wallet full, your using some of the best guns, your dual wielding. and lastly look for the guy n his jumpy horse. usually it's a thorough bred or better. chase it down and break it in. now you got a quality steed until chapter 4 when you can get arabians. or get the white arabian. i just get the guys horse. much easier and easier travel. now your set. to do all the game challenges like a boss."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-22,love the game i actually wish some of the guns weren't locked in story progression though. just cause i love hunting and messing around just as much or more than actually doing the missions. if it wasn't for trying to unlock a few things like the fishing rod and a couple guns i might have been on chapter 2 for months. that's the sign of a well made game though imo being able to just explore around and have tons of fun doing it cause its so well made.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-10-27,this is my type of game one that i can't finish in a few bloody days!!!!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2022-12-09,"if you bring your horse right next to a downed animal, it will speed up the skinning animation. helps save some time if you're doing a lot of hunting"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-04-14,"it made me sad when i donated 50k to my camp box and someone broke into it during chapter 6, i have a strong feeling it was how pearson had enough money to open a general store during the epilogue or why dutch always needed more money lol"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,i find it funny that the only hydrological mistake was also the only river that was ported over from the original red dead redemption
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-07,"rdr2 minor assistant game producer here! super glad to hear you enjoyed discovering the sources of each lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water in our game. we actually had around half a dozen hydrologists and geologists on call to assist and basically hold our hand to figure out a way to make this experience as realistic as possible for diehard fans such as yourself! glad to hear you appreciated the hard work, austin."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,"geologist here! so, the mistaken river feature at 1019, is not actually a mistake, it's something that can happen in real life. bear with me i would love to explain with a diagram but words will need to sufice here . so the bend to the north up in the map is the original course of the river lower montana river. the channel that is in the south down in the map is likely newly formed or artificially dug by humans to aid navigation, but the river doesn't seem deep enough for that. so the original bend may have formed because there was harder material in the way at first, or the river just filled a preexisting depressiongeological feature. but the outer side of the steep bend has more erosive power and so with time it starts eroding any weaker material in the river bank there. with enough time it starts to form a channel that may eventually connect to another part of the river downstream. this would indeed leave the original bent channel as the less efficient option for water to flow as you say. this causes it to have reduced water volume and speed, and the lesser speed makes more material carried by the water to be deposited there. this will eventually cut off that meander a meander is the name of a bent channel in a river, usually in the shape of a half moon from the main water flow and form what we call a meander scar or oxbow lake look it up they look amazing from aerial views. those may even be temporarily filled again during a flood if the water levels raises enough. what you explained will ultimately happen. the issue is it will happen in a geological time scale. it may take 1000 or 10000 years for that meander to be fully abandoned. in a human timescale that's a lot but in a geological one that's the blink of an eye. so you likely encountered the phenomenon in the process of abandoning that northern channelmeander but it just hasn't happened yet. it's not a mistake. if you want to see a similar feature google isla merio, neuqun, neuqun, argentina. you have a bend in a river going north forming an island with the main channel of the river to the south. hope my explanation is understandable. my mother tongue is spanish so i may have some issues translating more technical words into english  edit apparently, the proper term for the abandoned meander in english is meander scar or oxbow lake. i edited that in the explanation."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,"at the end of the video, as someone from california where gold mining was a pretty big deal, i can say that looks like what happened when folks diverted the rivers to pan for gold.dthat is a real loose description of what all happened but it is 3am here and i don't have the mental spoons to give a history lesson but you'd probably enjoy reading all about it!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"1111 your explanation is correct, but that simply hasn't happened yet. one of the splits is already more efficient and within time, will totally drain the other split. but erosion doesn't happen overnight"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,"what a great analysis! i was an artist on rdr2, and made a number of the rivers mainly tributaries of the dakota river. we put a lot of effort into water surface mesh and related flow maps. i'm very interested in geology and it certainly helps when building rivers  its great to see people so interested in this stuff."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,yippee new river video life has meaning again
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"1115, i'm not a trained hydrologist but i did take some classes in hydrology and others on coastal wetlands. this can and does happen in real life. you see it in coastal river features a lot, like river deltas on meandering rivers. it tends to be a sort of intermediate between when original riversedinemt changes occur and their long term, stable state. essentially, water will always take the path of least resistance, especially a low energy river like a meandering one near where it meets the sea. so if a naturally existing low spot exists there, water will move in to fill it if it can. and while the majority of water would move through the main path, water will also move in to fill the other low spots as well. if there was, say, a canyon through that area, which the surrounding topography on the red dead map kind of implies, the river would fork and flow at a seemingly illogical angle simply because of elevation changes and gravity. i would posit the san jacinto river as it passes through northeast houston as an example of this."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"my older brother showed me your videos when i was 14, im 26 now. i remember asking him like 5 years ago how is austin still not blowing up? man im so proud of you."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"i'm so excited you talked about dewberry creek! it's one of my favorite details in the entire game. the erosion, the small pockets of standing water, the wildlife that comes there to eat and drink from these small pools. the mud and the cracked earth. it's so cool and i'm glad you mentioned it!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,i love that austin loves everything about video games this semantic detail serves no purpose to the game but makes realistic sense  i love that. this semantic detail makes no sense  i love that.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,i like anyaustin because he makes me not only look at everyday things in video games from a new perspective and appreciation but also at the same things irl with a new perspective and appreciation
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,can i just say your love for the unremarkable is infectious. its made me occasionally play gtav and just kinda observe npc behavior or walk patterns. something that's amazingly unremarkable is what npcs do after you drop them off from a taxi ride
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,1400 the weird guy that was spinning in circles was doing the lake isabella glitch wich is a glitch players do for bassically infinite money and gold and items there are multiple version on how to do it and the horse 1 to my knowledge is the slowest one wich is why he spent so long doing it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,"austin, there's a very easy out of map glitch that lets you explore the origin point of a lot of these rivers. there isn't much detail obviously, but theres also miles and miles of unexplored empty terrain that i think you would find very interesting based on your odd places in games videos"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,this is my new favorite youtube vid genre. have you ever noticed this thing that doesn't matter? well now it matters and it's all you're gonna be thinking about today
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,1250 rdr2 does actually have a simple tidal system for some areas. the best place to view this is at bard crossing where water levels change and certain part of land will be uncovered at certain times. it is only on some parts of the map as for example i have never seen the tidal systems in play in the lemoyne swamps this is probably due to all the mud that has dynamic deformation and adding rising water levels could mess with that.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-07,hey austin! you compared rdr2 to cyberpunk in the later part of the video and mentioned you didnt have other comparisons. i would recommend kingdom come deliverance 1 and 2 for river review. both games pride themselves on their realism and people have even overlayed the real czech map over the ingame one. it would be really cool to know if their attention to detail extends to the games waterways as well. kcd 2 has two in game maps btw in case you decide to check it out. highly recommend. loved the video!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"it might sound dumb brother ive watched you do this like 4 times, if i thought it was dumb i wouldnt keep coming back"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,oh i was so happy you talked about dewberry! the dried creek bed is so cool hydrologically. the fact that you can see oxbow lakes from past times it flooded and didn't fully drain and then flooded again but in a different direction.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,the river naming at around 2 mins. there is a river in my state of virginia that goes by the name roanoke river at a certain point it gets renamed to staunton river then later down the river it gets changed back to roanoke river.....
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"life is great or bad and good, idk truly these are words that have been spoken"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,the reason for the odd river flow at thieves landing is probably because that portion of the map is from rdr1. pretty much everything apart from the blackwater area north of it isnt in the original game. i would guess this was brought up during the development of rdr2 but it obviously couldnt have been changed because of continuity.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,1753 yes!!! i would love to watch some cyberpunk content from you
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,"something worth mentioning with the little creek river is how r nailed the oxbow lakes and the creation of shortcuts for the waterflow. also, the northenmost river that u said came from under the ice, actually comes from a long line of glaciers. if you go freecam outside the map you can follow the glacier to the mountains and an unused lake. anyways awesome video, i love how this game is still kept alive by the fanbase"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,"600 this reminded me of when i first played breath of the wild and it blew my mind that you can go inside the windmills in hateno village and actually see the mill turning. such a tiny detail but i found it so satisfying. thanks for the video, it was great."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,1527 austin throwing the funniest clip ever without even acknowledging is a youtube masterpiece
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"as a geological engineerintraining, an interesting way to study these river systems is with what's called their strahler number. the source streams all start with 1, and when a confluence of another 1 stream occurs the downstream is then designated with a 2, and if two 2 streams meet then downstream it bumps to three. if the 3 stream has a confluence with another 1 or 2 stream however it just absorbs it with no change. so a strahler 4 or 5 river has many sources and as a result is much more influenced by large precipitation or flooding events. based on this video the saint luis river would be a strahler 3, unless the lanahechee was a 3 or higher before flowing into the map from the east. the mississippi river for example has a strahler number of 10, the largest in north america, and the largest in the world is the amazon river at 12."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"the water cycle is insane. you learn about it in elementary school and just accept it, but now that im much older whenever i see a stream im like, water fell, from the sky, and it was enough to make that. then at places like niagara where hundreds of thousands of gallons are dropped each second and i just cant comprehend it. water from snow and rain and the ground is enough to make that? how?! its crazy!!!!"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,"from my experience, the most realisticallyfeeling rivers in games were in assassin's creed origins. i don't know how they nailed that, but when you're standing at the shore, you can almost smell it. the physics, the colour of the water, all the plants, the sounds. they clearly put a lot of effort in those. i highly recommend checking those out! the level of attention to details is just incredible!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"i'm not sure if anyone else has commented why that one person was circling the same area, but i'm gonna do it. the reason why they could be doing it is because theres a money glitch up there, let me explain. it's called the lake isabella glitch. to put it simply, it's where you load a treasure map in a certain place in lake isabella and circle a rock kinda far away from it, basically loading and unloading the chest over and over. it really doesn't have anything to do with the rock you circle per say. i'm not much good at explaining things. there's videos about it, just search red dead lake isabella glitch if you are interested. oh edit, btw love all your videos, i found your channel when you uploaded that liberty city power line video, then like it so much i've watch every other video on your channel. keep doing your awesome work"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-06,i just found your videos and i have never in my life played skyrim or red dead but i absolutely love your videos and how you analyze everything in such a calming existential way. i've been binging all of them and i don't even care what you're talking about just keep talking please and thank you

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-03,"205 unless, of course, two different people both discovered the rive around the same time, believed it was two different rivers, and the mistake wasn't noticed untill both names had stuck. i am thinking of australia's secondlargest river system, the nepeanhawkesbury river, which runs runs down from the highlands, takes a great big sweep across the plains, disappears back into the blue mountains, and finally pops back out to sea. by the time the mountains were crossed and the river properly mapped, 30 odd years had passed since the river was discovered, and now the upper part is the nepean river, the lower part is the hawkesbury, and there is no particular spot where one name gives way to the other."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"austin, i love your videos, and rdr2 is my favorite game ever. after seeing you follow other game rivers, i decided to follow rdr2s rivers in my own playthrough. i followed them a lot more casually, usually enjoying the scenery rather than trying to figure out exactly how they worked, but it was the most enjoyable video game experience ive ever had. i love that you are now following these rivers too. thank you for making video games and giving me a new appreciation for the little things in games and life!!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,"regarding dewberry creek, an earlier clue is the meandering path you pointed out that it takes. rapid outflows due to flooding like you hypothesized tend to make wide, straight paths to lower elevation. its an asston of water, rapidly accelerating once any breakthrough is formed its not going to respect the topography of the downhill landscape so much as unmake it. that path, with a clear and curvy band of former riverbed sharply separated from undisturbed plants on either side, that all suggests a longterm and relatively stable river that only recently and perhaps temporarily ceased to be. man, i used way fancier words to say that than i meant to"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"147 dude, it's crazy to me that you have a reputation of being so thorough and just good at this stuff that you can just be like. yeah, there's only three of them in the entire game and i will 100 believe you"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"i went back and watched some of austin's older videos recently, and frankly, he's become far better over time. i'm assuming it's because of scripting, editing, etc. but that progress wasn't drastic when i went back it was slow and built just like the rivers."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"way back in the beta of rdr2, southeastern lemoyne was supposed to open to the ocean that let you access guarma from a ferry. beta guarma was just called guama and was only gonna be a small island the size of lemoyne that you could revisit and do side missions and stranger events but r got really over ambitious and cut back most content. the northeastern part is interesting too since van horn was supposed to be at the very cornertip of the map above annesburg, and if you boundary break past the invisible barriers, you can follow the river way up north."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,"627 my favorite natural spring creek i ever found was around san bruno california. this is a little suburb on the san francisco peninsula. the hills grow bigger into the santa cruz mountains the further south you go, so it's fairly elevated, but it's entirely developed. so this spring was just coming out of the side of a sidewalk and then flowing into a gutter for a block and down a drain. it was a completely natural spring creek, there was even algae living in it, but it was just stuck in suburbia, living for a block in a gutter then going out with the rest of the runoff."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-13,"you should absolutely buy rdr 2 no matter what year it is. i have been playing it for about two years now and am 97 through. i have finished the story but still have stuff to find south of blackwater. i was in no rush to complete this game and have had breaks over the last two years. i wanted it to last as long as possible as it will be years before rdr 3 comes out. i have tried to do everything there is to do and find all the collectables which i am proud to say i have nearly achieved without the use of any guides or googling. i have put around 2000 hours in to the game so far and from the start i have been using the ingame camera to capture glorious images of the world and many action scenes along with all the missions. i have nearly 9,000 images so far and plan to put them in a video when i complete the game with music from the rdr 2 album playing throughout the video. my current guess if i display each image for 4 seconds with a fade in and out means the end video will be around 16 hours long which i will have to split in two videos due to youtubes upload limit of 12 hours. i am guessing nobody has made a video like this of rdr 2 so it will be my tribute to what is in my opinion the greatest video game ever made. i hope to finish the game and have the two videos made and uploaded sometime in 2025 so keep an eye on my channel if that's something you'd enjoy watching."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-24,"there are issues no one talks about well i dont give a fuck, leennnyyyyy"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"i love the animals in this game. the pronghorn outrun your horse fastest land mammal over long distances, the opossums play dead so you can't study them since they're 'not alive', brown bears attack whilst black bears run away, the carolina parakeets are almost extinct around the same time as in real life, woodpeckers actually sick on the trees and go ham. just so detailed and accurate. there's a few other animals i would have liked to see like porcupine, black footed ferrets, fishers to name a few but overall this game satiates the animal enjoyer in me that's been growing since i was able to read books."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-09,the thing that blows my mind about rdr2 is that almost every location in the game looks like a painting. it's one of the most wellthought out and artistically put together environments in gaming history.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,2118 you know it's a serious video if it ends with more dunkey
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"whenever i speedrun rdr2, by the time i get to chapter two or three, i like to have arthur disappear up into the mountains to live out of the shacks up there while hunting animals and being hunted by bounty hunters, this is about a six hour time addition to my speedrun but it works in the long run"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,dutch's silver tongue also tricks me into thinking this play though will be different.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-20,"what's great about red dead is that, while gta is a vulgar satire of contemporary american culture that honestly gets a little old, red dead especially 2 has a deep, mature appreciation of its setting. the landscape, the animals are brought to live in a realistic seeming way. the soundtrack is an incredible evocation of american folk music forms. there is so much to experience in this game just observing and taking in the environment. while gta wrings a laugh out an annoying npc being kicked in the head, red dead invites you to listen and watch as moose takes a drink in a stream. or in reading arthur's journal and seeing his drawings and his appreciation of the things he you sees in the world. the frontier spirit is well captured not in dutch's gang, but in all the civilians they come across. the dramatic irony of the game which arthur comes to realize as the plot progresses is that most of the people the gang encounters and usually robs are just trying to make a living in a difficult environment and that the gang, while itself being a sort of family, is an antisocial force in this environment. this is by far the best game i've ever played in my 38 years of life."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,arthur talking to the nun about having faith  hitting us with the i guess im afraid. is still the hardest hitting line in any game and it was in a side quest of all things
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,"this is absolutely in the top 3 videos youve ever made, it perfectly encapsulates your sense of humor while simultaneously showing true insight and appreciation for the game. masterpiece."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"hopefully, after a second look, he gives the game a 45 with two fat cigars"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-10,this game will always be a core part of me realizing video games are such an important art form
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,"man i missed these types of videos, you simply do them the best"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"no joke, this game made a lasting impact. it's one of the greatest narratives in a game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"im a huge fan of these more indepth by donkleys standards anyway analyses and would love to see more, he always does a great job with keeping it entertaining"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-05,rdr2 is what hypes me up for gtavi. theres no way they can do this but better in a modern city. right?
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"my first playthru of this game was 80hrs, not 100 but most of the content, done nonstop every night over the course of a month. felt like being immersed into the most epic western movie ever made. i'll never forget arthur morgan, the story of dutch's gang, and the impact it had on me. it's a masterpiece of art that sits right at the top with all the greatest movies and novels."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,we are now in dunkeys 'slick' era and i love it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,welcome to dunkcember everyone
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-08,553 i will find thirtyfive dinosaur bones in real life before i'll let this company die!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,i loved red dead long before but recently had to say goodbye to a really close friend. he loved red dead and our group was always making red dead jokes. when he died i 100 the game for him. the last photo we have of him is him recreating arthurs death on the mountain and the irony is so painfully good. thank you rockstar. my best memories with him will forever live on whenever i hear dutch say i have a plan miss you bro.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,man its wild how you are in fact very capable at making indepth videos but you make the conscious effort not to most of the time. nothing but praise for your creativity dunkey. keep being you!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,"i'm so used to the videos ending on a joke, the reverence you have for this game is very clear, and very well deserved on its part. it's an incredible masterpiece still without peer"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-28,this game really makes you feel like youre going to tahiti
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"rdr2 is one of those games where i wish i could play it for the first time all over again, but at the same time i feel like you don't truly appreciate the world and the characters until your second or third playthrough when you start picking up on the smaller details that allow you to get closer and closer to fully understanding why everything is the way it is. it's definitely one of those rare games that can still surprise you no matter how many times you go back to it"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,this might actually be dunkeys longest video
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,a 21 minute video about red dead from dunkey is an amazing christmas gift
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-06,"312 damn this soundtrack... always sends chills down my spine  always brings back that one memory of going to the top of the mountain with that special someone , listening to their last conversation and then  you my brother, my brother! i know...i know.. and that damn song kicks in  my vision becomes washed out due to tears, im realising that this is the end..."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,"i really liked how you presented this. you even inluded the most important scene without giving a hint to how important it was, just how arthur the player experiences it. you picked some great eye candy and gave some insight into arthur i hadn't even thought of after hundreds of hours of playing."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,my fav type on dunkey videos
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,people always hype gta etc but imo this game is in another league by itself. its utterly astonishing how detailed it is.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-06,this is my favorite video of yours in awhile. i really like when you talk about why you like certain games and show off the bits. you have your reviews which are great but then i feel like you do these types of videos where it's more like pontificating. love you dunky
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"i never got far in this game when it came out because my pc couldnt run it, but i played it all the way through this year and was absolutely blown away. actual masterpiece game. no joke, it got me into birdwatching in real life because i was so amazed by the animal life in the game. some games just change your life and rdr2 is one of them."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-05,"this is the most unserious, serious video i've ever seen."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"when the final music swelled in this video, i got tearyeyed. this game means so much to me for a lot of personal reasons, but i think what got me is how much i cared about arthur and still do. whenever people ask me, what's your favorite story? without hesitation, it's red dead ii. arthur is a character that will live in my heart for as long as i live because he's the type of character that makes an impression on you, and you grow to feel a connection with him. you start to understand him as the story goes on, and if you're like me, you can relate to him. especially when he gets sick. thanks for making this video, dunkey. i was glued to the screen the whole way."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,"i go back to play rdr2 from time to time, just roamin' around , taking in the atmosphere, walk slowly, talk to people, ride my horse. it's quite relaxing. it's world is just surreal."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"i have almost 400 hours in this game and it never gets old. genuinely one of the best games ever made, right behind knack 2."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,i am loving the rise of red dead 2 on youtube again recently!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"rdr2 is so dense with greatness at every corner. like the moment arthur mentions the story of his family during eagle fly mission, or how onelegged mickey reflects on arthur in epilogue. the dutch's reciting famous chess part during intro to a mission which alludes to the whole nature of his character. and so much more..."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-06,"2040 arthur and dutch, despite their conflict, havoc and demise, clinking glasses by the truth that they at least aided marston by securing his legacy. you're pretty slick for this ending, dunkboy"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"i just completed red dead redemtion 2 for the first time. i am glad that a 6 year old game still gets such love. i guess it just goes to show what a timeless game it is. also, love you dunkey."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,im ok with losing a monsters inc sunday for this
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"when i was 11 years old i used to watch my brother in 2013 play gta 5 on his ps3 and he would do live commentary specifically for me to follow along and understand what he's doing, he would never place a marker for any destination on the map. he knew where he was going and how to get there, which streets to turn left or right on, he would pass by a lamp post and tell me a funny moment that happened to him there. i would sit and watch as he got to were he needed to be without needing a marker in amazement. every single game i ever played i would always try to get to the same familiarity that he had with that map but i never could, until rdr2 came out. the train tracks you could follow to valentine, the valley between the heartlands and flatneck station, the train tracks you could follow from annesburg, to van horn, all the way to saint denis. i didn't need to place a marker on the map to know where i'm going, i just went there. i could get lost in the woods near emerald ranch and find my way back to saint denis just by finding a road. they did such an amazing job with adding little details to the environment that i could know where i was by using them as markers. rdr2 will hold a special place in my heart not just for it's amazing story telling and atmosphere, but for helping me connect to my brother and feel as if ive finally reached him even after his passing."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-05,game fully changed my life. i was at a conservatory for college in a different country and felt lost. then i come home for break and my old friend puts this game on. it helped me reprioritize what's important in life and is endlessly beautiful. thank you more dunkey
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,"357 dutch arthur, youre in that one points to the red dead 2 game cover"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,i've always thought rdr2 would stand the test of time and be viewed alongside the great works of art from the 20th century. it's a masterpiece in every sense of the word in a way i think no other video game before or since has ever matched. it's been 6 years and we still haven't gotten close to matching rdr2's graphics. its writing is so deep and complex that it draws comparison to the greatest prestige tv shows of all time like deadwood or the wire. it's phenomenally immersive and makes you genuinely feel like you're in the world. and on top of all that  it's a good fucking game. fun to play and infinitely replayable. sad to think we probably won't get another game like this ever again since the housers left rockstar.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,this game made me learn acoustic guitar just to play one song unshaken. what can i say?
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-27,647 gungo wungo type of tree tickled me so hard i had to stop the video and take a sec.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"this game hasn't left my mind since i played it 6 years ago. 2 more 100 playthroughs only made it better. it's the only game i played where i missed the characters once they were gone, my life was quieter without them and i couldn't be happier to see everyone again when i started the game over, and not a single one of them is real. if rockstar never made another red deadwestern game, i would be okay. they made 2 of the greatest games of their time and one of the best larger stories in my opinion, and i feel so lucky to have played them. flaws and all, i would give anything to experience either one of them for the first time again. they're those rare life changing pieces of art to me."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,"id never heard the dialogue at 1801 before but its so well written and it just humanizes the characters that much more, just makes me want to play the whole game all over again"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-05,i just want to let you know that ive been following you since around 2012. you truly are a master at what you do and i want to thank you for putting so much time and effort into your content. it really shows through. i dont even play video games anymore and i still watch all of your videos. keep up the good work!

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,historians will say this was the second redemptiontype game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,i love finding an unintended glitch in a video game. its like finding a typo in a book. nobody wants typos in a book but when you find one its an intimate experience that connects you to the book and author. it breaks the illusion but it makes the whole experience feel more real and alive. finding a glitch in a game breaks the game but it reminds you that what you are playing was made by someone and is real and therefore fallible. that makes the experience sweeter somehow.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-07,"i appreciate this vid. i completely missed the train on rd2, but this vid did an excellent job of helping me appreciate just how excellent of a game it was. on top of that, your videomaking skills shine in this video more than maybe any other of yours i've seen. i was laughing every minute or two but never lost appreciation for how good it is. 648  that is, in fact, a gungowungo type tree, can confirm."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,1503 that introductory description of micah has me wheezing

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"ive played through it a few times, but not for years. however, i still go back to an old save file i have late in chapter 4, where arthur isnt sick, and i have everything unlocked that i can. i just wander around, experience the world, and get into whatever i find. rdr2 is just so many good vibes."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,215 okay you got me with this one.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-15,"dunkey man, i love your takes on videos, you express your feelings in such an entertaining way and the choice of gameplay, editing and music, everything just blends together. brilliant game, great video."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,thank you so so much for making this video. hearing you articulate exactly why i love this game so much years after it's release brings me so much joy.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,"i stopped playing for a long period of time shortly after arthur became ill, something about it just wasn't clicking with me. then i decided to get back into it after my wife brought it up in conversation. i replayed some of the ealier missions to get caught up on the story since i largely forgot what happened. it was when arthur went to round up dept money was the moment i realized the reason why arthur got sick later on in the game, it was because he contracted tuberculosis from thomas downes man he assaulted to get dept money. the reason why arthur got sick was because his loyalty to dutch became a sickness, both literally and spiritually. arthur got sick because he allowed dutch to corrupt his integrity. in order to redeem himself, arthur gives john a future that he never allowed himself to have, even if it was a fleeting moment. realizing that was the moment i decided this game was special. it's not a game you can rush, you have to sit with it to understand the story the game wants to tell. the way the game threads together it's story and themes is masterful. i have never seen a game accomplish it so well."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,"the first redtype video... geez man, this is one of your best. i love how your thoughts ricochet off each other, leading into the next point seamlessly while still keeping me engaged. would love more longform videos like this if ever the mood strikes you."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,"i've been playing rdr2 again these past months very peacefully, taking my time in camp, talking with everyone, and i truly appreciate how dunkey translates all the feelings i experience while playing this mastepeeece. love ya dunk, you are great"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,"350 graphics quite literally peaked with rdr2, theyve objectively been getting worse with each passing year. its remarkable really, that nextgen consoles running any nextgen game you can think of cant even come close to the fidelity of rdr2 running on a launch xbox one vcr player"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"this is good. love the funny, but it's also very dry and serious. this is really well balanced. i'm reminded of your the shining review which really impressed me with its serious tone, and i think you were closer to that in the last rdr2 revisit you did. this one is the best of both world where you have a serious take, but with great comedic asides and inside jokes about the game. well done."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-07,"i really like these type of videos. its not a review or analysis of red dead 2, its a celebration"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,"beautiful video, one of my new favorites for sure. i think the format of cutting between the serious analysis and the funny moments throughout your revisiting of the game works perfectly. so funny yet hits so hard and captures the massive scope of this game into a short time frame. a mastapeece dunk"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,"amazing balance between jokes and admiration for such a great game, while at the same time showcasing some of its flaws. was a bit busy and not willing to see the full video at this moment, but it just hooked me with its great progression. can see you took your time to cook this one, and it shows."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-21,4th comment !!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-12-03,seriously one of the best gaming experiences i've ever had
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-03,never thought i'd say this but arthur is the best character rockstar has ever created. the vocal performance is nothing short of exemplary.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-27,i can't believe this is about 7 years old. this still outranks 98 of games made today
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-06-13,started this in mid of 2024. rdr2 is a bottle of finest wine ever.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-09-30,remember when everyone hated the idea of playing arthur morgan
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-06-08,"guys, do you remember how much nonsense we talked about arthur only in the trailer? i never imagined i would say that, but arthur morgan is my favorite character in the history of video games"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-04-10,"i love that this trailer made arthur look like a dumb angry meathead, then when you actually played the game you realized he was actually very compassionate, poetic, and full of nuance under his tough guy exterior. sometimes the best trailers say very little"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-07,im here watching this in january 2025. one of the best games ever made
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2017-09-30,when games are getting better than movies at making trailers.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-09-05,rockstar do you have my back? fans always rockstar.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-08-12,"maybe when your mother's finished mourning your father, i'll keep her in black, on your behalf. savage"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-02,015 walking into your bosses office come payday
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-07-26,"i remember thinking originally that arthur seemed like the generic jerk protagonist in this trailer and finding him a disappointing choice for a protagonist. oh boy was i wrong, not only was he a fantastic protagonist who you could end the game with him being a massive villain or a relatable but flawed hero but he is one of the greatest video game protagonists of all time."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2017-09-28,this game looks amazing
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-12-03,why am i still getting really excited even though i beat the game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-27,this brought back so much tbh. i remember my dad loved the first one so much thats all he played but when this trailer dropped he was so excited about it and he loved it so much for 8 years straight he played it 100 complete and played it over and over again and i would ask him why this game and he never gave me a straight answer but for years after he got home from work he played it for hours and all up till recently he passed and i kept the ps4 and the case for him so he can still have it and now im playing it and its making me feel like he is watching it with me i miss him a lot and im seeing why he loved this game so much
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-12-21,"i still cant believe it's been 2 years and no other game has even come close to topping this game as far as looks, story, or attention to detail. this is why you let rockstar take their time with stuff, people."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2017-09-29,"you got some money for me, bwoah? rockstar"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-01-27,remember when we thought arthur was a cold hearted sadistic bastard from this trailer?
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-27,just casually getting this trailer recommended to me 7 years later
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-10-20,"030 maybe when your mother is finished mourning your father i'll keep her in black, on your behalf. already one of the best lines in video games."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-09-26,i really want to try playing honorably but this trailer makes arthur look way more badass as an outlaw
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-10-24,lets all be honest there's no way the graphics will look this good
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-20,a masterpiece that can still be played for the next 5 years!!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-09-04,"anyone else feel completely powerful when arthur says i'll keep her in black, on your behalf and then that one guitar strings comes in and your just like ieshegeiwkndbdidhegheiehwvwb"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-10-19,ill keep her in black on your behalf thats ice cold morgan ice cold
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-20,hosea walking away from the burning braithwaite manor is just so badass.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-10-01,"man i never realized the extent of how good the voice acting is. even when he screams wheres are money its not bland screaming, its reinforced with the actual emotion of anger and frustration. rockstar has me seriously sold on this game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-15,036 i will keep her in black in your behalf

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,i still play red dead 2 like it came out yesterday r.i.p arthur morgan
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-12-06,ah i remember seeing this trailer and being bummed because i thought arthur looked like a prick. oh how naive i was.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-05-14,"it has been out for some good 3 years now, and there is still no other game to even be close to the story, open world mechanics, details , and so on, truly a masterpiece"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-13,its almost been a decade. insane to think about that. thank you for some of the best time ive ever had on the game rockstar.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-06-02,"it's incredibly nostalgic to look at this now after experiencing this game and going through so much in life. it not only gave me the best gameplay experience, it gave me something to hang on to, and it may sound silly it made me learn so much about life and what truly matters, how people can change from one second to the other and how unfair it may be. when i lost arthur, a familiar feeling came over me, of grief, that i had never experienced before for a game. it was like he was truly alive and it rendered me numb for a couple of days, and i couldn't believe how deeply i was feeling. rockstar is the best game developer out there and nothing will compete with their storytelling, ever."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-11-02,"me watching this trailer man, arthur looks like a douchebag me after finishing the game we don't deserve you arthur"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-24,"ill never forget coming down off the snowy mountain at the beginning, seeing the valley open up to the detailed expanse for miles and my jaw just dropping. the greatest game ever made, so far."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2022-01-02,"i love how they made arthur look like such a badass but also a bad guy. like i remember the feeling of realizing you are playing as someone that is apart of the gang you had hunted down in the first game and starting to think you're playing as a full on outlaw. especially the way the trailer ended when arthur told dutch he'll always have his back, just hit differently because we knew how horrible of a person dutch was in the first game. finally the game came out and it was nothing short of expectations, truly a masterpiece."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,"use code 'max0r' for 10 off gamer supps httpsgamersupps.ggmax0r hi all! i wanted to include this little bit near the end, but i was rapidly running out of good footage and it was going to break the flow. i couldn't find a place to put this disclaimer on a more nuanced topic with full information in the video itself without breaking the flow. this video contains adaptations of a few memes and jokes from other sources. for instance, the fighting the copies of jack bit at 2412 is from what i believe is an instagram post, and so is the killing the entire gang bit, but often sent to me through so many reposts that it became extremely difficult to research the correct source for them. anyways, these all contain completely unique visuals, context, and followups, and i specifically add things to the jokes or entirely change their premises in order to adapt them to this video. another example of this that i want to be clear about are that i adapt a few memes which have their origin in the subreddit rokbuddyblacklung, thankfully i was actually able to track down the sources of those memes, which have since been reposted and sent to me later. for instance, turquoise purloined embroiling 2 and other color themed names for the game and abdullah morgan began on that subreddit, but i decided that i wanted to add a few things to the joke, add my own entirely unique visuals even the visual for the text saying turquoise purloined embroiling 2 is mine, etc etc etc. so they are different, especially the context and the way they are used, but i just wanted to be clear where my inspiration came from and what i was adapting. this is pretty common stuff, though, i tend to reference internet memes a lot. i like the idea of taking community memes that only exist in the form of images and making them into a video format where people who recognize the joke can see them and, hopefully, people who do not recognize the joke can find the source if they want more. or, in the case of the video memes, i straight up entirely changed the scenes in some cases, and in others, added things that i thought might have made the originals more funny, such as me adding the fact that jack goes flying after being kicked in my version."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-23,these horses aint loyal
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-01,with some sadness in his eyes sorry i'm laughing so hard
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-24,"cant herd, cant swim"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-25,"horses in rdr2 oh crap, every man for themselves horses in rdr1 i'm afraid of dying, but it's a sacrifice i'm willing to make"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-23,the horses in rdr1 still freak out but they dont toss you away like every man for themselves!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-23,i kinda wish the more you swim as john he gets better cuz its a bit annoying not being able to swim in a game where you could swim earlier.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-07,just be glad they didn't make the horses so realistic that they spook at a weird looking tree lol
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,the horse mechanics in rdr2 are just amazing especially in first person
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-23,i love the detail that they turned it around so that they said john cant swim in rdr2 cause you died in rdr1
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-25,that background song though soo nostalgic
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-24,this videos makes me remember the good old days of playing lost saga
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-24,omg the slapping horse detail is so sad in red dead 2 when it approaches you with sadness
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-21,when horses in rdr1 get approached by predators they do not move and do nothing that brotha is dead
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-27,john sinks like a rock in rdr
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-27,i love how rockstar made a limitation in their system a feature for their character.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-07,the horse ass slap is the best feature of rdr2. funniest shit ever when you do it accidentally
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,that lost saga wild west theme hits really hard
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-26,"honestly, before anyone judges me for this trust me, read the whole comment i really like horse games as someone who rides horses in real life and i like looking for realistic details in horse games. i am aware that this game is not specifically a horse game but the fact that there are so many realistic elements to the horses, behaviour and animations is amazing to me. i really like that you have to actually care for the horse in order to maintain their health and stamina. i really like how the horses will spook when they come across predators i like how sometimes even when you fire your gun in the game the horse will spook depending on the horse that you have. i have some horses that will completely stop running if i fire a gun and spook a little bit and i have another horse that will just keep running and doesnt even care when i fire the gun. so, even though i started originally playing this game as i kinda just played it in a free mode version, and it just rode around and caught wild horses and teamed them, and sold them that kind of thing and i did like a little bit of hunting now im actually getting into playing the story mode of the game but like i said, there are so many realistic details to the horses like the fact that if you leave them in water and get off them, theyll get out of the water the fact that they will have steam cum off them if you come from a cold area to a hot area or it might be vice versa im not sure the fact that when it rains you can see your horses coat visibly get wet when you ride through muddy areas your horse visibly gets dirty. all of these things are so realistic but theres such small details i just really like that they put into it and it even though im not. just playing the game for the horse mechanics anymore like i was i still very much i do appreciate them and there are times where i just played free mode and ill just go and tame a bunch of wild horses and sell them or ill just ride around on my horse and do you like trail rides around the area because i do really like the graphics of the game as well. all in all the behaviour for the horses in the second game is just a lot better compared to the first one from what i can see in this one, and i absolutely love the behaviors, the graphics the details that they add to the horses is just perfect."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-29,when john falls into the water like that he's getting snatched by an alligator
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-25,rdr1 will actually protect me like a g
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-20,horse i dont needs to be faster than the predator i just nerd to be faster than you
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-27,also in rdr 1 when your running and whistle the horse would run along side you. in rdr2 the horse will not.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-25,every time i go through the swamps i hunt the alligators and the snapping turtles. and just started doing swamp fishing. doing the hunting and fishing are definitely my favorites this game also has beautiful graphics. i'm glad i have this game.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-18,rdr2 is a sort of life sim with cowboy fantasy
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-02,"i know not many people would recognize that lost saga wild west song. man, the song brings back so many memories, love the game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-10,"the horse you used in rd1 is the preorder war horse, its whole deal is that it doesnt get spooked,"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-09,red dead 2 came out 8 years after red dead 1 so of course its gonna be more realistic
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-16,"its good to see rdr devs, engineers and such are learning and actually putting their knowledge to use each iteration"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-17,john ditched his family for a year and didn't even take a swimming lesson
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-27,the horse was like it's every man for himself
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-13,no wonder i went into the water and my stamina instantly went away..
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,in rdr you could see on the map where the train is. in rdr2 i sadly didn't see this option anymore. it was very useful.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-17,i believe some horses act differently to predators so some get less scared than others
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-23,when i used to play rdr online i got scared to death by the lagras swamp bounty because of the aligatord
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-14,i have played both red dead games and this is completely accurate
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,"horses in rdr1 i will stick with you till the very end horses in rdr2 sorry, homie, every man for himself."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-20,that kick from the horse was personal
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-27,i only owned red dead redemption 1 and a horse called out to me if any type of animal is near me that's dangerous
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-28,danger from afar while being 2ft away from an alligator
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-24,lost saga wild west ost
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-13,what makes me mad is the water in rdr1 looks so good but you cant even go in it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-01,lost saga wild west map theme song
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-28,in rdr2 there is an ability that when you activate the dead eye to shoot something your horse can't throw you off. one of the best ways to hunt legendary animals
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,that nostalgic lost saga wild west song
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,"as an aussie, i approve of the fairy bread!! also i was so looking forward to seeing you try it! however, with fairy bread it's usually better to overdo then underdo it. more sprinkles are usually better."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,"how did i not know that they had bears in rdr1 or that they had other animals like that, i never seen them"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-10,that one mission in rdr1 with jack gave me anxiety as we had to cross a river
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"they have done so well in this game, its mad good."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-17,"first time drowning with john was the last straw for me. i completed the rest of the game quickly and started again with my beloved arthur, currently chilling in chapter 2 without tubercolosi and micah rotting in jail"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-05,nice video
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-01,"in rdr1 when john goes in the water, it looks like he just falls through the map"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-29,i didn't knew that jhon can't swim through out the whole game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-18,"thats why my john always dies in the water,"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-29,the horse also comes when you call it in rdr1 where in rdr2 you spend a good 5mins calling the thing for it to show up
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-27,senior jean esquela in my dreams
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-31,john has got to be able to learn to swim. this needs to be added
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-05,i think different breeds of horses are more sensitive to presatorsgumshots
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-12,we didnt know how good we had it with the horses
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-08,rdr1 horses when they see a predator i'll distract it you run cougars and wolves
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,red dead 1 got that vice city and gta iii water physics
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-31,john doesn't fall into a hole. it's the place where the water is if you try it in other locations like el presidio you can go until the water fully passes over his head
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,slapping the horse on the ass and getting kicked is killing me
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-03,"just recently completed rdr1 and rdr2, gonna say they are both amazing games"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-13,i still feed my horse even if the core is full. and then before the chains of the last mission i sell it before buying a cheap one so my horse i cared for doesnt die
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-26,"one time when i was on rdr2, i was in the epilogue, i didnt have any weapons bc i couldnt buy any, i only had my knife, and then i was going to do a mission but a cougar ambushed me and my horse bucked me off, i ran to my horse 2 times but she kept bucking me off. so i tried stabbing the cougar with my knife but of course it ate me lol"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-12,i remember when i landed in a spot where the water did not kill me
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-29,"bruh a man like that cant swim, i remember when i was like 89 i kept forcing him in the water in the first one, i got angry and was so confused. i was probably thinking why doesnt this grown man know how to swim honestly was so annoyed, and dumb enough to keep trying."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-19,"my black shire raven in story mode, my first play through was such a good horse, i miss him  i was looking at my phone once, and looked back at the telly and there was a pack of wolves coming for me, but my shire didnt buck me off at all"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,oh so that explains hwy my horse ditched me into a pack of mounttain lions
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-31,"yeah, the horses in rdr1 were completely brainless, lol. rdr2 is really more realistic, but it's naggy when the horse throws the gamer from the back, especially when predators are near. man, i can't tell how many times my horse threw me right on top of another animal, thanks for that horsey."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-19,you are using lost saga wild west theme. respect
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-01,i thought my horse drops me off when it sees a predator cause its timid natured but guess all horses do it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-06,one thing i hate about one to two is the horse if youre riding the horse at super speed you get thrown off a lot faster because i guess its tired and i cant breathe but in red dead redemption two this usually does not happen
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-26,riding a horse in the bayous is annoying

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,this is the closest we can ever get to the full final episode of woody's roundup.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-12-19,"this was mesmerizing, the way he fits each scene and the dialogue so well, all the physical interactions. where's my jaw? oh yeah, on the floor."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-11-07,woody looks so out of place and yet fits so well. the fact it's revealed that all of this was just a kid's imagination is such a good touch.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,that's the trash... woody can remain wholesome and still destroy a mans ego in 3 words or less.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-30,seeing woody swinging away at micah made my day
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,"okay i havent seen toy story 4 or intend to, but the eye movements of woody at 100 are just gold. ghe animators definitely enjoyed working with him."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,"this was incredible, loved every second of it. i love how the ending makes it seem like this is a part of jack's imagination given how much he enjoyed stories in the game. brilliant work!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,this is probably jacks reenactment of how arthurs adventures went. i know the toy itself isnt from the 1890s but it has some serious symbolism. im probably going too deep.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-26,i love how woodys giving john parenting advice  edit woah thats a ton of likes lol

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-12-23,seeing jack pick up woody at the end was brilliant
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,"i thought it couldn't get any better, but having jack play with woody at the end really tied it all together. good show."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,ok. couple things. 1. you cant show those ending moments of rd2 and not have me get a bit emotional. 2. that transition at the end where hes picked up by jack?  so smooth.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-12-05,i stumbled across this completely by accident. i'm so thankful i did.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-26,"that ending, from sad to precocious. fantastic work."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-13,you are just such a talented compositor. the lighting has gotten so good in some of these shots.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,as a passionate fella once said you can't rush art. beautiful!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,"020 woody is smart, he knows the best way to avoid a grizzly bear attack is to play dead."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,oscar level editing. not that any award would be able to hold a light to your work. great stuff!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-21,"your editing is astounding, but you need more praise for how incharacter you have everyone act within the worlds you put them in. woodys' interactions with the gang all feel right. he'd definitely try and convince john to be responsible to jack, he'd be buddies with arthur and wouldn't stand for dutch or micah."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-11-04,the animation and the interaction is soo good. awesome job
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-27,this was absolutely brilliant and it blended very well it looked soooo smooth! ill never understand how people are this talented
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,"great to have woody's origin story for once. buzz gets all the credit of having a cool history, but imagine rdr3 if woody was still around!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,i like how the nun asks if woody is okay and showing the same coloration of the eyes that woody also has tb.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-01,"love the fact that the animations to get woody to grab the lever on the train, or when he ragdolls to escape the bear is so clean"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,"this crossover is simultaneously so unexpected, yet so fitting! all the scenes are perfect!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-31,the way you made woody interact with the flowers is so good.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,"i love the thought put into this. 034 works as a good gag against micah, but cutting to the friends about to do something horrible is just perfect."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,it never fails to amaze me at how perfectly you can find scenes to mesh together. the character interactions are of just an otherworldly quality
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-11-02,"117 for an edit, this made me a little bit tearyeyed."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-22,bro this is so well made

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-26,"its amazing just how he has a dialogue for every important step in the story of the game. i mean you could fit all these into any other important part, say, downes ranch or the assault at braithwaites manor."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,this was funnier than i expected. the edits are too perfect
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-31,dude this whole thing is so well edited. i completely forgot it wasn't real. this is the best i've seen.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-07,genius !
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-26,114 i agree with woody
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-25,"i can't believe how terribly welledited this turns out, love this one 110  121"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-06-17,astonishingly well done! my hat is off to you sir!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-27,having woody in the rougher side of wild west doesn't seem so strange either. well done
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-11-03,words cannot describe how incredible the editing in this is.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-01-08,i love how he played triggernometry

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,still playing rdr2
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,dude 6 years later it is still the best looking game ever made.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"in my 40 years of gaming and playing countless games, rdr2 is by far the most detailed and immersive game ive ever played. a true masterpiece. im on my 7th playthrough on story and level 140 online. the only thing bad about rdr2 is it has ruined all other games for me. even though i have about 400 games in my library, rdr2 is all i want to play. its all ive played for the last 2 12 years."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"i play for the world. not new content, not for multiplayer. my extent of interacting with others is the occasional hat tip greeting, helping out a delivery or gun fight with npcs. rest of the time i just want to be left alone to do my thing"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,crazy how players are still going. i wish this game was supported. such a good game. hope all is well with you my friend.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"i'm level 365 as of today and still love this game. sometimes i grind for stuff, other times i just chill and ride around and see what happens. perfect game for me"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"i've just came back to rdo. not much to do, but riding our good steads with the boys is still fun."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"i'll be 15 in 2025. i discovered this game when i was 12 2022 i adored cowboys all my life so i instantly installed it and played it. took me 4 months to complete i was too busy doing side activities  i think rdr2 is needed for someone to mature and grow up, the game taught me why life is so precious and why to not take anything for granted."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"cat...thank you for the continued support. for some us, this is more than just a game. im almost 50...my son introduced me to rdr2 a few years ago. it's a nostalgic opportunity to be one of the characters from movies  tv we always wanted to be while growing up."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-14,"after a stressful day, i come home and sit on my rdr2 game and i saved a spot in chapter 6 when arthur is healthy and hunting and riding on buell, and fishing and after a couple of hours i feel like a new person....the game is a masterpiece ...... and i'm 61 years old !!!!!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,i feel sorry for people who are not into games. they have no idea what they are missing out on. best game ever made
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,i returned to red dead online a few days ago and i still love this game it didn't feel like playing a game it felt like i entered a different world
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,this is the only game i play anymore. none of the newer games stir my interest.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"i've played games since pong. i prefer openworld games, but rdr2 is the only game i feel homesick for if i don't play. story mode or online, the world they created is one i feel comfortable in. a beautiful work of modern interactive art! thanks for continuing to point this out, cat. keep it fun folks!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,old game ugh...i've been working 7 days a week for about 9 years and had to put everything on hold. it feels so strange to hear about a game i was looking forward to playing being old.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,i'll tell you why. because this game looks goddamn impossibly good like wtf? i simply can't understand how this game looks so good it pissed me off sometimes. i can go through the same forest i've crossed 30 times and still get a different vibe because the weather and lighting system of this game is just ridiculous. it's insane. i cannot wrap my head around how they did it. how did this run on a ps4????? love you pvpcat
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"same, level 682, not stopping anytime soon. love it, will play it for ever. cowboys for life"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,rdr2 is a work of art. people will keep looking for it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-20,"playing rdo, with beers, solo session and spotify is perfection thats why, so chill"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"i reached rank 1000 yesterday, and ill still continue playing this beautiful game"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-09,"been holding off and holding off wanting to play this since release, bought this 3 weeks ago , and what have i missed even today this is a masterpeice by any standards"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,just recently replayed on pc to get 100 and it honestly just made me sad seeing everything rockstar gave up on
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-13,ive played through 3 times and the end still gets me. arthur is such a great complex character. best ive ever seen.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"they can never make me hate rdr2, but rdr2 made me hate rockstargames. hope gta6 will wash up their sins. outlaws4life"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"the storytelling in gta has often taken a backseataside from the standout example of gta ivto focus on immersing players in a sandbox filled with endless possibilities. the emphasis is more on how much chaos you can unleash, with missions serving as a secondary layer of engagement. rdr is all about the narrative. its primary goal is to channel the atmosphere of classic western films, placing you in a very detailed open world that prioritizes storytelling and immersion. i find myself engaging with these two game series in completely different ways. in gta, i try to cause as much mayhem as possibleblowing up cars and orchestrating massive shootouts, testing how long i can outlast the police. on the other hand, rdr inspires a more thoughtful, roleplaying approach. i tend to imagine how john or arthur would live their lives, allowing me to slip into their shoes and approach the game with a more characterdriven playstyle."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,playing rdr2 again and enjoying it. bought a 32 inch screen for the immersion. the best part of the game is that it seems real. no spells or magic or leaping off buildings or soaring through the air or zombies or other monsters. just real people making good and bad decisions and living with the consequences. heightened real life. nice. thank you rockstar.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-20,"yea i agree, i have around 2k hours on the game and still not bored with my character i just ride and explore the map"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"i played rdo way back when, but i just returned on dec. im having a blast after a slow start. i can see how it can be stale after finishing each role. but, right now, im loving it!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-14,"played rdr2 for the first time summer 2024 and was obsessed! i don't recall ever having cried so much for characters in a game since i was a kid. i cried for about 2 weeks after i finished the game, every time i thought about the ending. i still get teary eyed by that particular scene you showed, and had to fastforward as i'm at work right now, haha. this became my all time favorite game ever, and i just started getting into red dead online properly and super excited about it, even if it's dead."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"iam lvl 366 and play it when it was beta,now finally i try it again and fall in love again,6 days without griefing, sry german my english is not the best,keep up your good work,thx cat for the entertainment"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,i truly love this game but as veteran who played it since pretty much realise i really do wont to play it again but its just the lack of contentupdates thats not making to come back
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"i love this game, the problem of this game is i get forced to play on private community server cause of hacker invasion in the public online"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"story mode is still one of the best openworld rpgs, with a story as good if not better than any movie made in the last decade. most of the time, an openworld game has a story that feels weak and tacked on, and a game with a great story is often not openworld. while it's sad that rockstar squandered the multiplayer possibilities, the story mode is simply unmatched."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,about 40 games in my steam library. used to play a dozen of them on a regular basis. then i found rdr2online. quit playing all the other games. rdr2o is literally all i need. used the  because i go back and forth between story and online modes.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-06,to be honest i done the story about 10 times and i'm still playing story mode and online this is truly the most beautiful and best open world game ever in my opinion
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,just came here to say i quit playing last year but came to check in on your channel today as i used to watch every upload of yours. thank you for continuing the red dead content still as ive seen a couple move onto other games.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-04,i just came back to platinum this masterpiece. feeling like its my 1st walkthrough
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-07,bro called it old. quite broke poor mammy's heart
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"i bought this game ages ago, but never played it until now. saw plenty of others play it, but never got into it myself. i looked and i have 3.5 total hours in it. that said, someone got me into a role play server and i'm fast learning i may have to play the actual game. seems like i've missed a gem for sure."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-20,yep. still playing this game. each time changing and challenging myself through the missions
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,i think many people fail to realize this is not that kind of game which just dies. rdr2 is rockstars minecraft.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,i played this game endless when it came out and still gonna buy it again after 5 years hope it will be a good choice
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,the camp interaction with mb is one of my favs also.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-17,literally the most detailed game having most immersive story. to think that this game was released in 2018 is giving more hype on the details that gta6 is gonna have.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,i will never forget this game. 1010 masterpiece.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,i just don't think this game can be topped just feels too much like a real life experience
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-04,"i just bought rdr2 on steam on my brand new pc since its on sale for only 15 right now, and itll be my first time ever playing it! im definitely excited to give it a go, ive never played a singleplayer campaignbased game before, ive always been a pvp multiplayer fan, but im starting to wanna branch out cause it gets tiring at times always tryna sweat to have fun and win those games"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,im re playing the story rn. in the beginning i was intimidated by the shire size and stuff to do in the game. i got all the way to chapter 3 and moved to rd2 online. its was bare bones but i dumped so many hours into it. glad i'm replaying it again in 2025 and it simple hits different compared to gtagta online.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-02,second play through since 2018. unreal. what a feeling this game gives you. 20 hours in and ive only completed about 4 main missions haha. amazing immersive experience. exploring the map.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,"i just began my second playthrough last weekend, and i can't wait to hop back on it this weekend! there's so much i missed the first time around."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,its not just a game. its a way of life.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-18,i completed the story a year ago and am already getting nostalgia from it. that just goes to show hoe amazing it was. nothing will ever be able to compete with it.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-18,"i just watched your legendary animal guide, man how much youve grinded starting from having a crappy mic to now."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-05,"the reason why i still play rdr2 is because it is a masterpiece. the best game made in the last 10 years and among the best games ever made. details, story, gameplay, everything is 1010. not many games come up to this level"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"i still playing red dead online, and loving playing it. the players in freeroam are relax than gta online and more fun to interact with. i still hope that this game will get a upgrade to curent gen consoles. for now it feels like the old version of 7 days to die, this console version of that game got no updates for a long time  telltale games was broke and only bq the large player base still playing, we got a next gen upgrade. i hope red dead redemption will be the same."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-19,"i don't consider 5 year games are old, i don't know, perhaps it's because i'm not young anymore but 5 year feels like yesterday to me."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"for me, its the greatest game ever made which makes it even more unbelievable why rockstar would abandon such a unique and special game"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"back in the day we were spoiled for choice with western themed games like gun, red dead revolver and call of juarez all releasing within a few years of each other. now however rockstar completely dominates the cowboy western themed genre with no other publishers pushing out a game to compete with it. with that in mind that is one of the reasons people keep playing rdr2 as its all we have in a market dominated by rockstar."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-06,just started another playthrough and going strong in chapter 2. this will always be my favourite game.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-06,"damn i can't believe i'm alive to see someone put the term old on this game, by far this gem is kicking the industry upcomings a lot and then i realize i will be 20 the next year damn"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,i'm playing it again because i've upgraded my pc. in 4k this game is awesome.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-28,"the world in rdr2 is very dynamic. everytime you go back to it, there is something new and you feel immersed in the amazing ecosystem."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-08,"i found out about rdr2 in december 2023, i bought it off steam at like 20 bucks, i did not leave my house for a week after the first playthrough. i finished the story mode twice on low and high honor with all side missions as well. but i spent a bunch of time just enjoying the game, hunting, killing npcs, riding, etc. now i just started another playthrough and i want to finish only the main story without any side missions, and then complete them with john."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-19,got the vr mod for it. i just like jumping in the game and explore the world from time to time. quick getaway from this urban life.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-17,"rockstar made this masterpiece for 8 years just to abandon it, no 60fps patch on current gen, no updates or dlc for red dead online. this game also deserves the love gta v gets"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-03,"how abandoned is you said. man, this game was made with so much love that it didnt need anything else afterwards. no dlcs or new content. the game is just perfect. in addition, its probably the best looking game so far."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"having this on my youtube frontpage is funny, i recently started lmao."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,"as someone who has a hard time getting immersed in games, i felt very immersed in this game. much like i did when i was a kid."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"started playing rdo again lvl 75. there just something relaxing and soothing about the game. i usually do legendary bounties and hunting and i just love taking my time with the game and just taking it all in. im lvl 300 in gtao and in that game i just try to rush everything to get things done as quickly as possible but rdo, i soak it all in."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-15,thats crazy i literally restarted to complete it one last time love this game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"just started the story for the first time, ive had the game since pc release over 1000 hours in online and probably just as much in redm waited all the way til i got a new pc to play story because i knew it would be way better with beautiful graphics"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-28,"mate it happens i started playing this game again so i can actually finish it. i am amazed of how much better this game looks than most new games. even these dramatic conversations, npcs always have something to say. this game is amazing."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"best game ever made, in my opinion. it's certainly my favourite. i own it on xbox, i own it on playstation, and i recently bought it for pc during the winter sale and i'm about to play it through again for the umpteenth time. at 60fps dutch's plan has to work... right?"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"immersion  beautifully crafted open world  incredible stories and characters  best protagonist of all time?  little to no bugs  side content bounties, missions etc is s tier  timeless"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,this game is one of the most realistic games and beautiful games ive ever played. but there are so many bugs in red dead online that is annoying. i wish rockstar could remove them.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"game so good gave me carpel tunnel, yeehaw, pardner"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,the youtuber bw4yne was promoting a mod menu for rdr2 and even accepted a sponsorship. when i confronted him on his life chat i was told by another user likely a mod because he said he personally spoke to bw4yne tried to convince me that mod menu no longer works with rdr2 online but i can confirm it still does. im mentioning this because i have zero respect for content creators like him and the world of respect for creators like you. thankyou for always keeping our hopes up. you have inspired me to be a better player and exposing hackers and griefers. i uploaded my 1st video on griefers and will keep posting because there will never be a lack of content.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,i finished the game over a year ago but never played the online until about 34 months ago and i was amazed all over again at how brilliant it is. i'm up to 195 now and logon every day and i still have more to see.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-18,the disc stays in my ps4.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-21,"i was playing rdr2 back in 2020 on my ps4 i haven't played rdr1 by the way so it was my first rdr. i mean the graphics were stunning, the huge and diversity open world with all the different climates even on my ps4. now i'm thinking about to get the game for my computer cause i don't own my ps4 anymore and play online with a friend of mine."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-28,i recently returned to gaming but only for this game. nothing else really comes close
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,i want the next video to be why ppl are still playing red dead2 online in 2040...lol. i love this game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"i confess that i played the pirate for the first time. but after i completed everything i could offline, i bought the full game to play online. that's more than 730 hours of online alone, and i still love it. and i just want to play it more."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,"i played rdr online less than two hours. and today, after playing story mode for 4030 hours i forgot how many times i replayed it and still love it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,"while i couldn't fathom playing rdo. the story mode is a relaxing experience once in a blue moon, but there's only so many times one can experience the exact same thing and still find enjoyment"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,"started playing rdr2 for the third time this week but with minimal hud this time, no map."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,hi cat when are you gonna be live streaming again btw great video
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-06,i finished yesterday the first one from 2010. cant wait to play the second!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-26,"was just checking this on steam graphs, and rdr2 just broke the peak players record on steam again. 99.7k on the last 30 days february 2025."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-30,"gave a second chance about 1 week ago, after a while at first i didnt liked the game man, i left off at middle of chapter 2, now i just started chapter 5 and i just can't stop playing, enjoying everything about the gameplay, the fights, the ambience. amazing game"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-07,"i just went to pick this up on pc since i purchased one after playing through twice on my ps4. to my astonishment the singleplayer story mode is still 59euro. safe to say i will find an alternative route. i hope people remember cockstars conduct long after this business with rdr2online, the gta overhaul mods and so much more. assuming they will even continue to produce compelling content. we will see."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-07,"the game is still the best looking game but in the aspect of overall distanced views, specifically checking how the ground looks and stuff shows imperfections like the textures or less polygons other games are now better at, but overall it still hits the eye better most of the times"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-03,"it's not that old when you consider that grand theft auto online is still played by millions of people, the witcher still played by millions of people, and even skyrim is played by millions of people. classics will always be classics and will always stand the test of time."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-01,"i bought it last month, idk why i thought i wouldnt like it but i actually love it"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,what rockstar should do is. release rdr2 on ps5. faster load up screens and have the tresor de morts and rhodes bank robbery on the game.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"i preordered rdr2 the first day it was available. i finished the single player barely a year ago. the final scene that you showed was the one i got. when i finished rdr, i was like dang! the cops did john marston dirty. at the end of rdr2, i just teared up. it was the best ending i had ever seen in any game by far."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-29,im on my 4 playthrough and i still find new things
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-09,just realized its going on nearly a decade since read dead redemption 2 came out
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,"graphically on ultra settings, still one of best looking games available. it seems the graphics engine rockstar games has developed is incredibly powerful. remember, rdr 2 came out in late 2018."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,i'm still playing in full lobbies on ps network.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-27,there are two kinds of people people who love red dead people who don't know red dead
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-28,dutch isn't talking about killing micah. he's talking about his final move against the pinkertons and leviticus cornwall. and the army. that final move was robbing the train carrying payload.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-05,idk why but the while he is playable made me break into tears
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-06,fun fact. that chess opening dutch played is called dutch defence
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-27,"im sure that in paradise, peacefully departed arthurs eyes are blood shot because tb is a disease of the lungs, so humidity would most likely cause it to worsen"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,"his eyes are bloodshot because at the start of that mission arthur's physical condition becomes unwell, and then in the mission the fork in the road becomes tuberculosis. hope i'm useful"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-06,the best part about red dead is every play through has been something completely different with a crazy amount of different interactions i love it and always look forward to finding the new things
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-26,i have a...i have no plan
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-28,id bet rockstar themselves didn't even think of that last one
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-16,that last one feels like a stretch
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-10,great content creator keep going
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-27,have u mentioned that in a fine night of debauchery if u wear a fancy outfit before the mission there will be special dialoge

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-16,i got red vest
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-23,"arthur gave him life and he gave life to his family, his son"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-24,you cannot live a bad life and expect good things to happen to you  arthur morgan
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-02,at least john saw his family one last time before death. but arthur saw his father figure betray him in his last moments. that's what makes arthurs death so sad
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-23,john only had 4 years of real happiness  not including his childhood
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-23,only 4 years...
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-23,"arthur's life is just sadness and loss, which makes john's death more depressing, because he finally made it, changed, lived a happy life, john's redemption just hits different."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-25,it all started with an hug it all ended with one too
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-25,rest in peace uncle may there be no lumbago in heaven
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-24,"honestly rdr1 john scares me, rdr2 john is you're friendly next door neighbor"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-03,"uncle died protecting johns family. they are not bonded by blood, but theyre still family to uncle. rip, the oneshot kid"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-18,john's redemption arc in rdr2 hits different. arthur morgan's life was filled with sadness and loss.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-24,this is an example that everything can vanish in a blink of an eye..
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-23,one of your best john edits tbh
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-15,you saved my life more than once. to give mine for yours is as it should be eagle flies
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-30,"rip arthur morgan, still crying to this day"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-28,just 4 years of peace...
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-24,to put it into perspective of how sad it is rdr1s story is way closer to the epilogue than the epilogue is to the prologue of rdr2. that is just sad that it was only 4 years of happiness 4 years!!! thats the same amount of time as the start of covid was to now.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-07,rdr2 epilogue makes rdr1 even sadder than it already was...
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-23,i will always cry. jack will always be lonely.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-25,the epilogues in rdr2 are truly awsome
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-24,man those 4 years were the only time john got to rest
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-08,antagonizing uncle as john he sayshow many years you got left uncle? 34 years? it refers to his death at rdr1
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-25,the worst part is some of those last years were spent trying to fight back against the life he previously lived instead of watching his family grow into the new life arthur herded them into.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-07,when the time is run away and don't look back arthur morgan 1899
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-23,using everybody wants to rule the world adds a whole nother level of pain to this

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-30,no man can walk out on his own story.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-04,it breaks my heart knowing my two favourite protagonists didnt get their happy ending

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-27,this is a true survivor micah
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-10,thing bout arthur is that he not only redeemed himself but he showed others how to as well. those 4 years john spent were to redeem himself so he doesnt die a terrible father and husband that nobodyd miss. mr marston died a man who lives and dies by family because arthur showed him the value of brotherhood and familial bonds.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-16,dam this one hits different
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-25,"rdr2 is such a fantistic game. i know alot of people dont like the epilogue but it one of my favorite parts of the game. it ties everything into rdr1 so well. i love helping john get beecher hope established but its so bitter sweet, knowing john only has a little bit of time before the sins of his past come calling."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-18,i don't know what happened but i knew when i read the pictures. i understand it now
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-24,"i honestly think john crapped all over arthurs work and he gave john good advice about revenge being a fools game,which costed john his freedom and his peace and then his life"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-30,its sad how this story is and then you remember they arent real but yet again they are so real
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-19,i want rdr3 with young arthur morgan stories  i want play that character once again in another game. it made me feel so powerful and proud of myself. even more powerful than any superhero games or magical games.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-24,that last scene hits hard
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-29,"i just completed the game and i was crying, the game is at its prime, it's the most majestic game i've ever played."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-10,great edit
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-21,2 best friends died heroes
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-08,i love it bro i hope you can do on arthur
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-16,"im so glad that my dad its playing rdr2 now, hes really into it, and with the release of the first game on ps4, ill try to convince him to play the first game too, pray for me fellers, i got a gods work to do"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-25,nothing ever lasts forever
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-02,nostalgia goes crazy rn
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-27,not gonna lie in that one clip john looks like hes about to do something devious
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-20,it was so sad when he died rip
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-13,its sad because ive played both games and i was tearing up when arthur and john died
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,100 years later people still finding new details in rdr2
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-01,"rdr2 is so life like realism, just look at the fiery hooves from the horse"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-11,drops of sweat literal fucking fire
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,arthur casually riding a rapidash.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-31,"another fact is if you remove the saddle on a sweaty horse it shows foamy swear which is released in horses if they're overexerted, and the singing fact can happen randomly when riding slowly. don't know what causes it though"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,that horse reminds me of cowboy ghost rider
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,the knife detail is pretty cool. i've been playing red dead again and noticed that when i got into the water after playing the knife game you could see the blood spreading out
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,did you know if you cut your finger it will bleed ahh fact
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-21,i love when he starts singing. its so wholesome
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-13,"rdr2 was 8 years ago, imagine what gta 6 would be like."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-17,"sir, your horse is on fire, like .. literally"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-18,effort exerted seems to be the definition of this game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-14,i have horses myself in real life and the red dead has the sweat foam that horses get when running a long time i didnt notice it until recently they nailed it. edit the foam will be around the border of a saddle and under it. its white and easier to see on a black horse
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-28,bro i sware im not the only one that thought there was something on my phone but it was just his logo
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,i noticed the lasso one way too much trying to catch the white arabian
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-09,"wow, old train track look old and new ones look new."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,that bullet in the end sounds like one of the sfx used for the menu in red dead revolver
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-19,my uncle a mf demon at the knife one
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-09,the ricochet sound the bell made my day
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-05,realism proceeds to show me a clip where a man is riding a burning horse
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-11,ah yes horse with fire effects on their hooves is so realistic!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,"the fact the bell makes a different pitch sound depending on where you shoot it is just crazy a lot of thought went into that itself, let alone coding that."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-05,"i found a neat detail in the moonshine camps  if you shoot a barrel connected to a still, gas comes out, but if you shoot a disconnected barrel, its full of liquid shine"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,youll notice sweat on the horse . the horse leg literally on fire
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,"fun fact, if you ride your horse 300 kmh, its hooves will spontaneously catch fire."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-03,he loses stamina if u hold on to the animal . you can see that in your littles circle thing in the corner.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-28,hey those big animals drag me dude..!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-21,i heard classic western sounds when you shot that bell
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-06,rdr 2 is living.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-11,just realized. next year rdr2 will be as old as rdr1 was one when rdr2 came out.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,the horse may be sweating because of the fire at it's feet
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,i just found out recently if john is drunk by himself walking he will start singing oh my darling
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-08,if arthur rides a horse for a long time hell walk kind of funny for a while after he gets off it apparently
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-05,arthur sings if you're trotting on your horse
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,chef  hey arthur is that horse leg done yet? arthurno its not done yet. gotta make couple more round and its done
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-16,am i the only one that realized that the sound in the bell is the same of red dead revolver?
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-10,bro.. your horse is burning
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-14,arthur will sing also when hes drunk
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,also you get permanent scars if you mess up enough in 5 finger filet
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,i think the sweat is more so from the flaming legs.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-17,heres another i was pushing my horse in the mountains where there is snow and you can see the steam rolling of the horse because of how hot it is
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,...carter slade... can you keep up? horse neighs ...lets ride ghostriders in the sky by johnny cash intensifies r.i.p to a legend
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,did you know that we breathe ahh vid
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,its crazy how realistic rdr is and its even crazier to think about how much better gta 6 will be
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,the bell sounds like  honor sound effect
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,if tell no show was a video
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-13,the sound changes based on where it struc
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-10,the scars also stay from stab wounds
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,if artur gets cut he bleeds
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,did you know in red dead redemption if he gets stabbed you start bleeding
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,the horse got that nft
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,this game has goldeneye sound effects when you shoot bells? who knew the game could get any better?
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-04,i hope gta 6 gets a lot of realism just like rdr2
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-18,his bead is as big as the bison
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,the sit suspension on wagon is working
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,look at me grogu
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,100 year's later rdr 2 vs rdr 10
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,"you guys im 4445 years old and just started playing. for one i think this is the best game ever made. two, i absolutely love the whole red dead community! some of the best people. all other platforms suck! ive met nothing but bad asses! may the first true god bless you all."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-09,funny how they added all this crazy shit but cans dont even move when you shoot them
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,has anyone realized that the horses hooves are on fire
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,"it's a cool effect, but horses don't really sweat like that. while yes, horses are one of the few animals that also sweat, their sweat normally gets foamy. it's very odd."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-06,more proof that rdr2 is the best rockstar game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,and his finger will have wounds that slowly heal from the knife strikes.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-12,no one is talking about the horses legs being on fire
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-09,this is the most realistic game ive ever played
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-04,wow this is so much information
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-14,"i love this game,so realiatic and beautifull ,i have to replay it"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,talking about realism but the horse isn't even a horse anymore
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,this game was so realistic and lifelike that i literally deleted it.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,rdr2 is virtually incredible. you have to wonder why rockstar show no love for it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-29,i will never understand why this game didnt win game of the year
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,when this game first released back in 2018 i knew there would be never another rdr 2 or any games equal to this level maybe it can happen but some of might leave at the time
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,if arthur farts  u can smell  it through the screen  to add a touch of realism
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,they spent 5 years making the most realistic game ever only to give the next gen update to a game 5 years older than it.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,the first detail was in rdr 1 as well.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,"erm actually, horses can't sweat"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,picture of rdr2 normal rdr2 players just the normal beautiful map. news this beautiful picture of the world
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-17,last sound was goldeneye n64
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-14,and this showed how good gta 6 is gonna be
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-07,horse may need to change the breakpads
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,"rockstar really is something else, i dont know how they do it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,i wish online had this stuff
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,i thought i was the only one with message over the timer
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,"he said if you play as aurthor but the clip was john, your welcome for this very useful detail"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-06,why is bro casually riding a demon horse?
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,never seen a fire horse
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-07,love this game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,isn't the bullet hitting the bell sound from for a few dollars more?
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,"wow, did you figure that all by yourself?"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-06,i find it funny how you have no proof about supposed train track vibrations nor arthurs apparent singing.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,horses sweat a foamy sweat so its not entirely realistic
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-05,ok so nobody is talking about that the horse is on fire??
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-08,did you know that animals dont sweat
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,i have over 1000 hours with this game. im legit an expert and cant get enough of it. oddly enough ive never done low honor run. i just cant get myself to do it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,imagine the insane details gta 6 will have !!!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-10,bro i can't understand what's happening wheater to understand you or the video
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,"something ill never understand is why would rockstar put this much detail into a game just to never update it ever like i just got the game back in 2021 and they still have every glitch from when the game first dropped. money glitches, the stable glitch, etc"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,"these details are impressive. but after seeing a bunch of youtube shorts of things that rd2 lacks that the first game has, i'd much rather they didn't waste time on these small details that have nothing to do with gameplay. the physics in the first game were much better when you shot some one, the way they reacted and crawled on the ground. much more important for a game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-12,"hey bud i think your horse is on fire, unless that's normal"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-20,looks like bro just started the playing rdr2
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-01,"this isn't cut content, this is just lore"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-06,"john marston also said he had a daughter who died in the first game, but it's never spoken of ever again."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-29,"they didn't get along, but arthur gave his last moments fighting for john, and john came back killing micah for arthur"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-28,"lets directly quote dutch we all had her, john married her. no like, no subscribe, enough people wasting my time. click bait"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-28,"this is all learned through dialogue in both rdr and rdr2. just because it wasn't shown in game, doesn't make it cut content. that would be things like the character models for arthur's lover and her baby, which were later used for francis sinclair's mother and the baby she was holding."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-25,where is the cut content?
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-25,"there is an unused character named dr. lane higgins who was leftover in the files alongside his voicelines, he would've served as the subject of a cut stranger mission set on guarma"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-06,damn abigail was passed round the whole gang in 1889
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-06,we all had her this means that pretty much every man smashed abigail including arthur
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-20,"people who played rdr 1, knows the real john marston."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-18,"plot twist in rdr3  jack marston is actually jack morgan, hes arthurs son"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-12,"ah yes, the most tragic cut content of them all established lore"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-27,jack nickname in spanish would be el tres leches because abigail did had the milk of almost the whole gang
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-29,"everyone says javier is the father, but i think uncle is the father."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-26,thete is a difference between backstory and cut content. you need to show that rockstar originally intended to include this content in rdr2.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-25,this isnt even cut content
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-28,to all the people who are saying this wasnt cut put you are wrong yes it was all mentioned that john left for a year ect. but it was never mentioned in the game that abigail was a prostitude wich was sleeping with the whole gang. and johns thoughts of not being jacks real father makes a lot more sense with that information
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-02,"if you read arthurs journal he mentions how he thought about marrying abigail but couldn't get over mary, implying there was something between him and abigail before she hooked up with john."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-28,arthur's drip tho
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-16,"the fact they all ran through her, makes johns choice to disappear for a while more understandable."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-25,rdr3 should be the whole story before rdr2 especially the cut content  and abigail joining the gang
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-14,roger clark explaining how all of this is what happens in the game. ai chatbot nuh uh
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-25,this is just lore
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-11,this is literally all explained through dialogue in the main missions of rdr2 lmao
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-27,bro just explained john's and abigail story these darn ai shorts
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-14,"you could see abigail was worried, john was to uncertain  poor jack was depressed smh"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-15,this all comes to a conclusion that john marston shouldve married bonnie mcfarlane instead of abigail.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-09,dutch we all had her. john married her.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-02,abigail being a working girl isn't cut lmao. it's hinted many times of abigails past
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-30,we allll had her.. john married her damn that sht hurt me  thats not even one of my huzz
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-02,this is quite literally just lore lmfao
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-22,not sure why they cut that about abigail dutch mentions it in 1 id have loved the consistency of it being in both
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-27,proof that arthur was a better than john ever was
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-21,"i always thought it was hilarious how abigail left john towards the end of rdr2 . dude was simping , while the doctor was dicking her down . she heard he got a house and some land and went right back lol"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-09,"this isn't cut content it's just part of the story. it was never going to be playable, but all of it is mentioned and referenced in the game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,sorry to pinned comment guy but its just wrong. none of this was cut. ive seen no mention anywhere from devs saying they originally planned for this stuff to be in the game and it would have made no sense to make it in the first place because all of this was years before the events of rdr2. exposition isnt the same thing as cut content
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,cut content and its literally something we already know because it was discussed by characters in game at length. lmfao
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,they sholl said guess whos dutch favorite now talkin about micaj
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,meanwhile john marston in rdr1
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,jack is the spitting image of micah...
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-29,arthur never ever hated john
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,ive seen this story beforesays robert devule
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-05,abigail was gettin trains ran on her daily apparently. what a trooper
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,well guess what. arthur!! youre my brother i know
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-01,jack is the son of dutch
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-21,that's uncles kid
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-07,"not cut content , ppl who played this , we all knew this"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-06,basically the plot would've been 1000x longer because of the errands she'd send you on..
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,abigail looking like a snack in the thumbnail
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-13,you cant call cut content if its canonically confirmed
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-26,yeah it was arthurs son! jack
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-09,"i knew that woman was for the street, i knew it"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-26,none of that was cut from the game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-12,lmfao this was all in rdr2 every last bit. its all talked about at camp.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-26,pure clickbait. that's a minute of my life i'll never get back.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-26,"if you know rdr 1 you will notice that it played after the second part so it cant be possible that rockstar said john wantet to leave his kid, because it was clear that this was not going to happen like 8 years earlier"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-26,"javier escuellas name is canonically pronounced escuela, which makes no fucking sense in spanish."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-16,this what makes a story a story emotions
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-26,this isn't cut content it's just lore it's all true
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-26,john should've never came back. he could've started a family elsewhere. abigail belittled him every chance she got. abigail annoyed me to no end. the first red dead could've easily been a charles story of tracking dutch down. especially how dutch used the natives as pawns in his madness.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-25,thats how group project was born
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,dutch ain't so bad tbh. he loved arthur and john like his own sons just took the wrong decision.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-25,this literally in the game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-05,i love how this cut content is in the game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-30,"for peepple saying it's not cut they did cut her being a prostitute, when she give arthur the key to the stash before arthur dies she says  i was always a good thief think most if the women were petty thieves"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-18,arthur and john still brothers in the end
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-26,is literally obvious throughout the whole game how is this cut content?
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-10,"i haven't been a able to play rdr2 yet, and i keep wondering about jonh and abigail history when they were with dutch. i loved this short, thanks!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-25,"it was cut, i heard about this"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,i am pretty sure this was in one of the early lines of the game in like chapter 2
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-15,this isn't cut it's just lore
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-12,and he ended up looking like javier in the end when he was grown up in rdr1
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-06,rdr2 is one of the most educational and in depth stories maybe of any medium.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-24,arthur didn't live that long to see the epilogue
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-14,i always figured something was a bit off about her  the family's situation
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-20,"dutch we all had her, john married her"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-15,this is not cut content its backstory that is mentioned very clearly in the game.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,in fact did not enjoy the content and i wish that it was cut from youtube
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-10,jack looks more like javier
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,"abigail and jack left with john for the year he was absent and they left in the months following her giving birth, while jack was essentially a newborn. and they didnt return in in 1897 because jack would be only 3 because it is 1899 in the events of rdr2 jack is 7"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-11,"they definitely mentioned her past career in the game they just did it subtle, they also subtly mention that dutch is possibly jacks real dad"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-10,yeah i remember that on ps4 version was wondering what happened to it lol
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-14,she reminds me of alex zedra lol you'd think she was doing her voice throughout the game cause of they're similar appearance
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-05,the thumb nail made abaglie look like missy cooper
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-24,jack was a group project. kinda like ichigo in bleach. he sort of looks like john and javier but his mannerism reminds me of arthur
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-26,how do yall not understand the most obvious comment bait lmfao
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-05,always knew baby isnt johns it was uncles
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-14,finish the sentence ahh...
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-20,"we all had here, but you married her! dutch van der linde"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,read dead 2 is one of the greatest games ever made.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-01,"it's a shame john didn't know the sasquat. because as we all know, he eats babies. it would've solved the problem"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-29,they cut so much the start of the game was really the halfway point its a shame we didnt get more then 6 chapters considering the fact that rockstar doesnt like single player dlc anymore so they shouldve went all in and not cut corners
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-18,they also cut out that arthur and abigail had feelings for each other at one point and they still have some lingering feelings
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-05,that's why that kid doesn't look like john but looks like arthur's son.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,i think the reason arthur didnt welcome john back easily is probably because his son issac might have died at the time or smth like that
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,well at least we know the kid ain't javier or leonard so they're in the clear.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-07,they should just make a dlc with all the finished cut content that wouldnt significantly impact the story and add all the online content to story mode and id buy it no matter the price
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-30,why do arthur character looks so good and john charcater looks like he is still in rdr1
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-01,there is no cut content this is lore from prior to 1899 and this isn't just info from a rockstar developer this is mentioned in the story of the game this isn't content this is the story actually show content
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-06,this music makes my stomache turns around.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-16,you know this game is a damn masterpiece when 6 years later people still debate whether or not dutch had a slow decline throughout the story or whether he was the same from the start. truly one of the most complex and greatest antagonists oat.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-11,i truly enjoyed this game every second of it.i wish i could erase my memory and just play it all over again. such a remarkable journey i spent 150 hours playing it to hit 100 achievement
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-13,a channel with 8000 subs releasing a video this long and detailed makes me happy in a way i cant describe. it really shows your passion.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-14,"its sad as hell when you give abigail that kiss and she says to tend to the farm, youve already done every bounty and side mission, got your fill of hunting and fishing and you just know the ride is over, and you saw all you came to see. i got that same sad feeling when you wake up in kaer morhen and everybody is gone, no more friends to do quests with, no more storyline, its over. its the biggest compliment i can give to any game if i get that feeling at the end of it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-26,"i totally get the hype for gta 6, but honestly, i'm craving a red dead redemption 3 sequel even more. there's this magic to exploring the wild west of the 1800s  the calmness, the way nature takes its time, and soaking in every inch of the landscape that makes you appreciate the game even more. sometimes, i wish i could actually live in the 1800s, and playing rdr2 feels like the closest i'll get to that experience."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-13,"i used to have 3 save files on rdr2 1. for me to try to get completion 2. when my stepdad and i hung out 3. when i would hang out with my dad. had to do high honor with my stepdad around, because i didnt want him to see what i was capable of  with my dad we would be sore from laughter when we would throw people on train tracks or try and get away with as much as possible, but i didnt spoil arthurs ending for him at all playing it. when arthur got his diagnosis he was all in on redeeming him and it made playing through that part of the game easier and more memorable since he honestly even cared about arthur in the game. i think that kind of speaks volumes to how wide of an audience it is accessible to, and the success of its writing being a really emotionally complex and engaging piece of fiction. for both my stepdad and my dad to want to just be there with me playing it and connecting between both was a positive thing for me."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-11,how did bro know that i had just finished a replay of this masterpiece
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-16,"saying this game aged well is an understatement, this timeless masterpiece will forever stand as rockstar's magnum opus and one of the greatest games of all time."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-22,the horse dying absolutely kills me every time.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-12,594 hours on this game and i will never get bored of it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-06-01,"dont forget the music. the music makes it 10x more immersive. or should i say the sound ambience in general. when you just ride along to some peaceful guitar music and animal noises, enjoying the view, then suddenly it changes to some dark uncanny sound while you hear multiple horse riders from afar getting louder and louder, realizing that bounty hunters are coming for your head. this is so good man"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-14,"1658 hours and i still love this game. for me nothing even compares to it and i still play it almost daily. great video, thanks for doing this."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-11,rdr2 is a great game. the good ending actually made me cry. not many games do that to me. plus i still love to explore in rdr2. beautiful map.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-23,this is my personal favorite piece of art of all time. arthur morgan might just be my favorite character in all of fiction. and i will never be embarrassed to say that. rockstar delivered a video game so immersive and so powerful and so incredible that i don't think they could ever artistically top it.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-21,"picked it up cheap recently, and i've got about 50 hours in the game now. but i'm not really playing rdr2  i'm playing a rpg with a guy named arthur as the hero. i actively avoid the story missions  anything to do with micah ends in slaughter of innocent people, and that's not what my arthur is all about. got my honour up to touching distance of the right edge of the bar! i'm the robin hood of the wild west! next story mission is stealing some oil carriages with john marston. i didn't play the first game, but apparently he was the hero, so i'm hoping he is a bit more sensible than micah. got a hell of a lot of exploring to do first  at the moment i'm riding the whole perimeter of the map, seeing what is to be seen. it is beautiful  coming down from the mountains in the early morning, into an autumnal forest, with the god rays all around. wonderful."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-06-10,"im doing a second playthrough six years later and im only on chapter 2. keep getting sidetracked by exploring, hunting, random events and just watching that world go by. at this rate its going to take me months to finish it again. love it, so much fun!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-25,no disrespect to gow but this shoulda been the 2018 goty .
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-06-21,"the epilogue is so brilliant, too. the main story is very intense, the epilogue has its moments of action, but the slower pace lets you take in the scenery of beecher's hope, etc."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-11,"4321 the graphics may age eventually, yeah idk, considering the current state of game development these days, it doesn't seem like it's gonna be anytime soon whatsoever."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-06-05,"candidly, playing through this recently for the first time i caught myself multiple times just being in the moment and actually feeling grateful and fortunate to play this game. its such a rare feeling that i almost never felt playing a game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-30,"not playing rdr1 and not knowing that dutch is the villain on the game, that scene at 858 completely broke my heart. i though somehow, someway dutch loves arthur and no matter their difference in opinions is, theyll still have each other's back down the line. but that scene right there completely shattered on whats left on my loyalty to dutch. the same way arthur did at that moment."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-25,"i started a new game recently and am currently playing through it now. this is my first time playing it sober, and i have to say, wow. it's probably as close as one can get to playing a game over for the first time because i was so blitzed out of my mind years ago, my memory of the game is fragmented at best. playing it sober, my appreciation for this game, and the work put into it, has skyrocketed. i've played a whole lot of games over the decades, and i daresay this is my absolute favorite."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-06-21,"it blew my mind and still does. think about it, hundreds of people working on this for years and years. the endless hours of work poured into it. and we end up with a masterpiece. loved every minute of it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-15,the game is so insanely well made. never seen this level of detail in any game ever before i was in a shack in the middle of nowhere where i found an axe. and i took the axe and threw it against the wall it made a wood sound. i took the axe again and threw it against a picture it made a paper rip sound. i took it again and threw it against a horse saddle nearby it made a sound leather rip sound. i took it again and threw it against a rope it made a rope rip sound.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-23,"replaying this currently for the second time since release, and it's even better than my first playthrough. the more i play, the more i think rdr2 got absolutely robbed that year by god of war... this game is as close to a masterpiece as possible. there is no game more visually beautiful than rdr2, i cannot believe this released on lastgen. it takes my breath away every single time i play it. almost every aspect of this game is an absolute triumph."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-24,"you didn't even touch on the soundtrack. i was already enjoying it, but when i got on a horse after returning from guarma  not knowing what i was going to find left of the gang  and unshaken started playing it hit hard. i knew in that moment this was no ordinary video game and i would be forever changed by it. i d'angelo's performance was just haunting, and i recognized daniel lanois' production immediately. he did bob dylan's album time out of mind, among many others it all fit in so nicely with woody jackson's score. then the part that broke me is losing my horse at the end. why, rockstar, why?!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-06,"rdr2, in my opinion, has some of the best technical aspects in a game. i cant think of any other game with such a high amount of detail in everything. story, world, physics and all the other aspects of a game. that being said i kind of wish that there were more fun missions that would have been fully open ended because it is a open world game. that would have been the cherry on top for me."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-19,"in my opinion, this is a world class novel that was then adapted into a video game if you know what i mean. i m in my 40s and both me and my wife could not stop playing it until we got 100 completion. and at the core of it was the emotional and historical depth it carries but as well the actors' performances. i bet that 90 percent of those who played this game had tears in their eyes when that end hits. if there are any tool fans here, i would say red dead redemption 2 is tool of video games."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-24,great video for an absolute masterpiece of a game. this is what you get when the time is taken to bring all elements of a game together. too many games today focus on only a couple of things and then release a buggy mess. this game is was and always will be a masterpiece. thanks for taking the time to put this video together. going to go and start yet another play though.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-27,"this game is still a top three. going back to it is like going on vacation, its so beautiful. the slow, steadiness of it is like meditation. truly one of the greatest experiences in gaming ive ever had. maybe ill go back for a fifth playthrough."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-24,on my fifth or sixth playthrough now. it has aged so well its crazy.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-30,"i'm gonna stop right here. at 810. i'm at my third playtrough and it has been a few years since now, so i don't want to spoil it to much. but i have to say, you are a very good story teller mr game. i will revisit this after i am finished. you got yourself a new subscriber. love from norway."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-06-21,the fact that this game lost to gow is unforgivable
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-20,i gotta say i never watch long videos but you did such a great job on the video i didnt even notice till i looked and i was at 38 mins in. keep this up.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-13,this was an amazing video. perfect narration and information for the newer crowd getting into this game. i have played this game since the day of its release and right here in 2024 i am replaying it again. it is that good and i'm still finding things that i haven't found before. eight different save files of the game  thanks for the video
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-08,arthurs last ride has to be my favorite scene from any game ever
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-04,i've never seen a video explaining the magic of rdr2 so incredibly well. you did a fantastic job at summarizing 50h of this masterpiece in 40min and with such a passion!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-26,your comments about switching from low honour to high within the last chapter are so true literally had the same experience where i just could not have arthurs story end with low honour
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-18,on my 8th playthrough and 1000 hours in and seeing this convinced me i gotta replay it again. i always tend to find 1 new things on each playthrough
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-15,the last ride after saving abi was so fuckin deep. that song and the verbal flashbacks were amazing and just ripped my heart out.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-17,easily the greatest story in gaming and i don't think even rdr 3 will top it. saying goodbye to arthur puts tears in my eyes every time. idk why because he isn't real. but we do go through so much with him. i'm just about to finally 100 the game and it has taken over 2 months of consistent playing to do so. the orchids and bird feathers will drive you insane just a forewarning... but even despite that it's still the greatest story i've ever known. great video man liked and subbed
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-07,"2724 actually i believe the i'm afraid scene depends on if you encounter the nun earlier in the game. if not, you get the reverend scene instead. because i had a high honor run and i got the reverend scene. when i play it again i'll take extra care to talk to the nun before hand."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-08,it warms my heart to know there are so many who appreciated the artistry of this experience. this was truly a masterpiece. nothing less than an absolute masterpiece.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-04,"out of the dozens and dozens of hours i spent on my first playthrough, my forever favorite part of this game is the camp party after you rescue sean. it was such a surprising step back from the madness going on that everyone just took a night to drink and laugh and dance and sing around the fire. it was such a beautifully wholesome moment and only doubled down my love for this game. i guess because it reminds me of growing up, we always have field parties with a fire and singing. it just made the crew that much more relatable for me"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-19,"i got the low honor ending on my first play through. i was so pissed that i stopped playing and didn't touch the game for 3 days because i needed to cool down. when i did play it again i started over from the beginning to get the high honor ending. i'm not ashamed to admit that i cried. i used to be ashamed i was like why the hell am i crying about a video game character?. then i saw a few compilation videos of other people crying at the end so i didn't feel bad anymore. the epilogue was all new to me since i never played it on my first play through. i like video games, but i'm far from being considered a gamer. this is still the best game i've ever played in my life."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-24,"i've played through rdr2 prob a dozen times, but i now finding myself getting on just to enjoy the scenery with the ambient noises and relaxing music"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-06,1448 honestly one of the most emotional moments i've ever had period. the story is that good. it's just hurts so bad to see a friend die like that. roger clark has forever raised the bar for every actor in existence. i will always compare a performance to arthur morgan until i come across something better and i really don't know how possible that even is
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-18,"you know it's weird, i love the opening section colter it just feels cozy to me and the tutorials felt natural"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-30,currently replaying it and interacting with every activity i come across. a masterpiece is an understatement.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-13,"redownloaded this game to give it a second playthrough, in shady belle and this is perfect timing to listen to as i ride to missions"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-13,"so happy you released another revisit! and rd2 nonetheless, the game i just started. can't wait for more of your videos"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-06,"it all started with red dead revolver. if it wasn't made, we would never have gotten rdr and rdr2 but in a true happy release of red dead revolver. we gotten the 3 best rdr games together, all we need now, is red dead redemption 3, to play as john's son. jack marston."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-18,"i just finished the game yesterday, it has become my favorite game oat and arthur is on my top 3 fav characters oat. im a person who rarely cries but arthur ending got me."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-13,i actually feel so much of this. i actually have struggled to play open world games since rdr2 and i didn't start playing it until 2020. still going 4 years later
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-24,"i completely agree with your take of this game. i truly loved it the first time i played it two years ago, i know, i was late playing it. but you just made me want to play it again. i think its time. great video."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-02,"i was playing rdr2 today actually and one of the things that still blows my mind is the level of the world building that went into it. standing on top of a mountain somewhere and looking around and you can actually go to the places you see, nothing is off limits. its also the little details like snow building up on your hat if it starts snowing, or falling snow turning into rain as you come down from elevation. its details like that which make it so immersive and better than any other open world game in history. gta6 will be another level above this which is wild"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-26,"this is an incredible video essay, i have to say. outstanding work. congratulations."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-20,great video! only thing missing was a chapter on the music! one the best uses of sound and music
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-19,"fun fact, murphy brood will stalk you at night. if your eyes are sharp enough sometimes you will see them following you, as if roanoke cant get creepier"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-15,i remember in 2020 when i received this game as a christmas gift from my uncle. i had never met him before that point and even though i was stuck on 30fps on a 60hz tv with motion blur it was the best gift i had ever received from a distant family member.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-23,"this game legit made me laugh, cry, think, and all together enjoy the hell out of itrockstar truly outdid themselves with this video game masterpiece.the themesettingplot line is executed beautifullya 1010 for me"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-09,"excellent commentary. well done. thank you. it took me 1000 hours of playing actually 997 to get 100, and every minute was worth it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-30,"i was still in hs when rdr2 came out. my mom typically never really cared about my games, but she would constantly watch me play this and it was the most invested i'd ever seen her. she bawled her eyes out when arthur died. the game is a masterpiece, but the memories that came from it are priceless."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-06-03,great retrospective on such a great game. i started playing it again too. a classic forever.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-19,ive never been big on replaying games but this game is one i play maybe twice every year since it released. i think it was the place i was in with my life when i played it and beat it that really cemented it in my soul
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-31,"still one of my favorite games. don't forget the music, the score of that game is also timeless. when i don't play for too long, i get a bit homesick xx"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,im replaying it for the third time now and its still so amazing. since rdr2 i have not played a game even nearing the quality of this masterpiece.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-12-26,red dead redemption 1 you can be sick with revenge red dead redemption 2 you can be actually sick lumbago really out did itself this time
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-03-14,"i feel the opposite really, i thought the best of the story took place near the end. arthur's illusions of dutch and the outlaw life being shattered and choosing what he wanted to do with the remaining time felt like the most compelling part of the story and really elevated his character one of the best protagonists i've ever played. i guess if you count the epilogue, it's kind of weirdly paced."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-01-31,the second half is supposed to make you miss the first half when the gang was together

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-08,"the good, the bad, the dunkey."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-08,"dunkey riding a donkey, that's meta"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-01-02,i disagree with you about the second half of the game. seeing the gang and dutch himself falling apart is one of the most heartbreaking and fascinating things. i also love seeing all the work to make arthur a good man pay off when he redeems himself and dies looking at the rising sun. its such a thoughtful game and one of my favorites.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-09-05,go on grab the gun um that guy actually kills himself
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-10,this game really makes you feel like you have tuberculosis
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-04-15,"personally, i enjoyed every second of the game and its one of my favorite games of all time, but i can understand the frustration with the 2nd half edit changed 'my favorite game of all time' to 'one of my favorite games of all time.' tears of the kingdom was just that good edit again baldurs gate 3 actually cleared everything."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-01-23,fun to come back to this after this game was dunkeys goty for 2020. awesome to see how his opinion evolved.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-12-14,"having just beaten the game, guarma didn't bother me nearly as much as i expected it to from this video. my main complaint was all the handholding rockstar does during missions. you are constantly given text instructions, even for things you've done dozens of times. rarely can you stray from the intended path, and if you aren't doing what the game wants for literally two seconds an ai starts loudly berating you for it. otherwise i thought it was an amazing experience that sets the bar very high for sequels. it not only improved on the first game in pretty much every aspect, it expanded the world and story, making the original game even better for it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,i'm like 12 hours in so i think i'm almost done with the tutorial part
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,dunkey might be the only reviewer astonished that theres a dangelo song in this game. i knew you were black
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-11-25,'the characters meander towards a weakass dissolution' this is absolutely true. if you follow the missions and return to camp once or twice it will absolutely seem this way. however for some strange reason rockstar decided to bury some of the most personal and revealing character moments in the camp events and dialogues. there is even a hidden event where dutch accuses john of being a rat as he mysteriously disappeared during the saint denis robbery. then if you walk up as arthur he will roar 'and here comes the other snake'. without this scene dutch's decision to side against john and arthur seems ridiculous.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-08,it really makes you feel like a cowboy  ign
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-01-23,here after this got goty 2020 for dunk.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,the more you look into it the more you realize that this is actually the prequel to bubsy 3d
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-12-12,so you introduced us this d'angelo guy but never told what happened to my horse2 talk about character development
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,"what the heck dunkey don't you know you're not allowed to give this game less than a 4.5 out of 5 at worst? the number of immersive yet often tedious or hyperspecific details in this game clearly make up for any gameplay faults or dips in quality. for this reason, i rate this review 2 expanding horse balls out of 5. nice try, dunko, but the cowboys win again."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-24,"remember dunkey hated on this game, then made a second 27 minute video about how amazing it was."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-11-30,"this is one of my favorite games of all time, but i still respect your opinion."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-12-03,one the best black youtubers
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-08-11,the music is the best part of the game completely agree
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-12,"trust me, dunkey. this game really picks up when you get to the part where you get to ride a trex and eat cavemen."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-25,"spoilers! i disagree, sure, while on guarma the game isnt at its best, but once you return every single mission from then on feels like a climax in the story as you learn more about his gang members, and as their true intentions arise. in this moment you learn so much about arthur and in my case once i found out he didnt have much more time alive i began to care less about money, and more about my honor."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,yea i stopped listening to this guy after he said bubsy 3d sucked
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-04-23,"this game is easily my favorite game of all time and i personally enjoyed every single second of it, even the sad and heart wrenching story bits"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-08,"that guy was cheating, i 100 agree."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-12-09,"hmm, i do agree with guarma being repetitive and pointless, but the second half of the game ramped up the story and, essentially, gave meaning to the game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-05-23,"i actually liked how it all led up, especially with john marston for the original red dead redemption. the island was forgettable for sure, and those shootouts did wear out their welcome, but for the conclusion of most characters, i can't complain."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2020-07-04,"i believe that the excess of action in chapter 5 was to give the player all the shooting they needed, so they didn't feel a need to do it in free roam. this helps keep the player in line with arthur's character ark, as he becomes more honourable towards the end, just as the player gets bored of killing people."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,"so it's official, knack 2 remains uncontested as the greatest video game of our generation"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-08,"it looks like it suffers from the same problem i have with most rockstar games. the story always starts off so dang engaging, but the further i get into it, the more it thins out and the less i feel interested in it. still looks like a fantastic game, but i hope rockstar can overcome these hurdles in the future."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-05-04,"i agree on what you think about chapter 5, but when you say that rockstar is bad at making solid climaxes, i think youre kind of wrong. rdr2s climax had my heartbeat above 150."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-07-05,"after watching the new uncharted 4 review this feels like the type of review dunkey will revisit one day because cmon, chapter 6 was peak storytelling"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-10,dunkey is definitely my favorite youtuber because he really understands how to make you feel like batman
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,this game makes you feel red and dead
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,this game is just a rip off of woody's roundup from toy story 2
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2022-03-22,"theres a lot of good points you made here, like how the gameplay it a bit flinchy and inconsistent, but the story throughout the entire game was so brilliant and bizarre that i couldnt help but enjoy every last minute of it. no doubt the open world was the best part, but damn all of it pieced together is incredible. a masterpiece! fav game of all time"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,"finally a guy that can see both , the good and the bads"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,the only reason dunkey didn't give this game a perfect score is because donkeys aren't your main mount.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,from watching the dong play this game i can tell that this is actually the sequel to the wild west map from mario party 2.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,010 it just doesn't make you feel like batman
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-01-21,"200 actually, before this scene or this part of the game, you can hear the tones,notes of unshaken in background music quite often"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-12-23,how to survive a red dead redemption game... dont be the main character
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,"i don't think you rdd2 fans are getting it. 35 for dunkey is a good score, and i agree with him on his scale. 35 is good. it's a good tier. he says it himself that he'd recommend the game to most people. final fantasy 15, one of the very few aaa rpgs he's played to completion is a 35, uncharted 4, a must have title for ps4 owners is a 35, shadow of the colossus, a game every gamer should experience at least once is a 35. he acknowledges the jam packed environment and exploration here in the same way he does for the division, which he calls next gen and still gives it a 35. i think you're getting the trend here. his scale isn't like ign, where you get 6 points off the bat for a working game, it's more like 0 is unplayable, 2 is mediocreaverage, 3 is above average, 4 and 5 are reserved for timeless masterpieces."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-08-12,"the second half guarma and onwards your just senselessly killing without reason well, yeah, ain't that the point? all that killing is happening because of dutch and arthur's blind loyalty"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,i think what dunkey is trying to say is the game wasnt very yee but was perfectly haw
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-08,"why are pc players complaining? you have the oregon trail, a timeless classic."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,"you know something's gone astray when you're playing a game about bounty hunting, train robbers and the most exciting mission in the last 10 hours is a music video of building a house  that part killed me"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2021-02-24,i'm so happy dunkey came back to change his opinion about the game. this is a special one.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-07,"now, back to red dead. the game kinda sucks dick. had me dying with laughter"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-06-19,"i think i understand dunkey's argument about the story, even if i disagree. the tone shifts drastically, so if you really got into the light hearted first half it might throw you off. personally i think it's masterful how as arthur's journey becomes darker and more introspective, the entire game pulls you into it. you could even argue the straightforward shootouts in the latter half drive home how tired and disillusioned arthur becomes. the best parts of the final chapters are the intimate stories and experiences, which helps drive home how narratively these become more important to arthur than ever."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-08,this game is just a knock off of ms.pac man
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-08,why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-11-08,"this is my favorite indie pc exclusive this year. thank you rockstar, very cool"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-08-16,charles is actually pretty great he's prolly one of my favourite characters in rdr2
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-12-15,albert mason is slept on tbh
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-03,bro looks like the golem from lord of rings
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-01-19,that side eye was so cold
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,the carolina parakeet is extinct and has been for over 100 years. nice touch to have the game take place within the same few years that the parakeet went extinct in real life.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,"wearing the expert hunter outfit, killing buffalo to get double materials. then putting on the savvy merchant outfit and traveling to mexico to sell the pelts for 5x what theyre worth in west elizabeth was the way to get stacked on rdr1."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,as a native north carolinian i wish the carolina parakeet wasnt extinct cause it would be so cool to see these colorful birds fill the sky
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,"fun fact their own defense mechanism accelerated their own extinction. in the early 1910s, southern farmers were very protective of their crops from which the parakeet would eat on. so they would shoot them with their shotguns and when one parakeet would get injured the entire flock of parakeets would come try and swarm the injured bird to protect them. unfortunately, grouping up against a remington model 10 doesnt help as much as an animal."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,charles hated that
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,"in rdr you can extinct two species, buffalo and the baby eaters 22k likes? that's insane, even my best video with 448k views only has 10k likes"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-20,damn bro i dont know why but just hearing the phrase manifest destiny after the extinction of a animal race is so sad
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,the consequences are unthinkable. you get an achievement
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,fun fact americans tried to kill all the buffalo to spite natives and starve them. manifest destiny is the most aptly named achievement.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,you can also extinct the passenger pigeons in rdr2
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,that shit sad as f those parakeets were beautiful man.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,"its a reference to how a lotnof buffallos were killed in the early us, almost making them extinct"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,"manifest destiny is a quote from the us government in the 1800s when settlers went west in search of land and gold, designed to inspire settlers against the natives, depicted as a spirit essentially"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-26,"the manifest destiny achievement is supposed to reference how american settlers did every attempt to kill off as many buffalo as they could to starve native american tribes buffalo was their main food source, and force them into submission during westward expansion. this would explain probably why some of the buffalo in rdr1 doesnt respawn again, due to how many killed buffalo there was. besides that reason, hunting buffalo was also a popular sport for settlers at the time."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,"fun fact manifest destiny was the term used by early american colonists which said that it was their divine right to plunder the land and hunt the wildlife, which is a very fitting for the achievement"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,it is likely called manifest destony as there was an effort by colonists to wipe out the natoves by taking away their percieved primary food sourse
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-19,now they gotta do this again in gta vi
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-20,imagine the dude stuck at 99.99 progress because he killed all the parakeets without studying them lmao
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,to this day as of 2025 i still find out new things about this game. stunning.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,"fun fact, the carolina parakeet was most likely poisonous as cats would reportablly died after eating them, and the birds would also eat a poisonous seed from cockleburs"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,i you can extinct? bro forgot that extinct is a noun not a verb
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-26,5 gamerscore for ending the buffalo race is filthy.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-20,the only reason why i know about manifest destiny is because of school
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-20,manifest destiny was a term coined by john o sullivan referring to westward expansion which was also the slaughter of the buffalo thank you a level history
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-09,it would also be realistic if this applied to wolves as well since they went extinct in the us before conservation efforts brought them back from canada once the ecosystem in yellowstone started to collapse. turns out grey wolves are a keystone species.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,i had no idea once you killed all the buffalo they would respawn explains so much looking for them bastards for hours
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,"i left 4. i loved doing other missions, and still see them roaming around. made me feel warm inside."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,just finished my first play through. i think i know what im gonna do in my second one.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-30,consequences are unthinkable  consequences notification and trophy
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,"yeah dude, we kind of literally did that. it was an attempt to starve the plains native american tribes and the bison population is still in a critical state"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-25,"in dont starve together the buffalo can go extinct, or even extinct for one particular area, they are really useful for food, wool, and bc they fight against the hellhounds, but we were always careful to leave enough to reproduce"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,extinct is not a verb.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,manifest destiny is a reference to actual hunters being hired to nearly hunt the buffalo to extinction in the early 1800s
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,theres also an la noire mission called manifest destiny. i feel someone at rockstar likes this phrase a lot e
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,as soon as i heard buffalo i was like uh oh ive heard this one before
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,rockstar put so much effort into this game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-29,those things are so hard to find! was on my 4th playthrough before i ever saw one.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,or the legendary animals. magnificent creatures ended up as arthur wardrope.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,"consequences, unthinkable... unlocks achievement."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,i was only trying to get a jacket for arthur but it's a panther
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,i've done soooo many playthroughs and i did not know this.. at all. i'm flabbergasted. to this day i'm still learning new things about rdr2. this game is just amazing.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,"the buffalo being hunted to extinction and the name manifest destiny references the fact that the us nearly drove buffalo to extinction, they did this because buffalo were natives primary food source and without them theyd starve."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,so sad how weve accelerated the extinction of every animal around us
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,repect to the native americans
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,"honestly ive completed that game a few times, thought i knew everything but still to this day im learning new stuff about it"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,they are called bison
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,"yep that makes sense. many would kill the buffalo just for the hell of it which severely hurt natives since that was one of their primary sources of food after they were moved. if i recall some folk would even shoot and kill buffulo while riding by in a train. it was disgusting, i believe there even a quest with chalres in rfr2 that covers some of this where you hunt down a group that just killed the buffalo for fun instead of actually making use of its resources since the natives felt it was important to respect the animal and make use of every part of the animal they could."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,those are bison not buffalo
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,"coming from the uk long ago, our wild spaces were as rich as the americas. we had wolves, bears, bison, lynx, elk, etc. but due to multiple human factors, we eradicated them all. although our landscapes are still beautiful, they are ecologically dead in comparison to what they were. look after your wildlife, don't lose them like we did for profit."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,the fact more than 500k people have this achievement just shows no one understands history.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,"youre a good man, arthur morgan."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-19,theyre called bison
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-26,"i really wish the carolina parakeet was still around, they were the only parrot in all of north america,  they looked beautiful. i remember learning about them at the museum  just feeling sad."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-03,the reason they did it just for buffalos is because during the time period in real life they were hunted to near extinction there were only 50100 alive at one point
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,the carolina parakeet used to call my state home its so sad that these birds no longer exist
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-30,you can extinct an entire animal species and the consequences are unthinkable. the consequence  the species is extinct
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-31,"the same is also for the sasquatches in rdr1 as well, which you can hunt down and kill as part of a stranger mission objective. once you find and hunt them all down, the last one will be crying, begging john to shoot him as all his friends and family have been killed by some maniac and he's the last survivor left. it's very sad and makes you regret ever accepting that mission"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-08,"also, there're currant plants in rdr2, but not in 1 because they were outlawed between the events of those games, and destroyed everywhere in us."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-26,i remember playing rdr1 as a kid and hunting buffalo for some reason and realizing they were spawning less. i didnt realize they were just literally less buffalo because of me!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,oh man the carolina parakeet was so cool!!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,"7 years later, and i'm still finding new things out about this game"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,"someone at rockstar did their homework in the migratory bird treaty, granted it was signed into effect in 1918. this feels more like a prelude as to why it was enacted seeing this is based in 1899 just 21 years before the act."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-25,"this was something that happened in history around 1830 or 40 if im correct were learning it in history rn but its basically where when american settlers were moving west to oregon and just west in general, they killed a ton of buffalo or bison or whatever they were, causing them to be endangered, conflicting with the american indians ways of hunting."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-25,"safest thing about extinction, its always the coolest most diverse looking animals that are hunted down. not for food or any other reason then for sport and to say yo check out this albino rhino i just killed  like bro we had so many cool animals that if we never hunted or they didnt lose their habits wouldve been so astonishing to witness"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,makes me think of gta san andreas come on down to ammunations endangered species barbeque!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-10,"i accidentally stumbled onto the carolina parakeet quest when riding through the swamp and trampling one of them before the rest flew off, it was something i never heard of or seen anybody talk about online"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,i've watched tons of in depth lore videos about red dead and never knew this was a thing...
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,"you're a good man, mr morgan, a good man."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-26,"poor carolina parakeet. was such a cool looking bird. take care of birds, people. they're an integral part of the food chain. without birds we would witness all our crops getting eaten by insects, and with more invasive insects introduced to north america each decade we need to protect birds more so now than ever."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-28,consequences are indeed unthinkable  he didn't even think to tell us what they are.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,carolina parakeets had some of the prettiest feather colors! shame that they were all killed off
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,that manifest destiny achievement is wild
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,"holy cow, this is something i never knew about rdr"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,i used to live almost 50 miles away from the closest city. i would spend every day outside if i could. lived on a very long dirt road near the flga line. one time i went to go on a walk and in the middle of the road was 1520 parakeets just sitting there eating. i couldnt belive my eyes and got too close and scared them off
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-26,"the extinction quest sounds like it's a challenge, not a consequence."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,man im always learning nee things about this game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,oh thanks for letting me know that i missed a quest!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,in the french the manifest destiny trophy is just called oops
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-03,damn still learning new things about this game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-10,"i remember how big the buffalo herd was on rd1 and i killed them all off down to 2 left then didnt touch it them again, the whole herd grew back quite a bit. as long as you seem to give it time."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,"brooo i never realized that's why the buffalo stopped appearing in my red dead game. i remember being a kid and being so confused, thinking it was a glitch or aomething"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,rockstar details in video games are amazing
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,"i reloaded my save after killing the buffalo so i could see them wander again but i wiped out all the parakeet since they were tied to an objective, made sure to pick them all up at least though"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,if i was a dev i would have left a single parakeet that follows the player around sounding his mating call. making the player remember their actions
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,well i know what i'm gonna do after my appointment today.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,"if you shoot a parakeet, consider yourself an opp"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,ive been playing this game since before release and i havent found a single parakeet
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-27,gonna hop back on the game just for this mission
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,i remember my first time playing rdr1 years ago and i saw large herds of buffalo. so instinctively i shot a bunch every time i saw them and as time went on i wondered where they all went until i got that achievement. such a cool detail.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-26,a moment of silence for the carolina parakeet
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,fun fact. theres a subspecies of buffalos called the wood buffalos native to florida. its only in one national park in gainesville florida.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,the producers probably told shane not to choose 5 kazoos instead of his actual list
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,still finding out stuff about this game all these years later
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,the carolina parakeet actually breaks my heart. the only north american parrot...
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,the buffalo made me so sad mostly because you got the most money for their skins and horns
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,"you're a good man, arthur morgan."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,i single handedly exstinted a spieces
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"i had this going on loop for a 3 hour nap.. in my ears. you know what happens when your brain is trying to make sense of something like this? it doesnt i had this on repeat in my dream, it turned it into a nightmare i was unable to wake up from.."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-15,buffalos help.. its bison
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,oohh that's why it gets harder to find them after awhile
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,"i feel like if we play this game until were old, well eventually forget it, and then get to experience it all over again for the first time"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-01,"its funny ive 100 the game and gotten all achievements, and with about 900 hours i still found myself clicking on this video even thought ive played the game 8 times and used mods, just shows how strong my love still is for the game and people making content on it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,the biggest mistake rockstar has made is thinking that rdr players are the same as gta players. a large percentage of rdr players dont play gta or play very little. they tend to be older than gta players and are not that into pvp and micro transactions
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-17,"i do whats called ano micahplay through. i purposely leave the dowes family alone  keep micah in jail. you can earn a secondary holster just by hunting a few deer so his perk incentive to break him out is then nullified. i break sean out, i upgrade the satchel 100, grind outfit challenges, treasure hunt  make sure the camp has all its upgrades etc. sure those two missions are main story missions but horseshoe overlook with no micah bell is really a whole vibe."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-01,the fact that you experience things like that cougar attack while youre narrating is one of the reasons youre got one of the best series ever. keep it up. happy new year.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-13,red dead redemption 2 isnt a game. its a work of art
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-14,man i remember when rdr2 came out back in 2018 right around my birthday. thats all i played for a few months. but now after over 6 years i redownload this masterpiece so i can start on a 2nd play through. ive played many of games since rdr2 and i got to say arthur morgan is still one of if not the greatest main protagonist ive ever had the pleasure of playing as. i havent felt invested into a character like him since. cant wait to play this again and relive what made this one of the greatest gaming experiences ever.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,"im playing the game again for probably the tenth time and this time im doing it different. ive decided to play it slow and really enjoy how beautiful the game is. i dont play background music, i dont run around everywhere in a hurry, i eat and drink in a common manner, and make choices that i can truly see myself making. so far it is the most relaxing play through ive had and im really enjoying it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-01,"i have been an avid gamer since 1980 when i got an atari 2600 for christmas, and over the years i've played countless games on just about every console made. rdr 2 is by far the most immersive and detailed game i've ever played. im on my 6th playthrough on story mode and am level 130 online. its the only game i've played for the last 2 years. all other games now just pale by comparison. i might need some red dead rehab..lol"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,"rdr2 taught me you cant rush with some games. the level of attention to detail is immense, and you are absolutely going to miss some of it. ive been playing the game with low honor and its insane how much the world is warped by your actions. fantastic experience that i doubt ill be able to get anywhere else until gta vi"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-12,"currently in chapter 3 of my 9th playthrough and im full immersive mode. not only is my minimap turned off, but im not allowed to use the map at all. going strictly off things like the sunstreet signsetc for navigation, use my pocket watch to tell the time, have a regular sleep schedule, huntcook all my food and eat every day, change my clothes every day, bathe, not getting any of the hidden treasures, walk everywhere, lead my horse during travel sometimes to give it a break, never fast travel.. its taking me forever to progress through the story but its so much fun and would highly recommend"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,"just played  finished the game yesterday, i had no idea what i was missing out on all of these years."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,"i just got into rdr2 in november and beat the game high honor, absolutely loved it and cried a lot. it's become one of my favorite games, i honestly never expected to become so attached to arthur or many of the characters but i did. such a good game. thanks for still making content on it, i'll be watching your old vids"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-15,"im 23 and i only just now bought a ps5, first ever console so i was still excited. decided rdr2 was gonna be my first ever game. i enjoyed it so much that i finished before i even knew it. on my 2nd playthrough rn. i tried playing other games like the witcher 3 but nothing came close to the feeling from rdr2"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-08,"i picked up pencil sketching because of this game. i set up a tent , open arthur's journal on my screen and tried to learn his style."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-05,ive got 3100 hours logged in rdr2 i play it daily !!!!! and still see new things all the time
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,"i did a playstyle where i was a wild man who lived in the woods, stalking people strolling by and taking whatever they had, running in the city to cause a massacre to disappear back into the woods, the outfit is shirtless, no hat, barefoot, ripped pants and you can only use a knife."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,"this video brings me peace, just seeing all the different play styles really shows how good rockstar are letting the player play the game how they want. also love the acoustic in the background"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,"i preordered this game when it first come out i still play it to this day. i took a break for a long time, but im back on. i love it and i just want to add do everything you can possible with arthur before he dies."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-10,"the greatest compliment to a game is a world in which you want to exist in, and there's no game world i want to exist in more than rdr2"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-28,"i remember my first time playing this game. i rushed the story mode so that i can free roam with all my gears upgraded and buy everything that i want, it was when arthur died that i realized i never should've rushed it. i was attached to the character and it didn't feel the same with marston. i took my time with arthur for granted and never got the chance to do my main goal, free roaming with arthur."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,"i have been playing this game since the release date, oct 26, 2018. it has definitely ruined other games for me. it's important to take your time, not rush whether walking, riding, or playing in general. i made the mistake of beating this game in like 5 days when i first got it. hunting and fishing is great, you can chill and gamble, you can live in the wild and become a mountain man  oh there's so much"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-04,"one thing i like to do is hitchhike, i put my horse away safely in the stables and just go see if i can hitch a ride on a stagecoach. another thing you can do is sneak on trains and ride them to the next destination, if the train guards don't see you then no bounty will be placed and the train will operate like normal."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-09,"im a 45 yo pc gamer, just finished rdr1 port a couple of days ago and really love it. now im in chapter one in this one...its gonna be a hell of a ride"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,"i still play rdr2 nearly every day. it's a world i just enjoy being in, even if i'm just walking around looking at things."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-16,"just watched 1883 and immediately thought that i need to pay rdr2 a visist. it was one of the best games i have played since i played my first videogame in the 80s. when you finished a game years ago and here and there you still think about the main characters death...this says a lot. i understand this game is not for everyone, but nobody with a sane mind can deny the absolute love that went into this game. the immersion and amount of world detail is unmatched to this day."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-26,i love how serious the tone is for these videos. it's kinda sweet.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,youre a sick person if you want to play the outlaw.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,i will still love rdr2 no matter what i play to this day if i beat i will make a whole new game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,you can play a drinking game watching this video. everytime he says immersive you take a drink. you'll have alcohol poisoning at the halfway mark.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,started my fifth playthrough a couple days ago. i'm 63 and a lifelong gamer and i agree this is the best game ever made. getting the legends of the east satchel is a breeze at this point. that is the first thing i go for at the start of chapter 2. each time i play i go slower and don't miss much. it really helps to have all this experience.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,"red dead redemption 2 is my favorite game, and i got all achievements and 100 the game for the first time a couple months ago. this is why i clicked this video because i'm probably going to take a long break in order to forget a lot. so i can return in 2026 and hopefully enjoy it much more."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-31,i love this game above all others.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,bro ! i just got to the epilogue first time play thru and your intro is 10000 percent correct that game feels like a darn movie i feel how people say you have to watch a movie or read a certain book b4 you die i think you should play this game before death because bro it is amazing by far one of the best games ive ever played i havent even played rdr1 but i did play red dead revolver as a kid so to see it doing good today brought back soo many memories and rockstar deserves way more recognition
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,"rdr2 is the only game where i haven't turned the soundtrack off! that's a big, big compliment"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,i can't agree with you more of what you said in the first minute of this video. what amazes me is it is the best game ever made and how rockstar can just quit on it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-12,"best game ever made by far, nothing comes close."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-12,"im literally just playing it like i did in 2019, and its even better the 2nd time"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-26,i just started this again on ps5 and missed how good this game is. even after playing ghost of tsushima and various vr games this game hits different.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-11,"i'm on my 6th or 7th playthrough, i started playing with mods that makes this game even more immersive  enjoyable. even without mods the possibilities to explore gives me joy"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,i just hope that this isnt the last red dead redemption game. that would absolutely break my heart. the worst part about rdr2 is it ruins every other game and you can never go back in time to experience it for the first time.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-09,"this is the best game ever made so far. i doubt anything will ever top this. the game brings a level of nostalgia with it, a longing for something that you've never experienced. it's weird. brilliant game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,been playing since it came out not as much lately because i've done everything as high honorlow honoretc. this video inspired me to start another story and taking my time and try these play styles
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-11,"an aspect of both red dead games that i've always found odd but cool, is that many players who love the series aren't actually too engaged with the actual western genre. they've seen a few films and maybe know some iconic figures, but that's about it. it's because these games are masterclasses in entertainment from all aspects, that they remain devoted to them!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,"i have been playing this game since its release, and now 2025 does not pass two months without playing it, it is amazing and integrated, i do not need anything else other than it, of course i play other games, but this masterpiece i never give up"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-01,"i have been playing as a survivalist for a long time now. i live in a selected remote area to forage, hunt, craft, and then sell my goods to go gamble. once im burnt out on civilized life i find a new camp and experience a region of the map i havent been in a while. i used to play as an outlaw but i felt it became repetitive and was burnt out on paying bounties and running from bounty hunters while trying to hunt or some other activity,"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-20,"all the good things said about this game reflect my sentiments. i recently discovered a way to do that which the game forbids  completely free roam in chapter 1. yes, you heard me  in chapter 1 immediately after the second mission. it all starts with a trip to the shack at cairns lake and afterwards heading to deadboot creek to get the carbine repeater from the jeremiah johnson frozen man west of that creek. what a game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-13,"red dead 2 is the embodiment of the best of each department bringing their best work forward. it's so fun to just sit there as a game developer and think about the countless hours, hard work, and passion the devs poured in, in every single possible defining way. the sounds are all beautifully crafted and handled, the open world is gorgeous and densely populated, the performances are just, voila, delissimo. even the programming for something even as simple as a scenario somewhere in the world is insanely complex and reactive it's insane and it raises the bar extraordinarily high for future rockstar titles. i can only imagine the programmers had their own fun crafting the systems and engine, and the rest of the team had a whole other kind of fun filling everything in with the story, cool easter eggs, funny encounters, etc. it's just so awesome. i love good games. we need more of em. p.s. i rock the lote outfit and exotic hat, such a nice combo bruh"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-27,i enjoyed rdr2 more than my actual life itself.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"omds ive almost hunted enough fir the whole trapper, i had to create a document to keep track of things i still needed"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,always choose the road of honor and righteousness
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"i got this game on release day, been playing on and off since. currently on chapter 4 and starting to play again, i haven't beat this game in 7 years. wow"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-09,"the guide should be 3 words play the game. i know every piece of dialogue through the story, i could damn near collect all of the dinosaur bones without even looking them up. but even when i've replayed the game to that point, i hop into it and it still feels surreal."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-22,"i still play through this game once a year, one of the all time best games"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-27,"i have such a glacial pace with the main story, that after 7 years i'm still not finished with about 260 hours played, that keeps the fun alive. ... i'm in the epilogue now though, but it's just gotta last a few more months and then gta 6 is finally here d"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-05,ive gotten back into it recently doing all the side quests and things. fishinghuntingplaying poker just everything to get immersed into the insane world that rockstar created
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,me just vine years and years late to the party. just bought a ps5 slim and downloaded rdr2 and still amazing.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-10,love the way you explain how good the game is
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-07,"rdr2 is a master piece. through and through. this is a game gamers will have their own children play after school without a doubt. teens granted given the story kids wont get it lol. meanwhile. the detail and just how amazing the game looks getting 90 fps on a 6900xt with a 2.7k panel, todays games cant touch how good this looks and is popping out crazy demands and upscale tech. whats next? mfg required with dlss 7 for 30 fps 480i?"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-26,i've never played it before. just finished red dead 1 and am just now starting 2. i like it so far.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-11,ive done about 5 playthroughs and each time feels like the first time. gta 6 is going to be on a whole different level.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-08,"just recently got back into this game for my second ever playthrough, my 1st was back when it released and wow its hitting hard"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-14,quite simply the greatest game ever made. no game comes close to the world in this game.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,i never stopped having fun. still play occasionally to relax. beautiful game.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-19,"this is the one game i cannot put down, i'm on my 5th playthrough right now"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-06,just bought the game for my xbox. excited to experience this masterpiece.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,i have 3000 hour in this game it is my favorite game ever
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"what an absolute joy it is to listen to someone actually narrate their own video!!! well done  so sick of all this cheap, lazy ai bullshit that youtube is saturated with these days"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,i'm surprised you didn't mention playing the game in first person
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-26,this is how feel playing mafia 23 just acting like im really just walkin the city and living thru the day as if im really in thereand taking the missions seriously as if im actually in a shoot or even doing the same in fallout
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-02,"this game is my zen, my happy place, my escape, etc etc etc. it keeps my mentality sane"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,"mods have kept this game alive for me. i never got into online because once i changed some of the gameplay aspects, there was no going back. my list contains the following clean horse less dirty over time no auto horse equipping  holstering weapon rebalance realistic navigation w hidden mini map online content unlocker  why ems dlc no bullet trails cinematic ped accuracy remove screen effects micahs hair fix hunting rebalance holstering animations no hitmarkers realistic loadouts for npcs serving spoon fix spoon bug fix maize sack fix ped damage overhaul softercores fix toggle run first person walk default more persistent weather camp anywhere all weapons unlocked in catalog longer days my 24 hour in game clock is tweaked to last 8 hours in real time. nice long sunrises and sunsets and plenty of time to enjoy the world and not have the days fly by rdr2 is my favorite game ever. hope my post helps people if they want to find some more immersive mods."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-03,"when i play this game it gives me a feeling that nothing else has ever given me. the last of us 1  2 are the closest thing to give me the same feeling but its still not the same exact feeling. red dead redemption 2 gives me this warm and happy feeling when i play. like you said, its so immersive that you cant help but play the game as if you are really in it. the open world is so beautiful especially when in the wild, on some mountains looking around. the story line is absolutely amazing, and hunting is also amazing. the world is huge and you come across something new all the time. its actually really sad that rock star hasnt made any dlcs for the game. i mean i know so much work , time, and money went into making this beautiful game. and for them to just not create new storylines for us to play is just so frustrating to me. but with that all said, this game is thee best most beautiful game i have ever played and nothing else can give me the same exact feeling. no nostalgic movie or cartoon, no real world place, no item that reminds me of childhood. such an amazing experience its kind of hard to put into words!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-06,start playing for the 1st time last month. jesus christ!! best .game.ever!!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-08,"i knew you'd get attacked by a cougar as soon as i saw the route you were riding. but i believe just like you said rdr2 is a masterpiece, shame it dont get the attention it deserves."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-13,started fresh new playthrough after moving on from xbox to pc this game is by far the greatest story ive ever experienced. playing it at steady 70 to 60fps feels so brand new better graphics than xbox one x 30fps at the time was the norm and had no issues but experiencing this at unlocked fps just feels like a whole new experience. its been 7 years and it feels like a movie that you havent seen in such a long time im picking up dialog mainly memorable ones but my goodness the acting and writing in this game is top tier ive yet to see a beautiful open world like red dead redemption 2. i missed out on big game hunting and handful of random side quests and world encounters mainly focused on main story line with some quests. it saddens me how the state of modern gaming is at the moment with insert identity politics gender politics this game is clearly made by passionate developers and i pray to god that gta 6 feels alive and full of detail. still cant get over how they killed rdonline and how they could have ported rdr1 remade on the new engine that would have made so much money for them  rdr1 pc is ready to after this game to have that total experience.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-23,"that guy and wolf you killed in minute 36. they lived together, i believe the story is that the guy was raised by the wolf. and they live in a cave nearby you can hear the guy howling and follow him sometimes. but the wolf do attack you. this game is awesome. i've got 3000hrs more and still playing. now with mods and still enjoying the heck out of it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,lets start a petition for rdr2 updates
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-29,my first play through i just focused on the main story now im hunting all the legendary animals and fish. doing the challenges as well and as i explore i keep running into stranger quest so im enjoying those as well as trying to get a bunch of perfect pelts to unlock all the outfits at the trapper. theres still so much to do and the games is still plenty fun
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,my second pay thru will be good honor and basically speed running thru the story and getting collectables and all their subsequent money after the prologue
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-09,i just started playing this game a month ago! this game is unbelievable
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,its crazy how people started to quit playing and i just recently caught up with it again. it still feels like the best and most technologically advanced game to play even in 2025 if you have a high end rig.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,i named my son arthur. he is 8 months now.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-07,greatest game ever made and no other is even close
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-18,im on my first way through! im at 48 and doing every side mission and stranger so it takes as long as possible. ill be done in a year at this rate. tremendous.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,"i will never quit this game. online is fun and i recently got into it but i can replay this game on single player time and time again. i still see things where i'm like, i dont remember this little pond.. slowly exploring and hunting is great. what has yet to be found?"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,great video feels like a love letter i'm playing this for the first time now after owning it for years... throughout it was slow paste then and maby didn't appreciate it.... but always was curious about it now seems like the right time!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-20,"and this is why i'm excited for gta 6, rockstar knows what they are doing regardless of them trying to make money from gta 5."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-11,"im on the epilogue right now finishing up the game, and i gotta be honest i think im just gonna start a new game and play it again. thats how great it is. i have almost all the hunting garments and i just might do it all again."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-13,"i was just riding around in this game, stopped in the middle of this forest area at like 1 in the morning. blew my horses head off and was walking around super slow with the saddle. decided that was it for the night and shut it off"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-19,"best game of all time , 100 will be playing fully one more time before gta 6"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-07,im about to experience it for the first time in 2025 lol. idk how ive gone this long without playing it no cap
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-15,ive started in 2021. still during the game

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-22,me just riding the horse and feel im inside the game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-02,just started playing it for the first time
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-07,"im a new player, i got rdr2 a week ago now, originally i had never been interested in the game but the horses and arthur drew me in. so i got it and decided to give it a shot, i began my first play through and was on every single day without fail, i used to grind on fortnite but since getting rdr2 nothing compares to it. i know arthur dies and i spent days crying over it because i saw sad edits and stuff, but a tiktok video in particular came on my feed and i decided to watch it. the video showed secret scenes amongst the camp members so i decided to quit my first gameplay on early days of chapter six and restarted. im now doing side missions and taking my time with it, i even went back to colter once i realised you could and i felt upset ? if thats the word. to know such a great game like red dead redemption has so much to give, yet so little seem to care. i know its impossible but i would love a 3rd game where you play as arthur once more and its his days before the blackwater incident. as the story continues you pick up more of members to the camp to make it what it is known as today. its an impossible dream but id love to see something like that"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-02,after 5 years i completed the zoology achievement.. best game i have ever experienced
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-19,yes this game is like next level immersive there is no other game you can compare once u get into this amount of details damnn

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,arthur ate his horse in this timeline.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,nah bro got high weight instead
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,arthur ate his honor
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,high honor  high calorie
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,i wished rockstars made author and micah frienemies it would be amazing to see those two save each other asses while making funny insults to each other.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,arthur died of morbid obesity in this timeline
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,i genuinely love how subtle the differences are throughout the game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,i love how arthur and micah treated each other like siblings who kept trying to impress their dad up until chapter 6
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,ngl there should have been more of these arthur and micah team ups
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,bro ate the population of strawberry instead

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,the way they push eachother down the stairs
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"i like them fighting who gets down the stairs first, like my kiddos on christmas morning"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,arthur ate the camp funds
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,thats like the scene that was cut and they both run
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,i wish we had more arthur and micah in rdr2
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,overweight arthur in chapter 5? that's a skill
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,why do you have low honor? i ate all my honor
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,i now have no regrets for going high honor on my run
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,dutch we need food
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,micah with arthur would be such a badass and fun duo man why micah had to be the rat
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,one more thing i love about rdr2 is the different branches of dialogue
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,damn they really did eat pearson in chapter one
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,that damn oregano big game got me hooked
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,arthur was the life raft in this universe
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,bro ate the honor
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,arthur if im gonna die why not a happy belly
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,arthurs in bulking era
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,he ate the blackwater money

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,arthur ate the damn wheel and the quarter don't forget the quarter
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,"high honor, high cholesterol"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,it would actually be cool if low honor would be best friends with micah
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,low honor ending should have been teaming up with micah.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,micah should've been a playable character  they should change the game name. its not a redemption story.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,so thats why he called me partner
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"that aint high honor, thats high cholesterol"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-20,i like the different tone of voice in each. confident vs uncertain
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,"i do wish that they there was bigger differences in the honour system, especially the ending."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,the level of detail rockstar put in this game is fucking unreal. im still finding stuff to this day and it amazes me.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,"rdr fans micah is rat he shouldn't have beaten authur he is bad. shows micah showing authur some kinda of respectilove micah actually he's my one of the fav character in rdr, micah and authur are great duo, i wish micah was a good guy."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,so thats where pearsons stew went
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,yet he still tried to kill his partner at the end
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"i gotta say, the micah character is amazing. i don't often see him get props from the rdr2 fandom. but they almost found a way to make micah the stereotypical bad guy gunslinger, without the feeling that it's being done ironically. for example, he uses cartoonish cowboy lingo like cowpoke, which sounds funny when anyone says it, but when micah says it, it feels almost demeaning. just like black lung."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,micah calls arthur partner in the lowest honor also micah shoots arthur
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,i love how micah laughs broo
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,thank you for reminding me to keep arthur as pure as damn possible
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,you know you going bad in life when the rat calls you partner
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"i noticed the way arthur says shut up, micah. also changes low honor sounds more serious"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,man why am i so fat.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,micah looks like he is from outer banks with this outfit
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,bro really likes the stew
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,even tuberculosis can't help arthur lose weight after all that minty big game.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-20,nah bro ate the whole camp food
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,high honor high weight
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,micah is also low honor so that if arthur is low honor he will have a partner in crimes
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-21,"jesus christ arthur, the flapping will wake every pinkerton in the whole states"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,bro ate all the mangoes on the island of guarma
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-20,both of them look like cj after 3 hours at cluckin bell
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,more like high cholesterol.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,"i think that if low honour arthur didn't question dutch and micah, they could've been partners in crime."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-21,"arthur and micah, bellybuddies"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,why does arthur look liek tommy
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-20,with that weight he had to drown in the shipwreck.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,lowest honor or highest bmi
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,i can't believe that the same dude voiced dr.fontaine in la noire
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,the details just keep on coming!!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,arthur ate the god damm wheel
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,may i stand unassisted
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,i dont think micah was a rat from the beginningin the mission before the last story mission agent milton reveals micah talked after they escaped guarma..so saint denis incident wasnt him.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,bro ate the wall to break micah out
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,i think micah liked arthur until chapter 5. i think micah took offense that arthur didnt like him.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,bro got low honor and high blood pressure
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,the on time low honor is good is when arthur and dutch talk on this island and he says maybe weve all just gone sour with the most serious face he makes all game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-21,he then proceeds to fall of the stairs and cause a 9.6 earthquake
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-21,two bickering brothers
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"lowest honor, highest cholesterol."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,arthur ate the goddamn wheel
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,i got tb  i got diabetes
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,although im glad we got what we got with micah he was a great villian i wish we couldve seen a more likeable micah in the game. just more banter instead of being universally hated in the camp
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-20,okay the way they're both dressed reminds me a lot of kaye and lynch
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,its been 7 years and i had no idea about this
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,he also crushes mihah in red dead redemption
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,bro ate the whole gang and spat out micah
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,micah looking like john lennon
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,bro is caseoh's great great great grandfather
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-20,my life is complete now! thanks
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,he had to many mangos in tahiti
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,the attention to detail this game has still shocks me
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,arthur ate all the mangos in tahiti
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"waint no way, micah so heavy he could stop the gta 5 train"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,fat arthur
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,arthur why did you eat my lunch
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"they should've added a low honor end of you choosing to stick with micah, sure i bet barely anyone would choose it, but it would fit the persona of low honor arthur"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-21,arthur is a true patriot now
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"bro, even the line delivery from both of them on the repeating lines is different.. what the actual no wonder gta 6 is taking this long"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,micah has the same build as michael in gta
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-06,"arthurs dead eye sound is a ticking clock, while johns is his heart beating"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,"fun fact when john visits arthurs grave, it's the one time he actually tried to put effort into his drawings."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,"cant herd, cant swim"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-06,the ticking gets faster the closer arthur gets to death from t
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,johns heart beat represents his love for his family and arthurs ticking clock represents his time left i think
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-12,its so weird. wanting to play as john throughout the game only to feel such sadness once youre playing as him
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,"johns notes are more descriptive, hes a better writer. arthurs better at drawing"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,johns sketches do get better though the more he does it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,"john not being able to swim makes the epilogue so much more painful, especially if you're going for 100."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,arthurs dead eye makes make players feel nervous
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-10,"i always interpreted the deadeye as to highlight that john is so concentrated on his target that he can hear his heartbeat, and arthur is concentrated on the time it takes to shoot his target."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-21,"john starts drowning the moment he jumps into water, probably because he cant swim. i love how he says, probably, as if it could also be some other reason, like john just ate a big meal or had lead in his boots or something."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,"also, when you're playing as john, the death screen looks like the one in rdr1."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,it all makes sense when you think of the theory that john list sight in his left eye after the wolf attack.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-12,the only time john puts effort into the journal is when he draws arthurs grave
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,"the ticking clock is arthur coming closer and closer to his end and the end of the life he knew the wild west as he remarks often throughout the game, while johns is the heartbeat representing the life he currently has and wants to hold on to, to go home alive to. pretty poetic ngl and a great subtle choice"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-10,"i will always prefer arthurs deadeye sound. john sounds like hes focusing in on the enemy, arthur sounds like hes focusing on making his time count."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-10,cant herd cant swim  arthur morgan
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-10,"the 1 eye closed is interesting, shows how much more of a grizzled gunman is during rdr2, i've read they teach most people in combat situations to keep both eyes open so you have the peripheral vision and don't limit your view"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,"the drawings may be crude, but the renderings themselves are well done and clearly drawn by a skilled artist on the dev team"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-13,i remember hearing that the ticking from arthers dead eye symbolized his focus and johns heart beating was his nerves getting to him. i like the other ideas of what it could mean
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-08,"i like to think that john's deadeye having heartbeats is just as simple as him being more adrenaline driven while arthur is just a more efficient with his time and cold thinking when he needs to shoot something, which adds a lot to them as characters. art is art, everyone may interpret it differently"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-24,"it would have been cool if the ticking sound came in at chapter 2 when he gets tb, and gets progressively louder in every chapter until it's really bothering and then finally goes silent in the final shootout. i think that would be pretty good foreshadowing."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-10,"1. the john's deadeye sound is the same sound from the first game. thought that was a nice touch. 2. john cant swim because in the first game you would instantly drown in water. it became an inside joke in the second game and i love how the devs made it a part of his character. 3. john wont be as fast as arthur until he meets landon ricketts, who helps him improve his quickdraw. so i love how they made hin slower than arthur."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,john is actually partially blind in his left eye from the wolf attack so thats why he closes it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-10,"oh, so thats why john instantly dies when he falls on water on rdr1"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-12,"i actually like that every single gameplay element has arthur better than john. fits the story. john isnt that character from rdr yet. arthur is looking out for him, almost as a big brother. john still has to grow into that fearless gunslinger that we love."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-17,"the irony on john and arthurs deadeye sfx. arthur time is coming up, johns heartbeat of last breath."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-17,arthur keeping both eyes open is a great detail to support that hes a better shot than john. a detail that id be surprised to learn was by design for that reason
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-01,i feel like the reason arthur's deadeye is ticking because he doesn't have much time
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-10,"johns deadeye is a heartbeat, signifying his family and why he does everything that he does. whilst arthurs is a ticking clock, which represents his limited time to live during the events of the story."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-06,that gun speed is crazy 0.00002 second difference
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-20,"john can swim, but his tungsten balls drag him down"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-18,glad we could hear the dead eye sounds over the background music
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-13,johns deadeye sounds like a ticking sound while arthur sounds hes entering a memory
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-19,that john dead eye brought me back to rdr1
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,probably because he cant swim. yeah no shit
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-21,side note im glad you talk normal in your vids and not fast and annoying like the other creators
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,john's deadeye sound is the same as rdr1 one
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-02,j hypei esse vdeo 3 vezes essa semana
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-29,arthur and john could've cowritten a detailed biography of the van der linde gang with illustrations and all it's fun to imagine alternate realities
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-11,"now, this is information i needed."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-11,this game has so much detail its insane and i appreciate every single bit of it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-11,"the deadeye is so detailed because arthurs is a clock, and john has a heartbeat"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-12,johns drawing is better than me
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,im glad that they kept johns original dead eye sound from red dead 1
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-10,arthurs dead eye sound to represent how much time he has left
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-01,the game is just a masterpiece. we are blessed to have lived whilst this came out.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-10,i still love john more
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-17,the eye thing when aiming is smart. its smarter to squint then to close it entirely because then you cant see outside
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-12,johns draw is faster than arthurs in rdr1 it gets faster
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-14,"it's crazy that we basically got a debuff switching to john. i remember trying to get the pirate hat, and having to go around looking for a boat because i couldn't steal one of the ones passing by without swimming. with arthur, i literally had no problem getting there."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,arthur had both his eyes open while aiming because thats a fucking shotgun
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-05,keeping both eyes open is good for having a good peripheral of multiple targets. its more calculated than one eye focus because hes usually trying to get his shots off quick to multiple targets hence the ticking clock
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,the drawing speeds are the same
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-23,the death's bell on arthur's deadeye is icing on the cake.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,john draw feels way quicker for me
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-16,i think it's worth pointing out that the two eyed vs one eyed aim is more indicative of combat styles. both eyes opened are best for close quarters shooting so you have a wider field of view. where having one eye closed it more for precision shooting and long distances.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-10,they did john dirty in rdr2. he's the fucking legend in rdr1. when it comes to combat he's the best there is in the whole story.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-28,nice ai slop vid good job dude
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-06,fun fact the draw time is the same
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-10,and they fight differently. john knows how to fight while arthur takes the brute force approach
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-16,whats sad is that when john visits his old friends grave he trys to put a lot of effort in drawing it.  if there is a eagle and it flys away he will say  good bye old friend  it breaks my heart
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,that's how i was trained for shooting keep both eyes open
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-30,arthur's deadeye reminds me that my deadeye meter isn't going to last forever
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-12,1911 john  1899 arthur  18991907 john
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-28,i was waiting for him to empty the revolver on micahs face
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-13,john is faster than arthur tho and red harlow jumps the highest
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-18,dead is the equivalent to observation haki in one piece even has a sound depending on the character
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-10,the amount of detail in this game is insane. i never finished even chapter 1 because i found it too slow but maybe one day
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-16,"its incredible how much detail this game has, cant wait to see what they do with gta 6"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-10,johns dead eye sound meow arthurs dead eye sound roar
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-11,"i love the ticking clock sound from arthur, even though it is supposed to represent the amount of time he has left, i think of it as equalizers timer that he uses to see how fast he can eliminate the threat."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,"probably can't swim? put some effort into these shorts, he literally, canonically can't swim and that's said multiple, multiple times bots making shorts now, wow"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-04,"i never noticed the differences in their sketches... rdr2's attention to detail is mindblowing, man"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,"one thing that can split them, who is the more ruthless?"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-05,when you see a video from 5 years ago but instead of seeing 2015 you see 2018
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,its 50 until we pull up who lived longer
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-24,the deadeye sound for john is the same in rdr1
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,also theres a theory why john closes his left eye when aiming its cuz in colter he was attacked by wolves and in his left eye so he is blind in that eye
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-06,i feel like johns and arthur's dead eyes show what they are feeling when they shoot john is calm and collected with a slow heartbeat while arthur feels he needs to be fast by the ticking time
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,everyone forgets john is blind in his left eye
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-26,"i love both night in the woods and rdr2 for doing some sort of personal journal that the characters draws and write themselves physically, and i wished more games do this. it's much better and immersive than the game that tries to do this but just write a log in the menu screen and its just typed it in there."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-06,so is john just worse than arthur?
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-26,arthur's dead eye sound has a clock ticking behind meaning he has not much time and die and in john's case there is heart beating meaning he will love in the game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-09,john still better
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-28,the drawing difference is the coolest one to me.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-26,the dead eye sound changes with honor.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-15,"the ticking clock signifying arthur's dwindling time left on earth, compared to the beating heart signifying john's love for his family. such well done but minor differences"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-05,"this is why after years, i still stay at chapter 2"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-08,"hot take, john was a more iconic rdr character because he was first and the im still standing scene"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-02,arthur will always be the best and always have a place in my heart. i started playing the game probably a week ago. im trying to do it as slow as i can because i dont want the end to happen and i noticed theres a couple ways it can happen one where he passes on looking at the sunto he gets stabbed by the douche he gets shot in the face by the douche in the same place that the first one happened. it depends on your honor level. im hoping i get the first one. i did the scene. i watched last night of charles going down finding him and making sure he buried him.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-07,i never noticed the deadeye difference until i watched this. that clock ticking in arthur's deadeye make me tear up. imma go cry in a corner now bye.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-16,they kept that dead eye sound for john
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-19,probably because he cant swim riveting use of logic there lol
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-24,also when arthur is running out of deadeye theres a clock sound reffering to his limited time and john has a hearth beat reffering to his love to family
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-04,this game has been out for a while now and its still things been discovered amazing stuff rockstar did
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-30,the ticking time dead eye i feel like would have a quote of times up. or be quick or die. then the heart beat dead eye would be my life depends on this. or its kill or be killed.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-30,dead eye sound of arthur is goosebumps
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-03,the sad part about arthurs dead eye is its a ticking clock counting the time he has left resembling he doesnt have much time left

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-24,my favorite game ever  incredible achievement.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-01,possibly the longest video i have come across in youtube. a miracle youtube was able to process it in 720p. most videos that attempt 20 hours fail to get processed right and end up with sub par quality. congrats
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-29,shoutout to this guy putting all his effort to make a full 100 walkthrough and having to put a timestamp in the comments

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-01-08,"one tip i always give new players doesnt exactly even have anything to do with gameplay itself, just open your mind and get immersed into the games world, it honestly makes the game 10x better for me at least, its probably dumb but a few people told me it helps them get into it because at times the game can be boring if youre not fully into it"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-06-18,"i've been playing rdr2 on  off since 2018  i'm still finding things i didn't know about. slowly going for all mission golds this, my 3rd complete play through. enjoy, my friends, best story  best acted game i've ever encountered to date. i've been playing the franchise since 2005 starting with red dead revolver, and between phil  fizhy i've not only learned a tremendous amount about all the depth in this game  all the historical connections plus all the western film references in this great story, but also enjoyed a ton of fun  humorous content from these two fantastic presenters . i grew up a duster fan, wanted dead or alive, the rifleman, paladin etc. on tv  all the western movies from the 50's to the present, stagecoach, rio bravo, both 310 to yuma's, the unforgiven, all the eastwood westerns,  open range amongst my favorites, this game allowed me to live in all those films. a gamer's dream come true, i'll still be playin' this game on my deathbed."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2022-10-13,first game to make me cry. started playing after an arrest and decided to quit being a party girl and stay in focus on myself and used my free time playing on a playstation given to me by my sister law. i had never heard of red dead before. only gta. figured since i liked gta this game would be a fun little adventure nothing to exciting. i had to stop playing the game for a few months after reaching a certain part and i knew what was about to happen. ive made so many life long friends from the online community. this game literally changed the course of my life. arthur is just a video game character. but that character kept me wanting to stay away from my former behaviors. he isnt real but the way i became so invested into his journey became real to me. rock star has been greedy and making choices that the community absolutely hates. but because of something they made im a different better person. arthur was real to me. this game is so great. not perfect. but ill forever have so much love for a character that i thought was going to be a forgettable little side hobby. if anyone reads this. and especially if youre playing for the first time. stop watching any videos about it. focus on the game. go through the first play through blind if at all possible at this point. explore. help strangers. trust me when i say first play through. youll know after the game youll play it all over again. enjoy.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2022-10-31,15 hours in. this game is something extrodinary ngl
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2022-09-07,tips 1. sometimes you will find animal carcasses on pearson's table. you can skin it and donate it back to pearson for easy resource. 2. you can pull a dead body from the driver seat of a caravan with your lasso. the same can be done to some of the dead animals that are in water bodies.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-12-29,"this game just went on sale for a historical low on epic, experiencing it for the first time. dodged all youtuber playthroughs because i wanted to experience it myself. i'm at around 50 progress now and i'm glad i've been so thorough, knew most of the tips already. i never knew you could duel with just about anyone and also i had no idea the hats or clothing items you collected went in your inventory permanently. thanks!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2022-08-12,tips 1. you can pat your horse from time to time while riding it to restore some of its stamina. 2. snake carcass rot slowly if at all. 3. you can fish using small game arrows for perfect fishes. 4. you can steer fishes in shallow water towards land and they will die and will be ready for pickup although icons won't appear in the minimap. 5. you cannot saddle up the white arabian if you haven't completed the 1st hosea mission. 6. take a temporary horse which has a saddle bag so that you can carry more small carcasses. 7. you can bring most criminals to a police station for a reward. but don't have himher long on your horse or they might die. 8. remember if unskinned carcasses rot you lose all the resources from it. skins and meat after butchering will never rot. 9. black bears will run from you but grizzles mostly don't. 10. you can lasso a bison but can't kill it with a knife. 11. you can lasso most charging animals who can be lassoed. 12. you can bring lassoed enemies and dead bodies from river towards you with the fire button.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-10,"i messed around and bought this game 6 years ago on opening day. regrettably after less than an hour of gameplay i foolishly decided that i didn't like it and end up trading it in. it's interesting that now in 2024 digital games dominate the market and majority of the times that you buy a game, it'll forever be in your library. i repurchased the game on a black friday sale recently and after spending a couple days playing it, i truly don't know what tf i was thinking on the first time around. i'm definitely glad that i gave it a second chance and only wish i watched more videos like this before i made that decision. at least i get to play it now while there's a shortage of such good and original games though. nice video!"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,the guy that recognized arthur 100 shit his pants
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-05,beaver hollow and every mission is just depressing
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-05,"milton is a 5050 on whether he would rather capture arthur, or he was relishing in stopping the powerhouse of the gang."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-16,i like how milton and micah ask about arthur sickness but not dutch
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-05,"my guess for the final one is he was the antagonist, yes, but not the bad guy in the situation. milton had been simply doing his job the entire time and gave the gang countless chances to leave unscathed before he began hunting them down. milton probably felt remorse for arthur. considering milton was assigned the van der line case, he more than likely had to learn everything about the gang and its members, so he would know a lot about arthur and his upbringing. he probably felt sympathetic for him because he was forced into that type of life with no other choice. also, he is a firm believer in the law and would probably rather have him given a fair trial than a frontier type of justice. if he did shoot him, it'd show he is no more of an animalmonster than the van der line gang is."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,milton is an interesting case. hes the first time the gang realizes there can be civil resolutions and not the wild west showdowns they are used to. he approaches them a few times offering dutchs head in exchange for the freedom of the gang and is met with hostility and in some cases fatal shootings. ive been thinking about this lately but i think the reason edgar decided to betray john in rdr1 is because he watched his boss try to do things in a civil manner and each time it never worked. he realized through the death of his boss milton that these are outlaws through and through and that the van der linde gang can not be bartered with so he used john then disposed of him once john did the heavy lifting.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-16,i never noticed bill's devastated face when he had to choose between dutch and arthur. that and javier lifting his gun explains why they chose to not chase down arthur and john.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"chapter 6 was so depressing. nothing made sense anymore, seeing arthur deteriorating broke my heart. i didn't feel like doing any challenge anymore or going hunting. i have spent the least amount of time in beaver hollow camp. i am so glad they had some uplifting missions that brought a little joy, like the widow charlotte, helping people."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-05,"i honestly just thought that milton didnt shoot arthur in the face because he couldnt. the hammer of the schofield isnt cocked that entire altercation, and the revolver is a single action. also, the by time it looked like the gun was pointed at arthurs face it looked like arthur had one hand on miltons gun and the other on his handwrist, stopping the hammer from being pulled back."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-31,"the entire beaver creek arc is one of the most gut wrenching arcs ive ever experienced in a video game. it was jarring, seeing stern strong stoic arthur morgan begin to get sick outside of cutscenes. it was a genius way they implemented it. i went in blind in 2018, had no clue about the tb, all i knew was that arthur wasnt in rdr 1. chapter 45 i began to notice my cores draining faster, and hed start coughing a little bit here and there. then in chapter 6, seeing big badass arthur run out of stamina while hunting, or wheezing duringafter running, or seeing him randomly coughing into his hand and there being blood on it, was jarring. let alone the spiritual aspect of it all, arthur being afraid of whats to come, thinking about his entire life of sin, wanting to help those he thinks he can help. and seeing the entire thing come crumbling down when just a little while before the gang was celebrating and throwing a party. the real tragedy is the fact that nearly everyone except a pretty injured john who would've had arthurs back and likely backed him up 100 when he blew the lid off the whole operation were either dead hosea, lenny, kieran, sean, grimshaw, was just killed. or gonesent away by arthurescaped on their own karen, pearson, marybeth, sadie, tilly, charles, abigail, the reverend, uncle"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,should i just sneak on now? god damnit.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-05,"milton was really just doing his job, and he gave enough warnings and offers to completely justify using deadly force, he was even quite generous with the offers, allowing people to leave, no bounty, no wanted level, nothing, that's quite generous considering most people in the gang were definitely guilty of many cases of murder or robbery."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-10,arthur morgan is the legend of the east
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-05,oh yea i didnt realize he didnt pull the tigger straus also didnt ask about arthurs sickness but milton did
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,"isn't arthur holding the hammer on the revolver? if so, then even if he wanted too, milton couldn't quite get a shot off. it's like what the joker did with two face in the dark knight"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-16,"i love when the game gives you legend status and all the npcs knows who you are and how deadly you are, kinda like ghost of tsushima."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-11,i actually never knew that dutch and micah didn't board the train on purpose. they wanted to see if arthur and john would finally die on that train without their help
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-01,once i hear its arthur morgan im no longer a law man
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-18,the fact that people recognise him as a legend willld
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-09,"must have been terrifying for the pinkertons having heard so much about arthur, to being going up against him. watching him shoot your friends dead in front of you, knowing youre next."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-15,"hate when people try making milton look better than what he actually was...he shot hosea while he was unarmed in cold blood in front of the saint denis bank. he also bragged about one of the callender boys dying a slow death when he got to him. he was killing people in a frontier manner. people make milton out to be some fair man. he was edgar ross mentor who turned out to be even more of a piece of shit than him. agent milton was a lowdown mf. he only gave chances because he knew how dangerous the van der linde gang was. him and one other guy walked into their camp to manipulate dutch into giving himself up maybe to disband their most influential memberleader so it would be easier to pick off the rest with dutch being out of the picture. he knew dutch was smart and dangerous, articulate and persuasive. if he could take that from them he would have returned the way ross did and murdered everybody when they were vulnerable. he was playing chess with the gang and only conquered because dutch went batshit and everybody split with each other. that's what he wanted all along which is probably why he had micah in dutch ear to do exactly that. as a whole the gang was untouchable to an extent but during panick, separation and feelings of betrayal it was the checkmate. in the end everybody got smoked even him. milton was just as grimey as dutch. they were both silver tongued with devious behavior they just operated on opposite sides of the law. when i played this game for the first time i paid attention to every single detail down to the smallest. if you pay attention you can really understand how everything panned out, who had a shady character, who's intentions were right or wrong and what was actually going on. i recognized the bullshit early on the game with several characters. milton and dutch were a reflection of each other. that's why the battle was harder and more intense than the o'driscolls. even arthur said he didn't care about them anymore after seeing colm swing because there was a bigger threat on the rise and with the deterioration of the gang he knew it was a matter of time before they all got wiped out finally. dutch let that happen by not knowing what to believe anymore, losing his faith and betraying his most loyal and strongest members. micah did that for milton to survive and escape with money. if john didn't come to kill him he probably would have killed dutch and took the money anyway. milton found a weak spot in the gang micah because the gang relied on loyalty which obviously micah didn't appreciate as much as the rest. milton found his diamond in the rough to finally take the gang down. milton was not a good person or fair."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,"hes a prideful man. much better status if you bring in a 5,000 bounty alive."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-03,dutch needed a whole camp. arthur was the guy supporting the whole camp
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,if you look closely during the milton scene im pretty sure arthurs finger is over the hammer. so even if milton pulls the trigger it wouldnt have properly fired
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,"one thing i noticed that may not be intentional but i found interesting. bill can be seen wearing a red shirt near the end of chapter 6, similar to rat and tahiti. i believe this hints toward bill's later betrayal of arthur and john"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-16,my headcannon is that milton wanted to capture arthur and make a whole ceremony around his execution
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-12,also when arthur appears at the camp to confront micah you can see the pinkertons allready in the backround and micah even seeing them but telling no one that they are there.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-15,its arthur morgan the last thing an npcs wants to hear
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-07,the song goes hard
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,"i mean arthur and pretty much the whole gang were giant pricks to bill the whole game due to his lack of intelligence and alcohol problem, so its not hard to see why he does not like many of them."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,arthur always treated bill like garbage. in fact the whole gang did. he latches on to any affection given to him so of course he'd side with micah
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-31,"arthur was blocking the hammer with his hand, milton couldn't shoot."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-04,"milton was pleasantly surprised at being able to outmuscle arthur, and was intent on just flat out arresting him."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,your arthur is very dapperlooking. nice job on the hair and clothes!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,i just hate dutch van der meme for leaving arthur in dangerous situations.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-01,milton for me is like a ross with high honor. he was just doing his job
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,"milton, despite being the antagonist, was just doing his job. he didnt hate arthur or the gang. he just hated their actions. he was surprisingly merciful to most of them until the end. ross on the other hand did not share miltons restraint. he witnessed how miltons leniency led to his downfall. hence why he was so ruthless in the original game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,"makes more of these extra videos, i find them interesting"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-26,milton was juste doing hes work
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-12,"something i never knew was possible until i did an allfirstperson or at least as much as the game would allow playthrough, if you toggle first person before entering the fence's shack in the mission with sadie, you will stay in first person when it transitions from cutscene to qte and can look clear down milton's gun, with even the rifling in the barrel being visible"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-29,i think that arthur held the trigger
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-03,milton is a good guy. he talked things out with arthur when he took jack fishing for example. he could have arrested or killed arthur there
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-14,it's arthur morgan !
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-08,"when i was playing rdr2 in chapter 6 bill said with the friendliest voice  have a drink with us.  he was the only one sitting by the fire and after he said that i sat down and than he said  i warn you, i aint too sociable right now."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-30,it's genuinely so cool to play as arthur with his status and notoriety
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-17,"you know by fact that an openworld sandbox game is done perfectly, when new details are still being discovered after 6 years."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-18,holy shit. ur logo matched perfectly with bills face i was wondering for a moment why bill had glasses on
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-22,milton was literally incapable of pulling the trigger because arthurs hand was on his hand
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,bro this music hits the spot.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"arthur morgan, the legend of the east"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-09,at the start of the fighting micah you can see hundreds of pinkertons surrounding them in the trees
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-10,milton was just doing his job.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-22,"milton was just making his job, but he was among wild people, so he had to be wild too"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-27,milton didnt shoot because capturing arthur alive would have been the ultimate prize trophy
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-04,still one of the greatest games ever made!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,"milton couldnt shoot, the schofield is a single action and arthur had his hands around miltons, he couldnt pull the trigger"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-13,the most likely reason milton didnt shoot him in the face when he had the chance was because he needed proof of that it was him
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-19,milton never got the gun in my arthurs face and don't you dare say otherwise
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,milton was just doing his job he wasn't a villain
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-08,he never got the gun to my face dawg
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-29,"probably milton wanted more leverage on the gang, using him as an hostage since he captured abigail as well and kept her hostage too"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-11,jesus christ. thats arthur morgan! that guy probably
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-11,a red dead vid that was actually enjoyable to watch? noice!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-23,milton was a vemgance driven ceiminal with a badge. the only reason he didnt shoot right away bc he wanted to see the fear in arthurs eyes and relushed the fact that he was going to be the one who brought arthur down
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-24,"it's arthur morgan, run!!!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-20,"i think milton wanted the reward for bringing arthur in alive, seeing he was already weak helped him think he could get away with it"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-09,"when the dude said its arthur morgan i was like damn right it is. idc if im sick and dying, im taking you all out"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-09,milton was just doing his job
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-07,the video in the backgroung the music
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,i cant believe bill is the flat iron lake butcher.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-10,milton was aiming for the balls
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-20,"arthur morgan, is a legendary bad a not just an outlaw."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-11,in the mission where the gang gets ambushed at shady bell if you dont go into dead eye you can hear one of em say hows the shoulder morgan after they shoot arthur twice once somewhere in his back and the other in the shoulder .
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-16,"milton wasnt a villain, he was doing his job he even offered them a chance to hand over dutch and they all could leave and live life"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-14,"another one is javier doesn't aim his gun at arthur and john, he points his gun upwards and doesn't aim hes hesitant to do it"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-25,milton its just the antagonist dutch is the villain
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-06,nah having people know you by name must make you feel like a god like imagine going up to people and they say its your name
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-13,"i think milton wasnt that bad of an antagonist. he gave all the gang members plenty of chances, they refused"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-19,badass arthur morgan
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-04,"milton toyed with the gang but was always merciful towards it. for all he cares, he could just take a hundred men with him and put the entire gang to the ground in a 5 minutes shootout, sparing no one, but he game the gang multiple chances but dutch had a goddamn plan"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-09,"i for the last one milton knew he could've killed arthur. milton knew killing arthur wasn't going to stop the gang alone. but leaving him alive after telling him micah was the rat in all honesty when you think about it, letting ms molly o'shea walk free is highly unlikely and she probably was the rat would almost definitely create divide in the gang when arthur returned, more than enough to split them for good. in other words, milton gave his life and saved arthur's momentarily to end the gang for good."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-09,"everyone knows that milton is a nice guy, ross is the villain"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-08,"it's true that milton was just doing his job, but what makes him an antagonist to justifiably hate is how unnecessary his methods are. killing hosea when he could have just arrested him, antagonizing arthur in front of jack and doing nothing when ross tries to act like a villain to the boy, kidnapping abigail who barely has any relevance to the entire conflict, etc. hosea's murder especially, as it is obvious that he killed him just because he wanted to and also sought to provoke dutch. most of his actions are simply reactions or warnings tho, which makes him a character of slightly low honor for me."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-15,"still think that one of the last times we see dutch actually give a damn about arthur is when he got kidnapped by thr odriscolls, mainly because and it goes for the rest aswell not one person other than, milton, rains fall and charles ctually truly asks or seems to care for arthurs conditon. althought tbf i think milton asked both because he nay have been disappointed that he is going to be killing a man whose already dying or because he felt like it was a deserved thing for arthur to have."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-20,there is a cut wanted poster for arthur and it says do not approach so people clearly feared him
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,milton probably just didn't want to ruin his suit lol
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-08,"i'm pretty sure for the last one, arthur's actually pushing milton's fingers away from the trigger, which gives enough time for abigal to shoot milton"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-08,"this game has a lot of character foil dynamics between a more forgiving and kind character and a more ruthless character. dutch is ruthless and hosea is kind. john is ruthless and arthur is kind. i think we see this in milton and ross as well milton gives arthur and the gang so many chances that he didnt have to. as soon as he dies and ross takes over an army of pinkertons show up at camp, hes ruthless in comparison to milton, and we know how much of a smug prick he is from rdr1"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-26,it's crazy that the pinkertons are suing rockstar for deformation.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-30,"arthur weve been friends a long time. me, going through every interaction they had in my head when?"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-09,chapter 6 makes me cry
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-11,"milton could pull the trigger all he wants, wouldnt mayter because his hammer was down and arthurs thumb was pressed against the back of the hammer"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,"and that is why i use masks and wear extremely colourful outfits when in firefights,i change back into normal outfits after i flee the scene"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-09,nice green sunglasses bill is wearing
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-18,btw he did shoot because the hammer wasn't pulled back that's why arthur is holding his hand that why and watching his thumb
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-04,several people recognize arthur and john in both games confirming that the two are very famous
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-07,best chapter in the game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-10,"i think when milton realized arthur was sick and very mentally different from before he was going to try and get arthur on his side, which is why he told arthur about micah being a rat and didn't shoot him when given the chance. he was hoping that arthur could be convinced to join him and help stop the gang, maybe even talk some sense into the less insane members."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-21,milton did pull the trigger you can hear it in the mission he just didnt have the gun cocked
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-18,"i think arthur was holding the hammer down for the revolver milton tried to shoot him with, so when milton squeezed the trigger it'd be much harder to shoot so that'd he have more time."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-02-21,this is the era where video games are better than movies!!!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-10-25,"just woke up and saw how well this was doing and wanted to say thank you guys so much. all the likes, comments and support on this means a lot especially since it's my longest part 1 i've done in the 8 years on youtube. much love and maybe we will reach 100k! part 2 is up! httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v7u6q7zjcab0"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2018-10-26,awesome to see how well this is doing. thank you all so much!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2022-10-12,i actually tear up because i actually sat down and played this game and the beginning is so iconic. the best intro to a game i ever experienced.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-01-20,i like how you don't talk over the game like your actually experiencing it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2019-12-29,"rdr2 was genuinely one of the best games ive played, ive never gotten more emotionally invested in a game before, never particularly cared for any characters but in this game ive felt something for each one of them, good and bad. definitely one of my all time favorite games"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-20,no saba que arturh era usuario de haki aunque me lo deba imaginar aunque quien le estaba viendo los huevos a los caballos para que viera ese detalle
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-30,arreglar los bug nah ponerle 48hrs de trabajo y fisicas a los huevos del caballo
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-21,"comienza a hacerme turbio qu los videojuegos sean tan realistas en ese aspecto. soy desarrollador y de cierta manera imagino el cdigo que llevaria todo eso.  si, ya se se han creado cosas mil veces mas increbles pero digo quien vrg piensa en reducir los geniales de un caballo respecto al clima simulado en el juego  aun que existiese una relacin o condicion que abarque en general todos elementos que deberan ser afectados por el clima en un npc. osea que no es nada complicado hacerlo me sigue pareciendo turbio que un requerimiento de desarrollo fuese testear modulo de encogimiento de huevos de cada animal. eso o que ya todo sea echo con ias jaja"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-19,a mi si me ataca el oso jajajajaja
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-10,"aunque lo del oso sea cierto, la verdad es que es una minima probabilidad, por lo que pia"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-22,nope imposible comprobarlo en la vida real lo del oso
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-21,lo del oso si no estoy mal no es asegurado que te funcione es ms lo mas probable es que te mate igual pero con suerte si te deja en paz
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-21,es ms real que la vida misma
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-18,viva el red dead
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-17,no mames por que le miras los huevos a caballos?
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-09-14,yo intent lo del oso en el online y no funcion
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-19,hay un poco de juego en los detalles
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-20,"quiero comprar alguno, me recomiendan el 1 o el 2?"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-22,its so cool seeing how dutch has just gone completely insane since red dead 2
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-22,dutch was one of the best villains rockstar made
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-22,"1907 dutch hello son 1911 dutch  you and the professor there, were gonna kill you both"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-30,can we all respect the fact that uncle outlived dutch
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-05,"john looks at the camera if he is alive, i hope i don't have to go on a red dead redemption"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-23,we gotta stop meeting like this.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-23,4 years can do so much to an already broken man
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-22,only if rock star actually made a remaster for rdr1
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-06,"he became what he hated the most, colm odriscoll"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-30,1911 dutch was intense man  blows a bystander's brains out for no reason  executes a captured cop in cold blood  terrorizes blackwater  refuses to elaborate  jumps off a mountain
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-01-29,1899 dutch 1911 dutch
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-23,this music makes him 10 times more scary...
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-25,"he doesnt have a plan,he just knows what to do in tough situations"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-22,dutch was a absolute beast in red dead 1
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-22,bros making my anxiety go up with this music
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-26,"micahs wildness was contagious to dutch, so much so he began enjoying killing, instead of low profile survival."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-12-22,"i think its fair to say even before shit hit the fan dutch.. had a few screws loose. but when shit get reals it's like he almost instantly sides with micah which honestly pissed me off because i saw through micah the whole time so it was no surprise to me when low and behold.. micah the rat. looking back at rdr1 we see him post trauma after he realizes how bad he royally fucked himself, how many innocent people he murdered, the friends and family he stepped on, and aiding in the death of the only man who ever truly tried to call dutch his friend. vengeance is a fool's game"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-12-08,"rdr1 becomes a lot sadder after playing rdr2. seeing the prime of the van der linde gang, how badass everyone was, the good times at the camp, the people who passed away... then you play rdr1 and see what came of that. the game has a more sinister vibe."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-24,"dutch has lost his love, lost his gang and even lost his own raised child. the last thing that he lost, was his sanity"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-23,dude dropped the coldest dutch edit and thought we wouldnt notice
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-25,"im curious just what dutch got up to in those 4 years, how many innocents slain, how many did he manipulate into following him? he ultimately turned into colm not knowing the men hes riding with or giving a damn about them. just paying whoever and not giving a damn as long as he has the numbers to keep on riding"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-23,the choice of background music was a little too good that it's nice to see you john. accompanied by that music made me feel like i was watching a mental patient go down an episode of a murderous rampage to a point it made me uncomfortable listening to it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-03-03,dutch rdr2 losing his mind dutch rdr1 insane and psychotic
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-12,the first young woman he killed in rdr2 was the first of his downfall. the young woman in rdr1 was the last before his fall.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-22,that's years john was the goat
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-01-30,dutchs eyes in red dead redemption 1 is pure evil
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-02,"its kinda wild to know that from dutchs point of view everything is crumbling around him he does anything he can to get out of any situation he completely loses any sense of what he once was turning into a cold blooded killer who doesnt care who he kills so long as he gets what he wants a far cry from the great man we once knew back in chapter 1,2,3 and 4"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-23,shame how he lost all his drip
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-25,bro finally ran out of plans..
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-23,pearson wearing winter clothes in rhodes
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-01,"i fuckin love when stuff gets spoiled for me, but thats the benefit of being so late to a game"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-10,its crazy and awesome how we watch dutch morph into a ruthless villain
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-03-01,dutch van der linde will go down as one of the most well written characters in gaming
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-24,i love how he literally saw him in the 1907 on mount hagen when he killed micah the rat.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-24,the death of hosea and arthur caused dutch to go insane.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-21,"oh man rdr 1 was so awesome, one of the best games. rdr 2 took it to another level, games a masterpiece."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-09,"since the blackwater massacre dutch was never the same, i'd love to see how dutch was even before"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-07,"it's weird that after killing micah in american venom, he goes even more insane"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-12-12,dutch is one of the greatest characters ever made best villain and the most interesting character i really liked dutch i think he really tried too keep the gang together but really his brain injury plus his mental decline plus the stress of the changing of the times and micah manipulating him too believe everything he says really broke the once family down he became delusional and living in his own head in a fantasy world where everyone could be free but in reality the plan he said never happened he was never going too stop running even though he said one more score and we are gone forever he was mentally gone
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-20,compare dutch from 1899 to 1907. then compare him from from 1907 to 1911. by the time 1911 rolls around you can tell he his a complete different person and that he has lost it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-11-02,voice actor for dutch was so good
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-03-28,i love how john said its red dead redemptioning time and red dead redemptioned all over the place
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-29,song  gallowdance vladnerq remixjamal cloud
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-26,its amazing how rockstar games got an game with already existing characters and simultaneously made new  great characters like charles or arther
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-14,johns voice got clearer in those later years lol
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-12,rd1 is a masterpiece as rd2 is
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-17,dutch completely transformed into colm odriscoll in red dead 1
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-11-13,when he said we cant fight gravity i knew he was going to jump
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-26,if you finish rdr2 and play in again you can see him going crazy since the beginning
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-11,its genuinely impressive dutch stayed alive as long as he did considering he didnt seem to slow down. he continued roaming with different gangs and never stopped fighting. an article in rdr1 says he xoukd of died in a fire during a robbery in 1906 so hes been fighting for decades.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-31,dutch is the best villain tbh imagine if arthur found out what he doing..
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-29,"i hope i never lay eyes on him again not only did he see dutch again, he was also the last person to see him before he killed himself"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-20,red dead oneend of dutches gang red dead two fall of dutches gang red dead three rise of dutches gang and maybe we get to play as young arthur and the final mission is the black water massicar
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-31,"when you first see his face in rdr1 just highlights his insanity, hes like some beady eyed creature behind that girl"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-23,"been a little while since i got one of your videos on my feed, glad to see more from you"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-03,the creepy music getting faster with dutch gave me chills
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-19,atleast john got to spend 4 years of peaceful life before getting forced into hunting his former gang down.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-15,dutch became micah in soo many ways but no double welding.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-15,dutch just went crazy after arthurs death
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-24,crazy that they made a character where even we ask wtf happened to you
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-01-30,best antagonist writing imo
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-03-03,1911 is 12 years after arthur
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-30,john once met dutch in 1907 on the last mission
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-01-23,dutch looked like hes in his 60s in the first rdr
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-04-08,rdr 1 dutch is the second to micah in being a menace.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-01,man this is just so sad everything that happened from chapter 5 and onwards just breaks my heart and makes me wish the story was different
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-08-08,i love dutch as much as he went crazy still love em
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-22,best game fr
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-01-14,we have all had her is the coldest line
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-01-24,saldame bro
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-20,in rdr2 its kind of sad because you start with dutch being your brother and the game makes you love dutch but then he just slowly turns to madness and becomes insane
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-01-20,rdr1...
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-17,sad  because he was a decent person to all he took in at one point x
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-23,doesnt dutch say something about every one at the camp sleeping with abigail? but then you got micah saying he couldnt get none unless you put a gun to their head
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-03,dutch lost his insanity once he figured out he had screwed up everything and had gotten one of his most loyal men killed by their own member and went downhill from there slowly.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-25,"oh i though people who played rdr 2 had played rdr 1 before, it is the first comment section i am on where many people did not play rdr 1 .. i finished rdr 2 for the second time since 2018, 2 weeks ago. and i will replay rdr 1 one of those days as i kept my copy since 2010 on ps3. 14 years later and having fresh memories after replaying rdr 2, i hope to experience it differently because the game is so old , i wish rockstard had remake rdr 1 the same way the last of us was made again for ps5 ...  i never played the last of us 1 because i know what happened in 2 and read about the ending in 1 so i dont know if i should experience tlou 1 even though i only know how it end and nothing else ? . i will not make many friends but john is not on par with arthur given my old memories of rdr 1 , i could change my mind but arthur is the best and rockstar did wrote better characters than john  max payne in the 3rd and detective phelps from l.a noire  although i am not sure phelps was written by rockstar"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-07,its so strange now hearing johns voice difference between the games. in 2 hes much more hoarse while hes far clearer in the first game. you can really hear how the va has gotten older between the two games.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-09,arthur died at the top of a mountain and dutch died at the bottom of one. really shows how rockstar prefers quality over quantity.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-06-08,"crazy that dutch went from being the leader and the one you look up to, to being the villain and the one you look down on"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-10-08,dutch lost his drip in rdr1 thats how you know a man is beyond insanity
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-06-04,"i love how in the first game we see him holding that girl hostage, and hes just crazy, meanwhile in 2 we never see it, but it is told to us so much that he lost it on the boat and shot that poor girl. its almost like maybe dutch had some type of serial killer mentality when it came to random women, we never see how he acted on the boat but multiple characters tell us he was not himself and the interaction in 1 is so erie that it almost gives off those crazed killer vibes"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-25,its not spoilers if the game has been out for over 10 years if there is a 2 then obviously theres another one
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-14,"even though i cannot stand dutch, he was a very vital and good character even though he was a bad guy. he had a way about him that just drew you in"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-01-06,"this music really matches just how badly dutch lost his mind, its unhinged, abrasive, loud, repetitive, has no logical end, it just builds and builds and builds."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-02-07,red dead redemption 2 is the first and then red dead redemption is the 2 last game of red dead redemption
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-20,"the foreshadowing in rdr1 is crazy, you can tell they had rdr2 planned when they made rdr1"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-04,cant wait til they remake part 1! thats gonna be epic!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-24,wtf so many people didn't play rdr1
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-07,fun fact the way he shoots that girl as he leaves in the bank is also almost exactly the way he killed that girl on the black water ferry job which is also coincidentally in the same town as the bank
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-01-06,we need rdr1 in rdr2!! pls r
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-22,dutches arc for his character showed him being so many typed of people like a good person bad person a crook a murder a savior
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-24,"i feel kinda bad for dutch, he had everything once, a gang, lots of money, he had colm killed etc, then he just lost it all, it may be his fault for trusting micah but he never intended that to happen. he had to slowly watch the gang fall apart, members die, morale being destroyed, no wonder he went absolutely insane in rdr1."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-01-17,"hes not a villain, he just has brain damage and manipulated by micah when micah was alive"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-12-26,"forget every character, mr.pearson needs his own spinoff"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-09-23,"damn, this edit goes hard. just a quick question, what's the hair mod you're using for john?"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-07-18,"hosea's death has driven dutch completely crazy, as he was already showing signs of paranoia before"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-24,fun fact. i played red dead 2 first. have yet to play rd1
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-10-24,his descent into absolute insanity and madness is truly terrifying
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-05-24,its been damn near 20 yrs but rdr1 is still a classic
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2024-01-28,"ive never played the first red dead, and im now just figuring out that rdr2 was in the past"
