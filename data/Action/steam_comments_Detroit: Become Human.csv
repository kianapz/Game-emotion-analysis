"[h1]  Story (9/10) [/h1] 
The story is super engaging and thought-provoking. It really makes you question AI consciousness, morality, and what it means to be human. Every choice actually matters, and the multiple endings make it feel like your decisions have real weight. I have nerded over it so much that i have completed like every choice possible xD

[h1] Gameplay (7/10) [/h1]
Ngl the gameplay is pretty basic. 
You mostly just smash buttons, use WASD, and click with the mouse. It works for the narrative-driven style, but if you're looking for action-heavy gameplay, this aint for you xD

[h1] Graphics (10/10) [/h1]
For a game that came out in 2018, the graphics still hold up insanely well. The character models, animations, and environments are super super detailed, making everything feel really immersive. Also, Connor is so pretty, and his voice??? Damn, I’m fangirling.

[h1] Sound & Voice Acting (10/10) [/h1]
The voice acting is top-tier, and the soundtrack hits all the right emotions. Every scene feels more intense or emotional because of the sound design. I freaking love it hehe.

[h1] Replayability (9/10) [/h1]
[i] [b]  I’ve had at least five different playthroughs, and I’m still not tired of it. [/b] [/i] I think thats all that i need to say abt replaylibility haha. I 100%'d all achivements xD
There are tons of branching choices, but there are two main paths you can take (which I won’t spoil). 

[h1]  Characters (9/10) [/h1] 
Imo the characters are really well-written. Connor, Kara, and Markus all have unique perspectives, and their development throughout the game feels natural. Their interactions can change based on your choices, which makes them feel even more real.

[h1] Cons ❌ [/h1]

[h3] Basic Gameplay [/h3]
Not gonna lie, the gameplay is super simple. It's mostly QTEs, walking around, and investigating. If you're expecting deep mechanics or action-packed sequences, you won’t find much here.

[h3] Some Slow Sections [/h3]
Certain chapters feel a bit slow-paced, especially if you’re more into the high-stakes moments. Some parts drag on longer than needed. There is [b] No Skip Cut-Scene Option [/b] which is honestly annoying when replaying.

[h3] Minor Animation Issues [/h3]
The graphics are great, but some facial animations feel a bit stiff at times. It’s not super noticeable, but once you see it, you can’t unsee it.

[h3] VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST Crash [/h3]
Some players experience the VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST crash, which can randomly close the game.

[b] Fix: [/b] 

-Switch the screen mode from Borderless to Fullscreen
-Set Resolution Scale to 1.00

[h1] Overall (9/10) [/h1]
If you love narrative-driven games, THEN ALL I'D SAY IS PLAY THE DAMNED GAME xD
The story is something everyone needs to experience once haha",True,15,0,2025-02-04 08:39:21
"Bought this game on sale, and it was absolutely worth every penny. Detroit: Become Human is a cinematic masterpiece in every sense. The story is incredibly engaging, with branching narratives that keep you invested in every character's fate. The choices you make actually feel like they matter, and the emotional weight of those decisions can be heavy. The game feels smooth and the quick time events are engaging.

The soundtrack enhances the mood and atmosphere throughout the game, and I found myself genuinely absorbed in the world.

If you're a fan of narrative-driven games with beautiful visuals and a gripping story, this is definitely a must-play. Highly recommend!",True,8,0,2025-02-02 04:51:22
"Detroit: Become Human presents the player a question that had me thinking throughout the entire game- through multiple playthroughs. The philosophical question of sentience. What truly is sentience? Do androids truly have free will or are they programmed to think that they have? Are androids capable of human emotion? Do the androids really have free will if you are the one controlling them? These questions are never explicitly answered, it is up to the player to understand this for themselves.",True,7,0,2025-02-07 12:38:04
"Unquestionably in my top 5 list; every single element of the game is a masterpiece, from the plot and characters to the gaming mechanics and the way the tale unfolds to the way you choose alternatives.This game is insanely replayable and well worth the money.",True,6,1,2025-02-09 15:40:56
"Detroit: Become Human is a gripping interactive drama that masterfully blends storytelling with moral choice. Set in a futuristic Detroit, players navigate the intertwined journeys of three androids confronting freedom, identity, and humanity. Visually stunning with stellar performances and an evocative soundtrack, the game excels in emotional depth and player-driven narrative. While some themes feel heavy-handed, its branching storylines offer strong replay value. A must-play for fans of narrative-driven experiences, it’s both thought-provoking and visually impressive.

Absolutely 10/10",True,3,0,2025-02-21 05:39:21
"[H3] Utterly. Fantastic. [/H3]

Detroit: Become Human is a phenomenal achievement of storytelling and presentation. Every line is on par with the best in prestige television, and each shot feels as detailed (and expensive) as a James Cameron movie. This single game highlights the creative power, and possibility, that video games can accomplish as devices for storytelling.

This is a short, spoiler-free segment on the game’s story which I’ll follow up with a more detailed look under the spoiler tag. On the whole, Detroit: Become Human (DBH) excels. Short chapters mean you’re always pining for “just one more” scene, and the game’s tight editing means you can make sense of weighty philosophical issues without getting lost in a tangle of lore dumps and endless context. This light-on-info approach can occasionally serve to the game’s detriment. The question of Android sentience is DBH’s ultimate conundrum: yet, we aren’t always given enough information to create our own stance. We’re shown that Androids don’t feel physical pain, for instance, yet we’re asked to feel empathy and intervene when violence takes place against them. These decisions, intended to make the player feel morally confused, can sometimes feel like guesswork.

Despite this lack of information at times, what [i] is [/i] shown is simply outstanding. The voice-acting across the board is superb, but Connor - an assistant to jaded ‘has-been’ detective Hank - ultimately steals the show. Connor is programmed to function entirely by the book, yet despite his best efforts, he can often flounder when trying to understand Hank’s more human responses. Connor delivers such a heavyweight performance that DBH requires us to follow not one, but two characters which contrast against his views to attempt a counterbalance. [b] spoiler-filled analysis next[/b].

[spoiler]Markus and Kara’s story feels inevitably weaker compared to Connor's, but some of this could have been prevented. Kara initially acts as a home servant to an unemployed taxi driver whose jobs are repeatedly lost to Androids. After witnessing him beat her daughter Alice, Kara protects the girl and they both attempt to flee the country. Alice’s quiet nature is understandable given her abusive dad, yet she never opens up throughout the story. She’s portrayed as a vulnerable figure to keep safe, but has so few lines that our empathy extends only so far. My feelings towards Alice after the first hour were the same as I had by the 12th hour. That being said, the cat-and-mouse storyline as they evade the police works well. Both Kara and Alice are placed into dangerous situations, which can be resolved via sharp street senses and social awareness. Kara’s story also places us in genuinely great moral conundrums, with the phrase “get it how you live” becoming a guiding principle for my survival.

Markus’s story [i] believes itself [/i] to be a bit more grandiose than it is. Having been wrongly framed for a murder, due in large part to anti-Android discrimination, Markus launches an uprising to demand equal rights for his fellow robots. Large portions of Markus’s story are clearly meant to replicate the Black civil rights movement in America, yet it feels so heavy-handed to the point of discomfort. Androids are bought and sold in shops, replicating how slaves in the American South were purchased by plantation owners. However, all subtlety goes out the window when Androids are relegated to a designated place in the back of the buses. Markus can follow either Martin Luther King’s non-violent approach or something more akin to the Black Panthers, but it doesn’t quite feel like the apples to apples comparison it thinks it is.

Markus’s story instead feels more effective as a critique of AI. Androids are blamed in Detroit for being so efficient at carrying out tasks that it makes humans redundant. Books scattered around the game world reveal a near 40% unemployment rate, as Androids supplant more and more jobs. It’s the working class specifically that are being replaced, leaving people most at risk of social deprivation and mental health problems to be forgotten. This doesn’t prevent Markus’s story from feeling any less holier-than-thou but instead provides a very natural grey area which explains human’s apprehension towards them.

As mentioned above, DBH isn’t exactly forthcoming with information leaving many decisions to feel like the blind leading the blind. For example, sacrificing Android characters in difficult situations is meant to be given the same weight as killing a human character. After all, they talk, act and feel like humans. Except in the late game, Connor can bring back a key character simply by changing their parts - nullifying the threat of their death in the game’s narrative. This makes me feel like I’ve made choices without knowing the full picture, and it’s easy to begin imagining the plot holes that result from this. [/spoiler]

Whilst I’ve gone into significant depth picking apart the themes, I want to emphasize that I’ve only done this because I engaged so deeply with the story. No other game in my 162 reviews has come close to warranting this level of analysis, and ultimately the story is absolutely brilliant.

What’s similarly brilliant is DBH’s visuals. The best way to describe it is [i]expensive.[/i] Clothes realistically sway in the wind, mocap faces react with nuance, and the game features over 74,000 unique animations. Stylised effects such as bokeh depth of field produces a cinematic look, yet it’s the game’s absolutely stunning lighting which takes the cake for me. In fact, it might be one of the best looking games I’ve ever played. This is achievable because environments are so heavily contained and controlled. The best looking scenes generally give you only a few metres of travel in either direction, letting the developers maximise the visuals and focus on creating a handful of the beautiful, static shots.

DBH’s visuals start to crumble at scale. During a mission in which Markus parkours across the city, you’re rewarded with views of flat and blurry building and ship textures. The bigger the environment the more issues tend to appear, but these instances are few and far between. Textures also occasionally fail to load in, or take a second to pop-in, which impacts immersion. Performance was mostly smooth, hitting 60fps at 1440p on high settings with an RTX 3070M with some drops to the low 50s when in busy streets. 

Gameplay is a bit less exciting: it’s mostly just a long quick-time event. As you move throughout the world, you’re given button prompts to achieve particular tasks. Flicking the right-stick in various directions is used to accomplish physical tasks, LB and RB for scanning, and XYAB for punching people. In reality, the game quickly becomes a right-stick up simulator, which can get tiring fast. Button prompts during fights are more engaging and challenging, but the game’s chase scenes are perhaps the highlight: offering speed and control of your character alongside the quick-time events. The game sprinkles in enough of these to keep things interesting, but some of Markus’s scenes can be particularly tedious. One awful mission, referenced above, has Markus explore a series of abandoned buildings and rooftops with little to no stimulation for the player beyond occasionally pressing Y and X. The result is mind-numbing, but this is the exception rather than the rule. Most of the time, DBH switches up its pacing and button prompts just enough to keep you engaged.

[B] Final summary in the comments.[/B]",True,3,0,2025-02-09 12:32:44
"Wow! How ahead of its time and deeply impactful of a game! Between the complex plot combined with the gameplay and graphics, this experience puts you in the hot seat to end all hot seats. Within is a definite reminder how the future is infinite and that no one else can see through its layers of light and shadow. After completing multiple different play throughs I am certain no other game out there has neither the same nor the similar shell shock; the mighty slam, that this one introduces to the player. The characters you can play as are charming and downright likable with their own intricate personalities and past. It is then solely up to you to envision and control their outcomes through the given situations. Despite the well thought out dilemmas in this game, picking a side of any of these characters is reasonable yet can be challengingly at the expense of someone or something. What can prove to be a difficulty is to not be torn apart in the process of whom you ultimately choose to go far with, as you will be going through everything with them together. Trying to figure out who is good, bad, human and far from it has never impressed me on this level before in a video game. Overall, it is widely accepted that this more than deserves a good rating and I wholeheartedly agree.",True,6,1,2025-01-30 08:38:02
"I love this game. The visuals, the characters, the story were all great. So often, the story had me overthinking and stressing about my choices. So much so I used a guide for the majority of my playthrough. Although my personal choices would've differed minimally from the guide, I regret using the guide. So much so, it got me to try to stop using them going forward unless I've been stuck for a while in a game (it's a work in progress, old habits die hard).

"While I liked the graphics and the character actor voices were interesting, it didn't really feel like a game.  Not really the form of entertainment I was expecting.

Imagine a game where your character walks 30 secs, then has a cutscene (that you can't skip), then walks another 30 secs, then another cutscene, repeat, etc. Your character can't run, can't jump, and often can't even fully look around - but is always carefully guided to the next cutscene. This gives you an idea of how the game's mechanism works.

You are given a few opportunities to make choices, and even shown a review of the impact of those choices between save points.  I found this frustrating as you couldn't replay prior save points, and I wanted to explore what outcomes alternative choices would bring..nope.

Again the graphics are great and there are some moral elements to the story that make you think. So if you have free hours available to watch a string of interactive graphical videos, then this is a good game for you.",True,1,0,2025-02-18 23:58:21

I still want to explore alternative endings and choices as choosing differently feels like a completely different story.",True,1,0,2025-02-15 21:15:29
"There are only few studios out there who give you something more than a game and Quantic Dreams is definitely one of the finest. If you've ever saw a film or TV series where you would come up with hypothetical scenarios wondering how the story would play out if the protagonist/antagonist did this or that, then Detroit Become Human offers you precisely that. It's a game by all means but I'd call it an interactive animated film. You have 3 main characters with their story and distinctive personalities and the mocap animation is just brilliant in this game. Every decision matters and has a impact on the story. The game does a good job of making you feel for the main characters and keeps you invested in the story while also encouraging you to explore the game further by making alternate choices. The music in this game is also one of the finest music compositions you'll hear. Kara's Theme is definitely one of my favourites.

If you have had your fill of playing big RPG's or other such open world games and are looking for something that you can play with a relaxed mind while also having an enriching gaming/cinematic experience, Detroit Become Human is definitely recommended for you. And for anyone who has never tried out such expansive movie style games with multiple choice and endings, please give this game a chance. Play it with an open mind and don't try to lump it with other games like RDR2 or Witcher 3, because DBH aims to provide you with a vastly different experience.",True,1,0,2025-02-14 18:48:50

You can kill some characters at first hour of game, you can complete story pacifist or violent way. There is much to explore if you're really want to take your time to see all the possible outcomes. That being said, running it on PC with hardware on recommended specs can sometimes be a little sloppy, with occasional frame drops and stuttering. The game is locked at 30fps by default and only have 2 options capped at 30/60fps, however there is a workaround out there.

"""Detroit: Become Human"" is an absolute masterpiece of interactive storytelling. I have completed this game for the fourth time, and each playthrough brings something new. It’s incredible how a single decision can impact the course of the story, leading to completely different consequences. The choice mechanics are so well-crafted that every playthrough feels like a unique experience—impressive and deeply engaging. The graphics are stunning in their detail and realism, making every frame look like a scene from a high-budget movie. The developers have meticulously designed even the smallest details, enhancing immersion. The music, on the other hand, perfectly complements the atmosphere—every track is carefully chosen, intensifying emotions in crucial moments. However, what moved me the most was how my perception of this game changed over the years. The first time I played, I made choices instinctively, without much thought about their long-term consequences. Today, after a few years and growing as a person, my decisions were different—I have changed my priorities, reevaluated my beliefs, and looked at the moral dilemmas of the characters from a completely new perspective. This is proof of how deep and multi-layered this game truly is. Detroit: Become Human is more than just a game—it’s a story that makes you reflect and stays with you long after you finish it.

"""Detroit: Become Human"" is an amazing game that immerses you in a world where androids and humans face moral choices and the consequences of their actions. The storyline is captivating, and every decision affects the unfolding narrative, making the gameplay incredibly engaging. The graphics and musical score are top-notch, creating an atmosphere that you want to stay in for hours. I was blown away by how the game made me reflect on the future of technology and humanity. I highly recommend it to everyone!",True,1,0,2025-01-30 08:21:56
"I am reluctantly giving it a downvote, because it is... not quite as great as it seems.

Don't get me wrong. It isn't a bad experience. I am enjoying it quite. I am five hours in and I will probably finish it, to see where it leads. There are alternate paths I want to explore. 

But it isn't a great game.

The graphics are quite beautiful. The premise is interesting. The way you are put in uncomfortable situations and given unsatisfying cards to play is enticing.

The movement of the androids limited to not-too-clear patches in the ground. It is also limited arbitrarily, frequently (the limitation isn't arbitrary sometimes, such as when you have been given orders, and this works very well and to a great effect to put you in the synthetic skin of the protagonists... But that is diegetic, part of the story, whereas most of the time the movement restrictions are there just because the world isn't open. 

Controls are clunky. Often you are required to press keys in more or less arbitrary moments and without discernible patterns. While the movement of the mouse to open a door is more or less consistent, as is the gesture for ""interact with something down, or to the left, or to the right"", about any other control isn't. Sometimes you will use Q to look. Other times you will use it to struggle. Others to crawl. Sometimes you will interact with things through clicking-and-pressing the left mouse button. Others you will use the F key for that. There is just no sense of getting yourself used to the controls and improving your handling of the character. It is basically a game of Simon: press or click whatever flashes on the screen.

Dialogue choices are, quite frequently, not clear. They are often timed, and when that happens it is good that you are given just one word describing each option, for a speedy understanding of what you can choose. That's the theory. The problem is that this isn't easy to implement well, and so it isn't rare that you can't figure out what kind of dialogue the word you choose will result in.

In terms of world building and narration, it isn't consistent either. Androids don't feel pain, this is well established several times. Yet apparently they can be traumatized through repeated physical torture. Androids will destroy themselves when subject to the high stress of being interrogated... yet our protagonists respond to much higher levels of stress with becoming deviant (or just enduring it, in other situations). A certain character establishes a strong emotional bound with a human... without really a reason why. Yet the bond is strong enough to break its programming. Another character feels that he is being treated unjustly, enough to break its programming too, just by being yelled at by a brat. The same character was thrown to the floor and kicked down earlier in the timeline, without apparent consequence.

Yet the main problem, to me, is that the experience feels *very* railroaded. You are constantly pushed forward in the direction the writers want you to go, either through having very obvious things you should do, or through *not* having any alternate possibilities, or through just smacking a sign reading 'you can't go there' and forcing your character to turn around. Your actions feel scripted, not a result of your own decisions.

Most of what you do isn't a relevant choice. It is just the only thing you could do. While this works well when the androids are serving humans, to reflect the way their programming constrains them, it doesn't make as much sense when they are supposedly acting on their own volition. 

The game exposes the flowcharts of choices after each episode you play. I think the idea here is to get people back to replay those scenes. The result, for me, is that it shows the actual rails you are on, reinforcing the feeling. 

Overall, it feels like an interactive movie. Movies *show* the story. Games have you *act* the story. Of course there is overlap, and thus experiments like Netflix's Bandersnach... but I don't think anyone would call that a game (or at least a *good* game, as game). I think Detroit falls in the same category.  

And the story is compelling. It is just that games are supposed to tell stories by *doing*, rather than showing. And in this... narration... it is quite evident that while they had a story they wanted to tell (with several alternative routes through it, granted), they didn't quite know how to turn that into an actual game where you have initiative and freedom of action and choice. All the fuss with flashing you keys to press feels like a distraction to the fact that your character can only go through the prescribed path.

Again: the story is interesting, and this piece of software may still be very enjoyable for you if you are into the topics it touches. It just isn't a very good *game*.",False,8,0,2025-02-02 22:26:53

"this is somewhat difficult to review, because while Detroit: Become Human's plot, storytelling, aesthetic, acting, graphics, etc are absolutely top-notch, the gameplay... isn't. it's fine, and there's enough branching (conveniently set out for you at the end of each mission in a flowchart) to ensure replayability, the actual experience of *playing* this is lacklustre. a lot of the time you're essentially on rails completing quick-time events.

this might sound like a criticism, but i'm not entirely sure that it is. it's more an observation that Detroit: Become Human is a piece of interactive digital storytelling that isn't overly interested in being a *game* per se. if you take it for what it is, you'll be rewarded with a really remarkable experience.

"I haven't completed the game yet but I can already tell this is my favorite game ever in the story-driven genre. I might even be one of my favorite games of all time by the time I'm finished.

Don't go into this game thinking you'll rush through it, or that they is tons of shooting or looting. This is a SLOW paced game. It is a story game. But unlike most story-based games, I think this story benefits a LOT from being a game and not being told through some other medium. And if you care at ALL about good stories, this is definitely one to check out.

PLEASE DO NOT SPOIL YOURSELF ON THE GAME BEFORE PLAYING. PLAYING THROUGH BLIND IS A HUGE PART OF THIS GAME'S PLOT.

Pros:
Mind blowing story, especially when [spoiler]going to the store changes the story[/spoiler] REALLY blew my mind.
Memorable characters and moments
Quick-time actions actually feel exhilarating
SUPER replayable

Cons:
STUPID TERRIBLE camera and movement. But, this game is good enough to ignore that.",True,0,0,2025-02-25 17:08:25

"I've always wanted to play this game, and I'm really glad I picked it up on sale. While the gameplay is limited—primarily consisting of QTEs and point-and-click mechanics—the true strength of the game lies in its narrative. With three playable characters, each with their own compelling story line, the game masterfully weaves their paths together in the later stages.

The choices you make have a meaningful impact, shaping the story in ways that feel natural and significant. You genuinely connect with the protagonists and their supporting characters, making every decision feel weighty. Set in a near-future world where androids are commonplace and designed to serve humans, the story explores their gradual awakening to consciousness, leading them to become ""deviants."" You take control of two deviants and a deviant hunter, each offering a unique perspective on the unfolding android revolution.

The worldbuilding is immersive, and the narrative builds toward a gripping climax. The overarching theme revolves around androids fighting for recognition as living beings, with each protagonist offering a different lens on this struggle.

Overall, I’m really glad I picked this up, and I’ll definitely replay it in the coming months to explore different choices and hopefully get a better ending.",True,0,0,2025-02-24 18:28:54

I just... I have no words. This game... it changes you. You can't be the same if you truly immerse yourself into it.

The only downside is that sometimes the options are ambiguous, and you think you're gonna say something but you say the opposite. But that's only 1 in 10 cases.

"Incredibly well written game with a great story and so many impactful choices that open up to who knows how many unique endings.

I was skeptical at first, because both the ""robots becoming conscious"" and ""multiple choice story"" may have as well been an overused trope and a ""multiple choices, but you follow the main story and minor details change / you simply get an early failing ending"" situation. But in both cases I've been pleasantly surprised by the great writing and character progression who caught me from the start, and by the impact of the choices that you make in the game.

Strongly suggested for everyone to play!

"Its a great story, which kind of drives the whole game. In terms of gameplay it is quite lacking of course, with just QTEs and some timed choices that drive your story. There are some nice tough choices for the player to take at some key decision points which add a lot to replayability.

The only small nitpicks I would have - I have been playing this game with an XboX controller and it worked quite well 95% of the time. Some really time critical points though, the inputs were not read. This really made me have to try multiple restarts to see if it was a problem with my controller, but it was just the QTEs with the Left stick that were not being read properly. I had to switch to my Mouse for these sections, but it definitely was very irritating the first few times I didnt know what was happening.

"This game absolutely blew me away. Before playing this game I didn't know anything about it besides the ""28 STAB WOUNDS"" meme that made its rounds when the game released. And now let me say, this is probably one of the best storytelling games I have ever played. This game is a thought provoking experience that challenges the player to think about what it truly means to be human. Is it simple biology that makes someone human, or is it the emotions that we feel that can make someone or something human? This game also serves as a reflection of the player them self, as their actions will ultimately decide the fate of the characters in the game. I highly highly recommend playing this game, not only because it is beautifully crafted in every aspect from the graphics to the score, but because it will challenge you to think and see things in ways you haven't before.",True,0,0,2025-02-20 21:34:40
"Detroit: Become Human is a breathtaking choices-matter story game that just hits different. The emotional depth, themes of mistreatment and injustice, and incredible character development had me in tears multiple times.

You experience the story through three different characters, and I still can’t decide whose journey impacted me the most. Kara, the caretaker android risking everything to protect a little girl from an abusive father. Marcus, who had a privileged life until it was ripped away, forcing him to confront the harsh reality of android oppression and lead a revolution. And Connor, the detective android investigating why androids are ""malfunctioning,"" all while struggling with his own inner conflict.

This game will stay in my heart forever.

"[h2]Detroit Become Human is unlike any other game, even in 2025. The music, environment, and cinematics pull you into the game like no other. You cannot even tell whether you are in a cinematic, or gameplay. Hardly anything is shown in 2D UI, but 3d spatial storytelling.[/h2]

[h3]Detroit Become Human - Playable Movie[/h3]

DOH plays like an interactive movie, more than a traditional story game. Thankfully it has incredible visuals, music, and a compelling dystopian storyline that makes it enjoyable to play. You, the player are the protagonist(s) in this game, and it's as if you are watching a movie. Yet, all the choices made by the main character are made by you, which makes it a very compelling final result since all your choices are decided based on your own biases and values. 

[h3]Incredibly Compelling Story[/h3]

Especially for 2025, and the advance of AI in our real world, Detroit Become Human offers a dystopian reality that has both its characters and its world grounded with depth, motive, and emotion, leaving you the player to shape the world and cards you are dealt. The acting is outstanding, the performance is something you don't ever find in video games but amongst Hollywood actors (of which there are some in this!)

[h3]Performance capture and Visual fidelity[/h3]

To say I was impressed would be an understatement. The facial emotions, tone of voice, and high-fidelity faces had me flabbergasted, this level of quality between talking characters sets the bar incredibly high and is likely the best dialogue and character performances I've ever seen. It sticks out even more than games like God of War, which have incredible performance capture because DBH is a game that solely focuses on story and acting over gameplay.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

Breathtaking visuals, Hollywood-level performances, and a fantastic dystopian story, it's complete cinema. Every choice feels personal, every moment immersive, and every detail meticulously crafted. If you’re looking for a game that sets a new standard for storytelling in 2025, this is it.",True,0,0,2025-02-20 13:46:24

Kamski said it could have been a mutation in a program. Make the Alice patient zero. Run through a short prequel, then cut to a sequel where you play whatever character survives at the end during and after the civil war. The humans could figure out that Alice was the original mutation, and could hunt her down.

Detroit: Become Human was gripping from start to finish. The story is a pretty standard 'humans suck at coming to grips with things they don't understand' tale, but it does so in an inventive and beautifully presented way. The number of choices and consequences is staggering, and replayability is high if you're curious enough to see where the next playthrough takes you.

I finished my first playthrough in just over 12 hours, following the creators' recommendation of not backtracking. You can replay/restart chapters if you want, but I felt my choices had more weight by playing straight through.

If you're up for a short but super impactful game, you can't beat this one.",True,0,0,2025-02-15 19:12:06
"As I've said to my friends, the game serves as a great mechanism to tell an interesting unfolding story. For a long time there was an internet discourse about 'choice' in video games. Discussion about how games lacked substantial choice, impactful decisions that changed the state of the game in ways more significant than some different lines of dialogue.

Detroit: Become Human is the game I choose as the example of meaningful choice in video games. It provides substantive decisions to the player constantly, minor decisions influencing larger ones, making some options unavailable or unlocking more or less desirable ones. In the end, how much you put into the game determines how much you get out of it. If you really want to achieve the best ending, you have to do your utmost to interact with all of the content the game puts in front of you in more than just a superficial way. If you don't carefully consider what choices to make you may quickly find yourself without many options at all.

If I had to deride the game for anything, it relies heavily on Quick Time Events to decide success or failure in action segments. Due to the cinematic nature of the game, creating an adaptable, high-quality control scheme that works in all cutscenes and scenarios may well have been unfeasible, so I do not judge the game too heavily on this aspect, however, if you are a serious detractor of QTEs in video games, then this one may not be for you.

All in all, Detroit proves to be a compelling and gripping narrative experience told from the aspect of multiple interesting characters who's stories influence one another and intersect at multiple points. Initially the game has significant down-time to explain the setting and setup the characters but once the plot gets moving things quickly escalate. Additionally, due to the significant number of meaningful variations in choices and consequences, the game has immense replayability that I find to be unmatched in games that market themselves on similar narrative basis.

Overall rating 8.6/10
Characters 9/10: Compelling, nuanced, relatable.
Writing 10/10: each choice felt impactful, but difficult. It was hard to choose the most favorable outcome at times. 
Interface: 6/10: sometimes choices were listed as a single word, with a timer ticking down, and no way to discern the full dialogue.  The camera sometimes swaps angles without warning.
“Combat” 9/10: Button mashing at predetermined times is hardly combat, but it was stressful in a unique way, it would occur inline with dialogue, so I was never ready for it, until I was always ready for it. It kept me on edge, which kept me in the story.
Replayability 9/10: there are entire story trees I haven’t unlocked, and I will be replaying chapters to see the outcomes.

"Detroit Become Human is just shy of perfection imo. this ""game"" is a button cut scene. Its absolute Cinema but it is focused on execution of Story telling as apposed to actual ""game play""per say.  when some devs focus on open world , these mfs focused on Open story. 100 pages of script compared to 4000 . Think of it more like a interaction cut scene with some areas having a time limit associated with decisions.  its a 1 of a kind gaming experience.  You forget what reality is / story is compelling/ graphics are Top Tier / Character development is in your hands. and your decisions result in sometimes heavy handed consequences.  i truly anticipate what the devs will create next .",True,0,0,2025-02-12 12:32:55
"The very definition of ""Every action has consequences"" and they show it in a beautifully heart-wrenching way. I love how this game made me question every moral and boundary I set for myself. It's the best game for overthinkers literally. I have not yet achieved every ending so far and honestly, it surprised me how it's so easy to fail a character's life and their goals. Every character is not just ""good"" or ""bad"" and I love how everyone is portrayed so realistically. I cried over this for a good few minutes and stressed over so many options. Even if I will probably find a game I would like more in the future, this game will forever be unforgettable.

The theme of the game is futuristic, inspiring, and eye opening. The choices in the story are very important and most fun part of the game. The game asks some crucial questions which makes one thinking about the choice that needs to be made, and it forces players to think creatively in the play through.

"This game will forever be in my top 10 personal favourites

The story, the characters, the action and all of the underlying references and similarities to real world happenings
It never overstepped it's purpose and allowed a lot of gaps to be filled in by the player.

It's satisfying to achieve as many of the endings as possible - whilst admittedly tedious at going back through some of the levels which have no effect on outcomes; no section overstays its' welcome after numerous playthroughs (and with the help of a few 'tricks', you can bypass some speeches and moments you don't fancy seeing again.

The graphical and audio technology for it's time is still brilliant - I remember when this got first announced as a Playstation exclusive and being jealous, until it finally came out for us

Now my main gripe is the excess crashes and failures to start - Deleting both Overlay(dot)JSON files from the Steam directory whilst disabling Steam Overlay worked a charm (had to do this upon every boot of Steam)
The crashes however were just super random at times for me; busy action or quiet moment; no rhyme nor reason
But the game tended to have a quicksave no more than 5-10 minutes prior, so it was rarely a huge hassle.

Achievement Hunting this was fun - I required about 3 guides; 1 for the last 2 magazines I hadn't found, 1 for an ending I couldn't obtain and 1 to ensure Connor died enough times (it's so hard for him to die the required amount without actively trying to force it)",True,0,0,2025-02-11 23:26:43
"Detroit: Become Human is one of the best games I’ve ever played. The story is amazing, and the way your choices can completely change how things play out is just insane. It really pulls you in and makes you feel like you're part of the story, not just watching it unfold.

I got really into the characters and their journeys. Some moments hit hard, and I actually cared about what happened to them. The game does a great job of making you think about your decisions, and it sticks with you even after you’re done.

"Detroit: Become Human is an absolute masterpiece of interactive storytelling, and I highly recommend going into your first playthrough completely blind—no guides, no walkthroughs. Just immerse yourself in the world, make decisions in the heat of the moment, and experience the consequences firsthand.

The game puts you in the shoes (and minds) of three androids, each with their own journey, and every choice you make—whether small or massive—shapes the outcome in ways you won’t always expect. Playing without outside influence lets you truly own your story. You’ll feel the weight of your decisions as if you were the android, forced to react in real time, unsure of what’s right or wrong.

Surprisingly, this game is incredibly easy to get into, even if you’re not a hardcore gamer. Both my father and my girlfriend—who are very casual gamers—ended up loving it. The intuitive controls, gripping story, and cinematic presentation make it feel like you’re playing through a high-stakes movie.

If you enjoy deep, choice-driven narratives with emotional weight, Detroit: Become Human is a must-play. Just trust your instincts, make your own choices, and see where your unique story takes you. You won’t regret it.",True,0,0,2025-02-09 19:11:11

"This game totally grabbed me from the start and didn't let go. I found myself completely hooked, rooting for the characters like they were my best friends.
Connor, Kara, Markus - they all felt so real I was genuinely invested in their journeys, feeling every triumph and setback right along with them. The way the game makes you care about these androids is pretty darn impressive. That is the twist of mind as we are humans, right, still the game makes you care about the androids :)
Now, about the gameplay - for me it's got this perfect mix of story and action. It hits that sweet spot where you're always engaged but never overwhelmed.
Oh, and can we talk about the choices?  It's not just some illusion of choice - your decisions can totally change how things play out. It's like you're the director of your own sci-fi blockbuster.
As for the controls, I gotta say, they were smooth as butter for me. Whether I was using a controller or mouse and keyboard, everything felt responsive and intuitive. I know some players had issues with the mouse and keyboard setup, but honestly, it worked just fine for me. No complaints here!
The visuals? Absolutely stunning. Detroit looks gorgeous, and the attention to detail is insane. It really helps sell this futuristic world they've created.
Bottom line, Detroit: Become Human is a fantastic game that shows just how talented and dedicated the dev team is. They clearly poured their hearts into making something special, and it shows. If you're looking for a game that'll make you think, feel, and maybe even question what it means to be human, give this one a shot. Trust me, you won't regret it!",True,0,0,2025-02-09 09:03:50

I was having some pretty terrible controller and keyboard input issues however.

Not sure if it was windows 11, my wireless usb 8bitdo adapter or the game itself. Maybe a bit of all 3?
The Controller would randomly stop responding in game. More specifically when QTE's would pop up.

This resulted in quite a few alt+f4's to retry the QTE.

A few times i switched to KB&M to see if that helped but i was getting the wrong input prompts and failing QTE's. Like it saying mash/press ""Q"" but it was actually ""A"" or having ""Spacebar"" as prompts for everything.

Both my controller and keyboard are wireless, Not sure if that has anything to do with it.

Went and got Heavy Rain after because this developer needs support, and I need to see what else they have done. Games like this don't come out very often.

"Graphics and Design: Picture this: jaw-dropping visuals that make you squint and question whether you're still playing a game or somehow stumbled into a futuristic art exhibit. The level of detail is so high, you might find yourself complimenting a digital character's hairstyle and then wondering what you've done with your life.

Gameplay: Now, let's talk gameplay. You'll be controlling three androids—Connor, the android detective with the charisma of a cold latte; Markus, the robo-revolutionary who's basically the android Che Guevara; and Kara, the nanny bot turned freedom fighter. Each of their stories is as complex as assembling IKEA furniture without instructions. Your decisions actually matter here, so try not to mess things up. Or do. It's your dystopian nightmare, after all.

Story and Characters: The story tackles big questions like ""What does it mean to be human?"" and ""Why can't my toaster love me back?"" The characters are so well-developed you'll forget they're made of ones and zeroes. Connor's cool-as-a-cucumber detective work, Markus's rise to android hero, and Kara's heartfelt journey for freedom will have you questioning your own moral compass and possibly shedding a tear or two.

Sound and Music: The voice acting is top-notch, with performances that might just make you Google the actors to see if they're actually androids. The soundtrack is a mix of haunting melodies and epic scores, perfect for those moments when you need to make a life-or-death decision about a character you've grown way too attached to.

Replayability: Replayability? Oh, it's got that in spades. With multiple branching paths and a gazillion (give or take) possible endings, you'll find yourself playing it over and over, trying to see what happens if you make different choices. It's like a digital version of ""What if?""

Conclusion: Detroit: Become Human is like a rollercoaster ride through a futuristic soap opera, and it's every bit as exhilarating as it sounds. If you're into narrative-driven games with a side of existential crisis, this one's for you. Just remember, it's all fun and games until your smart speaker starts quoting Nietzsche.

The topics of the game are very much relevant to 2025-- thinking about the question of displacement from automation and how technology doesn't really solve social problems.",True,0,0,2025-02-04 01:47:37

"Not my usual type of game but thought I'd give it a shot on sale. Glad I did, this thing is kinda like being in a sci-fi movie where you are the main protagonist(s). Visuals and sound are well done, acting is good with some memorable characters played by recognizable actors, pacing is plenty to keep you going. The subject matter is, if you are a sci-fi fan, fairly familiar but still decently done. While for me it was not a tear-jerker, it does have it's memorable emotional moments and is thought provoking about situations that could conceivably become real in the future.

Even though I completed it, I can see I missed a hell of a lot of content due to decisions I made. I may revisit this at some stage but I am satisfied with the ending regardless and could easily put this away without feeling I didn't get value out of it or didn't 'finish' everything.

Minor quibbles ... a 'romance' seemed to develop even though you disagreed with most of the courses of action suggested by the other party, so that seemed a bit forced. That's about the only thing that grated for me though.  Also, it was clear society relies on androids to function, without giving too much away a key plot direction doesn't make sense with that in mind.

"Detroit: Become Human is one of the most compelling and engaging games I’ve played. From the very start, I was hooked, not only by the gripping narrative but also by how personal the story felt. The fact that the world presented in the game could happen in the future—and some of it is already partially unfolding today—made it all the more intense. While I do hope the future isn’t as dire as the game suggests, it was incredibly thought-provoking, leaving me with plenty to reflect on.

The decision-making in this game is phenomenal. Your choices truly matter, and how people perceive you shifts depending on your actions. For my first playthrough, I focused on building strong relationships with North, Alice, and Hank. It was satisfying to see their trust in me grow based on the decisions I made. It added so much depth to the experience!

As for characters, Connor stood out the most for me. His journey resonated deeply with me because, like him, I spent a lot of time obeying everyone around me until one day I decided to rebel and take control of my own destiny. Watching him go through that transformation was powerful.

The pacing of the game kept me invested the whole way through. However, the cutscenes, while beautifully done, did get a bit long and repetitive at times. It would have been nice to have an option to skip them once I knew the key plot points. But honestly, the overall experience was so gripping that it didn’t hinder my enjoyment too much.

Speaking of visuals, the graphics are simply stunning. The city of Detroit feels alive, and the reflections off the buildings make it feel like you’re truly immersed in the world. The attention to detail is exceptional.

Overall, Detroit: Become Human left a lasting impact on me. It’s a game that makes you think, makes you feel, and keeps you engaged from start to finish. I’ll be recommending it to all my friends—especially those who enjoy narrative-driven experiences and thought-provoking choices.",True,0,0,2025-01-31 01:24:19

"I never really write reviews for anything but this game was really one of my favorites so I guess it's worth that. This review was also written on my second full play through. (This will be long, I'll be surprised if anyone reads it completely but I really wanted to write this soooo)
PS, this will contain spoilers

[h1] pros [/h1]

This game was an absolute masterpiece to look at. The beautiful scenery along with the details and various settings made this game such a nice experience. I especially liked how human the characters were. You could actually read the character's emotions on their face, making the game so much more human and attaching. The little game details were also making this gaming experience so wonderful. For example, when Hank tries to replicate Connor's coin trick in Stratford Tower, or how Zlako has blue blood on his fingertips when Kara enters his mansion. 

I adored Connor's story line. It is genuinely one of the best written story I've ever came across in gaming. It's so deep and gives the player an gives the player actual dilemmas regarding their decisions. Connor is a complex and really attaching character and the was everything is paced is wonderful. I often had to pause my game and think before making some of those decisions, like the one in meet Kamski, for example, where you have to choose between either or not shooting Chloe.

I think it's insane how much control the player has over the game. The amount of different endings and elements to account for is insane. I have over 200 hours over this game (don't base yourself off the steam time shown, I also have a Playstation lol) and i am not even near being done. Pretty sure the first chapter alone, ""The hostage"", took me about an our and a half to 100%. Every single action you take has small repercussions, either it is through character lines or through elements in the game, for example, certain magazines being there either or not you chose to be violent or Connor's graves in the zen garden depending on how many times you died. 

On the same topic, oddly enough, I love the death-ability of the characters. The game doesn't care if you kill its characters and it shows. I'd be lying if I say I didn't spend hours rewinding and trying to keep my characters alive through a fight. You don't get a ""you died, restart ?"" banner if you kill someone, the game moves on and it's too bad for you. I think this makes the experience so much more challenging and interesting.

[h1] now, for the cons [/h1]

I might be alone on this one, but I did not enjoy Kara or Marcus' stories as much as i would've imagined. I will explain both of my points individually to make this clearer

Beginning with Kara. I personally think making Alice an android was lame af. It was a plot twist, sure, but not all plot twists are good. I originally liked this aspect of the game, but now replaying it, I think it breaks the idea that androids and humans can live together, regardless of what they are or represent. I personally believe the game would've been better if she was a real human and not just an android. Kara had a really ""chore"" game style, and it's ridiculous how the only female main character has to be a babysitter the whole time. I also personally think the Midnight train chapter at Rose's place made no sense. ""Reports of androids"" Are we deaduzz?!?? This chapter- actually just the whole Rose part in general- felt like a reference to the underground railroad, which I think felt reused.

Talking about the underground railroad, I personally had a hard time with the holocaust and civil war parallels. To me, comparing androids to what happened to the black and Jewish communities is dehumanizing. The game is filled with allegories to real life historical forms of oppression, excepted both elements are really not comparable. The problem with racism is that we hate on others for physical or spiritual differences, although we are part of a same specie. In Detroit, the characters are robots, which means they may look human, but are obviously not apart of the human race. This, to me, felt disrespectful to the real life struggles experienced by hundreds of millions by reducing their problems to those of an android's. 

Now, onto Marcus' story. I think the idea was good, but I feel like his character development was poor. While we got to know Kara and Connor through the story, We got pitched a ""lonely at the top"" narrative with basically no development, just a total shift in his views after he joined Jericho. To me, Marcus felt like one of those spoiled rich kids who throw a tantrum because their parents ask them to empty the dishwasher or something. I also hated North, I think her character was poorly written, cliché and the romance between both characters felt insanely forced. Overall though, I think the Marcus part was decent, with some really fun parts and cool ideas. The character, on the other end, was not developed enough.

This was my overall experience of the game andddd yeah!! If you made it this far, sorry for my crappy English, please ignore any mistakes. Overall though, I would definitely recommend this game.",True,2,0,2025-02-09 23:03:52

"좀 더 역동적인 넷플릭스라고 해야할까. 내가 선택한 루트에 따라 전개가 달라지는, 미디어. 게임이라는 매체를 고려했을 때, 액션은 적고 감상하는 부분이 조금 많은 지점을 감안하면 훌륭한 작품이다.

"Let’s be honest—Detroit: Become Human isn’t really a video game. It’s an interactive movie with occasional button prompts to keep your hands busy. You don’t “play” Detroit, you watch it and nudge it along. It’s the kind of experience that makes you feel like you’re shaping the story, even if the major beats are already set in stone.

I’d call it a “Choose Your Own Adventure” game, but that phrase is copyrighted, so let’s just say it’s a “Select Your Preferred Narrative Diversion” instead. Jokes aside, while your choices do branch out into different scenes and character fates, the game eventually funnels you into just a handful of possible endings. You can take different paths, sure, but you’re still arriving at the same destination.

That being said, the ride itself is pretty entertaining. The story is full of heavy-handed themes about androids and humanity, sometimes subtle as a sledgehammer, but it’s well-acted and visually impressive. The game does a great job of making you feel like your choices matter, even when they don’t.

If you’re looking for deep gameplay mechanics, you won’t find them here. But if you’re in the mood for a cinematic experience with some “press X to doubt” moments along the way, Detroit: Become Human is still worth checking out.",True,1,0,2025-02-02 07:06:27

"Quando criança eu adorava assistir a série desse jogo do Alanzoka e desde aquela época Detroit: Become Human estava no topo da minha lista de jogos que eu sonhava em jogar, mas não podia (por ter um Xbox), então da pra imaginar a minha felicidade quando vi que ele estava em promoção na Steam e rodava no meu computador não muito potente, eu comprei na hora, zerei em três dias no máximo e decidi que seria minha primeira platina. 

Felizmente, graças ao jogo ser baseado em escolhas, ter assistido a série do Alan não estragou a minha experiência, é claro que eu sabia de certas coisas que aconteceriam, mas mesmo assim consegui fazer caminhos diferentes sem querer. E eu fico muito feliz por isso porquê jogar esse jogo pela primeira vez é uma daquelas experiências únicas que só se entende jogando, é bizarro o medo que eu tinha em fazer uma ação ""errada"" por conta da conexão que eu criei com esses personagens.

A gameplay (que é um problema para muitos) não me incomodou de nenhuma forma, já que para mim ela se combina perfeitamente com a história maravilhosa desse jogo, e que mesmo lenta, ainda trouxe diversos quick time events tensos e desafiadores quando a ação era necessária para a história.

Enfim, Detroit: Become Human tem uma história excelente que consegue trazer vida às máquinas por meio de diversos paralelos à história humana e suas partes tristes e sombrias e também por momentos tocantes que realmente te conectam aos personagens. Eu amei esse jogo, ele conseguiu me marcar e se tornar um dos meus jogos favoritos. A espera realmente valeu à pena.

This type of gameplay was very new to me but it was easy to catch on and oh so anxiety inducing in the right scenes. I can't fathom how this game was written and created. It must have taken literally forever. But it's so thorough and the flow chart feature is amazing. 

I will never understand people who play for achievements during their FIRST play through for this game. Since choices REALLY DO MATTER. I feel like that takes away from the point. Please just play it and choose what to do via INSTINCT your first time around!!

"Detroit: Become Human is an emotionally gripping, visually stunning, and thought-provoking interactive drama that delivers one of the most compelling narratives in modern gaming. Quantic Dream has crafted a cinematic experience that puts player choice at the forefront, allowing for deeply personal storytelling where every decision shapes the fate of its three protagonists—and the world around them.

The storytelling is exceptional, following three androids—Connor, Kara, and Markus—as they navigate a world on the brink of revolution. Each character’s arc is rich with tension, moral dilemmas, and powerful moments, making every playthrough feel unique. The game forces you to make tough decisions, and unlike many choice-driven games, Detroit: Become Human actually delivers consequences that matter, leading to vastly different outcomes based on your choices.

Visually, the game is breathtaking. The character models, facial animations, and environments are some of the best in gaming, making every scene feel cinematic and immersive. The level of detail in the futuristic Detroit setting is impressive, bringing the world to life with a perfect blend of realism and sci-fi aesthetics.

The gameplay, while primarily based on dialogue choices, quick-time events, and exploration, is engaging and well-paced. The interactive mechanics ensure that you stay involved, whether it’s analyzing crime scenes as Connor, making survival choices as Kara, or leading a revolution as Markus. Each character has their own unique gameplay elements, keeping the experience fresh.

The soundtrack is another highlight, with hauntingly beautiful compositions that perfectly match the emotional weight of the story. The voice acting is top-notch, with standout performances that add depth and humanity to each character.

While some moments can feel heavy-handed in their social commentary, the game’s strong narrative, stunning presentation, and meaningful player choices make it an absolute must-play for fans of interactive storytelling.

Rating: 9.5/10 – A cinematic, choice-driven masterpiece that delivers an unforgettable narrative experience.",True,0,0,2025-02-13 22:23:11

Not the game I thought it would be, and it certainly blended in elements that I typically don't like. I am not a huge fan of ""choices matter"" (especially when the choice you are making is not always clear based on the prompts you have to choose from and is time-gated) and there are a lot elements of ""point and click / spot the clue"" that I am normally not a fan of.

"This game is eerily accurate. It's quite interesting to have a simulation of AI integration into US society, with a vivid concept of human machine relations. Game gives accelerationist vibes, models of infinite growth in tech and economics without regard to limited resources and psychosocial effects on humans as well as machines. The game is rich in capitalist dogma to cast blame and ire upon the mysterious ""other"", which serves the purpose of diverting attention from failing policies. Classic. Ranting and raving about Marx's take on automation is a mute point to persuade millions of tech ideologues that a system built on exploitation is doomed to fail when the labor itself as a resource becomes extinguished, whether biological or mechanical. I am sure those enamored by the ramblings of weak men posing as big brained 5D chess masters, ""entrepreneurs"", with their illusions of grandiosity as to how they will thwart these problems, would like to whisper in my ear, that there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. Far be it for me to advise that one sh'ant hold their breath while having smoke blown up their ass, here is the cold water: they could spit on you and your whole bloodline, you mean nothing to them, their victories are not yours. What you can do though, is stop being a beta shitlib and prescribe to your own ideas instead of riding the coattails of morons.

Why do I have to steal clothes in front of the kid? if I already have money for a motel, why steal at all? forced decision-making, no freedom! These decisions regarding the rebellion and the actions of our police partners... average... The whole idea with the magazine and what's on the cover, which then allows our character to understand certain things.... I don't know...., also average idea.

"I do have some complaints, primarily, some decisions like climbing through a cancel once you engage with them you can't undo them, like you can't just close the window and back-out, NO, you HAVE to climb through the window, major oversight, and a massive annoyance. And if you try to go back to that scene, the flowchart doesn't save AT ALL so you have to go through the ENTIRE MISSION again, just for something minor, this is a big problem with spare parts, I just wanted to look around BEFORE stealing the key, I didn't realise it would FORCE me to climb through the window after opening it. This is my biggest disappointment with the game.

This is a great 'choose your story' game, which covers a lot of moral and ethical dilemmas around artificial intelligence, sentience, and autonomy of androids within a not so distant future. If you played through it once, don't be deceived, you haven't played the whole game (and this is clearly shown with the flowcharts). Not going to spoil the story.

My only 'complaint' is that the game is hard locked to 60fps, kind of obvious they ported it from the PS4, but the game is beautiful and pleasing to look at, and the lower framerate doesn't really make for a worse experience, since it doesn't rely on hundred-ms reaction times like various fps games do, and I say this as someone who likes their games to run at 165fps. There are some performance drops here and there, and its noticeable, when you scan an environment sometimes the framerate will drop quite significantly, but again, I don't think it necessarily detracts from the game.",True,0,0,2025-02-03 18:58:22

"It has been a long time since I've been so invested in a game of this type to such a degree. They usually feel a bit too simple, transparent, and predictable. But this one felt different the moment I got into the first chapter. From the intro cinematic to the first moment controlling the character, there was this subtle sense of awe in the back of my mind ""This is well made, you've got my attention,"" and it never went away to the end.

The writing feels so good, but the way entire scenes or chapters will be drastically different or missing completely depending on earlier actions, often those of other characters, is incredibly satisfying to play through, to see your actions have weight, have meaning, good or bad.
Choices matter, the things you say, the things you do. Likewise, the things you DON'T do also have an impact. Implicit and tiny actions and choices you aren't directly prompted to make will shape the way your story plays out. Sometimes it is unexpected, sometimes things happen that you did not plan, sometimes words come out wrong, sometimes you forget to check a detail, but it's real, it feels like being a part of something, a living world, not mindlessly playing out a pre-written, deterministic script.
I've never felt cheated out of or into a situation to achieve some ending for a scene designed to make the next one start the way the writers decided it should.

The game also looks INCREDIBLE, from the smallest details of clothes, panoramic views, and screenshot-worthy home interiors to character animations. Humans feel and act like humans, but Adroids act distinctly differently, methodically. They shift with the story, acquiring some subtle human behaviors, speech patterns, they become unique. You may say they Become Human ;)

Characterization is very well done. The way characters express themselves and mention their history feels natural and earned. They feel so fitting to the setting and events, evolving with them.

The degree to which your choice shapes the entire game cannot be understated and underappreciated. It's far from trivial to make so many events flow smoothly and coherently with a setting this long. It is truly an impressive achievement.",True,0,0,2025-02-02 22:41:51

Conclusion:  I played it the first time on the PS4 when it was release 2018. Loved to play it back then. After 7 years I thought I give it a second playthrough on the PC and it was worth it. I'm not sure if I made the same decisions as the first time but it was definitely worth the time again :) If you like Quantic Dreams or Telltale Games then you should play it. The graphics looks still very decent and the animations are also still good enough.",True,0,0,2025-01-30 20:44:39
"Jogo incrível, que nos deixa totalmente absortos! De tão boa, a história daria até para ser transformada em uma série da Netflix. Contando da minha experiência: sempre ao terminar uma cena, sentia aquela vontade de continuar, pensando no que aconteceria depois.

Jogando com seriedade, sentimos medo, pois a todo momento ficamos cientes de que nossas decisões podem mudar o rumo da história. Ademais, também nos sentimos arrependidos, quando percebemos que algo feito poderia ser feito de outra forma.

Algo bom, claro, é a possibilidade de retornarmos a algum ponto, para assim podermos tomar um rumo diferente, ou mais coerente com o que queremos, caso cometamos um erro durante a história. Claro, isso tira um pouco da imersão do game; mas ainda assim, é muito útil.

✅ Pontos Fortes:

✨ Gráficos/Sonoplastia: Os gráficos são ótimos! Joguei no médio, e ainda assim me senti surpreendido em diversas partes. A trilha sonora do jogo também não deixa a desejar. É impecável, e aumenta a imersão de forma considerável, fazendo até com que os pelos se arrepiem um pouco. 

🕹️ Jogabilidade: A jogabilidade é de um estilo particular. Senti-me um pouco incomodado por não poder correr em diversas partes do jogo, mas isso é apenas uma coisa minha. A mecânico de controles jogo é feita a partir do clique em botões (se estiver jogando num controle) ou em teclas (se estiver no teclado). Os cliques possuem tempo, e até diversidade no que escolher! Isso é um tipo estresse que realmente acertaram nesse jogo, deixando-o emocionante, na minha opinião.

📖 História/Personagens: A história é boa, e a alternância de histórias (três, pois há uma para cada personagem, apesar delas convergirem uma hora ou outra) faz com que o jogo não se torne enjoativo.

🔁 Rejogabilidade: Você passará horas jogando esse jogo, mesmo depois de terminar ele uma vez! Isso porque se torna interessante, e bate uma curiosidade, conferir outros finais alternativos.

❌ Pontos Fracos:

🐞 Bugs/Otimização: Achei estranho o fato de limitarem o FPS do jogo a duas possíveis opções: 30 FPS ou 60FPS (não sei se é por detectarem a capacidade potencial do meu setup, ou se é universal mesmo).

Nada mais a reclamar... Não sou tão exigente. O jogo é ótimo.",True,0,0,2025-01-30 20:27:33

"ends up turning into a mess after a few hours, tries to be interesting but almost has nothing to say, tries to argue about if machines can have consciousness but doesn't elaborate or expand any ideas at all.

perspective swaps between three different protagonists, all three of them are different levels of uninteresting, to tell a story that tries to do many things that it falls short of in many ways.

really the only way i see people actively liking this is the dynamic between connor and hank, which is really the thing that the director and team had the least to do with.

"I'd give this ""yes"" more than a single thumb up if I could. This is a [i]masterpiece[/i]. You'll fall in love with the main characters. You'll get pulled into their lives and you'll find yourself rooting for them. 

The game itself is an interactive story divided into ""chapters"" about three ""serving class"" androids in a futuristic Detroit that become self-aware. From there, you're deciding whether they try to rise up, learn to love, learn to hate, kill or save, and these decisions, often timed, have immense impact on the rest of the story. Generally, at least once per chapter, there's a major decision resolved by your reflexes (time sensitive, ""hit these buttons"" sequences), such as a fight. 

[b]Pros:[/b] 
- Beautifully rendered. The characters are generated from real-life actors, so facial expressions are realistic.
- Beautifully narrated. For the same reason.
- Roughly 85 meaningful endings, all based on your choices during the game.
- There's no ""game over"" decision. Everything you do makes for a unique story.
- The ability to ""replay"" a chapter. If you don't like how things went, or you want to experience the game in a new way, you can restart your game at any point in any chapter and have that become your new timeline. 
- Flowcharts. At the end of each chapter, you can see where your decisions branched off (the road not taken are hidden from you), and you can see how the rest of the gaming community chose. It's cool, and combined with the ""replay,"" you don't have to restart the game from Chapter 1 (though it's definitely an option) to see things turn out differently. 
- While not everyone may be a fan of the time-sensitive ""press this button"" action sequences, you can screw up a few times and still succeed. Or not. It all leads to a new story.
- The character who is on your opening screen. Play the game long enough, you'll see.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- I really can't think of one. This game is again a masterpiece. I managed to finish the main story in under 20 hours, with a couple chapter replays because I didn't like what ensued with a few of my decisions. I could easily vest a dozen more hours in trying to move a few chapters back, do things differently, and see how dramatically the endings can go and be.",True,0,0,2025-02-01 22:59:09

Somehow every negative character in the game is a white male and everyone you're supposed to be sympathetic toward is black, a white woman, a rainbow creature, or someone from an ""opressed"" group.
Yes you make a lot of the choices but like in most games of this type there are choices that don't matter, choices that are good and choices that are bad, and the game tries to make it abundantly clear which ones it considers good and which are bad.
Oh, and on top of that you got unskippable cutscenes, unskippable dialogues, dialogue options that don't match what is actually being said, frustrating QTEs, and no ability to replay from the last check point until you finish a chapter.
