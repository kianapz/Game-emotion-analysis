Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,its a game that wants to be a movie. it sucks.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,"i wouldn't say awful, but pretty bad for a god of war game. just a disconnected poorly paced mess of a game. same puzzles copy pasted over and over again with annoying npcs telling you what to do literally 10 seconds into them. terrible camera during combat, lock on issues. sound was mixed poorly compared to 2018. graphics for me were nothing special, but that's to be expected for a ps4 game. none of the new characters besides thor and odin did anything for me and god the atreus sections where you pick berries and roots for an hour were painful.. the pacing of the whole game was terrible. it had its moments but i couldn't wait for it to end."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,people are allowed wrong opinions i suppose.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,it's not the old god of war
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,"i couldn't agree more. i'm just trying to skip past the battles and get to the end. i'm at the point now where i just turned off the game, and i'm not sure if i'll go back and finish it. every corner, every corridor, another fight. coming from horizon and elden ring, where you explored, climbed mountains, uncovered secrets, leveled abilities etc. gow just seems so... dull. another hallway, another fight. it's a shame cause the story is really great and they nailed somethings. the worlds are beautiful, a shame we can't see more of them. the weapons are super cool, shame there aren't more ways to upgrade or new combos or... anything to make the combat less repetitive. i don't know how everyone really likes this game that much, im so bored and can't wait to finish it. i spent 100 cad on it, so i'll beat it... but yea, not even close to game of the year. horizon forbidden west takes that crown imo or elden ring."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,all in all a bad bait
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,"i think its wild that people are sooo obsessed with this game. its fine, its not great. i dont find any of the characters interesting besides thor and odin. and exploring is not fun. fuck that canoe."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-26,"this game is garbage. coming from souls games at least you had control of your character. you can barely dodge. your shield no matter which one you have deploys slowly and the only enemies you need to parry are mini bosses who are smaller than you and they only throw red hits. so parry aint there when you need it. the camera is garbage and seriously whoever thought programming the enemy camera unlock to unlock automatically because the enemies are able to go faster than the camera was a fking moron. so you got them locked and they can fly behind you and you cant turn fast enough or relock so they can just backstab your over n over as they stagger you by looking at you and you can barely stagger them. you have to hit them 200 times to die, they only have to hit you twice. i could go on forever. storyline too, garbage. i wish i would have read reviews about this pos before i wasted money on it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i cant say i agree, as true as some of your points may be the game when looked at through all aspects is good. the additions to the realms look great, the story really brings kratos journey full circle from the original gow, and the fact that they didnt drag this out over another game is great. so best game i ever played, probably not, but goty definitely."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,"it seems like a button bash fighting game to me with unskippable boring cut scenes. honestly, it's not close to games like rdr2, witcher 3, spiderman or uncharted. i don't get the hype at all."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,bruh... your opinion would be fine and subjectivity is ok but if you would make an effort to look objectively at the game and see all the effort and care put in the game you would probably realize that calling it total trash is absurd... like i don't fell enjoyed rdr 2 but i cant call the game absolute trash because thats objectivelly wrong
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-26,ya it was incredibly boring
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-27,"i hated it!!! it was such a slog and the characters were awful!! and all that stupid puzzle crap that slowed the game right down. and when is kratos going to admit his dead giant wife was a lying bih and that his son is a whiney little hit and just call it quits! if the little turd wants to go off and find his destiny, i say let him!!! let the little rat haired rodent go off and get smushed, so kratos can go find a new land where he can settle down in peace. the combat was so dull and repetitive, it was just a glorified coming of age tale for his idiot son. it was a giant waste of money, a boring, linear pile of overrated crap."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-07,gameplay  410 visuals  1010
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,turning off replies everyone its been fun. enjoying losing your shit defending a mid game!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,well your entitled to your opinion even when its wrong.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,git gud
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-19,"when you've played a game for 35 hours that seems like 100hours it's not a good sign, this game is disappointing on so many aspect, the story is good but the side quest, the open world and the rpg aspect who were not the best points of the previous game are way worse in this sequel. it really cost me to finish it and the fun was almost nowhere in this game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-12,"i finished elden ring, it was amazing, and i said to myself let's go see if ragnarok truly deserved to be in the goty debate. maan il played 2 hours and it was the 2 most boring hours of my life. world empty, the fights are pointless,what the hell happened to the design of odin ? thor was interesting but thats it, . x200b can someone explain to me how can someone call this a goty contender  ?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"bait your hook better, man."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i thought it was really good. did not agree with all decisions, character developments, characters or storybeats, but cannot deny that it was all done expertly."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-18,i'm watching my sister play. i grew up with the original trilogy with bloodthirsty kratos and compelling story. now im watching this stupid fucking atreus trying to skip rocks giggling with some angrboda or something. looks like something out of a poorly written tv series.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"lol, thanks for this. i needed a good chuckle this morning."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,omg youre so cool for not liking a popular and well made game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,careful you don't cut yourself on that edge.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,havent played so cant judge but from what i gathered from frienda they seem to like shame it didnt meet your expectations combat wise is it really that bad?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,story was ok i really wanted to see it but i couldn't because i got so bored of the game play. got to motivate myself to play it. game play is really boring sorry! yeah this game sucks. i hate the boring time wasting puzzles.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-11,"bro, ive been playing this game for a week most of the time its on pause because the game keeps putting me to sleep."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-06,way too much talking. i don't care about the story at all.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,lol.. back to cod then i guess.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,whats the last game you genuinely enjoyed?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"you're bitching about a game made for mass appeal, to the masses. be prepared for everyone to disagree with you. gl soldier"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,git gud
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i have found that if you up the difficulty to either the hardest or second hardest difficulty, it does make them more fun  it is significantly more difficult but it is also wayyyy more fun."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"its not awful in the slightest but its definitely not as omg fantastic amazing goty!!!!111 as its being made out to be. its a 7.5810 game at best. i found it to be way too long and downright boring in some parts. took me two full weeks to finish it because i kept falling asleep. half the characters are annoying af and the puzzles are a pain in the ass. the combat mechanics are mostly fun and the main story is okay, but thats about it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"the whole game was disappointing, or maybe i had very high expectations. pre order a game after 6 years, stupid plants exploding in your face every second  no i dont care enough to throw my axe at some plants, stupid puzzles, one or two is enough, but puzzles after puzzles, should have put that time in runes for weapon to make the combat more engaging. the new system of weapon awaking is bs since 90 you don't have the time to awaken them. spear is on down button if you press it while shielding, kratos does 180. thor story is bs, atreus doing stupid stuff half of the game. the big ragnarok was a dissapoitment, run in a straight line, and kill people, then odin jump from one place to another. why didn't kratos take the damn deal? the whole game he doesn't want to fight, but keeps putting his nose in odins business. either go full on or don't at all. the jokes between mimir, kratos and atrues made me finish the game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"on the contrary, doesn't seem awful at all.. however, if u are absolutely dogshit at gaming in general which sounds quite likely judging by ur qualms, i can understand why u could be simply incapable of experiencing anything beyond ur flaccid depth.."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-10,feel more like god of mid
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-30,i do.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-03,played it for an hour last night and all i can say is its ugly if they wouldve had the same layout for the entire pause screen id pretty much be fine with the rest of the changes but the pause screen is the wound and everything mentioned everywhere else is the salt getting shoved into it i was really excited and 70 later im pretty disappointed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-04,i had a blast with gowr. sad to see you didn't enjoyed it the same way i did. but its totally normal for different people to like and dislike different things. happy gaming my bro!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-20,lol more people in these comments seem to hate this game rather than love it how on earth it went anywhere near game of the year shows the standard of gaming at the moment ..........
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-03,"the game is a tedious chore. its boring and in some aspects stupid. the stuff where you collect fruit with whats her name is a joke. am i a farmer now? the puzzles are another slow the game to a grinding halt annoyance that just feels more like work than a yay i figured it out. oh and can we walk through another wall crack or crouching cave. i mean these are all over the place now. they replace load screens but dam, is it really replacing a load screen when they are all over the map. the combat is not fun. 18 was a blast and i 100 18. this game is just not fun at all with combat. the story sucks. the long drawn out narrative process while walking or boating drags the game along. i could go on, but im not even going to finish this game because its a grind and i have better ways to waste time. something told me to wait to buy it and i should have waited longer or for a sale. waste of 70 how in the world did this ever get considered for goty. such a disappointment oh and atreus is a whiney bitch"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-13,they should rename it to gow ragnacock
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i have not played it, but it sounds like my experience with the first game... so i have no reason to disbelieve you."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,the only thing that is complete trash is your ability to master the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,i understand what you mean. it does get tedious and the combat feels like a step down from its previous iterations. however the overall package comes with such attention to detail. nothing pulls me in quite the same.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,have you played a video game before?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,allies are useless in damn near every game i've ever played besides demon souls and dark souls lol pointless ass comment. give me a game with quest that was cool to you and i bet i can say those where boring. the world most def dose not feel empty lol. thats bs on a top tier level. the only thing i will give you is that the blockingparrying is hands down one of the worst i've played. that shit drives me insane. the combat while not absolutely terrible is just bad. specially on harder difficulties. its insane to me that the camera is so damn close to kratos. lots of cheap deaths in the game make me rage often. story is great though. still im mature enough to not say its absolute garbage lol you're just mad at the game to say something so stupid. i get it though. it can def make you that mad. im considering dropping the difficulty to offset the bad combat and not have to fight the same battle 15 times before i move on.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-16,i can't believe i just bought this game for 70
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-12,"its extremely polished and well made. did you play the first game? if you didnt like the first you wont like the second. its definitely not perfect gameplay wise but i mean cmon you sound like the guys that hated on elden ring. its just not your kind of game, im halfway through currently and its been awesome."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"i didn't like the story for the last of us 2 but didn't play either of the new god of war games, but, gameplay wise they look pretty good from what i've seen."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i think hes confusing being bad at the game with the game is bad
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"big fan of gow, played all the main games from 14, enjoyed the last game, but this game the worlds seems a bit empty, and new character designs seems amazon primeesque and looks cheap  with cringey dialogue. at this point santa monica should probably focus on making a movie instead. luckily kratos, freya, atreus carry the game. 810 at most."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-07,"the game didnt even feel like a fucking god of war game. badcringy writing, same combat bugs from the first game, kratos being a major pussy, even the graphics felt worse"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-07,veeeeery boring  agree
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,im slogging through it but what a grind. feels likea souless version of the last game. getting around the map is tedious and the fetch quest and generic puzzles are far too frequent.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-15,"i finally bought a playstation after some 15 years being solely on xbox. got the gow ragnarok ps5 from sony website bc i always wanted to see what was so great about the gow series. i stopped playing at the level where youre rescuing some giant dude from the mines. maybe its because im a late joiner, but i simply do not care about the characters and it moves along so slowly i cant stay with it. i might pick it up again after i finish some other games  ratchetclank ape escape and last of us are occupying most of my free time now those are some really fun ones"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-02,i found the story just barely fun enough to finish the story but then it got too boring
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-05,anyone else think mimir calls them brother and little brother wayy too often in this game? in the 2018 game he would call them that once in a while so it meant something. almost every other sentence in this game he says it. just sounds meaningless after a while
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-06,"the strange obsession with this game almost seems fabricated to me. like conspiracy level fabricated. not fun and the combat to me the most important part of this game not movie is so blocky and awkward. the sound design is really bad too, like im playing on a big ol 5.1 built surround and its tinny and flat still. i miss the old bangin snake broads and chopping up baddies."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-07,yeah tbh its kinda  im only trying to finish it cause i brought the bundle  all of the hype behind it.. but theres literally nothing special about it.. i also think the game blew its load by starting off with the thor fight.. that had me thinking this game was going to be non stop.. however 28 percent in its not its boring as hell for the most part.. the puzzles are annoying imo  the son is even more annoying..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,honestly the game would have been way more enjoyable if it had visible blood spray and feedback when hitting enemies. it was done so much better in 2018 and that was already mediocre in terms of feedback and blood. ragnarok feels like you're hitting everyone with a wet noodle. god of war 3 is a good example on how blood spray and feedback should feel like. dmc 5 and bloodborne is another good example. also the sound mixing was dog shit. the pacing and puzzles were god awful. riding that cow for what felt like 5 hours was enough for me to trade the game in after i forced myself to finish it. sony santa monica are overrated as hell and are a shadow of their former selves. sony has completely ruined gaming. it's not even a hot take. tell me i'm wrong? literally the only good game they have released in the last 10 years is bloodborne. because it focused on being an immersive game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"definitely a drag compared to the rest, starting to become a chore to play."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"it so desperately wants to be soulslike, but the dev slack at every turn and make ganks the solution to everything. the instarunic shields the bosses toss on is just the crowning achievement of fucking complete shite design. and before you start talking getgud, i have nohit king and gna on gmgow. but it was a shitshow of working around the ganks. sms couldn't hold from's jock. and yes, they'll make plenty of cash off this cowofgame, but don't kid yourself that this is actually good combat mechanics."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-16,fuck this pos game. total trash and after you beat it if you can even get yourself too there are no monsters. none. you may as well go to muspheleim and get fucked in the ass by the lame fuckin trials. again. fuck this pos game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-17,i really wanted to love this game but it wasn't anything besides a failed attempt at bridging an beat em up and rpg.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-25,awful awful game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-05,im enjoying it for the most part. its at a 710 for me at the moment. not as good as the first but enjoyable enough to see what happens. i like playing as atreius too. but i wish the allies wouldnt just tell you how to solve puzzles sometimes. its annoying af.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-12,the whole fucking game is just walking aimlessly throwing a fucking axe at shit trying to figure out what to do it fuckin sucks fuck this game im glad i didnt pay 70 for it i woulda been hot i got the bundle pack so this weak ass game came with the ps5  fuckin trash the graphics are good tho they should just make a movie instead of a game of walking around all fuckin day long stupid fucking idiots
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-15,game dragged on with some of its sections
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-16,im a huge god of war fan and i thought this game was complete dog shit. im tired of critics and gamers blindly sucking a game off and slapping it with a 10. how in the hell was this game a 10?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-17,"i think the whole god of war series sucks, because how badly misrepresented gods are and how indifferent the developers of the game are to the fact that the gods slaughtered in the game by a fictional character are actually worshipped by many in the old world"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-17,"totally agree. the game tells you eveything that you need to do from start to finish, no immersion whatsoever. combat is awful, attacks doesnt have any weight on it considering kratos is a big man. quest design is trash as well, go to this blabla and fight blablabla to obtain blablabla. man do i hate this game, 2018gow might not be trash but mediocre as hell too."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-20,i didn't like it i thought it was horrible! and and so was the last one.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-01,"shitty opinion you have there, this one was disapointing but gow 4 was one of the best, your just sad theres no more quick time event sex scenes for you to jerk off to"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-06,"this is just apart of our culture too just hate lol the enemy variety is way more then 2018 u litteraly fight the same 2 types of enemies mainly so u really didnt even play the game fr and second the story is amazing and has way more giants moments set pieces and over all just better quality and yes the combat may suck but too me it only sucks bc its the same moves i recently beat both 2018 and ragnorok back too back and honestly they feel completely different combat wise not the same rhythm but honestly cant change everyones opinion everyone today loves too hate not without reason crazy bc everyone says the same thing that the pacing sucks but i mean where is your proof how can you say the pacing sucks but what is good pacing? its all different events in the game happen sporadically bc its ragnorok the world in the game is litterally ending. crazy shit is supposed too happen and at random and i feel the pacing is good the start of the journey where everyone isnt sure what they wanna do if they wanna give in too prophecy or not and sooner then later they have no choice but too make their own decisions and take action without thinking exactly why the fates come in too explain that they are all playing too their fate just being themselfs, then releasing garm is litterally the cherry too start ragnorok, also like the hog riding part or whatever, yea it sucks but it also is important it all is important too prophecy if he doesnt go too iron wood and learn how secretive that all is then that doesnt make kratos and atreus bond start too break makes kratos question his son and drives him too asgard naturally, then that kicks off the whole search for a weapon and the norms which really starts too boil ragnorok"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-06,"totally agree, in my opinion this game is just a gimmick, a mandatory sequel aimed at mainstream audiences, all on it smells cheap design. it is clearly designed to be played in easy dificulty. the amount of bad thought systems you have to fight in order to not die is ridiculous. you can't get enjoyment out of it playing in higher dificulties, because it wasn't meant to be played this way. but they still give you the choice so you would think it is actually meant as an action game when its not. so the frustration is even higher. i literally got scammed with this game. just make a movie or an interactive graphic adventure or something if that is what you wan to do. why making an action game where any of the systems works well for an action game. its ridiculous. and then the plot and characters, in gow2018, ther was novelty so they were kinda ok. in ragnarok eveeything gets old pretty fast. its just a bad sequel, a bad action game, and a mediocre movie. shame, graphics look good tho..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-10,"this was the absolute worst gow game ive ever played. the game mechanics were shit , the story was mediocre at best, the berserker fights had you so fucked up with different dumbass builds that you have to have a goddamn aneurysm before you can beat the king for a combat game with this shitty of combat mechanics i definitely wont be buying nor playing any future gow games this game absolutely fucked off any chance of that"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-01,lol just becsuse its cinematic? gow 4 was cinematic and it was awesome
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"i could barely stand riding on that giant cow, holy shit that was annoying. ride slowly on it through the water get to a ledge to jump up to, break 2 pots, meet it on the other side then jump on it to ride slowly to the next one. yawn."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,i have no idea what you mean copy and paste puzzles. i disagree with the pacing. no problem there. i play on ps5 so graphics cool for me. why mention graphics on last gen? i know there not as bad as you're pretending lol. stop it. facts about the npc's telling you what to do in 10 seconds lol. atreus picking berries was painful. the characters are cool. story is good. the combat is the single bad thing in this game. and its pretty bad. like rage quit cheap deaths over and over bad
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-17,bro game was shit. deal with it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-25,people are allowed to have standards
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,"the gameplay of ragnarock was really sub par, i know other mediocre games with way better and more enjoyable combat and variety. but it's fine i guess if you don't care about combat or fights that much, you can pretend it's a movie where you have to click to open a door or pull a lever in a cutscene. well even if we treat it as a interactive movie, i for one, thought the story was painfully mediocre and only enjoyed a couple of scenes while the story was mediocre as hell. if you enjoy it like thousand of others praising this movie to be the best game ever, then good for you."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-11,both 2018 and this are halfassed at best.. they definitely don't hold a candle to the old games. they just aren't that good of games.. the story is interesting but the gameplay is bad.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-06,opinions are neither wrong or right you dummy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-31,"if its bad, howd gow 2018 win goty above spiderman and rdr2? gowr improves graphically and combat more than 2018"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-10,your right it must be better
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-27,beacause it's better then the old god of war.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"im always just almost at the point of putting it on easy so i can just get through the story. and i played through ds3, bloodborne, sekiro, elden ring and replayed gow 2018 basically in a row before starting ragnarak. all have far more satisfying combat. its just so frustrating in this game. they nerfed kratos, took away the key moves from last game, camera lock system sucks, and most enemies are obnoxious."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,"not a bait, the game is mediocre, if we can call it a game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-23,"kind of similar to how people are so obsessed with gears of war and halo. i hated those games. i mean, i've beaten both and found them to be very ordinary, yet there is a cult following of people willing to die exaggeration and defend their honor for said games. i just don't get it. i guess people like what they like."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-13,"yeah its really dumb sometimes with the combat system, you fight an enemy 1 or 2 levels above you and they take years to kill. and some of the mini bosses on gmgow difficulty feel so cheap because of how many hits the enemies take and how little damage you do, plus ive been hit at times from yellow attacks while using the stone wall shield that insta killed me when the shield wasnt even at full power."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"story, characters are great. gameplay not so much."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-15,"rdr2 is about as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle. it has its own share of boring cutscenes too. the open world, graphics, and storycharacters are the only good things about the game. everything else is a slog to play through. gameplay is still the same clunky shit that's been present since gtaiv. menu ui is awful. braindead ai and mindnumbingly boring combat too."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,"it felt like a ps2 game to me. not much care given into surrounding objects when you run towards them. it just feels blocky, and underdeveloped. way too much time on cut scenes."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-17,"i'm not sure how you can say that. i agree with the op. to me, the game is total trash. i think the disconnect between the ones that like it and the ones that hate it is the ones that hate it played the original 3 games. i didn't like the story at all, the combat was ok but worse than the last game somehow, and the characters were just plain awful. odin was sold as a monster in 2018, but turns out to be a used car salesman. the biggest sin is angrboda. this is norse mythology. like sweden, finland, etc, which are the whitest countries on earth. there is absolutely no reason angrboda should be black just for the sake of appeasing some exec at santa monica. at the end of the day, it's just not god of war. we tolerated 2018 because it was so different, and kratos had only changed so much. now he's a cuck."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,look up the word subjective.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,"ah yes, what a great defense for a game with mediocre combat and mechanics. git gud."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"just waiting for it to end at this point.. literally thought id put around 30 hours into it, checked my playtime and ive only clocked 7"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"not fishing, genuinely think its terrible. that being said i love the story, its a shame its hidden behind terrible gameplay"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,ok spartan.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,whos trying to be cool? grow up
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,cuz the truth does hurt
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"yeah i really hated it man, every single fight there is creatures shooting you from distance with poison, or little ones that seemingly spawn endlessly. the lock on function is terrible and comes off constantly, parrying enemies doesnt make a difference as they just attack again immediately. picking up health just gets you hit and rage mode is pointless."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i enjoy most games i play. recently the evil within, the medium, phantom pain, guardians of the galaxy. i also enjoyed 2018 gow as well as every other in the series."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i know, people acting like ive personally offended them over my dislike of a computer game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-28,thats the problem. game has no skill based mechanics to get good at so it ended up a boring mess
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"that's funny, i thought the opposite. on the higher difficulties the enemies are such ridiculous damage sponges that it made the combat really tedious. every fight was this drawn out chipping away at a health bar. once i dropped the difficulty down to the second lowest i moved through enemies quicker and it felt like i was actually swinging weapons instead of wet noodles."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,"this, its a gorgeous world and story, but as a game its a 6  8 at best."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,kratos does not make deals with gods

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"spear is on down button if you press it while shielding, kratos does 180. or you could go into the options menu and easily change the quick turn button. i set it to pressing down l3 because i don't have to take my thumb off the movement stick to do the quick turn."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,came here to say this. op describes my feelings with the first game of 2018.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,oooooh good one. i have finished the game for what its worth. why are you so upset someone doesnt like a game?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"the very post youre replying to suggests so what do you think, stupid?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-28,i loved 2018 god of war. ragnarok is worse. game is slowed down by annoying and frequent puzzles. the game is a chore to get through
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-21,the game is piss easy theres nothing to be bad at.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-03,totally agree with you and some points of op. i am huge gow fan but after 12 hours i have to force myself to play it. sometimes im so bored with this game. do you have recommendation for some game that you enjoyed recently?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-28,"ragnarok sucks but sony ruined gaming? relax champ. any uncharted, last of us, spider man, ghost of tsushima, god of war 2018 are masterpieces"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-21,the search for tyr chapter was quite lame imo. you just move water wheels and kill the same freaking poison frog things. i hope it gets better

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-04,im getting gray hairs playing this mission cuz its aggravating me so much.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-08,you seem like a bot account looking at your profile. everything he said is valid. why the fuck did you buy a game to enjoy it as a movie???
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-20,wow struck a nerve with the fanboy i'd say! much of a god of war fanboy are we?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-27,deal with the fact that the game is great.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-10,"damn, small world lol. i recognize you from the warriors sub. but yea this game has been serious step back from a narrative aspects so far. feels like some b tier marvel movie."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-26,yea but the story was complete trash too.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,"i really miss the combat in gow2018 that had more slow motion, heavier basic attacks, larger and better animations, more particles, better runics, etc. only thing that was improved in this game was kratos's speed and mobility but it did not have to come at the cost of heaviness."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-17,sifu found a better balance than this gow bloated mess.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,to each their own but after playing it for hours and finding myself relentlessly bored to tears i have to assume the reviewers were probably just too distracted by its admittedly impressive polish to realize they weren't actually having any fun.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-10,"i just finished it last night and booted up the original on ps2 for comparison. both are fantastic but they are very different games. ragnarok is beautiful and emotional and i cried a lot. but it wasn't fun, it was more a chore to play and it was very paint by numbers. the original is button mash fun."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-28,"wow that is such a hot take, nobody has ever felt that way. crazy that somebody would like a game that won a bunch of awards. luckily i have your opinion which is far more important than mine. tell me how i feel about other things."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-25,god the enemy variety sucks and turning it on east doesnt make them less tanky. i seriously hope they reevaluate combats being so frequent in the next game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,"oh man, yea just put it on easy. the story is worth finishing the game, but the combat is so tedious. but i dont think ill be grabbing the next entry unless its on a deep deep deep sale."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-03,story was shit as well tbh
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-09,watch gbg
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-15,"youre not wrong. rdr2 is one of my favorite games but the gunplay is horridly boring and although the lightingeffects are great, the textures are pretty bad. rockstar games have always had bad controls. rdr2 does not change this lol. the inputs are so laggy or just outright unresponsive. anyone who disagrees didnt platinum the game lmao."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-24,i can tell you hurt
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-13,yeah the ui is so slow and trash
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,"fair criticism my friend, it's not everyone cup of tea and certainly not  total trash"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"cant wait to see a white person cast in african mythology. oh wait, it only works one way because diversity. its so out of place. they even gave her dreadlocks lol. not to mention the entire mission was like 2 hours long. it makes the game a 610 for me simply because of this section. i dont care about atreus or angrboda."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"it's not subjective when 90 of your points are just you being dogshit at the game. you're experiencing the game like a moron, of course you hate it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-09,skill issue tbh
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,mad cuz bad???
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"in all seriousness, i do disagree with your post, as do the majority of gamers and critics, but not everyone will enjoy every game and thats a fact. so its okay if you dislike the game. i for one dont enjoy fortnite despite its mass player base and i cant just get into the rts genre at all. so to each their own."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"right, based off this post and these comments, im definitely the one who needs to grow up and stop looking for attention from strangers online."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,yeah you just parry again. picking up health staggers enemies. please explain how rage is pointless
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,i find it funny that one reason you don't like ragnarok is because the enemies are copy and pasted when that is what happened in gow 4
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,lol imagine how hard the valkyries are at the highest difficulty.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-08,6.4 but if i'm being generous then 7.1

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i get that, then why put your finger in odins nose, my point is,it could have been handled better. take the deal, odin breaks the deal, we have a reason to kill him. if you look at it from outside perspective, odin did nothing wrong, he was an ahole sure, but he didn't do anything until heimdall was dead, speaking of which it was all because mr atrues decided to visit odin, had he taken him by force i understand but nope, i am going to asgard then gets brok killed, after he gets brok killed he decides to walk away like bro?, then we have to kill odin because he killed brok, which was our fault since we were searching for tyr and he clearly told us, he is keeping an eye on us, they know we searching for tyr, even after odin was tyr most of the game he said let's not fight we could have found a better reason to fight odin, just not like that. odin didn't even feel like a villan, just an old manipulative man, the end fight wasn't statisfy ing, why exactly did we do ragnarok? who knows he killed thor, we should feel bad? thor was a bigger ahole, sif talking thor into killing atreus, then suddenly she is the good guy, jormongandar sent back in time, a clash so strong, happens in the back round, give me a break"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-08,im not a bot account you clown. so nothing i said was valid? lol so everything he said was without a doubt undebatable across the board? dumb ass. i played and beat the game. i disagree with him on most of his complaints. i even said the shit that i agree with him on. youre just a complete fucking idiot that cant read.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-21,its trash. the game holds your hands from start to finish its insulting. the game could tell you to go to this street address and suck the devs dicc and you people would do it. you guys better be happy that fromsoft doesnt pump games yearly because if they do theyd be swimming in a pool full of goty trophies.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-10,"oh whats up man! i agree with your take, dont care for the writing or the plot. didnt even finish it got bored lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-13,"lmao odin throws a temper tantrum and kills brok because he gets tired of listening to him . the guy is supposed to be a master manipulator but the gets upset like a little bitch over something like that, and then on top of that he doesnt even get the goddamn mask."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"yes! sorry, i know this is late, but im id guess around halfway through. the combat is super frustrating and disappointing, especially compared to 2018. i replayed 2018 right before starting ragnorak so its fresh for me. they super nerfed kratos. i know games need to have challenge, but he has a glass jaw here. they took away the core moves from the first game, your damage is super nerfed. runic attacks are nerfed. kratos feels weak and fragile. camera lock is incredibly frustrating. enemies are obnoxious. so many creepy little crawly things you cant hit, ranged enemies offscreen spamming poison. you cant have satisfying solo combat with heavy enemies because they all have nuisance guys with them griefing you. i just really dont know what they were thinking. i cant believe im doing this after playing through most of the from software games and god of war 2018 pretty much consecutively, but i am half considering turning the difficulty down to easiest just to blow through the story and be done."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-09,even the health jar animation is lazy. the last game had the green glow surround kratos looked awesome. now its just a little flash. very disappointed in this game relative to it's predecessors. just feels flat.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-13,"the runics in 2018 were op and made the game cheap and easy, why would you want that back?"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-25,"well, i just finished the main story the other night. ill say finally in the middle of the third act, things felt reasonably balanced. damage taken and received felt more how they should be. its a shame it happened so late. theres also an optional late game area thats huge and a lot of fun. again, too little too late, but i enjoyed it. even so, im probably not going to do the poststory stuff due to how tedious the gameplay has been. im just glad to be done. im glad people are enjoying it, but i just dont understand the praise."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,dude im doing the angrboda mission now and i simply dont care anymore. stop forcing me to play as this angsty teenage weed of a kid. give me kratos and stop weaving woke moral relativism junk into a god of war game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-09,whats that
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,yeah rdr2 gameplay is horribly outdated. everything else about the game is elite though
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,"ah, the braindead her of sheep defending this mediocre game, i love it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"lol garbage take. and i played the god of war 2018 right before starting this one. it was better in almost every single way other than graphics. the combat in ragnarok is incredibly frustrating and disappointing, compared to 2018. im also spoiled having played through sekiro and elden ring recently too. if you liking the game, great, but i find it heavily subpar compared to even the previous entry"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"funny since my problem with the gameplay is that it's way too stale, boring and uninteresting and it has nothing to do with skill issue since i barely died on the highest difficulty. the combat is inferior to the old god of war games"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-15,"i felt the same way about the combat my fist time around. its just.. harder in ragnarok. my second playthrough im finding out how to read enemies and counter their attacks. i can understand how people dont like that, though."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-20,"how can you have all those complaints and still say but the game is good? i think it isn't good, i think the game blows...just my humble opinion! a combat game with horrible combat mechanics is a bad game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-04,hop off
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-21,"its far from a great game. call me fragile but i hate people who glorifies games like gow, its essentialy forbidden west with a different protagonist and different title. i was really excited for gow2018 since they wanted to make another thelastofus. but no, its your typical western ubisoft game.tlou has too much cutscenes and drama but atleast they teach only you the most basic things and throws you on a hopeless world, its fucking beautiful. in gow2018 and ltrashnarok , i cant stand those cutscenes that are way too important to skip, a slow ass combat where your attacks doesnt feel like they have any weight on it, ui that tells me everything that i need to do and fuck that canoe."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-21,"just calm down, i get it you hate gow ragnarok 2018 and ragnarok. then don't play it and let people that do want to play it just do that. it's a great game, but certainly not for everyone. and it doesn't need to be."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-06,"god of war 2018 sucks too but it was much more polished, so kinda gulable. ragnarok is complete mess. is made for people who doesnt regularly play, and with easy dificulty in mind. its adesign problem and it sucks big balls."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-21,i wish you people could see how dumb and insulting those kind of games are.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-21,"so what, what does it matter to you what games other people play. if you hate it so much just don't plsy it and that's all. is it really so hard to just not care about what others play."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-21,"you could play whatever the hell you want, its you people glorifying trash games like these that grinds my gears,oh but its a great game tho, hell no its not. its the same idea of glorifying trash celebrities is it not? they keep pumping trash because of you people who enjoy it. fuck, i wish miyazaki could create masterpieces every year so every western games and those who uses their formula could burn to the ground. maybe only then they could learn. also no fucking wonder fromsoft won 2 goty with their 2 recent games since they are the only one who doesnt use that trash gow or any western game design."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-21,"btw, i don't know if you've noticed but i completely agree with you on fromsoft and miyazaki. most games coming from the west are trash. however gow is still at the very least good, not necessarily great in my opinion."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-21,"but it fucking is a great game, just like you don't get why some think it's a great game. i seriously don't understand how you think it's so horrible. sure i can understand people not liking it but thinking it's horrible? also, fromsoft is my favourite developer, so i would absolutely love it if miyaziki makes more games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-24,"glorifying trash games ultimately leads to more trash games, which is why games are so trashy these days, and until the trashman comes, we're stuck with 'em and it really really really fucking sucks."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"there are a lot of thrashy games these days, i completely agree. but i still don't think gow 2018 and gow ragnarok are thrash."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"at this point, dont be surprise. any games published and developed by sony playstation studios will require a psn account. they are saying this upfront so to avoid another helldivers 2 fiasco."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"stupid thing is, this means people in blocked countries still can't buy it. easy sales just lost because sony wants to take the easy way out. edit y'all can downvote all you want. i'm one of the affected and i will voice this as much as i can because their decision fucks me over. before the whole helldivers mess i had no issue buying and all of a sudden my country is blocked. this shouldn't be something we just stay quiet about because it doesn't affect some of you. because of this, i will never be allowed to purchase any titles from sony on steam."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i want to play this on my steam deck, and usually, games it require third particles do not installer play well on the back. it looks like i'm going to have to pirate it to play it on the device i want to, which feels stupid."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,sony preparing for their own storefront
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,dont buy it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"well, not playing gow then."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,imma pull out the p word
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"no it wont, and it will be free"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,no it doesn't. not if you don't buy the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,xbox has been doing this for years and it sucks.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,how. the first one fucking didnt.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,booooooo
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"sony gives up more and more reasons to buy their consoles, but still pulls this shit."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yarr harr fiddle dee dee being a pirate is alright with me!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,did they ever learn from the helldivers 2 incident?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,no shit
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,ive never owned a playstation so this makes no sense to me. is it at least a free account you just create with sony?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"sorry, why is there drama for this?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"well i did play it on ps4 previously so i do have a psn account. and it was a digital version so since i am required to use my psn account which has a digital copy, i shouldn't have to buy it again right? right?!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why the fuck is this needed? this isn't a multiplayer game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,not if i pirate it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it will never not be funny that people will happily sign up for half a dozen developers and even download their own launchers, but sign up for a playstation account? nahh, thats a step too far lmao the arguments about information leaking ring extremely hollow when youre making those arguments online because virtually every online platform has leaked our information in some way or another, and gaming companies are no exception"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,they can fuck off then.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yo ho
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,so this will be a repeat of the helldivers 2 business where folks can't buy the game in countries where no psn exist?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i guess sony figured out what's best for pc players.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the psn isn't the issue, it's the implementing in a game that has already been up and running. sensationalize this though please. love being angry"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i think the big problem here is that even on a pc environment, countries where people would like to play it can't because psn isn't allowed there. i could very much be wrong, but i don't think microsoft or many others have that issue, so their accounts while annoying don't hold anyone back from enjoying the games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,whelp one more game i ain't getting then.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,of course it does.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"just remember, they walked back this requirement for helldivers 2, but still upheld its region restrictions from anywhere that you can't get a psn account. don't reward dishonesty."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"for people that say you can just pick another region to make your psn account. yes, you can and i just made one before this comment to check but that's not the problem. the problem is the game won't be even available for you on steam to buy and link that account you made. this is the case for ghost of tsushima and i imagine it will be the same for this as well. you can't use a vpn either because that's against steam tos and you probably will get banned. a quick search showed me that both using game keys and gifting the game to someone in a blocked region don't work. there may be another way i don't know of but for me at least, it looks like there no way to get got on steam. it is also not available on epic games for the blocked regions. so, there is no reliable way to get got on pc if you happen to live in one the blocked regions and god of war ragnarok will probably follow suit. well, unless you sail the high seas."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,cause of all that multiplayer you play in god of war
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"oh man that is so disappointing, i was looking forward to playing ragnarok. i 100'd the first game on steam. but they can't convince me to sign up for a psn account, so i guess i can't play it. shrug"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,not this shit again
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,to bad psn and sony blow ass never again lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the entire pc gaming communityhttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vsvxj016xb4q
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"dont worry guys, the steam unlocked version sure as fuck wont"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,high sea. i am not making psn account for a pc game. what a dingdong.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yo ho its a pirates life for me
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i guess i'll have to pirate this game. psn is not available in my country and steam does not list games that require psn accounts in my region. thanks sony for making me save money!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,not mine. mine does not need anything. thx fitgirl repack
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"at least they can get the pa exclusive its been so long and so many pc players have wanted so many of these exclusives, they definitely took this opportunity to pump up the psn numbers lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i have the patience to wait. i wait for the game to go on sale. then i still wait for the game to go on sale till about the fifth time. then i purchase said game and it sits in my library until i finish my 1000th run of new vegas.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it definitely wont on pc if you catch my drift
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,here comes the crying babies again.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"numby go up. personally, it doesn't bother me as i already have a psn account because i played gow on my mates playstation. i do get it though, absolute dogshit corpo bollocks and it's a horrible way to treat customers. honestly thinking of sailing the seas for this title, if that can get around the account linking shit or whatever it is. which is a shame as i've loved every ps title brought over to pc and i don't honestly mind giving them 4050 for 150 hours of entertainment each."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"no idea why people are complaining every other game company has been doing this for years. its to stop piracy, doesn't actually stop piracy tho but its the thought that counts"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"off topic, but you pconly gamers that can play this are in for a treat if you liked the first game. i had such an epic journey"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"because some people are having a really difficult time comprehending why folks are annoyed, i'll try to break it down. you should know up front, however, that there are multiple concerns, and it isn't any single thing. firstly, and this is the same with any and all other platforms, it's completely unnecessary and annoying to have to make an account to play a singleplayer offline title. people have complained about this when ea does it, when ubisoft does it, when microsoft does it, and yes, even steam back in the day. sony is no different. where the sony specific issues come in is twofold firstly, psn is not supported in something like 180 countries, meaning you cannot make an account without circumventing the system by using a vpn. this is not acceptable because it means you are at risk of losing all your titles purchased on that account should sony ever find out. secondly, sony has a history of suffering from large scale data theft. there are countless examples. the combination of that and them forcing you to make an account for something that has no arguable reason for it is a ridiculous combination. i'm not here to argue with anyone, i am pointing out why people are understandably pissed off. you yourself might not have an issue, but don't suggest that other people are stupid for having concerns and grievances."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it is peak decision to require psn account on pc games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i already have a psn account.. that i cant access because my 2fa phone was stolen.. and they refuse to resolve the issue after 2 years..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yo ho yo ho
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"genuine question what's stopping sony from retroactively adding a mandatory psn requirement for their older pc titles like god of war, spidermen, and uncharted 4? i live in a country that doesn't have psn  would this requirement lock me out of games i've already paid for and have spent countless hours in?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,psn lets earn less money because of a service that is half assed to begin with
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,fuck sony. thank you for listening to my ted talk
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,so never buy a sony game on pc? noted.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,1 sale
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it won't when i pirate it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,a game that requires more than just my money can fuck off
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"no problem, i can just pirate"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"damn that sucks. i had a feeling sony was moving towards this. never made a psn account, and i don't intend to. i bought and played tlou and the horizon games. both are awesome and recommended. i own horizon zero dawn and gow 1 on gog. being able to play them without an internet connection is why i buy games on gogs platform before steam. i hope that i can continue to play newer titles with no internet connection."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,huh. almost like the game was made by a playstation studio
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"whats the difference between this and needing a secondary account for the rockstar launcher, epic, ea etc?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,not if you sail the high seas
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"its kind of annoying how you have to make an account to play games for absolutely no reason. you used to be able to just put in a cd and play a game. now every single game has to have an account and has to have its own launcher, and every single tv show has to have its own version of netflix."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i'm sure that won't backfire and just encourage the piracy they claim to be so afraid of. s
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the outrage of this is as stupid as telling a console gamer that he need a steam account to play games from steam on pc
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it's a shit requirement that blocks availability in 122 countries ghost of tsushima is blocked in japan like, wtf?, and will only cause people to pirate. and honestly? i don't blame them. sony is releasing years old games, at full price and then blocking the sale in 100 countries. and i have a psn account. i own god of war. but why tf would i buy the oc version, if i have to sign in to psn, just to earn trophies thst i already own? like, no cross progression?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i don't understand the purpose of it. like, what are they getting out of it?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,shocker. sony being fucking stupid
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,good cant wait to sail the seas and save money
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the fact i'm seeing people blaming helldivers players for sony blocking sales in regions without psn support is nauseating. sony are the ones restricting the sales, they're the ones making vpns and setting your region falsely a ban offense. they're the one deciding to force psn accounts into single player games. i get that some people have contrarian compulsions but holy shit. reexamine what and who you're defending, god damn."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i'll buy it if this change gets reversed. i'm not overly interested in the game so i'll happily skip if they're going to enforce these scummy practices.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"good thing, just like the other got, the pirated version won't."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i have a psn account anyway but i still hate this. i don't play helldivers yet but i'm glad the response went down the way it did, but not surprised they're pushing it even more, unfortunately. the spiderman games add a couple of ingame things if you link an account but it was very much optional. i despise the push to make it mandatory, and i can't help worry that sony being as tone deaf as they are would down the line try to make people subscribe to ps to use multiplayer on their pc ports. even worse when it's a single player game. still hate ea's behaviour as well, forcing their own launcher on everything. the post i saw recently of a game that doesn't require the launcher gives me a glimmer of hope but i'm not expecting anything."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,sony really didn't learn from the helldivers community
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,guess i'm not playing.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,aaa games are trash now. easy pass.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,pass.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,skip it is then.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,good thing i wont buy it lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,having an account require for a single player game is shitty no matter who does it. only type of games that should require some kinda account is live service ones.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,this is another one of those reddit things where no one actually cares but people here make this seem like an issue thats going to cause the world to blow up
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"darn, i was looking at getting that game eventually. oh well..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ah, cool. thanks for making my decision to not get this game, sony!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,not if i pirate it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i'm gonna give birth to a gaming industry exec aka i need to shit
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why are there so many hoops just to enjoy a game smh edit. spelling
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,im personally not upset or bothered by this. but it is weird that they require it for a completely single player game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,another reason to not buy the game. gg
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,piracy is a must nowadays
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you know what dont need a psn account.. pirated games.. so we are back to good old times, where pirated version are better then the released version.."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"didn't sony said, that psn will only be required for games with online features?  noooo they couldn't lie! could they?..."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it took me 1 minute to make a psn account you guys are crybabies
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i just wish trophies would pop if i want to play the same game on pc from console. i wasted time and bandwidth today installing ac valhalla to my rog ally only to find out after linking ubisoft connect that cross progression works but no trophies will pop after saving and firing up the ps5.. now gow is a different story because i enjoyed going through them. also get steam achievements by re playing! ac valhalla too damn long. i'm not even done with the main story and i'm 150hrs in! bought it release day on ps4 then upgraded cause i wanted to play on ps5 and it was optimized. didn't want to try to finish on ps4 even though trophiesmost pop. it's just a shame and also my fault cause i really don't need to buy multiple copies of the same game on different devices.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,no it doesnt?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i don't know why they don't have an international account, game getting blocked on 171 countries on steam is fucking crazy."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,has anyone identified why psn accounts are locked out of certain countries? ip blocklisting?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,well there goes my plan to waste money on buying it on pc even though i have it on my ps5

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,shrug as long as they're transparent about it. and don't sell the game in that state in countries that aren't allowed to make psn accounts. i'll prob buy it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"while i hope it doesnt happen, it would be some irony if ppl who say its who cares, everyone has a launcher leads to sony having a psn store for pc and then they get hacked again and the accounts with credit card and other sensitive info potentially get fucked. like yes everyone has launchers but ea, ubisoft, and a few more are dogshit or very archaic. and the mentality that everyone is doing it is how various shit from price hikes to bullying and other crimeshappens but eh."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"didn't care during the 2 or 3 years it's not on pc, when it becomes available i'm not going to suddenly care, i can just carry on because the fucks i give about a game are not greater than my spite for a corp and the sore lack of fucks i have to give in the first place"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,dont get what is the issue with creating an account ? to play recent cod you need to have an activision account. to play gta you need to have a rockstar games account. its me or people here just like to complain for everything ? just wondering

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,how is this is any different from any ubisoft game or any game that requires a launcher or secondary log in. like this is nothing new at all
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,didn't people say this about ghost of tsushima as well? i don't need a psn to play it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it sucks, but at least we even get it on pc"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"its just a straight up lie. people said the same thing about ghost of tsushima and you do not need a psn account for that, i dont have one and im still able to play the game. just any reason to try and bash sony"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,is that needed even if you buy the game from gog? i thought gog games were drm free?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ok, and?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why would you pay for a single player game anyway?  most of my pc gamers friends.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the problem with helldivers was that it released without the requirement but changed afterwards. ea, bethesda, larian and ubisoft do the same with their games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,what's next? will they force us to use dualshock in our pcs?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,consider every other game requires an ea accout or an ubisoft connect or some other bs who cares.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i'm sure i'm gonna be playing it in about 4 months without a psn account.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"personally this doesn't effect me since i'm in a supported country, however i do question why a singleplayer game needs a psn account? i mean, i get metrics and shit like that, but should be optional for singleplayer only games. i can accept multiplayer games needing an account if it is related to some online service that is required to play or use crossplay features, but hd2 proved we didn't need psn accounts to play online nor play with psn folks, so it shouldn't be required. overall sony needs to get out of the dark ages and support these countries."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,in my country it's free and it doesn't require any accounts...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ofcourse they would require psn account on their games. they are trying to make customers comfortable with playing their games with psn integration. so later they can introduce subscription to pc gaming with their account. i am sure they are working on getting psn available in countries that currently don't. the thing with helldivers was one time step back just to avoid escalation of negative image of psn account, just because lot of people had already bought it in countries that don't have psn service"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why? they argued with ghost of tsushimas online mode. ragnarok doesn't have one?

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"holy shit man, what is even the point of selling this game on pc if a bunch of countries where psn is impossible, aren't even able to play it? this is just another reason why piracy exists."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,this game has no mp wtf?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ea, ubisoft, every single of this required u to have their account, nothing different, people are mad cause its a console account."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i can see this is going to be how ps operate on pc thats a bummer, so many regions locked out of playing great games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"does this whole forced psn account thing remind you of that story arc from the office where ryan becomes a manager and shills a new website, then when it starts failing has the branches input sales they make into the website to make it look successful"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"rip bosnians, pirating it is"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yo ho yo ho a pirates life for me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i'm sure the cracked version won't
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ffs, it's getting worse!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"helldiver's community got that too, fought back, and won. it's up to you !"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"well, i was gonna get it. does it even have multiplayer stuff in the game?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,sorry but i dont really understand the problem? surely this is understandable seeing as sony is the publisher of the game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,that sounds reasonable to me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,ghost of tsushima only requires one for online multiplayer yes but valve has completely removed the action roleplaying game from the steam shops of all countries in which the playstation network is not available. so not exactly a win there is it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"heh, not mine, yarr"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,two words blood. borne.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"who.cares? aside from most of the people already butthurt, who cares?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,commence the online flipping of tables.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yarrr.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"this is the first step, in the future they will make you buy a ps just like with spiderman 2"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"hey games are comming to pc, their vr honestly the only vr i read the specs for and though, hmm might buy that if it comes to pc is comming to pc. i have very little problem with using my for spam purposes mail and register at yet another digital store i will not use. i cant really imagine how am i not a financial burden for all these mandatory nonsteam accounts, since not once have i bought anything on any of the 3d party official stores, but they do have to pay the upkeep for me to use it. i will reevaulate, when a single player game i purchased becomes inaccessible due to this, but so far, that has not happened to me as far as i know."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"just like ghost, time to sail the high seas with this one."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,ive been waiting 84 years for this game to be available on pc
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,love how they want to sacrifice money from different countries for statistics
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,does the prated version requires psn account?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the only issue i had with this was the fact they sold hd2 in places you cant register a psn account. if publishers don't do something stupid like that, then i don't really care. i would prefer not do have to login to another fucking account to play their single player game but i've been doing it with ea and ubisoft for 10 years so what's one more if it means i don't need to buy a ps5"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,second sony single player game that i want but can't buy because of this bullshit. i guess they don't need my money? guess i'll spend it elsewhere then?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,hackers are salivating to sell the data from the people who will inevitably get their info leaked because sony has dogshit security.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i play their game if i have no other choice and i feed them bs data.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,if you install mods do you still have to put in a psn
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why????
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,ah okai. i was looking forward to play it on steam. such sad news to hear that they don't intend to launch it there
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i mean i get why they would do that though. its an exclusive. still shitty though!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,shockiiiing
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,clown world lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,torrent it is then... since this probably won't be available in my region.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,idk why pc losers cry bout this shit on console its just as bad u have to make act for rockstar ea activision blizzard u never hear console players cry bout this shit grow up
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i'm gonna say sony has crunched the numbers and are fine with losing sales based on this decision. the game has already sold over 15 million copies, anything more is gravy to them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,will it require one on the high seas?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,does this mean no offline play?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,is it impossible to crack the game?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"... lawl, who at sony presented this to management and convinced them it was a great idea?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"makes sense seeing as sony is pushing their overlay and trophy integration, sucks for those that can't buy the game..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,so make an account
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why are people surprised? more so why is this even newsworthy? sony wants you in their ecosystem if you're going to play their games. don't like it? don't play their games. they are very adamant about it so what will bitching accomplish?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why is anyone surprised at all
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i don't get it. i mean it could require a ps5 to play.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"waited all these years to play it, guess i'm just gonna watch everything on youtube then finally. avoided watching that for spoilers but since i won't be playing it i will just watch it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the problem here is, that for the rest of the world that psn is not available we are left without any new games due to steamepic games not making it available as a result of the psn availability."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man?!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,well i dont live in a third world country so this makes no difference to me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"other than the initial frustration of trying to figure out my psn login that i haven't used for 10 years, i 100 don't care. sadly everything requires multiple launchers, 2k, ubi, blizzard etc all want their own login bullshit too. i'm not saying it's ok, just that it's not going to stop me from playing it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"cool another game i won't bother playing then. it's fine, the hundreds of other games on my steam library are rejoicing at the chance they may have now!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,if it happened again i would burn all desire to play their games. it happened. plus they just came out saying they won't pc port the next sequel because they want users to buy a playstation.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"come back to me once you do this for every ea, ubisoft, activision, xbox, etc. this is concern trolling, and the people here going welp i'm not buying it aren't nearly as edgy as they think they're being."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ok, so?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"creating multiple accounts is a little inconvenient. but, correct me if i am wrong, i don't see many major economies which are unsupported most of them left out are kind of third world countries which probably consist of hardly 5 of global population among them what percentage of people play high end games that remains a question. i don't think sony is losing out on anything."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,friendly reminder that i was forced to make a stream account to play portal 2 multiplayer online back in the day for playstation 3. that is why my steam account has been psnmyaccountname for basically a decade. tons of games and products make you go around their hoops.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,just nnooooooooo. pc does not want or need psn.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i don't understand the shock... it's the same for xbox exclusives that have moved to playstation, you need a microsoft gaming account. it really ain't that deep."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,common console slop.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"that's funny, fitgirl doesn't require a psn"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i have one, haha!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,this is most likely their long term plan. they see pc gaming getting more popular and they want to sell to them but they also want their 30 cut so this is to ease people in. first its psn account then itll be a launcher then theyll stop selling on steam and only through sony launcher
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i think some democracy needs to be introduced.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,nah sony needs a wake up call. im a lifetime ps buyer and this is bullshit.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,would this mean that if i get a ps5 i would have it there as well?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,needing to create a psn account to play an exclusively single player game on steam.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,cool. i won't be playing it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,umm...duhh?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,so...sony just forgot how deeply hated games for windows live was did they?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,wasn't as good as god of war imo
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i am still a little pissed i cant look up on steam which companies are linked to my steam account, in my account settings."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the big question is can i continue with my ps5 savegame?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,dont play it then
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,boooo
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yes, and? palworld from steam still also requires an ea account. not saying it's okay, because it's not.. but it sure has become sop."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,scummy published that forces this crap will mean many people pirating their games solely for that reason.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,mad how sony want you to login for their services to play their games
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,this is going to be their way forward so that they can attempt to brag about player count and the amount of psn service users. dont expect it to change.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"damn this is how i find out gow ragnarok is getting a pc port, i'm so happy though idk if i'd be able to play it on my 1060 though"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,piracy is almost always a service problem
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,ahaha huhh........ fuck sake
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,no it doesnt
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,bound to happen
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"oh no. another company requiring a specific account to play their game. just like red dead 2 made me create a rockstar account and use their launcher. if yall actually worried about your data, being on anything that connects to the internet is where you went wrong."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,wont play then
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"helldivers lesson was not learned, nobody would buy this product except few crapeaters"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,id suggest you vote with your wallet. avoid the game and spend money on something else instead.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,i miss preps4 sony
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"and the api for it doesn't work on linux at all, so i guess it's the high seas for me if i want to play the game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,not if we kick and scream loud enough
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-02,"psn account is not the real issue as many people didn't understand, the region locking is, having like 170 territories that don't have access to the game is a real issue and an anticonsumer move"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-03,"ok ill just play one of the 1000 other games i own that also require weird thirdparty logins, etc to play. whats the problem here exactly?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-03,"this was always going to happen. anything published by sony is a probable. anything built by one of their studios will 100 require a psn account. otherwise they have no way of connecting with the people playing their games. it's the right move from their side.. out of interest, why are people so against it? it's a usernamepassword combo right?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-03,"i had to make a ubisoft account a steam account epic account a rockstar account origin account ea account xbox account, blizzard account, nintendo account on the wii not switch. modern nintendo is trash. and im sure there's many more i can't think if right now. why are people upset that u need make a playstation account. it's become the norm for companies to force u to make an account with them if u wanna play the game. i think it's pathetic of these companies to do this to single player games but nobody should be surprised or hold this against sony. it's industry standard now"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-03,are we going to post something every time sony does this?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-04,no suprise here. not gonna buy since piracy is a anyway better program than legitmate
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-04,"dont mean no disrespect  but no shit it takes a psn account, its a playstation exclusive game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-19,"i opened my psn account to check gow ragnarok trophies, then noticed that the game is available on ps5  pc, does it mean that i have the game on 2 platforms"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,is a psn account free? why are people pissed?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,if a psn account is free and i can play offline then i see no issues.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the game isn't being sold on pc in regions that can't make psn accounts, so the problem has already solved itself."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,nope you figure sony would learn after the helldivers 2 debacle screw that
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,pc gamers never stop bitching and moaning
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,about fucking time this game got announced when it is coming out on pc. day one buy from me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i'm not going to tell people what they should or shouldn't be mad about of course. but personally, i couldn't have cared less. even if i didn't already have a psn account, i would've just created one anyway. got all these accounts for other companies too such as ea, ubisoft, creative assembly, rockstar... i'm just glad sony releases these games on pc and without denuvo too. and i think it's more than fair for them to ask for an account, similar to most other big studios do."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,damn people really disliked it when we did it on helldivers. let's do it again
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"sony patents have shown the bullshit they have planned for monetizing game difficulty, displaying ads everywhere, and stealing your data. they want to milk gamers playing singleplayer games. edit also, the ai companion that will play the game you purchased for you while you watch."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,is a psn account free?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,did people forget that this is a singleplayer game requiring a secondary account
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the account isnt the problem. the fact you cant even make an account is. sony selling games where you cant make a mandatory account is.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,piracy it is then
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"correction, it requires the will to sail on the high seas"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,pass lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"oh boo hoo. its literally free. no problem with playstation games requiring a playstation account. if you dont like it, dont play playstation games"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i mean its a playstation game, what do you expect?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,who cares? pc users are used to launchers and having numerous accounts. why should playstation get flack for joining the party.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i can't view the store page. now i'm gonna look stupid with the 2018 game on my account. i should've just pirated it from the get go
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i can go out and buy a physical copy where i live on ps5 but sony has also marked my home as part of its non supported countries, meaning i cant purchase their games on steam. all very odd."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,just an account or a whole ps launcher app. accounts don't bother me as much as having to install their launcher
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"hopefully this isnt an inhibitor to the steam deck by requiring the psn launcher too. every playstation port to pc that ive played on the deck has been awesome, especially god of war! hopefully they arent limiting the devices to just windows devices."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,who would have thunk
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"o, my name was captain kidd as i sailed, as i sailed o, my name was captain kidd as i sailed my name was captain kidd and god's laws i did forbid and so wickedly i did as i sailed, as i sailed so wickedly i did as i sailed"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"easy, just bombard it with negative reviews like they did with helldivers 2, seems to work."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"as long as it starts out with this, then its not a big deal. including it after the fact cough, helldivers is a huge l."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i literally had to start an account on an app to use a laundromat the other day. tbh its so par for course these days i dont think anyone cares.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,piracy is allowed by sony
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"dont like the psn account, dont play it. gaming is a privilege not a right."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it's weird how sony continues to not so subtley tell me hey man, it's cool, keep your money, we're good. will do, guys."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,damn no way a sony game requires a psn account to play? absolutely outrageous
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"man im fuckin' stupid, here i was thinking the helldivers 2 shitshow actually taught them anything, serves me right"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i am already thankful when i don't need a separate launcher.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"and that's another sony game unavailable in my region. really wanted to play the game but it is what it is, i guess. edit got downvoted for saying i am regionlocked out of the game which is in no way a lie. what am i supposed to say?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,same shit that happened to helldiver2
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yeah and? i can't play sea of thieves on ps5 without creating an xbox gamertag account. you don't hear ps5 users losing their shit over it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,sony really cranking up those villain points.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it's all ragnarover now
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,capitalism ruins everything. can we just play some damn video games in peace without being nickel and dimed as well?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"don't care, i'm not gonna buy any sony games anymore anyway."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"well, i guess i'll take it off my wishlist..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i just wish they would expand psn to more regions
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"me omg, sony is releasing its games on pc, finally i can play horizon, spider man and gow! here sony, take my money, i dont mind waiting a year or two after release, these are single player games with graphics that stand the test of time! oh joy! sony no! i dont want your money!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,another game to cross off my backlog. good job sony! indy for me thanks. i don't want more logins for anything..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i'll play without a psn account, you can bet on it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,sony has already made it very obvious they will never learn and the idiots who pay for this trash anyway are enabling it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,pc gamers love having launchera for every publisher
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,haha i am going to steal this game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i was on a fence on buying this. i did enjoy the previous one a lot, so i was leaning towards making a purchase. not anymore, nope."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it's not really a big deal. if you want to play steam, you need a steam account. same for epic, blizzard, microsoft, ea, ubisoft, etc. this is no different. it's how they track trophies and connect users for online play, again just like all the others."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"no one is surprised. microsost, ubisoft and activision just to name a few already mandate this. sony is just following protocol."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,oh the humanity!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,who cares?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i guess i'll be the 1 not buying it because of this decision. i don't even own a ps5 and this game would have probably been my sole reason to hence why i don't own it right now and to quote the oatmeal, i need more website accounts like i need an asshole on my forehead for people like me the requirement is the nail in the coffin for the decision not to get it shame. it looked really good and i played the original trilogy, so seeing kratos change was really nice. there's always let's plays i guess"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ah, i dont care ill just get the damn psn, i still desperately want to play ragnarok. it looks like so much fun."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i'll just wait for the cracked version and pirate. sony doesn't deserve my money. also, don't forget this will mean the game will be blacklisted in around 180 countries."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,its a playstation game so no shit lmao
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,gow ragnarok requires me not to buy it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,oh no! anyway...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,a sony game requires a sony account. no way
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,common sony l
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,just block sony as a publisher on steam. i'm tired of all these extra logins for no reason.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,if this is the hill sony wants to die on so be it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"people are missing the point. the point was in 120 countries including mine we were enjoying snoy games unrestricted, giving them our money. because of the helldivers fiasco snoy completely removed their games and now all future snoy games from our countries, where before we paid for them and enjoyed them. they arent even trying to give us psn support, just dumping of us instead."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it's not a problem at all. the link is from 'videogamechronciles' that when i click on to read on my phone tells me they want to share my 'cookies' with 695 partners. if they are happy to share their info with that many people, one psn linked account should be no issue for them to complain about."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,dang. signing up for a simple account is just so hard.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"just read the terms and conditions. if you don't want to make a psn account, then don't and don't play their game."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,nope. fuck em.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i get that people are annoyed by the inconvenience of having to have yet another account on some shitty platform that you're never going to interact with in any other way. but i don't quite understand the claims of actual harm that it causes. this feels to me like people are just mad at a games company for using the leverage they have to monetize a product in another way that doesn't increase actual cost. if you're mad that game companies want to make more money, that's fine. but be honest about your outrage. or at least explain why this thing you're mad about is actually bad."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"oh great, now we have to hear the infinite bitching about this for months."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,lol fuck off i wont play this game then there are too many games out there
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i will never make psn acc... there is nothing wrong with me buying games, i can spend now i earn enough... after they fuked up sooo many people with the helldivers fiasco over 100 countries still can't play even tho they let them buy the gamei will rather pirate the game than give sony 1 more cent."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,so are peoplle readying the review bombs?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,as long as it's stated outright. still sucks for those in countries that cant get psn's. guess ps doesn't like money.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,gta vi on pc requires rockstar games social account  oh nooo. anyway
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,piracy doesn't need an account.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,thank god i lost interest in sony games
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,good thing almost all ps5 games are cinematic fluff garbage i don't want to play.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,oh no.... anyway
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it's different when you require it from the beginning versus not requiring it for months and then suddenly making it a requirement. now i can weigh the pros and cons before i buy it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,where my helldivers at? round 2 boys...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i wanna buy ghost of tsushima but cant... now this too lol. before any dick heads say i cant afford a 60 usd game.... please think twice. its not a 600 usd.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,no amount of mods would get me to play this dogshit again regardless
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,just like ghosts of tsushima? im shocked.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,arrrrrrr i mean seriously imagine giving money to sony..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"oh no, many of you did abusing the refund system from helldivers 2 excused fully aware psn is are requirements now sony corrected it! sorry matey, you are blocked! lol earned it!!!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,who cares? seriously. why is this an issue. i was onboard with the helldivers controversy. i even joined the boycott and made my negative reviews. why? because they forced it to be mandatory after the release. and let people in regions buy it who could not make accounts. as long as ragnarok and tsushima let people know beforehand. so what? is it just a sony hate boner?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,then make an account you bum. or dont play.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,imagine paying for a 4090 and being to dumb to make a psn account or use a vpn and i'm owning one httpsi.imgur.comngj0nbc.jpeg
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i don't understand why i'm supposed to be angry. you need an ea account for ea games. you need a bethesda account for bethesda games. you need a psn account for psn games. who fucking cares?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,do we really have to teach you this lesson again sony?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,never seen so many people bitch about something like this. do you want me to start making accounts for people? just make the freaking account and be done with it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"im a ps guy, but also, why do people care hate making an account so badly? i feel like i must be missing something lol. i have to make a steam, original, ubisoft, and epic games accounts to play games they have. i just dont know why pc players draw the line at a psn account but not the other 4 they possibly have lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,literally who gives a fuck. it also requires a steam account. stop trying to drum up outrage over absolutely nothing. god this sub is pathetic
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,lol. not buying it then
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,isn't this normal? why is there an article and why do people care?

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ok, fuck you sony, as always, fuck any ps developer as well for not doing anything to stop it, and fuck people that don't care and even mock about the unsupported countries. lastly, fuck valve for allowing sony to sell games with locks like that on their platform."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,oh no what ever will we do
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it's a game that belongs to them. ea has their own launcher and you still can't play their games on steam without an account.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"okay but what bout the games that require a ubisoft account, ea account, rockstar account, microsoft account, the list goes on. its almost like theyre new to the pc industry and just following what almost every other major game company does. sony does need to expand their list of available countries though, thats my biggest thing with them"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,your reminder that reddit has long been used by companies to try and change public perception by manipulating the sentiment around a clear negative thing in order to try and make it look less bad or even positive...kinda like the dozens of upvoted bot comments in here
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,you create a psn account and that's it. you never have to interact with it again. boot up game and play. no launcher. nothing stoping you from playing the game offline. sony just wants a statistic box checked. cool. fine. but i can't even buy it cause sony won't sell the game in my country google why that is. is sony completely blameless? no. but i cannot blame a company for not wanting to bend to the will of the greedy ass governments.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the number of people in this thread who are ready to take the corpocock so readily while disregarding all legitimate concerns is so bizarre that it sounds like astroturfing. its reaching nearly nintendo fan levels of selfdisrespect.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"sorry, but why do people care? it takes seconds to make an account. genuinely dont understand"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"if sony games were actually worth the hassle, i wouldn't mind. i played a few of them and it was a forgettable experience."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,whats the big deal? this and ghost of tsushima were formerly playstation exclusives. this isnt a helldivers situation.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"why are people still so mad about making accounts? i have so many damn accounts that i made and then never had to look at or deal with ever again. i use the same login and password for most because they're not tied to anything. i get it. maybe some people get annoyed. but do you guys not have that 1 email address that you use for all of these gaming related accounts so that you never have to look at it again? i mean i use psn, xbox live, and switch online. i occasionally use steam but really all i play on pc are retro titles like starcraft and jagged alliance. but origin, epic, ubisoft, ea, and whatever other random accounts out there take 5 seconds to make. it's no hassle at all."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,we'll just have to see about that.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,ghost of tsushima already launched and found success despite this requirement. i think this one is a lost battle.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,ok this is ridiculous. i can get the helldivers complaint cuz they let you play wout the account on launch then locked you out if you skipped the account. all these other games who are asking for a psn account to play the game are fine lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,just do the same we helldivers did
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,ahhhh sony what the fucckkkk im going to do it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i did play both the gow games on a ps4, so i don't intend to buy it. that being said, i never justified buying a ps5, and i've been waiting since release to play ghost of tsushima on an eventual pc port. now that it is finally here, i can't play it because the store page is literally inaccessible in my country. i haven't pirated a game in nearly two decades, but this is definitely pushing me in that direction again."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i can wait.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"don't care, when is it coming out?!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ah st, here we go again !"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i don't understand, what is the problem here? it's not like this hasn't happened before."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"its just so weird. many wont do this out of principle and they are locking 177 regions of people, millions of potential customers out of buying the game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yo ho ho and a bottle of fuck you snoy.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"idc if they tell us beforehand. sure, i feel bad for the 180 countries who can't get it because psn isn't present, but it doesn't impact me nor people who already have the game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,eldin ring ruined this series for me. gow seems so silly compared to er

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i'm sure there will be a similar amount of outrage to helldivers 2. because that wasn't just an excuse people were using to get a refund...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,fuck sony
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,well. pirating it is then
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i still have my psn account from 2010 or something when i brought a ps3. so i dont really care honestly. so far at least sony doesnt force another launcher on me so in that regard im kinda glad its only a login in the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,jesus fucking christ its a first party game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i guess the pc port of ghost of tsushima proves that even without those 177 countries, they can still sell record breaking numbers. i guess the market in those banned countries are either very small or is just a hot bed for piracy so not much of a loss for sony"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"honestly. this is the equivalent of being surprised that an ea game requires an ea account, whether you intend to use multiplayer or not."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,no it does not ! yo ho me hearties yo ho
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i don't care.gif
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it's not worth playing. the pacing is inexcusably bad.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i absolutely loved the first game, and i will definitely get this one too, maybe not for full price though. people love complaining, and tbh it seems really petty by people that wanted to buy it, but don't want anymore if they live in a country with psn"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,good thing i already have one
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,years of xbox requiring the same on steam cricket chirps
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,oh no! anyway...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why does anyone care about this? do you have to pay for the psn account? i didn't think so.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i could not care any less. i am going to play god of war ragnarok on pc
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,makes sense

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i heard even steam games will now require a steam account

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"people saying but you need a steam account is so brain dead. its on the steam launcher, you literally need one."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,already pirated it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"as if these pc players didn't sign up for battle net, epic games, and other company accounts. stfu losers."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"how many playstation game requires playstation account posts can we endure? steam games require steam, epic games require epic games account, sony games require psn account. deal with it or don't buy it. i don't think anyone stopped playing rocket league when it moved to epic despite the account linking... everyone is starting rockstar launcher in steam for years."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,does this mean it cant be cracked?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i was genuinely excited that sony was bringing games to pc, but that's basically out the window now. not going to sign up to their pointless service that had security breeches every other year."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,probably a mistake since it is required for trophies if you want them. they could fix it before launch in 4 months

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"who cares, as long as this game on pc have dlaa and frame generation, so i can play at 4k dlaa with fg, it will look so good. ghost of tsushima look so insane in 4k dlaa fg, can't wait to play this one !!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"no, it won't"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,remember that the us government fbi is spying on your via psn backdoor. they are colluding with other organizations to get as many people as they can to sign up for a psn account and start using it regularly. the government is constantly giving itself permission to violate the constitution.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,xbox has been this way for years. why is everyone surprised? hd was a unique situation
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i don't think people would have been as mad about this as helldivers if it launched with it. it got added later, and it stopped players from continuing after already playing a bunch. even if it's just a short few clicks, people get pissed if you force something on them if it wasn't there to begin with. honestly im surprised sony hasn't made their own psn launcher for pc yet. they may start to roll that out later but who knows."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,couldnt give a shit tbh
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,how hard is it create a psn account ? you like ps games just make one. you want to talk on reddit ? you create an account.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i dont in any way care. im just happy that i finally get to play this game. i played the first one years ago on ps4 and it was incredible.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i don't really care? its just an account. i already have dozens that sell my data, reddit included."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"why do people care? yes it was clearly pretty scummy retroactively adding it to helldivers and locking some people out of the game who had already purchased and been playing it. this though, if you dont want to use a vpn and live in one of the few places that cant play it just dont buy the game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,its their product
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,can someone loop me in on why making a psn account  bad?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,just don't play it then ffs. what a bunch of complaining children.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"...and in other news, water is wet."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,more reason to pirate
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,no it doesn't
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,5 years from now and nobody will care about this. it's just the typical hive mentality of gamers pretending to care about something that might not even affect them.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i've had a psn account since psn came out, tf do i care? takes 3 minutes to make."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,game sucks anyway
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it literally doesn't fucking matter and everyone crying about it is so pathetic. just make the damn account and play the game. it's the tiniest of inconveniences.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i love seeing dumb people crying pretending like they was buying this game hahahaha
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,this is no different from rdr2 requiring a rockstar account
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"still playing, are you guys goanna post the same thing every time a sony games releases on pc?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why. does. this. even. matter. you people needed to create a steam account to download games. a reddit account to post. an email account to even make a reddit account or syeam account. this shit is a non issue
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,who gives a shit? is it really that an inconvenience to enter an email and password
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,playstation studio game released on other platforms requires playstation account. shocked face
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i'm playing ghost of tsushima right now, only need psn for legends which is multiplayer. why does gow, a single player like ghost, need psn?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"like... ea, ubisoft, microsoft, etc... ?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,at least one would be able to find a yarr dee harr copy of god of war ragnark if one happens to live in an unsupported country unlike their multiplayer titles which would just be unplayable unless one farts around with vpns. honestly in the case of single player titles it's mostly a loss for sony by reducing the number of customers who can buy the game and give them money.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it's no different to many things though, i don't get why people are making such a big deal out of sony doing it i'm sure the trophy hunter and completionists on pc are happy"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,when i play mass effect i need to install the ea launcher. same with witcher 3 and many other. i dont get the issue with playstation now.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"they were still fairly upfront about helldivers, but people didn't care"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,lol they said it upfront about helldivers as well...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"to be fair, my understanding of the helldivers 2 fiasco was that they started at launch by saying the psn account was needed for multiplayer since they were doing crossplay with ps players. obviously that wasn't the case, since they were forced to disable that and crossplay worked just fine, which was annoying to see but since it worked out, everyone let it go. it was when they came back months later to reinstate it, while basically blacklisting quite a few countries who can't make psn accounts and who were playing the game just fine until that point, that everyone lost their minds lol. ps absolutely agreed that the intent was to start with helldivers 2 to boost their psn numbers with their steam games, but it looks like they just waited for things to blow over before starting again."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"even for helldivers 2 it was 100 stated from day one a psn would be required for the game, it just wasnt set up for launch."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i don't think surprised is the emotion most of us care about
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"honestly. this is the equivalent of being surprised that an ea game requires an ea account, whether you intend to use multiplayer or not."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"not sure why anyone is surprised. i currently have to have an account to play games from blizzard, epic, ubisoft, ea, riot, battlestate, microsoft, and a few others. i mean i get it, it's annoying to have all these accounts, but that's just what it is."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"why does a singleplayer game require a psn account? with the awful history of all the different data breaches that sony has had over the years, im not really interested in linking my steam account to that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,99 of the people mad about this werent going to buy it anyways. is it a mild inconvenience? sure. is it going to stop me from playing a game i want to play? lol no.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the amount of people i've seen who legitimately believe if reddit doesn't like something it'll bankrupt a multibillion dollar corporation is staggering.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,and will continue to not care about every other game that comes out that requires an account
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,reddit gamers still dont realize that they live in a massive echo chamber with views and opinions simply not shared or cared about by the vast majority of normal people. these people just love to have things to be outraged about.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"hi, it's me, most consumers. i don't have a psn account because i haven't owned a playstation since ps2. i'm perfectly fine signing up for a psn account to play on pc. i'm just going to use my burner email so they just get my bogus data."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"gotta be honest, looking forward to this game and the psn account doesnt bother me personally. i considered getting a ps5 for some of the sony single player exclusives but am pretty happy they're being ported over and i dont need a console. making a psn account seems less annoying than dealing with ea or uplay low bar i know. everyone playing helldivers on ps5 seems to be doing fine with a psn account."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yea i dont really understand how is this any different than any other game that requires a launcher login after youve launched from steam its sony, but is that really any worse than rockstar or uplay?"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"if logging into my playstation account is all it requires to play playstation games without having to buy a ps5, i'll gladly do it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,most consumers don't care. i know who will care the people in the 180 or so countries where psn accounts aren't available and have been waiting for a pc release to be able to play it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"most redditors don't care, they've been doing 3rd party launcher sign ups all the time. the helldivers 2 thing was crazier because some countries had no psn. and sony took their money and said you can't play."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,im upset because my friend won't be able to buy the game and thus i won't be able to borrow their copy of the game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"reddit will continue to be upset about it  justifiably or not and it will still sell incredibly well because most consumers don't care. i don't think you even understand why people are upset. i would have bought it, but it won't be available in my region on steam, so i won't be able to buy it. not because i don't want to, or because i care about accounts  but because i literally can't. it will still sell incredibly well it will still sell incredibly well, even in those regions where you literally can't buy it? how is this the top comment."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yeah. im just glad it seems to have been announced. i wasnt paying attention. first game was great. looking forward to playing this.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,problem is that requirement for psn cuts about 100 countries as they dont have psn there.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"except, of course, the regions it will be blocked in"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i dont think most people care that theyre being up front with this one. helldivers was a big deal because the expectation wasnt set, and sonyarrowhead literally had to scrub things from their websites in the spirit of avoiding potential legal action when they tried to make having a psn account mandatory."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,ghost of tsushima also required a psn account. i ended up just making one.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i'm all in support for people speaking out against this. i just don't have a dog in this race. i've already linked my psn. i will probably buy ragnorak on pc, probably when it goes on sale."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,let's see. i would think the same but helldivers 2 stuff was widespread way beyond reddit. it was obvious anything that's a nuisance will also piss casuals off
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i don't know about incredibly well as this far a lot of the pc ports have been bug filled trash games, specifically with tlou. plus, these games come out years later and are really kind of old by that point. it's hard to justify the full price of a year or two old game when, if you have a playstation, the game is far cheaper and runs better. i've had bad experiences with pc ports of sony games so i won't be buying anything theyve released anytime soon. the next big big release is obviously gta6, and they're actually holding back releasing the ps5pro for because it's a system seller. so the hardware will be somewhat rated by the time it releases in 2025 with the game or a few months prior. for the lead sony has over xbox they sure love shooting themselves in the foot."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i like it cause i'm a trophy hunter who prefers to play on pc, but i wish there was a way to have it incorporated that doesn't inconvenience so many people. last time i said this tho i was downvoted for some reason sadly"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the same people who arent gonna buy it are gonna pirate it even though they live somewhere where they can create a psn account. and then theyre gonna complain when pc gets shafted again.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i don't care, i've been refreshing this particular google search for a long time"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,well i just hope it isn't broken like ghost of tsushima multiplayer.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,oh no! a sony game wants me to have a sony account to play their sony game made by sony!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,people will always complain if they cant play their video game while sitting in a lead bunker in the heart of a black hole while the heat death of the universe is occurring outside.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,justifiably or not can anyone actually argue it is justifiable? lol. it is such a fucking minor inconvenience. a gaming company wants you to have an account for their thing... oh no.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yeah but at the same time its a single player game only. why decide to let other people not be able to play it in other regions. doesnt matter if most people who can play it are fine. what matters is the people who cant. wouldnt be surprised if they started adding ps later down the road.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it will definitely not sell as well, since a huge number of countries can't buy it because of this. people aren't upset that they have to create a psn account to play it they're upset that they can't create the account at all. sony themselves have effectively ensured a boycott of this game that will cost them profits."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i reckon players that can't male psn accounts won't lose any sleep over pirating the game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,just like how reddit is mad about recall but most people won't care.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,my gripe with the hell divers issue was that they sold the game in countries where psn was not available knowing that the game was going to require psn in the future. not cool.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yeah look i'm sorry but god of war 2018 is easily one of the best games i've ever played in my life, i bought it the instant it became available on pc and i have been eagerly anticipating the day i can get ragnarok. i love these games so much i bought the stone mason edition of 2018 and the jotnar edition of ragnarok and i don't even have a ps5 lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"its weird to me that theyre only mad at sony but ea, ubisoft, activision, etc all require the same. if you are playing video games online, your data is out there, its not just sony."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,and most consumers are stupid
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,because people that can't make a psn can't play the fucking game. it's a fucking singleplayer game. let them play it without an account.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,consumers do care though? they got sony to change this for helldivers 2 after massive backlash.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,im a consumer. i dont care. gonna get it day one. been waiting a long time for this
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,except that means it will be unavailable in almost 200 counties. did you think that might be an issue instead of just having to make one account ?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,this wasnt even the problem. the problem was psn was not required at first then they forced it when people who cant even use psn have already bought the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it will sell not because customers dont care. the population of us reddit users is a minority among the 300 million people of the us. im sure if you sent a survey out to all people in your workplace as a yes or no question for using reddit. the number is going to be lower with older people. even lower or nonexistent for the elites of society. among all subreddits on this site. wallstreetbets is the only subreddit to break the confines of this site.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,don't matter because my voice counts and i let it be heard on all social platforms
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,some of us already have a psn account because we've had a ps345.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"what i dont understand is why its suddenly such a big deal when this has been happening for well over a decade with almost every other gaming company. ea, ubisoft, rockstar, microsoft, the list goes on, have all required you to have an account with them. and most of them not only require an account, but require you to use their own launcher as well. as far as im aware, sony only requires a psn account."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"exactly like helldivers 2, where no one got a refund and sony wasn't forced to revoke their plans."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"terrible sports games sell incredibly well despite them being shitty and have shitty practices, does not mean they're great or something lmao."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it will shrugg it off after someone makes an pirated mod where you don't need the psn account
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,ubisoft and ea pull this shit too and they're dead to me. oh well. get fucked sony. it's not like i'm spoiled for choices on pc right now... oh wait i am.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,so to play portal 2 on my ps3 i had to make a steam account.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,because most consumers don't care are stupid ftfy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yeah just having an account on your side mail address is really not a problem for literally anyone. its not like it hurts you in any way. people just like to cry and complain.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,honestly it is kind of a silly thing to be mad about but to each their own i guess
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,well those customers deserve when they're data is exploited and their identity is stolen.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"maybe, this case is different from ghost of tsushima since they are locking the whole god of war single player experience behind a psn account, ghost on the other hand locked the multiplayer behind psn which is bad idea as that means less ppl using the multiplayer part but oh well thats their choice"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,in some countries it's the only option.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,lets be honest. you were going to pirate it regardless.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it's always like that for me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,youre right that will show them. then maybe they wont even bother making a pc port so you dont even get the option to buy on pc. or you can just make a free account.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"is it not arguably more of a hassle to pirate something than it is to just make an account? basically every service requires an account anymore, so i just dont see how this matters at all outside of being a onetime annoyance."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yeah i get you cant use playstation in certain countries which does make it worse putting it like that is disingenuous. by estimates it works in 70 countries and doesn't in 120httpswww.sportskeeda.comgamingtechallcountriesplaystationnetworkavailableandcountriesitsnot.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"that is the issue, sony isn't opening up to new regions. microsoft accounts work in regions xbox isn't in, playstation accounts do not.that is the major issue, when you block almost over 100 countries from buying your game on pc, you pss people off. why is this tied to a console marketplace, when these games don't have a console marketplace. if sony had opened up account creation to every legal country they could and had a note saying account will not work on playstation consoles due to unsupported regions, people would have been fine with it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i'm not mad at you, i'm just irritated in general about all this, because it's fucking everywhere. it's just another fucking dumbass login for something that shouldn't have one. everything has a gods damned account and password, and i'm just sick of it. why the fuck do i need to be interacting with these companies outside of just booting up and playing their games? why do i need all these accounts? why do i need to be online, all the time? dude... enough with this shit. is it data collection? just big brother'ing us? like what the fuck is it? because i have the strangest feeling that corporations aren't trustworthy... and i don't want to support this shit any longer. it is stupid as fuck in principle and function. i'm tired of having to be connected to fucking everything all the time ffs. i don't give a fuck about these corporations besides the fucking games they happen to slap their damn name on. i don't want another fuckin' account for some company that i do not give a shit about interacting with i'm not going to use anything on their account platform aside from just buying a fucking game, and that's only if i have to. and if this shit is somehow exploiting me to earn them more money on top of the price i paid for the game then fuck them and fuck this."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"hmm okay so just a quick run down of what happened so far from the beginning... psn games were region locked, since like last 20 years, but you could just work around that by saying you're from a different country, sony were fine with this and didn't really give a shit if people did this. helldivers2 happened. it blew up, hard. servers couldn't be maintained. afaik, sony did and were always planning to use a psn account to sign in. just like ubisoft, ea, xbox.. literally most companies out there..it's a very common practise. at the beginning of the hd2 arc, sony indeed did have a sign saying you need a psn account to play, however, arrowhead, the developers, messed up. as the playercount increased, sony gave the devs the go ahead to temporarily bypass the psn future, but they have to readd it in the future. everything was fine and dandy as the servers increased and the player count settled after some months. until sony asked the devs to keep reenable the psn future, as it should've originally. arrowhead dev admitted that they kinda forgot that the psn sign in notification wasn't re enabled every time one booted up helldivers2, which is what they originally intended to do. instead it was just one small notification, with a 'skip' option back when things were hectic and everyone forgot about it. helldivers2 community went mad, admittedly. they were complaining about two main things 1. why did they need a psn account to sign up after all this time 2. certain regions couldn't make an account, but could buy the game. 'wasn't this illegal?'. the review bombing came, like never before. hell was unleashed. people mass demanding refunds. steam allowed the refunds even past the 10hour playtime mark. sony responded and said that helldivers2 will be an exception, as it was a mistake. which brings us to the current timeline. the backlash sony received was 100 significant. it was on articles, youtube videos, mass negative reviews of not only helldivers2, but other psn games on steam.  this brings us full circle. sony, who couldn't care less if regions that didn't have psn, were now fully aware of the consequences by not paying attention to it.  so what do they do? they stop selling the games in those regions. full stop. it's the easiest and quickest solution for sony to avoid such a debacle from occurring ever again. these are the facts, afaik. feel free to let me know if i'm missing something. i just want to state that, it would've taken less than 5 minutes for an helldivers2 player to create a psn account. and possibly a maximum of 10 minutes if they were in a region locked area to make it. no, i am not pro corporate or whatever people want to call it. sony are a business. that's how they operate. i can definitely understand why sony did what they did. they're not some indie developer that's for the people."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"what is the benefit to the customer in requiring registration? if nothing, then it is at best a waste of my fucking time when i've legally paid the company for their game. if they want me to pirate their shit, they just need to show a lack of respect for my time."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i actually like getting trophies in ghost of tsushima and i can see my playstation friends and messages. they just need to open it to every country.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"issue was when they tried to force people to make new acc for helldivers after, idk 3 month in order to continue to play game they bought. making people open extra acc on fresh game buy is dick move, but still tolerable if you buy it for first time"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,also most pc games for the longest time if you bought a physical copy would require you to install and create an account on steam. even if you own the physical disc you still are required to use steam it seems like. i should be able to play the game without having to use the internet at all if i wanted to. so kinda annoying in that respect to.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,pc gamers need something to complain about.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,according to the downvoters everyone affected should be more worried about finding fresh water and not about gaming since apparently they all live in 3rd world shitholes

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,they want your data.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,so this makes no sense to me. it's 2024 and making an account is a hard concept for you to figure out?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"its a free account that gets forced upon you, so its easier for sony to collect data about you and get a profile. this can be important for adds and stuff. f those kids in bangladesh or whatever countries they are from. no psn acc there? no ragnarok for them! for the user its not a big deal. all you have to do is get another launcher which you maybe can link with steam. so you open steam, to open another launcher, to logg in, to just start the singleplayer game... oh, youre american and happen to live in texas and have a generator? no ragnarok for you aswell in certain days in the summer. so its more inconvenient for the consumer only so he can get more adds. i do not understand how some users start to defend this bullshit. i for sure will pirate it, even if i have a new job then"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yes its free to create a psn account but the issue is only 69 countries have access to psn. but this isnt an issue for needing it on release vs needing it months later like helldivers looks like i was downvoted by a bunch of idiots again
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,people in supported regions pretending to care about those in unsupported regions not being able to access the game

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,my issue was that creating a playstation account literally requires me to give my postal code address...like wtf? i'm not giving personal information to a company that has had multiple security breaches.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i mean just think about it for a second. ill give you an example. i just got an email today that there was suspicious activity on my activision account. i forgot i even had one but probably had to make one for call of duty in the past. so i can possibly have some information stolen from me due to people breaking into my account or activision having their data stolen directly. for what purpose? so activision can sell some personal information to target ads at me? its actually bullshit and its bullshit people have gotten so complacent about giving out all of their information so they can actually use a product that they bought and supposedly own.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,single player game. no multiplayer of any kind. still blocked.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it was against their terms because it had to be in the legal speak. they rarely enforced it and it allowed people in countries without psn to get around it easily. the helldivers thing is now pushing sony to just region lock and now there is no way around it but the people who complained about it, from the countries that it truly has no effect on, will still have to have a psn account to play the games because they aren't going to stop doing that. most major publishers already do the same thing."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"they did already learn, this is the result from the helldivers bitching."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"collecting unnecessary personal data to sell off or market to you ext. nice email spams. or annoying logins. or any number of other things. i want the game, and just the game. not any other bullshit attached."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,bitching actually got them to reverse course on helldivers 2 so theres that.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-03,how about i play the game without a psn account and give the finger to their ecosystem. sounds like best of both worlds to me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,because psn is only available in certain regions.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yea
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yes, but only available in certain regions."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it is not available for sale in countries where psn isn't supported
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"making an account takes, at most, one minute. unless you live in a country without access to psn, is this not a slight overreaction?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,140 countries can't because they can't make an account with sony
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-03,"or i can play any playstation games i want with mandatory psn account for free, how about that. and maybe just buy the ones i'm interested in that don't force that shit."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it is just making them region lock games now. no one with a shred of intelligence thought the psn requirement was going to go away on future releases.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,upvoted you. these privileged people don't understand what it's like to live in the wrong country.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"this is contrary to capitalism. them requiring psn means they have less countries to sell it to, limiting their reach."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"blame the fans, they the ones who forced their hand and made them do this"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-03,"tough luck, cause there's gonna be plenty of people who are going to play the games without a psn account. i guess terms and conditions don't matter so much eh?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,youre the one missing out lmao

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,just imagine if when gta launches on pc it's exclusive to the rockstar games store.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it would be nice if you didnt need to though. being able to just buy and play a game without all the secondary stuff is good quality of life. you dont have to be angry, but i still find this stuff annoying"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,or you know people actually don't give a shit about the need for a psn account
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i think i blame the japanese way of doing business or some law that's preventing them to divide them by regions like most american and international countries to make it more manageable. sony cannot realistically divide the psn infrastructure per country, hence, why they stopped at that number. this restriction only exists in japanese companies like sony or nintendo. however, the first taste we got when someone blocked the game for sale in most of asia because of these weird regional licensing restrictions was konami with metal gear rising revengeance."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,because it's now blocked in a lot of countries. god of war 2018 and other previously released sony games didn't have that restriction
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,because it's unnecessary step that is being forced on pc players just so sony can try to inflate their psn numbers for investors.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the big deal is psn is not available in some countries, and by some i mean a lot. . ghost of tsushima is not even listed anymore in my steam because of this. ."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,that was in reference to ghosts of tsushima's online mode. gow is a strictly single player game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,or wait for gog release
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,no
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"like this. if it's just required for playstation trophies, that's fine. i don't care about that. ghost of tsushima required it for the playstation overlay and legends multiplayer. i can ignore that and play the single player content, what i bought the game for anyway. god of war, and all of the other single player content playstation games don't require it to play, ragnarok shouldn't either."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you must have failed debate classes growing up, huh?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,but sony have already announced that they have signed kojima for another project after ds2.httpsyoutu.bewepk67jdlu8?featureshared
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,you think the fbi needs you to make a psn account to spy on you?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,every single detail about you is online. the government isn't using psn as their way to get your information. you've already willingly given it to them.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"helldivers did launch with it, btw."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i'm in a country where it affects me right now tho...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,many country don't have access to psn network they just can't create account and if you try to vpn you risk to loose access to all your game .
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,you must be lucky you're not born in the wrong country then.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,except that rockstartake 2 isn't pulling the game for sale in 177180 countries just because they don't have it officially listed in those countries.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,did you miss the whole incident with helldivers 2 where sony allowed the game to sold in countries where psn was not available and then tried to force users to get a psn account that they couldnt create without risking bans from sony for violating terms of use?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,data collection
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,because sony is working on their own playstation store for pc and they want people to be able to move there and bring their games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"is not that hard to understand, honestly."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,how else will they steal your data and sell it to china?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,money
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,collecting and selling your personal data and boosting their monthly active users numbers.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i am guessing for future cross progression save where if you play the game on a ps5 and want to continue on the pc, you can transfer your save file from the ps5 cloud to your pc game. hence the psn account requirements? crossplay and crossprogression is useful if you dont want to have to restart the entire game again if you already have an old save file."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yea im not sure why sony is the only one catching shit here when i had to make a microsoft account to play sea of thieves.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,at least they arent having data breaches every other week
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-02,"and this attitude from people is why they get away with it. it's just more restrictions on how we can play the games we buy. how long till sony starts trying to enforce ps on pc players to play online? the playstation people have to do it, so what's the big deal, right? give them an inch they'll take a mile. look at the helldivers 2 fiasco. people got pissed about the psn requirement and it launched a pr nightmare. sony backpedalled with some bullshit statement about how they're figuring out what's best for pc players. then the release ghost of tsushima. single player is untouched, but multiplayer requires psn account. not much outrage here. single player is playable regardless, and the requirement for the psn account is only multiplayer. sure it's sucks for the people being barred from the game, but whatever. now they're requiring psn for single player only games that doesn't have a multiplayer to justify the barrier of entry for non supported psn regions. when does it stop?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yeah except now they know that the proper response to psn having issues and the game being unplayable on launch is, sorry, the game will be unavailable until we resolve the issues, instead of, sorry, we'll temporarily waive the psn requirement so everyone can play while we resolve it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,who cares? like why is this a big deal or surprise?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,its a completely irrelevant thing. i cant think of a single playstation release on pc that didnt have this?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,people have emotions over this? its a playstation game its expected. after the bullshit people tried to give sony over helldivers 2 they will never make the same mistake again. this is now standard practice and will apply to all future sony games doesnt matter if they are single player or multiplayer. the people mad about this that also gave sony shit over hd2 only have themselves to blame.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,ea games requireing an ea account is also bad. there should be no accounts at all.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-02,they dont require ea accounts tho only for multiplayer at least on console anyways
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i don't play any of these games why do we care about helldivers requiring a psn account?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i get it for multiplayer games but requiring online accounts for offline single player games esp gow which has no online game mode ever is really odd.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"that makes sense considering they offer services worldwide, unlike psn. so you cant really compare em as apples to apples."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"microsoft have had 280 breaches since 2002, they absolutely eclipse sony in how often they get breaches its not even close, they've already had multiple this year. i bet you didn't blink twice to link your microsoft account to steam."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,psn hasn't been compromised in 12 years. microsoft and steam get compromised way more often and way more recently and these people use steam on microsoft windows every day so you can stop pretending you are worried about whatever data you'd put in to sign up for psn
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,actually it does stop me from playing when i couldn't even buy the game in the first play as sony pull it off from unsupported region.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"and then they'll sign up for the next account like it's no problem. why isn't there an outrage posts every time ea or ubisoft release a new game that requires an account? edit people keep replying that there is outrage for other games, i ask where is it? where are the outrage threads for every new game that comes out that requires an account? they simply do not exist"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,99 of the people mad about this werent going to buy it anyways. finally i've reached the 1 !
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,wasn't the whole problem that psn isn't available in some countries? so if you lived in one of those countries you were just fucked out of the game you paid for? seems like more then an inconvenience if you live in one of those countries
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i believe that 99 of the people mad about this cannot buy it due to being in the region ostracized by this decision. why not sell to the regions that cannot own a ps console or have a psn account?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it's not about the mandatory psn account. it's about 180 regions that can't buy the game at all. even if you want to buy it, you can't."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,you should see the piracy subreddits talking about how this is the reason why they've decided to pirate the game. sure..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the games are starting to give playstation trophies at least. i'm alright with that compromise.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i wouldn't care if the process for making a psn account didn't involve uploading a photo id of some sort... to a company notorious for data breaches.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,another new launcher is where i would draw the line. psn account and overlay? fine. it sucks for all those countries but they'll find a way to play that doesn't even give money to sony which is good. but a new launcher? that's the moment i stop caring. until i can launch it only through steam it's fine.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yeah this shit definitely doesn't stop me from playing it... but i'll happily wait years until it starts going on sale before i even think about it. and if they make the account requirements more strict by then... well streaming services already had me going back to my piracy bag so i guess we can put gaming there too.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,im not mad they require the account. im mad that they arbitrarily exclude a lot of countries from creating an account. im from the unknown region called the european union. i guess they cant be expected to have heard about such a small place...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,depends on the country you live in. mild inconvenience for me? sure. for someone in a country that psn doesn't support? it's a massive inconvenience.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,caption zealous upbeat paltry zesty chop cough ancient one abundant
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,very much so this
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"is it going to stop me from playing a game i want to play? lol no. good for you. it's going to stop me, because it's not available on steam in my region, and i don't want to pirate it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"we expect this gamento truly be worth playing. there are other games that aren't part of an awarded franchise that require online access and accounts etc, and that's the especially frustrating part. but i'm also a grown adult who has limited time to play the games i want to play. i'm very discerning in what i buy and i usually can decide if i want to deal with the hassel of an extra account or whatever. frustratingly, kids who playbthese games have limited access to regular funds to buy games, and things like game pass or whatever, or any kind of hook to keep young players using a single publisher's platform or games is likely to be a little bit more effective. it's still a dirty and frustrating tactic, because we should be buying games based on that game's quality, and ideally everything else is a bonus and a choice."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,from other games the biggest inconvenience was that psn isn't available in the majority of countries and some of the countries it is in require you to buy a ps5 to setup a psn account.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i have no self control and don't mind being a statistic in decisions that ultimately make the industry more shit for everyone! lol!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,people like you is why its hppenin
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,tying a game to a playstation server and effectively making it a glorified rental with a builtin off switch sounds like more than a mild inconvenience to me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"this is the problem with gamers tbh, as long as it's a game i'm thirsting for, i don't care. that's why publishers creep and creep remember when micro was only in free mobile games? gamers  protest for the dumbest incel shit most of the time instead of what actually infects the industry like corporate greed."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,99 of people make up statistics on the spot.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i feel like so many games require an account of some sort, it's kind of annoying, but whatever, it's not going to stop me from playing the games i want to play."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,maybe it would if you where an avid playstation user but you got fucked over when they hacked your account after sonys was breached again and they stole 150 from you lol.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,seriously. get back to me when sony requires you to run a separate launcher for their pc titles and i'll get real mad. but a login? eh. every company and their mum needs a login for that hit of sweet sweet data.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,must be nice to view the world through your eyes. only seeing your point of view and not caring about millions that can't play a game they wish because they don't live where psn is available. what a peaceful world it must be for you to so easily say fuck those guys.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"honestly it triggers spite neurons in my brain, so while i've been avoiding and waiting to play games like last of us and horizon, maybe get them in a sale, i've played ghost of sushi on release via methods and probably will the next god of war before i even play the original now. with that said, i see ghost of sushi isn't a game i would buy for more than 10 though it turns out don't care for the combat and general gameplay that much, looks pretty though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"mild inconvenience yeah, in 74 countries in this world. what about the rest of the 195? it's honestly fcking pathetic how sheltered you americans are"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i linked my steam and psn way back in the portal 2 days. does it suck that it's required now? sure. but between ea, ubisoft, steam, epic, and games own proprietary launchers i've grown numb. it needs to be cracked down on, definitely. but, eh."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,my only concern with this trend is that im nearly certain theyre going to lock it behind ps plus on pc later down the road.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,not true i already own the first game on steam and this is encouraging me not to buy a second one even though i wanted to
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"awhile back that was true for me. i'd jump through hoops to play games. these days there's tons of games i'm interested in playing that i've avoided buying because of bullshit like this. i've got a list of dozens of games right now that i would buy if they ever release a version without the bullshit attached, i pick up one or two a year when they relent but each year the list just grows bigger. this kind of thing might not stop most people but i have a fairly large list of games i'm interested in so it's pretty easy to just add this to a list and not buy it while it has this requirement."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"lots of people can't play it, actually."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it wont stop me cause i can assure you the high seas dont include it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i deleted every sony game from my steam wishlist after the helldivers incident. i was gonna buy a bunch of them the next time they went on sale. not everyone doesn't care.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,is it going to stop me from playing a game actually it will once the servers are down at sonys whim
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yeah a mild inconvenience until sony gets hacked again and your steam account data gets stolen. just a small inconvenience. a tiny inconvenience.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,some of the people mad about it are probably living in a country where psn is blocked. they cant even buy the game so that would warrant the anger.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"exactly. i'm so fucking hype for this game, i genuinely don't care that i'll have to make another account. i completely understood the helldivers backlash, since they tried to change it after the game was live and would brick it for many players. but if this is the route they want to take at least they're setting expectations ahead of time."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it's a great game. i bought a ps5 to play it. the exclusivity works.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"honestly i'd get annoyed if i had to do something like pay for psn or they left steam and tried to make their own store front or something. i've had a psn account already for years. i have no interest in any psn game game though. maybe ghost of tsushima when it's like 10 in a few years lol. it's still pretty stupid that they require a psn account for a single player game. if it's some always online for single player games bullshit, i wouldn't think less of people who get it through other means"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"well the game isnt even on my store, so i cant even complain about a mild inconvenience. i have the first god of war in my library and now i cant get the second. fuck snoy."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"wheee i am the 1. just built a new pc to handle modern games and just finished cyberpunk looking for the next game. god of war was on the list, so i'm either skipping it or pirating in protest. also currently skipping elden ring due to no ultra wide support unless you download a mod, which means you can't play online.... oh well."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"no it doesnt stop me from playing it, ill just choose to pirate it instead"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"so if you look at the helldivers fiasco, you'll see that there's over 100 regions where people cannot make a psn account. hence the controversy for helldivers  why a lot of people are mad because they'd like to buy it but you're violating sony's tos. oh but also their customer service dept were telling people to violate and how to violate the tos to make psn accounts for helldivers. it's not a matter of it being inconvenient, it's a matter of this being greedy, not beneficial to the consumer but lets sony brag to investors while harvesting as much data as they can. but also sony having several data breaches over the last 7 years."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the issue with helldivers 2 was that the psn requirement was dropped from the game early albeit they said temporarily and sold in countries they shouldn't have. so people lost access. obviously everyone hates third party launchers. but it's no worse than any other.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it is not mild inconvenience the main problem is, sony are making an offline game require internet access."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ah yes, the ignorant user. of course those who can play it will play it. the other 100 countries literally locked out from playing wont."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"social media easily leads people into this false sense that this is what everyone thinks because you don't realize that a post with 1,000 users commenting is 0.000003 of the us population. in addition, most comments are by crazy people who think they are right about everything."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"reddit is also inherently flawed by design enabling it to be an echo chamber. users will upvote what they want to hear and downvote hard to swallow truths. the gross misuse of downvotes sucks. theyre supposed to be used when someone makes a shitty comment that doesnt add anything of substance, not for disagreeing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"on the other hand, if nobody complains, it never gets fixed. it's like arguing that the people protesting x government action should just stfu because nobody but them cares. in truth, nobody but them cares yet."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"if you haven't been using reddit for that long and already had your own gaming opinions it's really obvious. here's a fun example around the 2010s i mostly followed french media on video games, and call of duty quickly gained a reputation of being a scam, with its overpriced map packs, very short campaign, releases that were just the previous game with 3 hours of new campaign... it peaked at some point where if you typed call of on steam the first suggestion would be call of pigeon pigeon in french is also used to call someone gulliblestupid. yet if you mention call of duty on reddit, how likely are you to have everyone go on a rant about you and your shit games? the point is that even if there was a really big gaming community opposed to the game, there were millions of people just buying it. and the opposition was such a minority that it's all but forgotten a decade later. boycotts are irrelevant, most people live outside of gaming communities or will just buy anyway. and whatever was outrageous at the time, millions have grown with it thinking it was normal. and in fact, it also applies to whoever thinks they're superior or above that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"no. people just like the drama, they like to act all righteous on the internet for upvotes. is a fake endorphin release. you say something righteous, get upvotes and endorphins are released. i'd bet that 99.99 of redditors would made an account on the nazi party if they released a game they'd like to play."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,especially when there is no sony launcher. smh
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"if sony thought it was profitable enough to sell in those regions they would, they aren't avoiding those regions out of malice."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the gaming market in those countries is incredibly small which is why they are not supported. the money it would take to operate in them has not been worth it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you really need an s after your comment, or people will think youre being serious."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"nobody has to pirate anything lol and i am part of crackwatch,but lets not pretend a game is a basic need"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i said the game will still sell well. i didn't state my opinion on if i think its a big issue or not. ghost of tsushima was also region locked and still sold incredibly well.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,what? steam was actually giving out refunds lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,no they don't. psn customer data hasn't been breached since 2011.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,ghost of tsushima sold incredibly well on steam.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i probably am i try to avoid anything that requires constant accounts mainly for this very reason. a better way i should ask it is why is everyone hyperbole i mean majority just okay with it? ignoring regular consumers not quite understanding the implications behind all the accounts it's still just consistently annoying to deal with i'd think ever for a regular consumer
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"this is why i adblock. if this system is unavoidable, then the least i can do is tear a hole in their coin purse on the way through. at the device level, and the dns level."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"this is the thing that really pisses me off. if they want my data they should pay me for it. instead, they are trying to have it both ways  the service is offered free of charge, but at the same time they claim you're exchanging data for access. really, it's the first one  the service is free of charge, and in the fine print they hide a second transaction where you give up your data free of charge. this is done to deceive and prevent users from making a fair value assessment. it should be a crime. the data brokerage industry is a 400bn industry. there are 8bn people in the world. if we assume everyone is online and everyone has data of equal value both are not true, that means a person's data is worth at a minimum 50 per year on the market."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"sony can fix this in as little as two steps, so they're just being lazy fucks over it. selling in these regions isn't even their jurisdiction on pc, that's entirely on steam."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"except that sony can, at any time, change the tos to allow non officially supported regions to set within ones that are when making accounts. or also allow vpns for it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"its always been a playstation exclusive.the entire franchise is. this is standard practice for sony now, release a game first in playstation and wait 2 years for the pc release. the first god of war released for pc was to get people tempted to buy a ps5 for the sequel that was announced a couple of months later and not wait 2 years for the sequel.they almost got me but the lack of kbm support put me off otherwise id have got it for gow and hfw. the same thing happened with horizon forbidden dawn and will keep happening as this seems like a solid strategy they are happy with."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it's a singleplayer game with no online functionality, there is no reason at all to force people into creatinglogin in with yet another account. with helldivers 2 those functional reasons existed, and if sony knew what they did they would have sold it as steampsn integration like they used to do with portal 2, as offering actual new functionality that's a plus for the user. instead, they make this a pointless, and reputation damaging, exercise of you do what we want you to do, even tho there's nothing in it for you! trying to turn the whole customerbusiness dynamic on its head."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"sure, pirating is primarily a 'redditor thing'"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"what is it with people like you who clearly spend a lot of time on reddit thinking redditors are other people. dude you have 10k comment karma, you are a redditor."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,always online and account sign in drms on single player games are utterly ineffective and haven't worked since almost forever. denuovo is just about the only thing that can currently keep games from getting cracked for an extended period of time and even that is overcome eventually.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yeah, piracy is going to be compromised after 40 years of existence."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you know what's the funniest thing? in restricted countries, the dlc shows up on the store page the digital deluxe edition upgrade, soundtrack and artbook, but the game itself doesn't. there isn't even the this content requires insert game to play prompt."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"in most countries. 177 countries are banned from buying the game on steam. thanks sony. and everyone blaming helldivers 2 community for this, i wish you a very pleasant fall on a rope."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"after i bought helldivers 2 and they lied about it, i will never trust sony ever again. i will just pirate every one of their games until they can prove themselves actually trustworthy. when random scene groups are more trustworthy than your mega corp you know you have a problem."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,so?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yarrrr!!!!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"what is this stockholm syndrome like bullshit? in most discussions on this sub people are very quick to complain about how gamers don't take consumer rights seriously enough, they keep buying everything, that's why too much gaming is just gambling. yet whenever there is backlash against such anticonsumer practices, people belittle it and act like we shouldn't inconvenience our benevolent corporate overlords, or they might stop trying to sell us things."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,no pirating is extremely easy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it's cheaper  hence the reason for pirating.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"is it not arguably more of a hassle to pirate something than it is to just make an account? not if the game is not even aviable for purchase in your region, because your region is not aviable during account creation. so even if you create a psn account using a different region, you would still not be able to purchase the game on steam as steam does not sell the game in the regions not supported by psn. so the only way you can play the game on pc is to pirate it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i can have all the files for the game, for free, with literally 2 clicks, game launched in 5. and not support the shitty practice."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,such a 1990 post
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,my ps5 neglects to run modern games at 1440p 60fps lmao
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,name one sony game on pc that has denuvo
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,fairly sure no playstation exclusives to pc have had denuvo yet.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,empress has gotten around them pretty fast before. who knows? it's hit or miss whether someone is crazy enough and smart enough to crack it fast.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"every company tried that on pc. steam still reigns. ps studios could do that but they could only do that if they undercut steam prices and then, steam users are waiting machines, we waited 4 years for got and a few years because kingdomhaerts was exclusive to epic iirc. besides, if that doesnt work, we sail the seas"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"and they were actually cool with that up until the helldivers thing. arrowhead delayed the psn requirement to help launch and sony was fine with it, and stuff like ghost of tsushima was going to release single player but multi wasnt going to work without one and it said so on the steam preorder page. then helldivers happened, sony is reacting by making these games unavailable in those countries completely, and making psn mandatory. but people did ask for transparency, and theyre getting it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,they are more than likely working to resolve that but the reason the other regions aren't supported is because the gaming market in those regions is so small and a fraction of the people that actually buy video games sony used to just tell people to sign up in another region if yours isn't listed. after the backlash it was forced to be removed and not sold in those regions. millions of people have been signing up for psn in unsupported regions since psn came into existence 18 years ago
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,those 70 countries sales combined just arent big enough to matter
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"number of countries is just as disingenuous tbh, given that the 70 includes the vast majority of north america, south america, asia, middle east and so on. really just parts of africa and asia missing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,but your own link literally says they are allowed to create psn accounts...? that's all you need in order to link it to your steam game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,game dev have no obligation to sell their game in all countries after all. tons of games are only available in japan and no one are crying in internet for it..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,anyone in those 120 countries can easily sign up for a free psn account by simply saying they're in any supported country. i'm so confused that people act like this psn thing is some insurmountable barrier. you don't even need a vpn. sony will just take your word for it that you're from wherever you pick.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i dont get why we cant have it in the baltics, but literally 200km from me, the poles can use it. same with xbox."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,now do it by population
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"id love a breakdown by percentage of how many people who have access to video games are in each of those countries cuz theres definitely way better things to focus on for those people than whether or not they can play helldivers or god of war. we could be helping them to change the law in their countries, for one, or help them get better infrastructure or something literally anything thats actually important. but instead, everyone wants to focus on the playstation thing so maybe theres more gamers in those countries than i thought"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"if sony had opened up account creation to every legal country they could and had a note saying account will not work on playstation consoles due to unsupported regions, people would have been fine with it people were upset about registering, full stop. it was never about what countries were officially supported. that's why the protests stopped on helldivers even though the game sales are restricted. psn works unofficially in unsupported countries. you don't even need a vpn. you just have to choose a supported country to be your home. technically this is against the rules, but sony isn't interested in enforcing it  they just don't want to be subjected to any given country's legal jurisdiction. if people sneak onto psn, that's fine by them. the helldivers protests forced them to end pc sales in those countries because they couldn't exactly claim at that point that they had no idea people buying the pc game in those countries were using psn while selling the game to them directly."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"what really pisses me off as someone who moved to one of those unsupported countries, is i already have the fucking psn account but they still won't sell to me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the issue only started occurring like a month ago. this isn't something they can just do in a short amount of time. they are a large corporation and policy change like this can take months
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,totally agree. its a fucking single player game. does it cloud save to your ps5? if not gtfo
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the problem is that whule creating an account outside your region hasn't been an issue, it is against sony's own tos. they could theoretically axe your account never have, probably never will, but the possibility exists for creating it in a different country. you open yourself up to potentially lose access to hundreds of dollars of products by doing something sony themselves have encouraged. it's stupid"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,then why don't people freak out over every other account they have to make the same way?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,they want your data
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ill take that seriously when yall stop being hypocrites and go protest against ea, activisionblizzard, rockstar, ubisoft which all require their launcher and account. wait, those companies have millions of players all together? hypocrites"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it was required at launch but the developers disabled it to free up server load after they had tech issues with the amount of players
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,third world countries like latvia and lithuania apparently arent good enough for psn
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,hey may i ask how you got locked out of hd2? my friend from egypt is in an unsupported region but hes still able to access hd2 fine. maybe steam might be able to help since you should still be able to play.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i'm from an unsupported country and i played a few missions in hd2 steam today.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"non issue? the problem here is not the psn account, it's that the game is not even available to buy on steam for the people in those countries"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,game isnt sold to those regions so your point?

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"so if you going to need an additional steam account in future to play your games, you wouldnt be asking questions? imagine a portal remaster that also gets released on consoles. a single player game, but you need to stay online and have to login to steam for it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,like... steam?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,boohoo. don't buy it then.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"but i don't want to make one for a single player game. there is clearly no need, they just want to steal data. so piracy it is."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yeah, i mean it's not like we have a choice  the steam page wouldn't even show up in our region and i wouldn't even risk using a vpn as that might get my account banned because it could be construed i'm gaming the regional pricing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,you have a point there so they are just being dumb. that's even worse.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,all of them. everyone gets hacked.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"as someone who is literally a cybersecurity expert, all of them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"over 100 countries where its not available, im well aware. but the issue then should be why is psn not available in those countries. not why is sony making their exclusive game require a sony account edit dont get me wrong, it sucks for those who want to play the game but cant because they cant get a psn account. my point was that the fact that theres an account requirement shouldnt surprise anyone so its not really news."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"im worried about this, will psn function as a drm?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"well you were able to buy got before in those countries and there was a warning on the steam page that the multiplayer wouldnt work without psn. after the helldivers shit show they delisted the game in those countries. theyve obviously decided theyre happier not risking that twice so now even the single player isnt available there, and neither is ragnarok. is anybody shocked? after all those memes about winning against sony and the death threats and the review bombing? now their games are available in psn capable regions only, and require psn online or no."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you may not be able to buy it, however there will be a way you can play it. if you don't mind piracy that is"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it's 2024 i'm confident most people know what a vpn is and they're extremely widely available. region locking just doesn't matter in this day and age buddy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i think you missed the discourse over the outcome of the hd issue. people got around that just fine for years. people, who weren't even affected by that issue, quite possibly ruined it for people in those countries by making sony consider fully region locking games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,did you miss the part where sony support themselves tells these people to just select the closest supported country at account creation and that not a single person has ever been banned for this specific thing in the entirety of psns existence?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"this, and investorboard optics. by forcing psn integration, the suits can point at the numbers going up to show growth and bolster investor confidence, or some shit. this whole thing is just corporate slop, and it's distressing how many people are defending it under this post."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,so they can lose this data instead of pay telemetry in their next data breach
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-02,just in time for their next big data breach!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,they can still do data collection just fine.... without a psn login...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,exactly this. i imagine they will go all in on a pc store next year and why wouldn't they? saves them the 30 steam takes.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-16,its hard to put up with all this invasion and login into shit and capitalism ruining fuckin gaming like its ruining everything
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it's not the people don't understand it's like they don't like it and it's ridiculous.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,that sounds like an optional feature to me!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i booted up master chief collection on my steam deck and had to create a microsoft account before i could even get to the main menu. entered my new microsoft account details and it said i wasn't eligible. looked it up and you have to separately create an xbox account within your microsoft account first. it was very annoying. sony's process is at least a lot easier than that mess.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"everyone i know hates dealing with ea's launchers, hates dealing with ubisoft's launchers, and hates dealing with microsoft integration because it causes at least to me and my friends a number of personal headaches dealing with their garbage coding. it never stopped being something we hate, it just became something we begrudgingly dealt with. sony is catching shit now because if i remember right previous sony pc releases like spiderman didn't necessarily require this, so they were hoping it would generally stay that way, but ever since the helldivers 2 fiasco this is.... well. y'know. more in the limelight."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yep. need an ubisoft account to play assassins creed, need a rockstar account to play gta5, need an ea account to play mass effect, etc.  plenty of examples even with single player titles."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"to be fair i've hated it with every other company too. makes playing ubisoft and other games on the steam deck a pain, i often have issues with the nonnative launchers."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"sony's account is the only one that isn't available in over 100 countries. seriously, if they didn't have such absurd region locks people probably wouldn't care. most people, anyway."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"rockstar has absolutely caught shit with their launcher not working most of the time. i still need to do some shenanigans to get the rdr2 drm software to realize that my pc is infact powered on, it's ridiculous."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"tbf pc gamers have always hated ea origins, uplay etc it sucks to buy a game off of steam and have to use another different online service just to play a game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"because it was made clear retroactively. i dont blame sony here, even if i'd rather not do it and i already have a psn account."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-02,so does that mean i need a microsoft account to play hifi rush? if so fuck that
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-02,"because sony is the only one region locking the access to their games on pc, i can purchase and play any of the microsoft, ea, ubisoft... games, but not sony's"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"my only issue was that helldiver's made it look like it was going to be optional, but that had been a lie. i didn't care as long as stuff like that is upfront."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"because they recently caught shit for it when they made the requirement announcement for helldivers 2, and that's still fresh in people's minds. that said, the situation here is different. in the helldivers 2 case, at launch they were selling the game in regions that psn isn't available in and effectively threatening to remove access to the game to everyone who didn't link a psn account four months after they had already purchased the game. that's pretty much the definition of bait and switch. some people say it was always a requirement from the start, but if it was then they wouldn't have sold the game in those regions in the first place so i don't buy that. that put the players who purchased the game in those regions in a very shitty situation they wouldn't be able to play the game they bought without a psn account, but they couldn't create a psn account in the region they lived in even though they were sold the game in that region. so they would have to make a fake psn account in a region that psn was allowed in to link the game to, but that goes against sony's tos and they could have access to the game they bought revoked as a result of doing that. it was a very shortsighted comedy of errors on sony's part and would have been a incredibly scummy thing to do to their playerbase if they had plowed forward with it. this situation is not the same as that. i'm not a fan of having to submit thirdparty data to literally every company to use their products because of personal reasons, but in this case they're making that info readily apparent up front instead of dropping it like a 500kg stratagem on the playerbase after they already bought the game. it's less bad in this case because the choice is up front. edit funny that i'm getting downvotes for roughly explaining why the helldivers 2 situation isn't the same as this."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"thats a live service game, not singleplayer"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,most pc gamers use windows and already have a ms account
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,need an online account to play an online multiplayer game. need an online account to play a singleplayer game. and you are baffled as to why one imposition is seen as more reasonable than the other?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the others have already caught shit by the gamer community. it's sony's turn as they've done the most recent thing. everyone already hates microsoft and ubisoft and whoever else
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"cause in this essence they apparently have the worst network system out of all of them somehow, even worse than nintendo it turns out."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"sony is catching shit for changing things after purchase. for saying to a bunch of people who purchased a game you will no longer be able to play due to the country you live in for no technical or actual legal reason. making nonsensical and technically impossible claims for the reasoning. for having multiple huge security breaches of user data in the past. for being a console only service and pushing their login. for geolocking sales of a single player game rather than allowing people in regions without psn to simply not log in. honestly, while i assume unintentionally, your response is just whataboutism. other companies doing bad practices doesn't make sony doing something bad or worse any less bad."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"because sony has limited availability, excluding most of the countries in the world. other launchers don't have such trivial limitations. and it should be shamed for not being available even in the entirety of europe."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,microsoft didn't block you from buying the game did it?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"there are regions were you cant make a psn account, making this game unplayable for them."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why are you defending a multi billion company like its a person that gives a shit about anything other than money..?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"its a playstation game its expected. since all of their other games don't need a psn account, no, this isn't expected."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,how much is sony paying you? or are you the multi billion company's little bitch for free?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yeah. and creating an account to use steam is also bad. reddit too. there should be no accounts at all. s
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,because there's no benefit to the consumer. because it was added 3 months after the fact. it was 'required' from the very start but there was nothing to actually stop and ask people. so 3 months after the fact customers found they were not going to be able to play the game they paid for because sony was selling the game in over 100 regions where you cannot create a psn account. sony was then telling people how to bypass their own tos to create a tos account while telling everyone the psn requirement was there to help security. people then pointed out everything sony said was to help customers? exists on steam already and there was no benefit to this other than sony gets to boast to investors about the uptick in psn accounts and data collection. also sony had several data breaches over the last 7 years so no one trusts them with their data.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"also, some countries don't have access to psn. and particularly in helldivers' case, those same countries had access to helldivers. so sony basically kicked them off their own games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,because it didn't require it when it got released.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"they're gating access to a game that you bought. and at any point in the future, they can shut the servers down and lock you out of the game you paid for."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"because it's just there to harvest user data. they even require you to provide personal identity documents to make a psn account in the uk and ireland, which they pinkiepromise they won't retain to make the data they totally don't sell more valuable."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i don't play any of these games why do we care about helldivers requiring a psn account? because creating a psn account is not available for the majority of the world. so many people who bought it, were not able to legally without breaking tos play it. this is why helldivers and all other games requiring a psn account have been delisted on steam in the majority of the world."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"because they didnt enforce that requirement until people bought it and couldnt request refunds, the arbitrarily added it back in. having this from release is fine, otherwise please feel free to delete call of duty, and every ea or ubisoft game. i dont like accounts being needed for everything, but its whiney and hypocritical to suddenly care now."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"if people over at helldivers didn't kick up a fuss sony would have continued to turn a blind eye to the workarounds like they had done for 20 years, you can thank the fine people over there for making them unable to carry on doing that. of course now they got theirs all those 180 countries are no longer useful to them so they have stopped pretending like they care."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,isn't that the whole issue? at least what i understood....that people who have bought the game helldivers 2 in regions which didn't have psn couldn't play the game. but genuine question....can you just create an account under say usa if you live in a country that doesn't support psn? i have no idea.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,congrats! you are completely morally justified to pirate it

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"valve and helldivers players forced it to happen after people lost their minds over a psn account for helldivers. sony has never cared about people in unsupported regions making accounts in another regions. millions did it for decades without issues and that was how people in unsupported regions played on playstation and then the helldivers thing happened and people freaked out and was forced to be removed from unsupported regions even though sony was initially selling the game there and the regions that aren't supported the gaming market is tiny, many complaining aren't even from those unsupported regions"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,blame the people who kicked up a stink over helldivers requiring psn forcing sony to remove unsupported regions. i have 5 psn accounts myself across multiple regions sony didn't care about tos until the helldivers community rioted over it forcing them to do something about it on steam.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,there are a fair amount of people who love to complain about it even though all they have to do is set up an account. so many games require account linking that their complaints are petty. people in your situation are really the only ones with a legitimate reason to be upset.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,most likely wont stop you from buying. playing is a completely different thing...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,same thing. i'm not buying ps games on steam because i'm mad but because sony has blocked my region
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,blame the crybaby redditors that made a huge deal about it. just like playstation games anyone in an unsupported region could just lie about their region.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i can tell you dont really read steam reviews on ubisoft games, or visit the steam forums, or read reddit comments on pc specific forums about their games. its actually very hard not finding it mentioned in some form. thing is, theyve been doing this for years so it may not be as loud. sony had set a precedent of not requiring that stuff, now presumably future games wont be playable offline nor on the steam deck their overlay doesnt work on deck. as someone who plays primarily on the deck away from internet these days, its not just some minor inconvenience to me. its a literal roadblock to playing their games and it genuinely feels bad to see them do this."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i think the reason sony gets a heavier backlash now because after the drama in helldivers 2 people realised how small the list of regions that have access to psn is compared to other companies
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why are people missing the fact that people in 180 countries can't buy the game?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the psn account problem wasis a major problem because they were selling helldivers 2 for 3 months without the requirement they stated they did require it, but there wasn't anything stopping you for 3 months. so 3 months later  whoops, actually there's over 100 countries that cannot play this game that we were actively selling this game to. welp we'll just revolk access to it or we'll tell customers how to violate our tos so they can keep playing the game they bought. so now with their latest games requiring this, there's no consumer benefit so people are obviously mad about that. but also sony has had several data breaches over the years and they've made headlines about how much of a problem it is and how they've been warned and done nothing about it. so sign up for a psn account, we might leak all your personal data but at least you can play god of war, ghost of tshushima and such! there have been plenty of outrage posts on eaubisoft, you not seeing it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. go to the steam deck sub and see people trying to play the games they legitimately bought but they can't play because they're on an airplane or the internet crapped out while they're not home. there's plenty of people pissed off and if you don't believe it? ea has just started removing ea play requirements for their games because of the problems it's caused with the deck and just how shit ea play has become. ubisoft, is ubisoft so they'll die on their shitty drm hill before they change anything like they've been doing for the last 10 years"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ea and ubisoft have required bullshit launchers for years, if you want to see the backlash you have to look at older releases as people are now expecting it and only slightly grumble. sony demanding accounts is new and therefore gets backlash as that's the time to be vocal if you want change. it won't change and people will have to accept or go without just like they do with ea and ubisoft but this is a new standard so it gets more attention."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"have been complaining about mandatory account signups for this for every single game company of significance, and for a million other consumer products. such a bizarre defense to other companies do bad things so stop complaining about sony. are you just some kind of partisan sony fan or something? wrong no matter who does it and it should be called out no matter who does it. the issue is not that there's some double standard the issue is that these tactics are inherently anticonsumer. people complain like crazy when walmart got rid of guest to check out, there's plenty of outrage to go around."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"why isn't there an outrage posts every time ea or ubisoft release a new game that requires an account? it's not really a question, because we all know why, but the big question is why isn't there outrage over how much stuff you need a steam account for? i guess it's okay if you started demanding an account two decades ago, but if you want to do it now then it's wrong?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,with ubisoft and ea it's more like quiet resignation. a lot of gamers have given up on both companies already. what was the last game either company put out that you enjoyed playing? my answers ubisoft  assassin's creed origins and far cry  primal. ea  dungeon keeper 2.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"and then they'll sign up for the next account like it's no problem. why isn't there an outrage posts every time ea or ubisoft release a new game that requires an account? simple. ubisoft and ea games are not regionlocked in as many countries, unlike the psn account."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,no one was ever fucked out of the game. if you bought the game you could keep playing it. this is now happening months before the game releases and people are still acting outraged
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,sony did for decades on playstation by having people sign up using another regions and millions did and sony never cared. then the shit with helldivers happened and people lost their minds and the games were forced off the steam in those unsupported regions

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,people like to conveniently ignore this part. sony could make the changes to their tos but choose not to. yet it's the players fault somehow?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"are you telling me you never buy a sony game, a ubisoft game, an ea game etc? there are so many companies that demands an account to access their games, online or not, it can hardly be surprising that a company focused mostly on making games to their gamesplatform, requires an account to that platform now that they're branching out, when most of the major players that it is now entering competition with, has been practising the same tactics for years?"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i'm talking about the ps games. they released their games with no drm so far. if anything it's sony's loss for doing this, but people who talk can't buy the game because psn stuff i'm afraid this will leads to drm into their game. maybe i'm putting my tin foil hat but the outcry for helldivers 2 made sony dropping all non psn region of its service."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"not all games are available in all regions, and that's been a thing for a long time. but yeah, sure, people totally care for real, and just decided not to say anything about it until now. that makes sense..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,they dont. they use vpn to get what they want. thats the end of the story.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why arent you still made about helldivers 2?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,they dont. they cant afford new games and dont want to admit it so they pivot to something else

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,got was region locked and sold very well. the people pretending to care on the internet don't really mean anything
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,presumably not a thing where you live.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i mean the general backlash was that helldivers tried to make this change after being sold in regions psn didnt support. ghosts of tsushima was also available in those regions for preorder until some clarification came. its understandable that people get upset by this requirement. at least this time its clear and obvious ahead of time
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i along with many other people won't. i certainly won't lose any sleep over distinctly average sony games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,and that was pretty stupid too. but at least that was only required for the coop mode.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"but you have an interest in the game, don't you? money is not an issue, nor is the availability of psn, both of which i would consider fair reasons for piracy. i do find it interesting that you have concern over the stealing of data, however we are currently communicating on a website who is partly funded by selling and stealing data, as both of our posts are currently being used to help flesh out llms like chatgpt. is this not also exactly the same kind of redline but in a different context?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the other issue is that it is beyond stupid and anticonsumer to require a psn account for a singleplayer only game on epic and steam.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yep. the helldivers won the battle to get rid of psn requirement for their game. but lost the war for everyone else.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"you do realize that companies have ways to block vpn. if your ip belongs to a range that data centers use rather than residential address, you can be flagged and blocked. this is how netflix, steam, and other companies defeat vpn bypass. it's 2024 i'm confident most people know what a vpn is i don't bother with vpn. i live in a country where vpn doesn't matter and it's just another utility i have to pay for like internet, electricity, water. my finances are way too overstretched as it is from this recession and i don't want to pay for another recurring subscription."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"maybe sony should have thought about improving psn availability before clamping down on psn access hard. if i was a shareholder, i would absolutely scorn sony for this because it limits their reach."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it doesnt matter what sony support says. the terms of use state you cant create an account outside the country you live in or provide incorrect country when creating the account. they realized they fucked up not restricting sales to countries with psn which is why they backed down on helldivers

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"i keep seeing people post this, but just having a higher count of psn users doesn't make any sense to me on its own. what purpose would the number of free user accounts serve a company who produces so many tangible products? it's not like it's twitter or facebook where the number of active users is directly tied to potential revenue. sony makes high end electronics in most categories, publishes video games, runs a very successful movie  tv production studio, and runs the 2nd largest music production company on the planet. the amount of psn really doesn't seem like something that would affect how sony is perceived. the only thing that makes any sense to me is if they're going to make a play to start selling their pc games directly from the psn store in the near future, and if people who have been buying their pc games already have an account it won't be much if a barrier anymore. god help us if they make yet another launcher"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it will cost them a ton of money to before that extra 30 turns a profit.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"and a good one at that! no one cares if this shit were optional with benefits to users if you decide to opt in. the issue is it's both forced, and offers nothing in return."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,there's a reason why i stopped buying singleplayer games on pc from certain companies  because buying isn't owning anymore.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"assassin's creed is also single player, but you still need a ubi account"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,plenty of single player games require accounts from other companies.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-02,i would assume that any of the transplant games that came to playstation require you to login with a microsoft account but ive only played sea of thieves so im not certain. this feels like the trade off that these companies are making in order to host their games on other platforms. everyone for instance needs a playstation account to play on playstation 5 so the integration for their games is more seamless. same with xbox i assume. to put them in steam this would be their move as well.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"some people say it was always a requirement from the start, but if it was then they wouldn't have sold the game in those regions in the first place so i don't buy that. if it was a requirement from the start and they didn't enforce it, that honestly in my non legal opinion makes an ever stronger case for fraud or some other violation of the law. i feel like any judge or jury would hear oh well we always intended to make this required locking out people in those countries put together with selling in those countries on day 1 and be whatever the legalize is for unamused. edit i also can't stand all of the but it doesnt impact youme. well i play with people all over the world in various games so it almost certainly would but more importantly i can stand up and say something is wrong when it doesn't impact me in the slightest directly, thats like basic how to be a functional human being in society and if people can do it over something low stakes as in low personal risk i have no faith they ever do."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,there are numerous examples of needing an account to play single player games. ea and ubisoft have required it for a while and never caught this much hate for it. the only legitimate complaint ive seen is that players who cant get into psn because of country restrictions cant play. a psn account is free. if you dont want to make one thats fine but this is such a ridiculous thing to complain about.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,this is not true. my main is a pc but i have a switch and ps45 . i have never had any problems with psn except for it being down for maintenance maybe twice or thrice a year. nintendo online on the other hand is absolute garbage.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"you will no longer be able to play due to the country you live in they reverted that for helldivers 2, anyone who purchased it can keep playing it now. for having multiple huge security breaches of user data in the past. their last psn breach was in 2011. the same year steam had a similar data beach. for geolocking sales of a single player game rather than allowing people in regions without psn to simply not log in. they are literally not selling it there. you can't exactly complain about that because someone doesn't provide you with the service in a unsupported region. this isnt like the helldiver situation where the outrage was justified. here they are refusing service since the start rather than a bait and switch. note that i do not support always online for single player game, but most of your points just stem from misinformation."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you can make a psn account for a different region, ppl do it all the time. stop parroting shit you hear on reddit jesus fucking christ"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yeah, it's clearly a new mandate from them to boost psn numbers. like, i get the reasoning from a business perspective. they figure if you're gonna start buying their games elsewhere and not their console, they'd at least like to use you for their psn headcount for advertisers, shareholders, publishers, etc. from a consumer standpoint, it's not the worth thing in the world but it's definitely a little annoying."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i just dont care for account requirements its a standard practice and has been for years. the time for putting a stop to that has long gone. microsoft require an account, ubisoft require an account, ea, rockstar too and the list keeps going on. the bitching will do nothing just like it did for helldivers 2. western gamers and people from supported regions just screwed over the unsupported regions by trying to weaponise them. making sure they can no longer buy the game and use the workaround they have been using for years now of signing up for a psn account from a supported region."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"people that are bitching about an account requirement calling others bitches top kek. i just dont care about account requirements because its a standard practice and isnt going away, that time passed a long time ago. xbox requires an account, ubisoft requires an account, ea, rockstar too and the list goes on and on. the bitching about an account will do absolutely nothing and especially any good. look at the helldivers 2 situation. western gamers and people from supported regions screwed over the regions that couldnt officially make an account. they tried to weaponise that fact so now they can no longer buy the game and sign up for psn from a supported region like they had been doing for years prior."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the 'having to create a psn account' argument is still bs. what difference does it make being forced to create an account to use a launcher like steam, ea, ubisoft connect etc, and being forced to create one inside a game? either way your data is at the mercy of these megacorps. there are benefits to the consumer having achievements sync across platforms is one. cross platform cloud saves are said to be coming too. whether these matter or not is subjective. you may not care about these benefits, but others do. the only valid argument here is if you bought the game and then was locked out after the fact because of regional availability. but that's only if you weren't granted a refund."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you mean like what just happened with redfall, and what happened with a bunch of older multiplayer games? there are tons of games in my library whose multiplayer modes no longer work because their servers were shut down. that's just how it is. servers cost money, and games can reach a point where there is not enough income to justify keeping the servers running. your argument is valid if you weren't able to get a refund. steam has been giving people refunds even if they had hours in the game and were way past the return window."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,unfortunately that's uk law now.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"its pretty shitty, but sadly also uk laws to blame not just sony. all that fearmongering about kids accessing porn by lying their age finally got through over there."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,a lot of the 180 countries are tiny islands not recognised as countries.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,how can sony sell data if it keeps getting leaked?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you actually cant access the steam page for the game at all. you'd have to use a vpn to switch your steam region in order to buy it and play it, but doing that will get your steam account banned. its extremely difficult to buy the game on steam right now, i think you can get it from those key sites and add it to your steam that way, but you still have to make a psn account with a different region on it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you yse to be able to do create an psn account and say you where usa. and sony would look the other way. but after the helldivers debacle, you can no longer even buy the game outside of supported regions."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"there have been comments and posts which thank the helldivers 2 community for their effort in excluding their country, which previously had no problem with buying and playing psn games if they used a neighbor country as account."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"this is allegedly against the sony psn terms of service. the thing is that since you cannot change the country associated with your account, anyone who ever moves to another country will lose all their content digital purchases, psn free games accumulated over the years, friend list, saved game data, trophies, etc. even more puzzling is that 1 ps games are not region locked and haven't been since ps3 and 2 nintendo, microsoft, and valve all allow their users to update their country of residence. edit not sure why this is being downvoted? did sony update their tos recently?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,by passing region restrictions is a breach of tos at minimum and that can get you a ban. but it is also illegal in some instances. gamers arnt known for giving much of a care about the legality of things they view as nonsensical. but yeah... no one should have to break the law to play a game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"no, against everybody's tos saying you are from where you are not or using vpns."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,but genuine question....can you just create an account under say usa if you live in a country that doesn't support psn? i have no idea you can but you are immediately in violation of eulatos and you can be banned at basically anytime for just wanting to play a video game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yes, those players in unsupported regions have been playing on psn for over a decade just fine by using this workaround, only recently are they actually having problems and this is because people threw a shit fit over having to add one more account to their list of 10 accounts they already had. and so those players in unsupported regions are now suffering for this weird ass crusade."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i thiiiiink the whole deal was that you can do that, but it breaks the playstation terms of service. and when people from those countries asked playstation reps what to do, they said to just basically do what you said. and people were like that literally breaks your own tos. and the reps were like nah its fine. so people were doubly pissed that the company was telling them to violate their own terms of service as the fix instead of justnot making them make an account."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,apex legends is actually officially supported in fewer countries than psn is in.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"xbox also doesn't care about people in unsupported regions. i didn't get the 3 year warranty extension for the xbox 360. nintendo also doesn't care. if you bought your switch in unsupported region, you would have to ship it to the nearest supported country to get joycons fixed, shipping at your cost of course"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i think steam removed it because they got tired from the constant complains and maybe a possibility of a lawsuit for selling games that they can't play as they can't make the required account to play the game. and sellecting other region can also have it's drawback. as i remember many playstation users from countries neighbouring russia lost access to their games because they had selected russia as their region.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,snoy shills what are you a 5 year old console warrior?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"and the regions that aren't supported the gaming market is tiny, many complaining aren't even from those unsupported regions billions of people live in those regions."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"wait, so it was actually the complainers who delisted those countries and not sony? i thought sony called the shots and not reddit. good to know."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it's not the same situation though. first helldivers is an online game so a a community naturally builds around it. gow is entirely single player. further, the helldivers issue was basically a bait and switch. if they would have made clear from the very beginning that it would require a psn account, people wouldn't have been as upset. but that would also have hurt their sales. instead they waited until people were invested in the game and community and then tried to force them to use a psn account which obviously was met with a certain level of misgiving."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"because it was a ton of fucking idiots caring based off incorrect info and outrage headlines. nobody in those regions gave a shit, because it was old hat for them. but a bunch of americans with 5k steam machines got real upset!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"sony has never cared about people in unsupported regions making accounts in another regions. until they do, and start nuking accounts that violate their license agreements. netflix never cared about vpnusage until the rights holders demanded they prevented it, and the same can happen with sony."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,funny how every time someone points this out that it was an option they get mass downvoted. i tried explaining this when the account linking first came out and before any region was delisted and i was mass downvoted faster than i could have ever imagined. like 100 in under a minute. it's like a certain group don't want people to know this and just be outraged at sony instead
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"no. one. cares. what you mean to say, is you got shafted, and you don't care. don't project your beta mentality on the rest of us."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it's not really unethical  it's just a business decision. unethical would be selling the game first and then forcing psn and pocketing the money regardless.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,where are these threads? can you show me the ones with thousands of upvotes on this subreddit filled with outrage? they do not exist and those game sell way more than gow will on steam edit someone please link me a single outrage thread for any recent game that requires an account. any one at all...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i am wondering where the outrage thread are... and they don't get review bombed like got did on day one to the point where it was newsworthy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,not for every game that comes out that needs a ubisoft account... when was the last time there was an outrage thread for that?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,but they release very popular games all the time without backlash for account requirements
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why isn't there outrage over how much stuff you need a steam account for? it's outrage over creating an additional account beyond whatever online store is used. people are fine with using a ubi account assuming they purchased from the ubi store. they want to have only one account for any particular game instead of an awkward daisy chain of multiple sign ins and launchers. i think people at the very least accept that you need an account in order to purchase a digital version of a game from an online store. so anything you can use the account for beyond that is a bonus that they won't really complain about.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i mean x defiant just came out, no one lost their minds over it needing an account or an entire launcher"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"given that it's a single player game there is zero reason to add this useless drm on top. then again, helldivers 2 didn't need it either and they walked that back after the outrage. there is precedent."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,you would have been fucked out of helldivers 2 on june 6th if you were in a country that didn't support psn and you'd bought it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"there is nothing wrong with psn, just its not needed for the steam ecosystem. that's what it was there for, it's own gaming service. psn only needs to exist for ps services within that ecosystem. you don't need that ecosystem within another ecosystem. this is why you see people especially steam deck users  admonish the use of another drm with the steam platform because it adds unnecessary bloat and steps to use said product that don't need to be there. there is literally no functional use to a singleplayer game, needing this restrictive function."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,you can easily lie about your country there. steam is a lot more complicated when it comes to changing your country and carries a higher risk of being banned for it imo.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"they are technically not available, no. even if a country has official sony store, or sony partenered retailers that sell ps consoles, they still don't have psn available in their country. which is required to even use the console with physical discs. sony have been reaping the benefits without 0 consequences, responsibility or investment and now their hands were forced to actually address the issue which they've handled in a spectacularly poor way so far."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"technicallt, it's all grey area. like they will literally tell you when you buy it that 1. sony does not care about your country 2. its regionlocked to a supported country, so you need to check it. in sea its usually hksg or something it works because its a physical disk or ps store, its a pain when theyre distributing it via steam for pc because steam has localized stores for their games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,you need to work within local laws and regulations which can be incredibly different between 2 country's and require reworking a lot of how you do things to fit for x place. data residency is a big one here and can cost a lot of money.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"are you telling me you never buy a sony game, a ubisoft game, an ea game etc? i haven't bought a ubisoft game in many years, same with ea games, i bought the pc port of gow last year because i wanted a nice couch game for my fancy new 4k tvgpu. as much as i enjoyed that, these recent moves by sony, in combination with some other drama, have made me real skeptical on buying the pc port of the second gow game, and even the spiderman 2 port.  there are so many companies that demands an account to access their games, online or not and they regularly get legitimate backlash for pointless alwaysonline nonsense and even offline drm from consumers and those who would love to become consumers, if things were just a tiny little bit different.  it can hardly be surprising that a company focused mostly on making games to their gamesplatform, requires an account to that platform now that they're branching out it can be very surprising that sony has to reinvent an already installed wheel, only to reattach it and try to sell that whole process in the shittiest way possible. that's also why i not really agree with your description of sony trying to branch out now, it already used to be in a pretty branches out position. because steampsn linking has been around for over a decade, it used to have real noticeable functionality behind it in the form of crossplay and shared friendlists across services. if the process of linking accounts doesn't offer any of such functionalityperks for the user, then it's a useless process that only exists to pad sony's data collectionmonetization department.  when most of the major players that it is now entering competition with, has been practising the same tactics for years? and they've been getting similar flak for it, but sony used to be in a real good position on this issue with a lot of help from valve, yet they managed to completely shit the bed and keep smearing themselves in that mess. if they had any sense they least of all would throw in some kind of free pc game for people being forced into creating a psn account, reintroduce more steampsn overlap and functionality. that's how to sell people on stuff like this you want something from them, you have to give something in return. while taking people's money, to then demand from them they do something other in your favor, is just very bad optics and pr."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,sony exclusives have been incredibly mid for the past 10 years. pretty much every single one that has been released has had a much better nonexclusive version released somewhere else. spiderman 2 on ps2 blows the new batman arkham spiderman games out of the water. sad when 20 year old games have better design than anything new.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,there was a big orange warning label next to the buy button that say psn was required. upon start up you are requested to make a psn account. it was always intended
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"valve responded to pilestadt arrowhead's thenceo via press release and said nope, steam is not blocking the sales anywhere and never has. it's solely at the discretion of the publisher to decide where to sell their game, which means any country restrictions are being determined solely by sony and always has been the case. steam was very quick to answer after arrowhead said that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"well the prompt you got on release to link your psn account was optional. most people did it for free skins from twitch streams too. it wasn't disabled until later. what is their mental gymnastics for selling to countries who then lost access when the mandatory link came in? that the steam page said it required psn and it was only temporarily optional? buyer's fault? cant blame steam for that one, since it would be the developer and publisher's responsibility to make sure it is delisted by the distributor. edit yall are insanely zealous. your opinions don't change facts."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,lol seriously. sony was content to let people in other regions slip through the fence bc it makes them money. the only reason those regions cant play anymore is because the helldivers players made a big fuss over nothing.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,if they chose sales then they wouldve launched in those countries. clearly they dont sell well in those countries already so i dont see a problem.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,there's only 196 countries in the world... so that number is wrong
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"what purpose would the number of free user accounts serve a company who produces so many tangible products? i... think i already explained this in the comment above. it's all about optics. sony's gaming division has been constantly moaning about how each one of their bestseller, blockbuster tentpole game releases e.g. horizon zero dawn 2, gowr, spiderman 2, ffviir, etc. underperformed, because they just poured so much money into development and advertising. they need something to please the shareholders, and what the shareholders care about isn't profit, but growth not the value of the company right now, but it's value in three, five, ten years from now. psn numbers are used to show that people are invested in their ecosystem. if the number goes up, it means more people are into playstation games, which means they are going to buy games in the future and make more money in the future. bigger number means more growth meaning a better investment. at least in theory, in a perfect world, if all the stars align, but that's kind of the deal modern corporate investments are all speculative, gambling on the company's exponential growth, and so the corporations are scrambling for metrics to convince said firms and share brokers that they are going to grow in the future and thus make a good investment opportunity. whether or not those metrics, like psn numbers, are indicative, useful, or even just substantial is beside the point. as for them wanting to sell their games separately with their own launcher, i think it's a blatant misunderstanding of why those launchers exist. the big publishers pushed those out originally over a decade ago when they tried to compete with steam, and they lost. now they exist as just an extra layer of drm, which is once again nothing more than something they can point at during investor meetings and say look, we have all of these measures in place to combat piracy, meaning we're going to make more money in the future, so give us money now. the truth is that while steam's 30 cut looks huge, it's doing a tremendous service to these companies and publishers in return. valve takes care of the backend, the servers, the maintenance, the forums, the advertisements, and the customer support, including all the related apps and other services. if sony tried to do that themselves for pc, they would need to build out all that infrastructure and servicebase, which is not only going to be a big initial investment, but they'll also need to maintain it, pay the people in charge of maintaining it, and so on, so i sincerely doubt they would make any more money off each purchased game than they do when working with steam. but then again, sony is a big, publicly traded company with multiple layers of bureaucracy and multiple boards that answer to other boards like a freaking layer cake, so their decisions aren't necessarily rational. if someone decides if we make a launcher, we can spin it as our official entry into the pc gaming market and use it to bolster investor confidence, it will get pushed through, because at the end of the day, it's all about money, and the promise of growth makes more and easier money than actually developing a product."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"right now, today, its steam taking 30 from sony. i did not mean or infer anything else."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"so which company do you buy games from with no account? you need a steam account to buy from there and steam is inherently drm. gog will give you an .exe so it's drmfree, sure, but you still need a gog account to shop there."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,that doesnt make it right
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-02,isnt sea of thieves only online? maybe thats why. and i also know you need a microsoft account to play minecraft with other people who arent on playstation which is stupid. and yea everyone needs a certain account to play in their respective consoles
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"what do you mean they didn't catch hate? ea and ubisoft are infamous for being anticonsumer piles of shit. ea has been named worst company in america multiple times in a row over shit like this. if anything, the difference here is how many defenders sony has, that those other two don't."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yea, breaking the tos is a totally reasonable solution to a problem come on guys, use your brains!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"after the mess with helldivers, they won't even let people in the countries that don't have psn to buy the games now. so people can't even get the game in order to spoof the psn account anymore."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the bitching will do nothing just like it did for helldivers 2. except it did. and they removed the requirement. i just dont care for account requirements just because you don't care, or know why this is an issue, other people clearly do. microsoft require an account, ubisoft require an account, ea, rockstar too and the list keeps going on. each of those is a problem, too, but we're not talking about them right now. we're talking about sony."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the time for putting a stop to that has long gone. it is only long gone thanks to people like you. if people don't buy those products requireing a third party account, the practice would stop very quickly."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,its a practice that fucking sucks and people should keep pushing back against it for the reason it is bad for the consumer
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the key difference is that those companies work with countries that can't create accounts to make sure their games are still available to get.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you werent guaranteed a refund, though. that was the whole point of the entire uproar. i believe it was 121 countries that can not create a sony psn account in which there are only 195. so 3 solid months after the game was sold, after the psn account requirement was enforced, all those customers from those countries could no longer play the game that theyve been playing for months. steam has a policy of not issuing refunds if you played the game longer than 2 hours, which 3 months of play time is obviously longer. that is what the uproar was about. just like exclusivity, all this bs is serving is their corporate numbers, no one else. it actually severely limits how many people can play their game. i guess they just dont like money. edit i would like to point out that sony has reversed their psn account requirement, and steam aka valve has been issuing refunds to customers regardless of play times for helldivers 2 since nearly the beginning. supposedly because they knew how fucked this whole situation was to their customers."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"wouldn't you agree then that some may not care about who controls their data, but others would? additionally, in regards to the megacorp point, i think it is not unreasonable that many people would have a preference for how and where their data is collectedshared. for instance, i might not mind having a google account but i might for specific reasons not want to share my data with twitter."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the 'having to create a psn account' argument is still bs. what difference does it make being forced to create an account to use a launcher like steam, ea, ubisoft connect etc, and being forced to create one inside a game? either way your data is at the mercy of these megacorps. you seem to miss the point where creating a psn account is unneeded in any regard and that sony has lied claiming it's for safety of players  the ability to block cheaters. when steam has all of that integrated. they were proven liars. and you somehow missed the point of i bought it on x, why do i need an account on y? steam doesn't sell data like that as far as i've been able to read but having sony with my data? did you miss the seven times they've been hacked over the last ten years? i don't want them having my data for any reason. so i don't want my data in the hands of another company regardless, nevermind sony who can't stop data leaks for 5 minutes. there are benefits to the consumer having achievements sync across platforms is one. cross platform cloud saves are said to be coming too. whether these matter or not is subjective. you may not care about these benefits, but others do. all of those things are things not everyone wants or cares about. i don't care about achievements and i will never own a ps5. so why would i want to link my account info when sony has no ability to make data secure? other games that do this make it optional. most companies give cosmetics for signing up for this kinda thing, some other benefits. but it's always o p t i o n a l. sony is making it mandatory because they want your data, buy our game and we'll sell your data to make even more money. but thank goodness, achievements and cross save can be there! the only valid argument here is if you bought the game and then was locked out after the fact because of regional availability. but that's only if you weren't granted a refund. you're absolutely right, the consumer should just shut their stupid mouths and let the company do what they want. because complaining never got a company to realize they're pissing off their customers. oh wait, it worked with helldivers 2. and also ea, ubisoft, and microsoft all left and came crawling back to steam. microsoft dropped their account linking with single player games and ea is doing the same. also sony is in legal trouble for things they did during that because of customer outcry. it's like if things get loud enough sony has to listen and sony is repeating the exact same mistakes that 4 other companies have done. seriously, why say what you're saying? half of it isn't right and you're just saying if you don't like it, who cares, don't complain about it?? that's so dumb, we just proved sony pissed off people so hard they had to backtrack hard and apologize for such idiocy and nearly sank their best selling game ever."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"what difference does it make being forced to create an account to use a launcher like steam, ea, ubisoft connect etc, and being forced to create one inside a game? that one is required for payment processing and the account ingame is only for leaching off your private data. there is no benefit for the player at all. there are benefits to the consumer having achievements sync across platforms is one. cross platform cloud saves are said to be coming too. whether these matter or not is subjective. then make that stuff optional."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it has nothing to do with multiplayer. read the article.  while this is sometimes the case for playstation pc ports which have online multiplayer modes, god of war ragnark is a singleplayer game only. you can get locked out of your single player game because they close the gate. that's bad!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i haven't heard of any other publishers doing that here thus far.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"there have been comments and posts which thank the helldivers 2 community for their effort in excluding their country, which previously had no problem with buying and playing psn games if they used a neighbor country as account. that's some olympiclevel mental gymnastics."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yeah, they had no issue on playstation. the reason why it became a problem is because this was the first time a psn account was required for pc, and many of the people who never had a ps were naturally concerned about the regional restriction, not knowing there was a workaround, so they started asking for refunds. i've seen people on this thread believing the issue was just a simple oh, i have to take a minute to create an account and raising a petty fuss about this, but that's not what it was about at all. it was people genuinely concerned they would be locked out of playing the game after they bought it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i think you're being downvoted for saying allegedly for what is simply a fact. this is allegedly against the sony psn terms of service.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,everyone pointing out this objective fact is getting down voted. this has been proven true time and time again.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"yeah this seems to be exactly what it sounds like. i mean i get the irritation of creating a new account, but how is that any different from creating whatever shit gta forces you to create or blizzard or any of the other online games? i remember most of them ask you to create some shit account to track progress or get unlockables or this or that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yeah it's very common things to do on consoles. i even have multiple accounts in multiple regions to play games exclusive to some regions like japanese games

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,right and the ones who use psn all have accounts from other regions for years. americans bitching about the handful who dont know you can just select the nearest server far outnumber said handful. if articles werent outrage bait like this bs then maybe those folks would know they can still have an account.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it was valve after everyone started freaking out over having to create a psn account for helldivers 2
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"if they would have made clear from the very beginning that it would require a psn account, people wouldn't have been as upset. but that would also have hurt their sales. it originally requires one but was temperory disabled due to server issue. they could've communited more clearly but tbh even if they did the backlash would still happen due to unsupported region wouldn't be able to legally? play the game. their only other option was to either not disablereenable it all alone."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"plenty if single player games require an account but again all game would still be available everywhere if people didn't lose their minds over helldivers needing a psn account and no it wasn't a bait and switch, it was required day one but arrowhead disabled it because the servers got overloaded and they needed to free up server load. it was always indicated day one that a psn account would be required on the front page of the steam page it was known months before the game launched it would need an account"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"they did make it clear. it was in the marketing and on the steam page. the only reason why helldivers 2 didn't require it during the launch was because they had shot way over their expected server load, and arrowhead thought that by turning off the psn stuff, they could get more people into the game proper."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,pretty much yeah. i tried explaining here when it first happened what to do to get around it if you are in an unsupported region and i never been downvoted faster in my life. like i am talking 100 in minutes of suggesting picking another region from the dropdown if your region wasn't listed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,there will never come a time when sony decides they want to ban millions of people that have been giving them money ffor decades. they will never have a reason to people use vpns to get around paying for netflix... people make psn accounts to give sony money

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,like helldivers if they missed the reference
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"assuming a lack of outrage is purely because nobody cares is a fallacy. i can't speak for everyone, but in my case i don't voice my dislike for ubisoft or ea's practices because i don't want to play any of their games partially because of the regular crap they pull and also because i don't like their games. i would assume the outrage is there but it's also less relevant as it's nothing new from them, and those it bothers have learned to avoid those publishers. sony is relatively new to pc and hasn't required accounts until recently, plus imo they have better games than ubisoft and ea. even ignoring my opinion on the quality of the games, them finally bringing their exclusives to pc is obviously going to draw more attention than the nth entry in whatever ubisoft or ea franchise is releasing next, which means more outrage when sony do something people dislike."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,new games come out constantly and there aren't outrage threads dedicated to it.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i think you are taking issue with the level of response the psn account linking had, which was massive because the game launched without this requirement and then they tried to make it one after. which was not the way to go about this. if it had been required from day 1 the reaction would have been different. the hate ubisoft and ea get is definitely there, but no where as big as the helldivers situation."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i'm providing my personal caseinpoint. though i will add that i came pretty close to being pissed off at ea for buying out the outer worlds. i wanted to play that game and didn't appreciate the prospect of having to infect my pc with ea's software. in the end, though, i laughed and laughed at ea because they weren't able to keep the game off gamepass, so i ended up playing it for a buck. i'll be laughing at sony in a year or two, as games that would normally have been longtimed exclusives on underpowered 450 consoles, like new final fantasy entries, are simply going to be available day one on pc. bless square enix for getting that ball rolling. others will follow suit, because when you make a game for ps5, you're 90 of the way to having a pc port already. that will challenge all other incentives to stay exclusive, including nationalistic ones."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"this absolutely isn't true, though. there is clearly a huge overlap between the people complaining about this and people complaining about using other launchers than steam. sony creating their own storefront for the game wouldn't solve this problem. it would just shift the comments from, i refuse to create a psn account, to, i refuse to use the sony launcher. we've already seen this with epic. i think it's absurd to count the storefront as a primary account too. steam is where you are purchasing these games from. it has no affiliation to most of the games that you purchase beyond being a storefront for them. the one account in this scenario should be the playstation account, not your steam account."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i had never even heard of x defiant until this thread. games that are only on ubisoft, ea, or epic might as well not exist."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,plenty of other single player games need accounts and people don't get outraged they walked it back because arrowhead disabled account linking after launch and people bought the game. this time they are giving people 4 months notice and people are still pretending to care about a simple account that take a minute to make
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"then again, helldivers 2 didn't need it either and they walked that back after the outrage. there is precedent. still can't buy the game now. as it is unaviable in my region."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"where did the narrative that helldivers 2 didn't need it come from? the game 100 launched with the requirement of needing a psn account, they just turned it off almost immediately to help with server load. if they had never turned it off, this whole thing would've never have been as big of a clusterfuck as it is now."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i'd say it's fine. they didn't know, they were corrected, even apologized in reply to a different user. gotta make mistakes and learn!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"fair, but is it bad to assume a triple a title will have denuvo?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it was also in the trailer. it was labelled clear as day before the game was even purchasable. it was also mandatory on launch day to makelink an account. they temporarily disabled it because of the server issues. people then claimed it was never mandatory, never labelled as such, was a big switcheroo. these idiots basically lied through their teeth about it acting like it was some sudden shock and kicked up such a fuss. that community has been toxic since day 1 though, the sub has been crying and abusing the devs since it came out. whole thing was ridiculous."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it was temporarily paused ingame to make it playable, but that does not negate the original requirement which was always listed on the store page and sony never stopped advertising the game as requiring psn. it was right next to the buy button in bold and highlighted. people need to understand what theyre buying as for selling the game in those countries, i personally cant answer that, but people outside of supported countries have always been able to make alternate region psn accounts. no one who has done so has ever been banned unless they were hackerscheaters or used fraudulent payment method and other abuse of the system. the tos is specifically worded to allow for such occurrences without doing things which would make them liable, such as stealing identities or using fraudulent payment methods. they cant ban you for it without hurting travellers for example"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,arrowhead literally said it was valve that did that for those 3 countries
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i have several friends from many countries that got delisted off steam. people seem to think the only countries that lost access are shitholes that have more important things to worry about when in reality countries like latvia and lithuania plus many of the countries in the middle east and eastern europe aren't even remotely close to something like that. really shows the ignorance of gamers in general
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,you realize sony didn't give a shit about you creating a psn account for decades? millions of people did it. sony even said to do it if you are in an unsupported region. the game was forced to be removed off steam in those regions because people got upset and refused to make a simple psn account
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i mean if you live in a developing country and not being able to play god of war is a significant issue for you then you probably are living better than a lot of your compatriots and it does come across as being entitled.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it costs money to operate in specific countries, it's not just adding them to a list"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,thats not how things work. they dont just enter a countries market for free. theres regulations they have to follow and that requires investment.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,jesus christ i swear reddit gaming subs are full of a bunch of fucking children lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"good for you, clearly you have a life outside of reddit. ea app and uplay are complained about alot. hell, even blizzard games on steam got incredible ammount of complains about requiring battle net account just the account, no launcher needed"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"people freaking out over making a steam account was 100x worse than making a psn account. people also bemoan making r, ubisoft, and ea accounts to this day. the complaining about psn accounts is because it is a new requirement, long term people will probably give in just like everything else."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"they do, but they did it forever. unlike sony that was fine with me playing on steam without psn account until recently. it's not a free pass, it's a done deal. no point in suddenly being angry over ubisoft requiring uplay or whatever it's called now, because it's been like that for years. i enjoyed all previous ps games, including gow1, but it's not possible for me to have a legit psn account from my country so i can't play gow2 now. so i pick and choose this one to get angry about, does that make sense?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i guess i'm playing very different games from you guys, no game i played in the last years had a mandatory register."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,minecraft has gone through three different mandatory accounts and i've yet to see the outrage threads for that.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,im not asking those people im asking you
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"if you give a shit about games being region locked than it's pretty easy to find other games that have region locks, it's not hard... there are thousands upon thousands of them,"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,because this is reddit and people want to pretend to be outraged to show they're good people. to me this being anything more than well that sucks for them. is kinda weird. like if you don't live in those regions why does it matter? i've only ever seen stuff about that on here. so if you're just a normal person and don't sit on reddit all the time you'd have no idea this is even an issue.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,have you heard of having standards? wanting the industry to be better for everyone and not tainted by scumming practices. it's corporate bootlickers like you that ruin an industry.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"because their online infrastructure's to blame in all this. they could have divided it by region to make it more manageable, but no. sony, nintendo, and all japanese companies seem to have a unique spin on how online services work that severely limits their reach while the rest of the world don't even have that problem. they just created a problem in their own making, and you supporting it only validates them. this is why these elitist mindset needs to stop."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"its happening everywhere too. if i remember correctly cnn recently had to fire a ceo because he was god awful at his job and was essentially slowly destroying the company. despite him leaving the company on bad terms and worse than he found it, he got something like a 20,000,000 golden parachute on his way out. imagine getting hired for a job you suck at, sucking at that job so bad that an entire board agrees to fire you, then making enough money from it that you could comfortably retire. its a whole different world for these assholes"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,they don't even know the sales of these countries because the lack of support. those bastards think i'm english.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,because you are thinking logically and making the correct assumption that they have the data to back up the decisions they make vs redditors that dont know what they are talking about making corporate conspiracies
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i know. i'm just putting that out there because everyone on gaming forums now act like it's steam only, when say walmart is also taking 30 of that ragnarok sale. people are defending exclusive storefronts for software now not implying you, but a sony pc store is what i'm thinking and that's gonna become another much bigger issue in the future.like a sony pc store being region locked"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"indeed, and that's the conundrum  steam is great now, but what is likely to happen when gaben does finally die? gog is where i shop for any games i'm interested in where possible for that very reason, but it doesn't have everything i'm looking for."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you need a steam account to buy from there and steam is inherently drm no, its not. the publisher chooses to have drm or not. baldurs gate 3 is drm free on steam."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"not sure why you're getting down voted. since everything is bought online and not physical, you own nothing. once the company shuts down, you lose it all, or worse they decide it's not worth the upkeep. the only reason you buy with someone is you know they won't shut it down like steam. they are also big enough not to shut down."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,they didnt catch hate for this particular thing. we all know theyre anticonsumer but all of these companies are. they are companies that prioritize profit above everything else. why is everyone so surprised that sony wants to do the same especially in exchange for allowing their products to be hosted on steam?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"apparently sony support tells people to do just that, on top of the fact that they do sell playstations in countries where you can't make an account. here tho yeah steam won't care, it's just gonna be impossible to buy in those regions"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"dude is just dumb, sony created a problem and gave no solution instead of breaking their own tos. and this dumb fuck is licking sonys asshole, because why again?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"why is this even downvoted. the helldivers 2 situation was resolved literally because of the community's response. and yeah, account linking on other services sucks too  but they just aren't what this discussion is about. not to mention, that  unlike sony  services like uplay are available in almost all the countries worldwide. whereas psn is only in around 70, which in turn limits how many people have access to the game itself. and hell, even if stuff like uplay isn't available in some countries, those companies still worked out a way for the players to have access to their games. meanwhile sony outright refuses to do so and it's been like that for years..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"well done, one win and now sony are going to be much stricter with the policy and wont allow developers to temporarily remove the requirement ever again because of server issues. you also screwed over all the other regions that cant make a psn account by making sure ps now enforce their tos strictly meaning they can no longer buy the game and use the workaround they have for years."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,that's contrary to what i've seen. there are multiple reports of people getting refunds way past the return window. steam seems to have made an exception and only denied refunds to people in countries with official psn access who only wanted a refund for solidarity. because now they couldn't play with their friends in regions without psn access.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,if theyre not then theyre breaking the law.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"not knowing there was a workaround, so they started asking for refunds. what workaround? if i search for it on steam, it doesn't even find it. if i google the direct link, and try to open it, i get an error this content is not available in your region. sure, i probably could lie and set my steam account to a different country  use a vpn, but that's not workaround, that's breaking the tos."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"thanks. i haven't really read the tos lately, and i know a lot of welltraveledglobal workers who have continued to use their original psn account without issue, so thats why i had phrased it that way."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,right and the ones who use psn all have accounts from other regions for years. which don't fucking matter since you can't even buy the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"if they were so unpopular steam wouldn't support those regions either, but they do. i can guarantee there are more pc gamers in the baltics than there are in many central american countries but the latter are included while the former are not."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,valve is already on record saying it's psn doing it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ahh okay, so sony didn't have a say in it. definitely couldn't have made different decisions on their part, they're fault free."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yeah nothing worse than mad pc gamers man its impossible to have a conversation with these people. crazy that if they had the attention span to read this wouldnt happen
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"wrong, people used vpn to get access to netflix in other countries where the libraries were different. they would still need a netflix account in order to access the content. netflix themselves didn't give a fuck since the users were customers anyway, but license holders demanded that they prevent it  httpswww.cbc.canewsbusinesscanadiannetflixcopyrightlaw1.3406074 if a publisher owns the publishing right to a game in region a, they can sue sony if sony allows violations of their rights."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,17 years psn is older than some of the pc gamers complaining about it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i would love for anyone to share me a recent outrage thread about any of their recent games requiring an account. any one at all
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,they release some of the best selling games every year
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,definitely 1 of 3 benefits to having a console in that regard.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the game did launch with the requirement and was displayed ion the steam page that it was required. regardless being outraged over got and gow requiring it is also ridiculous. other games. there aren't threads like this and the ones for got about new ea games or ubisoft games edit he blocked me after spamming nonsense
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"well, i'm from montenegro, and i can't make the account, even though its the middle of europe geographically yeah sure, maybe i can mess around with vpns and whatnot, but such an unnecessary hassle for no valid reason, its a single player game... if you're gonna do this, you have to widen your shit, i never had issues with creating any other profile, ever, its just sony"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,can see that easily happening as well
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"regionlocking games on the other hand, that's what should be talked about, not the fact that they are demanding accounts.. good luck with that. regionlocking is directly related to regional pricing, and that's the unspoken big golden goose in the room nobody in the industry even wants to talk about touching."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,how so?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yeah because it tanks performance
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it's been pretty 5050 lately. ea and ubisoft stuff always has denuvo, but sony's games, most of microsoft games and stuff like baldur's gate 3, alan wake 2, etc didn't have it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i would disagree with the sony never stopped advertising the game as requiring psn. im from a country not supported by psn. i used to have a psn account because i made one when i got a ps3 a very ling time ago. i didnt get a ps5 so i forgot my password. when helldivers release i bought it because i had a psn. i loaded the game and ended up with the screen requiring you to log in and it just said psn is not supported in your country. so i couldnt even just log in my old psn account or do forget password or anything. anyway, i go to the faqs page it specifically said that you didnt need a psn to play. and this is what bothers me. why was it on the sony faqs page that you didnt need a psn account."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it was temporarily paused ingame to make it playable this is quite the problem imo, if it's such a hard requirement, you can't just disable it to make your game playable. if a certain feature is so critical to the proper functioning of the game, to the point that it may prevent certain players from accessing it, and that feature is missing at release, then i'm sorry but your game is not in an acceptable state for release, despite being playable on a purely functional level. people outside of supported countries have always been able to make alternate region psn accounts. in this case tho steam is also involved. if playstation had its own launcher there wouldn't be a problem, but here the risk is that in addition to breaking the psn tos you will also break the steam ones, and i can understand that a user is not willing to put his entire library at risk for a single game."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"this lol im sure im much more wealthier than some of the redditors in the us, but i guess because of sony were treated like were living in some shithole that has to scrap for food day to day."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,and lets not forget southeast asia. that place is a blossoming landscape for tons of gamers. its insane they still blocked psn there.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,really shows the ignorance of gamers people in general ftfy this kind of geographiccultural chauvinism is sadly way too common even in discussions that are in no way related at all to gaming.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yup youre 100 correct my buddy in egypt just has a american psn account
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"this sounds really condescending... and doesn't even make sense. so you're saying wanting to use a 2030 product that you can afford is entitled because some of the people in your country don't buy it, or pirate it? note i'm not saying cannot afford it, they mostly can afford it in principle, but it's a steep price so they prefer not to. but no, wait, that isn't your logic you're saying people in developing countries do not want to play games because they have more pressing concerns... of what? scrounging around in the dirt to make their daily dirt and broken glass soup in their house of plastic bags? wtf? how is having less money that us citizens connected to not having the capacity to play video games? are video games in 2024 some kind of extravagant luxury hobby, like safari or helicopter piloting? a thing that only the richest, spoiled people outside of the us can enjoy? sorry for going off, it's just such a weird statement on all counts. you shouldn't complain, most of your compatriots don't even know what video games are... so you shouldn't play them too out of solidarity. they do know, they play games."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i am literally being treated as lesser even when i'm someone of similar means. maybe it's not the worst thing in the world, but i would still prefer to be treated with dignity in a hobby that i enjoy. imagine if you were into knitting and your favorite type of yarn literally can't be sold in your country because of arbitrary company politics even if you are willing and able to purchase it. it's alienating for no good reason."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"to add to this. infrastructure, ongoing maintenance etc etc.. sometimes its just not worth it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"as i assume you're a pc gamer given the thread, have you heard of steam by any chance? just mandatory for a few games..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,really? i'm curious as to which games you've been playing? almost all of my games require at least steam.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,oh. i didn't realize i said i was mad.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it's pretty easy to find other games that have region locks i'll admit, i didn't realize people looked for these things."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i see people posting regular comments being considered outrage. there's no outrage. i see people saying that's shitty. i disagree. i may even speak with my wallet. as outrage. that's not outrage. why do you ever care about anything outside of your own personal life? because of empathy.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"yeah, it's so ruined right now. lol drama queen."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"same here. i buy games on gog before steamepic store. i have bg 3 on gog. i have couple ps45 games on gog, too. i encourage people to use gog, it's platform is optional, and you can download games directly from the browser onto your head drive, and it's there forever. the platform works a lot like steam. achievements work similar to steam, they aren't that important anyway, but they're there. it helps keep your games updated and easier to repair files. it's steam just with more ways to keep your games yours."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"upon further investigation you do appear to be right about bg3 giving you the direct .exe file and being able to launch it without even having steam running. however, this is an extremely rare exception. i've never heard of any other game like this. it certainly isn't the norm."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"why is everyone so surprised we're not surprised. we just think it's stupid, unnecessary bullshit that doesn't benefit us as the end consumer in any way and are pissed off about it constantly being forced down our throats if we want to actually play a video game that looks enjoyable. there's a difference. you don't have to like things even if you expect them, my dude."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"why do apologists keep using the word surprised? people aren't surprised. they just think it sucks. yes, ea and ubisoft also suck. they deserve, and receive, lots of hate too. people reacting negatively to selfish business practices is a good thing. why are you so upset about it this time?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it doesnt matter what some chuds on support say if theyre tos says the literal opposite. what matters is what they enforce.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"have i ever said that someone got banned or will get banned? as you said its providing false information which is a breach of the tos. i never said that smth will happen all i said its stupid, that you have to break them, to even get an account. and by all means, giving sony a single reason to ban your account, even smth as small as this is stupid. what if sony just needs a reason in the future to ban you?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you also screwed over all the other regions no, sony did"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you also screwed over all the other regions that cant make a psn account by making sure ps now enforce their tos strictly meaning they can no longer buy the game and use the workaround they have for years. that's not on us, that's on sony. nobody forced them to do this. stop being such a corporate shill."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"no, they couldnt play period, not just with friends. and i mentioned above already about how steam, not sony, steam, was issuing refunds against their own refund policy, exactly because of how anticonsumer this requirement afterthefact was. this was actually illegal in north america and europe. many eu nations are on this list, after all, as well as us territories that house us citizens. there just isnt any light where this change was justified. edit grammar"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"listen, i dont want to get into a back and forth with you on this issue. if you dont find this requirement an issue for yourself personally, then thats fine. i dont have a personal issue with this requirement either. i already have a psn from decades ago that i used to log in to their games on steam. theres nothing except an old google email tied to that account, so im not worried about any of that info being hacked. but just because i dont have an issue with this requirement doesnt mean i dont see the issue with the requirement for others. that is all. have a great day!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,this was before it became delisted. the reason it got delisted was because a lot of people in those countries already bought the game and steam was granting their refund requests. there was likely a lot of them for sony to take notice and decide to delist it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it's true that they haven't been enforcing their own tos, but nothing stops them from doing so. i'm going to be laughing my ass off and copypasting i told you so ifwhen sony politics changes new ceo, etc, and they suddenly ban all tosbreaking accounts, and millions of people come complaining and blaming sony for losing all their games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yeah you can lol you think they are just chilling on the homescreen?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"and as the previous guy said, this didnt happen before until everyone started crying with the helldivers thing, the obnoxiousness of this incredibly mad people made that happen and now the players are paying the price"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it's easier for steam because they don't have a console to also support like sony does which is likely where most of the regulations and restrictions come from
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"sony has never given a shit about people in unsupported regions making psn accounts to buy games... they aren't going to start now arrowhead even said valve removed the final regions, they could have done all the others prior as well"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"so the faq, which is not in any way official, you take it for its word, but not the store page which is game specific over a faq that might be outdated? in every pc related news on the game, it is labeled with the psn requirement"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the second point is a nonissue, the first one is just plain stupid. they can require it for any reason, it doesnt matter if the game can be played without it or not. steam wont ban you for them thinking you violated another companys tos without the other company thinking that. bring up something a little more specific next time"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"no, ah ceo said it was a management error or something that they found when they were doing ghost of tsushima and valve added the 3 countries"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"that's true. maybe i'm just overthinking it but i think gamers should generally know a little bit about the world on account of interacting with people from anywhere at any time. i played 1 single game with people from lithuania, latvia, serbia, russia, brazil, and many more countries. hell, i played old school runescape with some people from kuwait."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the thing is the reason that psn isn't available in your country is because sony have decided, likely based on console sales, that they won't make enough money there for it to be worth providing the service. you're a victim of global capitalism, much in the same way as people in poverty are, except you don't get to play a video game and they don't get to eat."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,one cannot because it's not available for purchase in those regions.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the reason people got mad is because they sold helldivers to people in those regions only for them to block the game for those players. i would say that is 100 justified to get mad about it was literally a scam. you bought someone and 2 months later they suddenly turn around and say we got your money now you cant play anymore.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,victim blaming much? how are customers responsible for bad business practices a company makes?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"and these same people brigade every thread about psn accounts and buries anyone that points this out. they don't give a shit about psn accounts, they just want outrage directed towards sony, mostly because they hate consoles and love pcs"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"regulations and restrictions part is just baloney, at least with many of these regions. with what i've heard someplace like vietnam makes sense, their restrictions are substantial. on the other hand it definitely doesn't make sense for countries in the eu and even the eurozone for that matter, they don't have some wild restrictions. it's just about sony not being arsed. to be fair same goes for xbox."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"show me massive threads like this for any newish game, ill wait"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"because there seems to be a hate thread for every new playstation game that requires an account, why not for every other new game?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yeah. im just saying it wasnt always completely advertised. and the faq page is the first link you can click on the page that sats psn is not supported in your region. so i hope you understand why its confusing. and again i had a psn do i bought it. i just couldnt log in.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"how is it a nonissue? does steam allow you to legally purchase games from a different region than your own or freely switch at will based on convenience? steam has its own policies that could lead to a ban. i find it crazy that it's somehow accepted as normal that a user has to break the platform's tos to gain access to a game to begin with. edit not sure if you added this later  the first one is just plain stupid. they can require it for any reason, it doesnt matter if the game can be played without it or not. i never meant that there has to be a specific reason, and yes it doesnt matter if the game can be played without it or not. it's a requirement, and that's fine. but if this requirement is so critical to the game's usability, don't release it with that feature temporarily disabled. release it when you have fully implemented it, correctly and so that it works. so that if a person mistakenly buys the game, because perhaps they saw it on the homepage even though it's not actually supported in their country or heard about it everywhere, at least they can quickly see that it doesn't work for them and ask for a refund."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i cant confirm this but an article in february 2023 shows that gamepass is available in 86 countries httpswww.theverge.com202322823618196microsoftpcgamepass40newcountries so not sure your claim of every other company is valid.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,no one is being fragile. youre just obtuse and oblivious.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i try to see asking questions as having a discussion. you see it as arguing.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"drama queen, the industry is fine. go cry more."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"almost assuredly yes. do i have proof? no. but you don't make a tos without the intention of enforcing it because if you don't enforce it and someone can prove you didn't, then a court may rule against you in regards to cases involving it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"and i know i said i dont need reddit, but this guy summed it up pretty good. he even explains, that they can ban you for creating an account not in your region. httpsredd.it1cj3gez"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"no dude you are wrong you can't make a psn account in those countries, except if you use workarounds like vpns. and even then, it might not work. i just read that sony even bans vpns, but i can not confirm that so take it with a grain of salt."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"no it isn't, you have to cooperate with each individiual government to operate in each country. they need to approve you doing business in these countries. this takes a lot of time and effort"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,this isn't a massive thread my guy. pretty much standard compared to ea and ubishit. sony chose to enter the pc market with their middle fingers up. did you expect them to be at valves level? they got years upon years before they undo the fuck sony mentality that they are building for themselves. don't be the guy kissing that corporate ass
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,because sony made it a requirement of one of their biggest live service hits after its release. and now they're firmly in the public eye facing extra scrutiny.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i have definitely seen a lot of hate for uplay and origin, or ea play i think it is now. also a lot of hate for the epic launcher whenever there is an exclusive title on it. the sony psn thing for helldivers was definitely big, much bigger than what these other publishers normally get."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the faq page link never existed on the store page for the game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you dont need to buy the game from a different store region. steam delisted the games, sony didnt. the original plan seemed like you can buy the game on your steam account where you live and connect a psn account from a different region without issue. they wouldnt contradict each other. and yes, steam allows you to change the store region"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i was specifically talking about companies selling games, like epic, ubi, ea, etc."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,lol case in point. i ask a question then get downvoted and attacked. try not to get so defensive and upset over corpos bud.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,and why do you want to have this discussion?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,bad trolling it is.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,recently played an indie game on steam called symphony of war. about halfway through there's a chapter where you play as the ludicrously op villain. it's pretty fun. kind of a neat introduction to what you're going to have to deal with when you finally face off with him.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,stay away from shadow of war dlc. playing as eltariel was something else ...

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,honestly enjoyed playing as atreus overall but there were a few times i got tired of it. the switching back and forth happened a bit too often imo. it felt more like playing as atreus was a bit of a noveltywatered down version i know he shouldnt be at kratoss level of power but i do wish there were more skill upgrades for him. i had him maxed out in abilities way before the end of the game whereas kratos still had a lot to develop on. i also wish you couldve switched back and forth between them as a duo when theyre together instead of being locked into kratos.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,my 2 complains about the switch in ragnarok 1. change from a melee to range. 2. ironwood mission was little longer than it should have been. no reason to have 2 separate mission back to back where you get food for the animals. could have just combined both into one mission and save like 10 minutes.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"everything i say below is kinda spoilery about god of war ragnarok but not really in a plot way but i put it all in spoiler text anyway... !the atreus stuff always felt like a waste of time because the game never really committed to them either?! !like with kratos there is a fairly deep levelup system where you have armor and multiple kinds of weapons and you have your support characters that you improve or adjust. you feel invested in every little widget you pick up or side quest you go on.! !with atreus you have... the same armor you got from doing the kratos parts and... no new weapons and... you don't level up your side characters. you do level up atreus still but it's all abilities that only matter on the atreus sections with some kratos section correlations.! !every time you did something with him it felt like a break from the real game and the game systems did nothing to make you feel otherwise.! edit also also also... !the kratos sections are, by and large, repeatable. the game could hide secrets in there and side quests because you could go back and do them later. the atreus stuff was all for the most part a one shot deal, so there just wasn't the depth there like in the rest of the game. i never worried about figuring out how to master atreus gameplay because i knew the game would never throw a harder optional boss or mode at me that required me to really master his style.! all of this just contributes to a mindset where you feel like these sections don't matter even if the story stuff is interesting or if you actually do enjoy the characters."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,i am selling a digital god of war game. who wants?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,this is why i stopped playing the game. i refuse.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"thought it was just me. between making me play as atraeus and the damn squirrel, it deflated the whole experience for me. all i could think about was them killing off kratos and them continued the story through lori. turned my stomach. i understand why they want to attach children to the franchise monetarily speaking, but not at kratos' expense."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"still better than the way tlou2 did it, thankfully."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,last of us 2... abby
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,this hit so hard!!! i just started that part of the game. its not going well

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,don't get people started on tlou2 please god. that game was fantastic and i won't hear anything else on the matter lmao
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"also when you fall victim to the hype train and spend your hardearned money on gow ragnarok only to learn that it's a short, repetitive, onrails interactive movie that panders heavily to facebook dad group members, just like the previous game."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"star wars force unleashed. you go from rampaging through kaashyyk as darth vader, just to play the rest of the game as some random kid vader kidnapped after making him an orphan"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"bayonetta 3 is almost entirely ruined by huge boring segments of playing as not bayonetta. the jean mini game gets old fast, in my opinion, and viola is like bayonetta with fewer abilities and nothing to unlock and no equipment. violas animations even seem lower quality like she was added to the game last second. she looks like she's from a game by a much less competent game studio."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,with these games its more like walking as said character down a long corridor.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"hey man, you have to play the game as kratos."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,what did atreus do?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,there was a fun hulk game that came out years and years ago that would force you to play as bruce banner and sneak around in between the hulk rampages
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i don't have a problem with this per se, my problemchipquirk is when games force stealth sequences, jfc that make me whip out the cheatstrainers immediately."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,agreed especially when they force you to pick fruit for a fucking hour
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i've dropped games as well as books for this before.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i'm just getting through the section as atreus in ironwood and holy shit has it killed the pacing of the game for me
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,star trek online has done this before and has doubled down recently
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i have never played a game where they make me play as the non main char and it be an experience i enjoyed. at best its quick and easy so i can get back to the person whom i've spent hours meticulously leveling and shaping. i can't think of a single game where i was forced to play as some other person and i went man that was cool as hell. i want to play some more of this person
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"lol, any game that makes me suddenly play as a different character pisses me off."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"octopath traveller. fuck off and let me choose what party to run the entire game with, don't fucking force me to play all of them cause most of them are stupid as hell and i have no interest."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the first time didn't bother me but i was like man i was hoping more kratos. the only time it bothered me was in jotunheim because good lord that area was long. every time after that playing as atreus was actually pretty dang cool.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i just started playing ragnarok this year and so far every time an atreus section comes up it makes me so mad, they're always so drawn out and his combat is just not fun for me"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i think they pretty clearly set up a potential sequel featuring atreus as the main character. and tbh, the speed of his movement and combat made him super fun to play as in place of kratos' slowness."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,how easily we forget the last of us 2 what a disappointment
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,last of us part 2 ptst kicks in

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i actually really liked the atreus parts and i hope if they make a spin off for him that the gameplay is even better fleshed out !maybe with ingrid surviving somehow and hugin as a new ally?!

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,last of us 2 is the ultimate version of this
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,first one was metal gear solid 2. 80 of the game u aren't snake.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,aya in ac origins. you spend the whole game making bayek your boy and then have to finish it as her. pointless.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"it wasn't abby at all. or any of that group. they were at war with another faction and though that ellie might be one of them. they literally call out the name of the other group when they start shooting at her. sorry but you're wrong, i jusy played through this"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i didnt mind atreus sections my first playthrough, but on replay and especially on gmgow they are miserable"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,tlou part 2
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,star wars squadrons does this where you switch back and forth between the empire and the rebels and while the ships are cool you can never really immerse yourself in the story because youre going to end up playing a similar scenario from the other side in a few minutes
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,last of us part 2 in a nutshell for me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,me i don't wanna be this guy he sucks............lemme guess he has some sob story.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,tlou2 was the absolute worse for this. i absolutely loved the entire first half of that game but being forced to play as the enemy for half the entire game ruined the experience for me. thank god for games like ragnarok
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,lol.. atreus is a little shit sometimes. great gameplay though..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,last of us 2 has the absolute best example of this in gaming history.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,metal gear solid 2 was one of the ogs for this having to switch from snake to raiden who was always complaining led to a lot of hate from fans. in fact he was so hated by fans that konami included a femboy character in mgs3 raidenovich from memoryas fan service.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,aoc with revali
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,i love playing as atreus.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"that's what games like warcraft 3 did so well you played as a human killing the undead but then you played as the undead, killing humans and all they needed to do was turn the protagonist into an undead or, kill their leader and establish a new one so the players don't have the hate for that character like how you need to kill cenarius in the orc campaign but once you're over you play as the night elves, as tyrande instead of cenarius"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,spoiler or?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,forced empathy is a bitch huh?

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"raknarok is not so bad, prince andrew interview was worse"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,this was gta v for me. every character in the single player is an absolute and utter moron.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,is it just me or did they just replace ron swanson with god of war?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,you forgot to mention tlou 2
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,tlou2s abby.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,sounds like bayonetta 3
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,nah the last of us 2 was the best example of this
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"i truly believe this is the dissonance in last of us 2. it simply doesnt work for allot of people, especially the way they did it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,lokis dumb ass
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"i finished gow ragnarok, and god know that i didn't like playing atreus but for his gameplay, not because he's a litle shitty ungrateful and unawared of danger little brat. !imo playing abby in tlou2 is a far worse thing because she alredy did what she did.!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,at least you didnt have to play at atreus during his god phase in 2018 gow!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,the last of us part ii lmao
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,meanwhile gears of war 3 lets you play as the awesome villain from the 1st game. and everybody loved it

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-20,last of us 2 has entered the chat
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-18,i love how almost 90 of the comments are about tlou2. really makes you wonder how unlikeable they really made abby.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,reminds me of the first force unleashed game where they start you off as darth vader and you just plow your way through so many wookiee.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i'm noticing a trend here. op mentioned god of war, one of other top comments mentioned shadow of war, you mentioned symphony of war. i'm just avoiding games with the of war ending from here on out."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,like ff7 when you play as sephiroth. early on.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,loved that game but the difficulty dropped off a cliff the last 2 or 3 levels for me sadly. it gave me huge ogre battle vibes with the armyteam building.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i suppose it's mostly a problem in narrative driven games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,absolutely love symphony of war! kinda wish we coulda fleshed out the character interactions part more and im sad they nerfed my favorite artifact though it was deserved but its an absolute blast of a game. cant wait for the dlc and the 2nd game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,just lose on purpose as soon as you get control of him and win the game. checkmate symphony of war.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,came here to post symphony of war but you beat me to it. i was still mad at the time.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"how is that game? been trying out more strategy rpgs now that i'm running out of good fire emblem games, tactics ogre reborn is kinda disappointing me with the lack of uniqueness to the characters. they all feel barely above generated ones."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,wait i was just about to go back and play both of those storylines. are they not fun then?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,tearofgrace ripped that dlc a new one in his hatefueled playthrough.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,shadow of war goes from good to ass in the final chapter when you have to just grind the fuck out of it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i loved desolation tho. baranor was fun to play as and the mithril rank reward lets him fight almost endlessly lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,bbut she got the shiny shines that kill.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"at least in mgr you can kill sam while as raiden, and playing sam just gives more story background about how sam teamed up with armstrong so the game did it right"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"not even a cyborg, just a mad brazilian"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i mean thats different though everyone loves sam. the fact that he practically a normal guy and beat the shit out of an enhanced cyborg already shows he was super badass.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,hes a brazilian so that means he has the ability to naturally double jump.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,that one?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,this
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"ugh, that dude was suuuch a good douchebag. i couldnt wait to fight him"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"and i'm the opposite, i loved heimdall. he was honest, straight forward and called atreus out on all his bullshit. i can't hate him even if he was an ass"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"like, i bought that game to whoosh and fling and splat on walls, what is it with this boring two legged walking ? get some powers you freak"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"wow, i had forgotten that part even existed. it was so unnecessary."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the miles part sucked too... really hope that sm 2 gets rid of the stealth sections.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,if they were gonna force her in they shouldve kept it like that part where you told spiderman who to take out.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i just finished that game and miles morales over winter and good god i wanted to break the game whenever id have to play as mj. it was even just the gameplay but what is she doing walking around super dangerous armed guards or villains like shes invincible one section was too much with the tents. i almost quit right there luckily it wasnt in miles morales
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i didn't really mind it, just the story around it, girl you don't have powers you are risking your life"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i would have been ok with it if it was only that one section in station square or whatever where you direct peter around. it would have been a cool 'ha look i'm playing as mj' moment instead of 'ugh another one of these'.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"omg yes, i died inside each time i couldn't keep playing as spiderman. they could have at least put more effort in those segments, i think someone forced those segments into the game lats minute for diversity's sake. or made a real effort for diversity and let us play black cat or morales spider man. but no, low effort diversity bullshit and if you don't like it you are a womanhating racist..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,mate why would you spoil a completely different game in a ragnarok thread
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i totally forgot about that. hopefully it's not in the new game coming out. those levels were fucking tiresome to get through.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,this makes it more enjoyable.httpswww.nexusmods.commarvelsspidermanremasteredmods2551
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"normally id agree, but the grand central mission was cool. how do you make a stealth section in a game fun? just have spiderman swoop down from the ceiling and take out the bad guys."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i wanna play as manspider
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i honestly dont understand why so many people complain about these missions. theyre literally like 5 minutes and are easy as hell.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i liked those parts, a nice change of pace. miles were boring af though"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,when he first encounters a chest and tries to punch it open like kratos but his hand crumples at the wrist
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,loved his quickness over kratos. he just felt so much faster. dont get me wrong  prefer the big guy but it was a noticeable difference in game play.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i had the same reaction, then realized atreus kind of slaps. just racking up headshots to r3 kill enemies before they even get close to me. i actually started to prefer him to kratos because he was so damn overpowered"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"this except instead of an ugh... i let out an audible gasp instead. i had no idea that playing as atreus was even going to be a possibility i'm not sure if they announced it beforehand or not, so i was totally caught off guard by it. looking back though, i'm not sure how where else they could have placed that first transition in the story to have the same effect. he sneaks out because kratos was being overprotective and still treating him as a child who can't do anything for himself. i think because we initially see it from kratos' point of view, it made atreus sneaking out seem as some sort of terrible betrayal. but then the transition happens and you see that because you're now controlling him atreus can really hold his own in combat without having to rely on his father. his combat mechanics were fast and agile and smooth like butter, despite being inexperienced and not having the same physical strength as kratos. it makes you realize that atreus' frustrations with kratos were somewhat justified, and made it easier to sympathize with him as a character. or maybe i'm just overanalyzing it. incredible game though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"becoming an almost hit kill wolf every 2 minutes was fun too. after the ending !i was hoping for some open world changeable character, but they did us dirty and robbed us of our boy!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"his combat is fine but his sections had the best storytelling imo. everyone shits on ironwood but i loved that section, angraboda is a dope charecter his time interacting with thrud and thor is great too. first arriving in asgard is absolutely draw dropping. and i loved the bar fight"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i thought at the beginning atreus combat was kinda fun and mostly on par with kratos. by the end of the game, kratos has multiples weapons and skills to unlockmaster while atreus is much more limited. that and having to remember the atreus controlscombos after hours of kratos made it a drag."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"my biggest beef with atreus is the lack of finishers, literally the same 2 finishers for each enemy"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i think im one of the few people who was actually exited to play as atreus from the moment i saw the camera behind his shoulder
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"he controls well, but for a storycentric game... it was really unappealing playing as him. especially with how long you have to play as him. i don't want to be passing the torch on to anyone or anything like that  i want to play as the god of fucking war, dammit."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,honestly his moveset feels as good as kratos' if not better imo
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,not unlike playing as miles
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i'm the opposite on the reaction, i was excited. though as it gets later in the game and kratos can kill way, way faster, it's annoying playing as atreus since his power doesn't scale nearly as much. !my first annoyance was musphelheim with thor.!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"whoa that is interesting, i thought atraeus gameplay was pretty cool. it gave me a break of being kratos because i lowkey felt a little bored of him.. so switching to atraeus is a cool experience. it gives me more curious to atraeus freedom of expressions what he had to say when kratos is not around and his own adventures. i'm glad santa monica went with this route."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,he actually controls better than kratos. it's kind of annoying because his character is too vanilla. wish he was more realistic and a bigger shit to his dad throughout. he's so kind and obedient.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i think that gameplaywise, !atreus! is a fun character to play as, but imo i dislike when the character transitions happens storywise. !usually the game makes me play as atreus after he does or say something stupid, like after you have been to vanaheim, i understand his reasons, but i disagree with his way of handling it!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"his combat is so boring, playing as him is boring. he's a petulant whiny bitch of a child and i hate him."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,if they didnt have the moments where you play as atreus then emotionally impactful moments wouldnt be well impactful. yeah hes not as strong as kratos but thats not the point. the point is to see things through his eyes and gain an investment in his development as a character
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i thought his kit was really fun to play. i enjoyed those sequences for sure.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,spoilers ahead the jotunheim sequence was integral to the story but my god it dragged on forever. i didnt hate the asgard stuff as much but for all the great story building they did with the atreus sequences i was just trying to get through them as quick as possible to get back to kratos
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,it be better if could use armor sets for him.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,honestly the worst part of the game for me. atreus was already annoying in 2018 and he only got more annoying in ragnarok. i enjoyed the game but his segments were a drag to get through.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"id love to play as him in his own thats fully designed for ranged combat where his moveset and perks are fully fleshed out, but it otherwise just felt sort of lackluster to play as him. enemies that felt tanky and hard to stagger as kratos were just awkward to fight against as atreus"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,i loved playing as atreus. i loved using the bow in combat continuing combos by melee then using the arrow.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"honestly it felt kinda good to have a light and fast character for a change instead of a slower, hulking powerhouse."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,exactly what i thought too.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,yeah i really hated the parts where i had to play ellie
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i was actually enjoying the last of us 2 until i had to play as abby. it kind of ruined the game for me because i didn't connect with her at all. that and the overall story structure just sucked imo
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"all the characters pissed me off so...yeah, i guess."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"this was me at first, i almost turned the game off when i had to play as abby again after what happened. but i came around and liked her and lev. i couldn't give less of a shit about that guy in her story though. owen i think? he was the most boring character in the whole series."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,you better believe i made abby die 10 times in the most gruesome way possible right after they made me play as her.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i like the point they made with it. after awhile. she had a lot of accidents in the early goings.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yep. i still need to do another playthrough to see how i feel about it second time around, but the length of the big halfway change really irked the shit out of me. theres no reason ellie couldnt have been written into most of what happened. i like how she was retconned as the surgeons daughter, and i appreciated the back and forth, but once i realized i was stuck with abby for the foreseeable future i really lost interest in the game. the whole time i fought rat king i was hoping hed tear her apart. that last hour playing as ellie again was such a oh thank god breath of air moment for me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"oh absolutely. totally hated abby at first of course, then you learned her story and how she's still haunted by joel killing her dad, and i began to emphasize with her. it helped drive home the idea that the world is basically never black and white, just a fuck ton of grey which was the whole point of having to play as abby of course. fantastic game imo"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yeah, didn't care for ellie, she went too far."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"last of us 2, everyone?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,fanboys on their way to give you every insult that exists
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,main reason i didn't play the game and never will. imagine having a character focused master piece on your hand and with your sequel you make another character focused game but this time have 0 likeable characters.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,nah
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i thought abby was more fun to play as than ellie. abby really fucks shit up.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i rarely finish games, and it might be the most i've disliked a character in a game i've finished, like ever. i just wanted to see the end of ellie's story so it kept me going. every single time the character would switch i would say out loud.. !i dunno.. kill any joel's lately? and i really wish the game just let me fucking off her.!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"god that game was awful. tlou 1 god tier narrative, characters, tense game play tlou2 c tier narrative, f tier characters, game play was the same but some how worse. abbey wasn't even the problem. abbey was an absolute badass unit. but her characterization was all over the damn place and it seems like no one noticed anything about her past her muscles. everyone's choices in that game made no fucking sense. abbey being able to even track joel at all with nothing but a description. like the only two compelling characters were lev and his sister?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"abby was a great character and most if not all hate about her seems to be strong woman bad lmao edit yes let the women hate flow through you, joel got killed by a strong woman lmaoooo"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,yuuuuup
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"lot of hating on abby in this thread but her sections were some of the best parts of the game. being captured by the seraphites, traversing the skybridge, the hospital. was amazing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,same here. i am not even that against the concept but the execution was just poorly done. which is a shame because everything is done so well except the pacingplot.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,abby was the best part of that game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,joel killed millions with his decision. i was sad but ultimately unshaken by his death
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"for real, when you have to play ellie again i was like no, i don't want to play this bitch anymore. she's fucking awful and she needs to die. abby is bae though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i had to take a break for a day or two after the switch i was so mad, but then i grew to appreciate the different view and new characters making the final fight much more emotionally charged"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"also i thought atreus was kind of a gameplay palette cleanser. kratos is hack and slash, but when you switch to atreus, it was almost like third person shooter."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,same!! loved the story sections as well!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"and we'll have her say something about getting herself out of this mess as she walks around, pointing out the people she needs her ex to get rid of."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,anytime i would have to change up whatever party i was using
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,people hated cid? huh.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"saying you play as him for a bit is kind of over selling it. hes in your party, as an uncontrollable guest, for one fight in a flashback, and he generally ends the fight in a single attack. it is a cool way to establish though just how strong he is in relationship to the characters youve met so far. everybody else is hitting for 100s of damage at best, and sephiroth is out here smacking dragons for a couple thousand."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,it's almost as if reddit was made of many people with different opinions.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,if everyone liked everything we'd never have anything to discuss.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,there is a psychological concept called negativity bias that all humans seem to be cursed with. really interesting stuff if you want to look into it.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,bring from salt lake myself i loved abby and thought that was an ambitious swing
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i can understand thinking its trash if you only like games that have rainbows and disney characters. i cant see how anyone could, for example, stomach something like game of thrones and turn around and say tlou2 is trash lol. the characters are well written, motives easily understandable. lots of complexity in their feelings and actions. overall it was a great ride"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,yea. i personally loved the points where you play as notkratos tho

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"in sifu kungfu style fighting roguelite, you play as someone trying get revenge on the group that killed your father. the tutorial level is you playing as the leader of this group, absolutely wrecking a monastery and killing said father."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,why? these are all great games
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,it feels so bad ass later in the game when you realize you're on his level now.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yeah, it has the easiest hard difficulty i've ever encountered. on the one hand it's gratifying to be able to sink everything they throw at you...on the other hand it would be nice if the enemy ai employed all the abilities available to them. for instance, i rarely saw them making good use of charge and ambush."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,loved the ogre battle group structures but yeah.... i felt like i hit max level several levels before the end and just rolled over the rest of the game without really progressing anymore
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,this man can't be left unchained!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"it was my favorite game of 2022. i rarely finish games and never 100 them, but i did everything there is to do in sow. however quality i'm pretty sure it was made in gamemaker, and it's pretty rough around the edges. it takes some getting used to, particularly navigating the menus. my experience was bugfree. content the story and most of the writing are pretty forgettable bordering on bad. there are some moments of good writing in the character support conversations. if the story isn't your thing, you can skip every single cutscene and dialogue. gameplay this was the entire experience for me. i think it's very well designed, and most importantly, fun. you have a lot of freedom to build units and armies as you see fit. advice if you pick up the game, bear the following in mind  use any arena tokens you find as you get them. the arena is where you earn most of your money, as well as incredibly useful items. also handy for leveling up your lagging troops.  don't sweat it if a unit occasionally dies assuming you're playing with permadeath, but it quickly becomes expensive to replace a lot of troops, particularly when they're promoted.  if you see any interesting artifacts or named characters in the market you want, buy them. the market is where about 80 of your army and gamebreaking items will come from.  don't hoard your items. they're useful out the gate, and you'll get plenty more. using them early and often really helps in the early game.  always keep 3k in the bank until a certain point. there's a map where you can hire a mercenary for 3k if you have it. it's very worth it. i think it's map 7, 8, or 9. after that point, feel free to blow your whole wad. hope you enjoy it if you pick it up!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"ehhhhhhhhh honestly, the desolation of mordor dlc is better imo for gameplay surprisingly. feels like ac in how much more grounded it has to be i personally hated blade of galadriel's light mechanic"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"the gameplay is fine, but the story is kinda messy"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i never did finish grinding out the final act
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"he's also very charismatic and likeable despite, y'know being kinda crazy and murderey although you find out through the dlc he was originally a good guy trying to take down armstrong but after his defeat he kinda forgets the reason why he even fights and who he is as a person and just started killing for the sake of killing which is reflected in his theme."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the other one is only available as dlc to reddit subscribers
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i told my buddy he looks like every stereotypical fratboy ever combined into one
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i loved that they gave the first punch you land on him such a deep thud. satisfying as hell.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"iirc, heimdall is the only norse god that was ruthlessly, sadistically, and brutally kratos'd. every other god got off relatively easy. and that makes me happy"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,same but the fight against him was kinda meh for me but kratos did end up giving that little bastard what he deserved.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,she goes to places that will absolutely result in her death if she gets caught and when peter expresses concern and says it's a bad idea she shuts him down by saying you babysitting me is why we broke up! like woman you aren't the one with superpowers

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,you...you do realize we actually play as miles morales in this game and that he has a spin off title right ?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,perfectenschlag
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the comedic bits in this game we're top notch! guffawed many times throughout the game and this being one of them!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,recently started this game and reached to this point yesterday. it made me laugh when he tried to punch open the chest. but all in all it is not enjoyable experience playing with boi. his dad is badass.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,atreus felt stronger to me because of that until i got the dropnir spear. i love nimble dodge and jab styles and atreus was really good for sliding around the field.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,but with kratos you get the added benefit of watching his rippling muscly shoulders as he runs
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"for real, playing atreus was fluid as hel."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"also, you can do sonic arrows to trigger status effect then melee for a quick kill on almost everything especially after you buff the status effect with upgrades and skills. all of his sections felt easy"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i used atreus as melee, lol. bow trip  downed enemy attack built up stun so fast which led into finishers."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"yeah im honestly surprised to read people immediately hated when they switched to atreus. i had a similar reaction to you and had a good time, especially because they dont really ever make you stay as atreus for too long outside of the part where they pick fruit with the ox thing lmao."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-15,"late reply, but no, they did not announce that atreus would be a playable character. i was equally shocked and pleased by the revelation!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"my one gripe with the game is that after you beat it, !you essentially lose all progress and experience with atreus. freya is a good assist, but i prefer atreus' summons over her sword attacks !"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the section isn't bad at all it just drags on way too long.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"ironwood was the worst part for me because it took me two nights to play through it. felt like a lot more exposition at once than there should have been. i liked most of the atreus sections, but the length and the let's do one more thing fakeouts made it drag. considering how kratos also serves as the voiceself insert of the player, it was fuckin perfect how kratos says you've been gone for two days especially as i was waiting to play as kratos again for that long."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,iron wood needed to be cut in half. way too long.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"the thing that i didnt like about angraboda and thrud is that it felt like they whipped them up specifically for a yet to be made atreus game. they barely had any character development besides im a giant with a big mean grandma and i wanna be a valkyrie and my dad needs an intervention. im sure theyll end up being cool eventually, but you could essentially take them out of the game and it would barely matter other than the deus ex machina part."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i was so excited when atreus !the sword! only for it to be another companion character lmao
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,to be fair atreus is 14 and teenagers do dumb shit all the time.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i think the transitions made sense for the story. you see him take an action and then you play through that decision. i havent beat the game yet but ive enjoyed it so far. and i think because of the games emphasis on story telling, this actually makes more sense."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,it didn't help that they had you play as abby in the middle of a cliffhanger. also right after she just blew a hole through best bro's head.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i think if they had swapped it up where you spent more time with abby before the joel stuff, get to really know everyone with her, give us some more time to like her. really hammer in the fact that joel didnt need to murder everyone in that building, because lets be honest, most of us in her situation or the families of any of the other people he murdered would feel the same way. show more of the repercussions of joels massacre, then bring us to joel halfway or something. then we fuck up joel and see what it does to ellie, then we continue on her side more, and give us more choices when it comes to abbys crew, or just let the rage take over and kill."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i jumped off the first cliff a few times before i actually continued the game with her lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"how i felt as well. i was initially just trying to rush through thinking it was a short sequence, it wasn't until i saw the gun upgrade stuff that i realized it was going to be a long haul. i almost put the game down but decided to finish it anyway. right away i felt they were being transparently manipulative with the dogs and stuff. it just didn't work for me. though certain sections of abby's part are cool from a gameplay standpoint, as far as story goes it just never worked for me and it reached a point with a certain boss fight where it became ridiculous"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,it was such a bad feeling to control abby. right away my brain went gotta find the fastest way to kill her to avenge.... the game really tried to force us into being empathic towards her.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"same. i understand what the devs were doing with their story telling but i'm not going to sympathize with a character that slowly and brutally murdered someone. you can't make me understand where another character is coming from when their goal was to kidnap and torture someone. there is a big difference between what joel did and what abby did. joel did it with the best of intentions, albeit selfish, but abby.....straight up fucking murder and vengeance. but wait, you get to play as her and understand her journey bullshit. i didn't even bother finishing the game, just read the synopsis if the story online and am so glad i didn't finish that story."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i actually never finished the game because of this. right at the switch off i was like fuck this and have not gone back to it in over a year.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"for the first time ever, i stopped playing a game, and watched youtube to see how it ends. i just couldn't play as abby. fuck her. how the hell am i supposed to want to keep her alive when all i want is to rip her head off?? speaks volumes for how well they did in the first one creating that connection that i just flat out stopped after i had to play as joel's killer."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"it's great to see this near the top. i always felt the second game wasn't nearly as good as the first, and one of the biggest reasons for that was the over all story structure and their decision to make me play as abby half way through the game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,don't say that around the fanboys lol it's so divisive that there are 2 tlou subreddits. one is for the fans of it and the other is for gamers who aren't fans of it but love the franchise and wish it was treated better.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yup, totally ruined the game for me as well."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"same here. the entire time i was waiting for abbys gameplay to be over, then it turned out it was a significant chunk of tlou2."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,how i felt as well until i realized that my feelings were actually at the character abby and not the writers. i did initially put the game down when i first switched to abby. i'll admit that i was determined to like the game so that's what brought me back but playing through her side is so incredible really. i really thought they did an amazing job with the second half.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,playing as abby was my favorite part of the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i always felt like it would have been better as 2 games. the first being abby's journey to find joel, and maybe a brief bit of the aftermath, keep the player in the dark about it being joel though and have it be a plot twist at the end. the second game would just be all the ellie parts from part two, with maybe a little bit of the abby perspective too. by doing it like that you might actually get a bit of a connection to abby beyond the sheer hatred we have from the start, and it builds her character and story in a much better way than just dumping it on you while you are too pissed to care."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,canny lie after playing as abby i thought ellie was just a bitch with issues. i felt immense satisfaction seeing her cry cuz she couldn't play a guitar.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i really enjoyed tlou2 until the abby swap. killing joel was absolutely an emotional moment and was honestly executed extremely well. i liked joel and his death pulled me in and gripped me hard. but abby i never connected with. her story felt like a forced metaphor so bluntly cudgeled over your head that it quickly lost all impact. i didn't care to see her growth as a character at all and just became a well built third person shooter with a boring story. i see arguments that people just don't understand the meaning of the abby arc and that's why they don't like it, this is absurd. the abby storyline is not subtle or intricate in it's delivery. everyone got it, it's not really that complex. the drop in quality of storytelling is one of the major reasons that segment was so tiresome and felt like a slog. abby's entire section could have been dramatically reduced in length and scope and gotten the exact same story across perfectly without grinding the pacing to a halt."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"i think it was just presented badly. the story was nearing it's climax after quite a bit of play time and then... no resolution for quite a while. not saying everyone would have loved it, but at least people would have been more open to see what comes next if it didn't feel like the game just robbed you from a satisfying ending."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,it did ruin it for me. i quit playing then. i know game is good but that made me completely uninterested in playing even a good game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,yep same. plus youre replaying the story when you already know what happens as ellie. i found it so tedious as well as frustrating. i thought maybe id be playing as her for a few minutes like at the start. when it kept going i just got bored.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yeah i was originally pissed off that joel died, but now i'm glad he left such an awfully written game before his character was ruined"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,don't forget mel. i think she was even more boring and annoying.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the love triangle with abby owen and the other girl was so dumb and unnecessary. great gameplay in tlou2 tho. just a meh story compared to the first.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,hated the whole game. from start to finish it felt like i was bashing my head against the stupid wall. everything the characters did all of them was dumb.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i got it out early. i grew to really like abby. but you can bet her jacked ass that i launched her off that rooftop she was so scared of a good dozen times
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"her dad was killed while trying to forcibly vivisect a small child. the situations arent even vaguely similar, thats why it was so strange that the game insisted that we see ellie and abby as equals."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i actually enjoyed tlou2 more than tlou1
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,they are the same character. they turned ellie into abby and tried to turn abby into ellie.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,fanboys as if it isn't one of the most successful sequels ever lol spoiler more people like it than don't
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,removed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,game has 0 likeable characters  i never played it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,that's a lot of shit talk for a game you didn't play
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"ellie isn't likeable but she's a fuckin beast. so is she hulk, though i hate her more."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,well yea they designed ellie to be weak and abby to be super strong.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the gameplay was far superior in the sequel... did you even play it? that's an absurd statement
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,saying the gameplay is worse shows how wrong you are honestly lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,yeah as much as i enjoyed it for what it was...the last 6 hours of that game give or take are rough. the hunting for abbey...the decision to let her go after finding her...just all of it. it felt needlessly muddy at the end.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yikes, the good old, you must be a misogynist if you didn't like it. as if there aren't tons of strong women in gaming that for some reason aren't that controversial..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,my personal problem with abby is that her defining characteristic is i'm angry and her decision making for better or worse isn't because of being blinded by anger but rather poor decision making and illogical choices. i will say her sections with the kid sidekick is really great though. everything that doesn't have to do with her relationship to ellie in my opinion is way better than most parts of the game as a whole.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,no. everything she did was devoid of any and all logic. her characters purpose and reasoning behind all of it was terrible and lacked wisdom or motivation for the audience at all.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,its not abby its the story direction and plot behind her.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,annoyed they made it so cheap. i'm ok with him dying for good story. that death was not good story.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i think there was only one instance where i truly disliked this ff8, when you have to split up into two separate parties, around when you got out of the desert prison ?. yeah no, i did not ever train with those 3 from the second party and playing with seriously underleveled, underequipped characters wasn't really all that much fun.."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,no they just loved cloud
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"dunno why you're being downvoted. you're right, he's wrong. i guess some people never played the original."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i recall that you could also encounter random enemies on the path to the reactor, where he'd use aoe magic. might have been a scripted scene, though, can't recall for sure."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"and one of them will always make this exact comment, phrased in the exact same way, without fail."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,atreus was awesome to play and it was refreshing to have a different kind of gameplay.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"so are you, what's the difference?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,still waiting for the sadie dlc

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,you talking about sam?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,oh totally i came around to him too. but when the game came out the amount of people that were bamboozled by the switch was insane.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"wasn't a fan of him complaining all the time, but then again i was put in the same situation i would be complaining about being tasked with disposing of bombs without having any experience"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the first game i can agree. you very obviously did not play the second game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i disagree, as a pubescent teenager learning about hormones playing as atreus is fun and relatable"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,lol what a great way to express such an interesting opinion.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"fuck you right, that slipped my mind. i adjusted it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i just didnt see that my bad
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,santa monica studios in this case
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,abby has very little redeeming qualities and is gross looking. it wasn't ambitious it was trying to be woke and it failed.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"a lot of people think if the story of a video game doesn't match what they would have done or written, it is automatically bad. let yourself be challenged by the narrative"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,some day you will learn that just because something is more mature doesn't automatically make it good.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"the characters are well written, motives easily understandable. except this falls apart with the ending with ellie forcing abby into a bloody duel... and then letting her live so nd could get a part 3. it's nonsense and makes no sense. if ellie committed to killing abbie to become the overarching villain then it would've been much better."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i really liked the game. thing about game of thrones is characters can turn out to be total pieces of trash and it adds a lot to the experience of watching. in a game having to play as that piece of trash is difficult to stomach. i do think it did a good job of showing you there's more to a person than what is there initially on the outside. you learn quickly to hate but it puts you in a position where you then have to come learn about that person and come to terms with the fact she isn't as terrible as you first thought. that experience right there is what helps set the game apart from so many others and from just watching a story in a show or movie.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i found tlou2 unplayable once i was playing as abby. i was unable to make any gameplay decisions that resulted in her living. i'll admit, suiciding her into infected was satisfying for a while, but eventually i got bored and went to play something else."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"ok, thats my bad because i dont like to play new games on old hardware that doesnt run it very well but thats very much a personal preference that not everyone shares. but the fact that you change characters from kratos for the first time in eight games is definitely a fucking spoiler."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"who wouldn't? joel said himself he used to be a hunter. those people killed innocent people. joel, we loved joel, but consequences have actions, and even if you're justified to kill, others will be justified to lay that blade upon you as well."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"to save fucking humanity, and ellie was cool with that, theres no comparison here"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"joel killing abby's dad and abby killing joel are morally identical, on the individual level, from the pov of abbyellie. they both inspire the daugher to get revenge. the only difference is that both characters seem to realise the futility of if all when they fight at the end which, luckily for abby, results in ellie letting her live."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,why would it matter to them what you think? you didn't buy the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i rage quit when i had to play as abby. after i got over myself, i was able to play it and enjoy it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,which is totally fine
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,most people did.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i was completely the opposite. witcher 3 and the spiderman game was the example i had in mind when i made the post. i'd love a witcher game where i play as ciri and it looks like she may be the next logical step for the franchise which i'm excited for. but i did not care for that section of the game at all.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i was literally gonna say thank goodness you can just dash through her parts. but yes great game. started a new play through with the updated visuals last week.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,thats awesome. ive heard a lot of good things about that game but ive never tried it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"this game is frustrating, because it's tough as nails."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"holy shit that game is good, i know no one asked but i have now beaten all stages, no hit, on the hardest difficulty, but i still suck at normal fighting games"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"if you played it on the wii with motion controls then i'd definitely suggest trying it with a controller on another platform, the swings just never registered for me and ended up getting me killed 910 times"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i came to say something very like this.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i liked playing abby. her fighting was so brutal.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"it helps that he manages to be distinct from raiden in gameplay while still being amazing to control. i'd kill for a mod that gives you sam's style for the main game, not gonna lie."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"also, he's hot"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,apparently santa monica purposefully designed him with the most punchable face. so it was actually intended.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,i was really hoping he'd get the poseidon treatment. he's the one character outside of odin obviously that deserved it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,he loved the fact that heimdall was truthfully just doing his job and doing it well. atreus realy was there to destroy everything and heimdall saw through his lies. sure he was abrasive but he was right. id say theres something wrong with people who love atreus because hes a lying manipulative little asshole. atreus characters real name in the norse mythology is not normally treated as a good guy.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,parts of missions where you have to follow an npc who is faster than your walking speed but slower than your running speed or they stop in place waiting for you to follow them if you go ahead of them they should be illegal as well
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i kinda shitted my pants but it was nice yes p
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,sometimes. unless the mission specifically says not to or they'll kill the hostage.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"this is absolutely true, and is pretty consistent with comic logic in general. but did you just quote yourself?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"doesn't matter why they are in the game if the parts are insufferable and boring? if they had other reasons what do you think were the reasons it was done so badly? with so little effort? tell me where the fun is in hiding in cover, watching stupid linear ai move to another spot, so you can move, then repeat it 20 times until you can go back to the fun part of the game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"wtf, how is miles morales the game, which is awesome, an argument for boring ass gameplay in spider man? i don't want to play as a basic ass human, that can't walk anywhere that isn't designed for me, 0 alternative routes, 0 interactivity besides the only and only thing. that is not gameplay to me, that is just bad game design. if you like the mj part i only liked the museum part, that was where they did a little effort and the morales part, fine, i'm glad you can enjoy such simple mechanics, i didn't."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"this game is proper funny with its writing, i loved it! the moment i heard the octopus is called dinner, i immediately thought so where's lunch only for atreus to call one of them lunch when you first spot them made me feel like a kid again with such a thought seriously, the funny dialogues in this game just feels so natural, like actual human adults would joke around, not terrible one liners that feels forced"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i like this riddle
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"it's kinda funny how much i hated the spear at first. then i got the hang of using it to stick  move quickly and suddenly i realized that i hadn't touched the axe in ages never forsook my beloved blades, though."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i really like freya more with her valkyrie form in combat situations. really helps in a lot of situations, that being said the summons were also very nice though so not having the possibility anymore sucked indeed"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"this especially sucks !if you didn't do all the side quests as there is some missable dialogue, like the big sky jellyfish in the alfheim desert.!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i agree, but i feel like it fit the narrative. !kratos made a lot of progress with atreus and had to accept letting go. he didn't want to, but he had to, and had to learn to live with what came after ! both of these games did a great job of connecting the mechanics to the narrative."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,god atreus would be a godsend for that bonus valk. i miss my rat summon.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yeah the things you learn to develop the story are interesting, but they occur in like two minutes of dialogue inside a section that takes hours. the boss fight in there is fun though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i think the only problem was that ironwood happened so suddenly. like, i thought it would be a 10 min dream sequence. if i knew it was officially ironwood time, i probably wouldn't have minded as much"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"ironwood was sooo effing long. i forget just how long it was sometimes. i did the same thing. those sections, in like every game that has the character switch off thing, always feel like they're going to be quick. i had work in the morning. ironwood was kinda boring. i figured i'd finish that section so i didn't have to pick up on it the next day. i ended up just having to quit midway. i kept waiting for it to end and it just didn't. it's a super slow introduction to playable atreus and his side of the story. it gets a lot more interesting in asgard, but i felt a lot of his playable sections were too long. he spends a good amount of time away. they should've chopped it up a bit more throughout the story. it gave me tlou 2 flashbacks. i like that game, but i just remember taking over playing as this character i didn't know or like. thinking it was going to be an interesting little bridge in the story. and you end up playing as her for like 7 freaking hours."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the only part i would cut is when you go underground
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"it's ok to have static secondary characters, expecially when you have such dynamic lead charecters. like gow r has so many charecters that go through major arcs like freya, boi, kratos, thor and sindri. you need some static charecters like odin, brock, freyr, thrud and angraboda to ground the story and allow you to better observe the changes that happen in the dynamic charecters. if everyone is dynamic the story is gonna lose its cohesion"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"people always asking me to name something dumb i did when i was 14, a better question would be something dumb i didn't do at 14"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"in hindsight of my comment, i have come to same conclusion as you have. i think the transitions actually are good and i greatly enjoy the game overall. however, i will still be mildly annoyed for a moment when switching to a character i disagree with. but that is a feeling which will pass."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,the biggest issue with tlou2 was the way the two chapters were structured. if they had a short intro with ellie and joel and then switched to abby and her friends either on their way to jackson you don't know what the reason is until she kills joel or on their way back from jackson. x200b the biggest mistake was making you hate abby and then go through the process of killing all her friends and then switching to her pov to try and make you like them when you dont and they're already dead anyway.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"you dont see her shooting tommy until you get in the theatre as abby. edit oh i just got who best bro was, my bad ..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i'm still baffled by peoples inability to empathize with abby. like the game basically forces you to feel what she felt when her dad was killed by joel, and yet everyone acts like she's just a monster."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"they did it that way to give you the blood thirsty revenge ellie has for joel. completely dehumanized abby with the opening sequence, so you and ellie are of the same mindset to find and kill abby and her friends."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"if i had a relative who tried to kill a man who was saving his daughter, i wouldn't have much sympathy for my relative. this is why i don't have any sympathy for abbys father. he not only rushed rushed ellie into surgery but begged marlene to agree to it. people say but it's what ellie wants, well ok but why rush her into surgery? there was no need. they could have woken her up, treated her like a queen, let her say goodbye. but no, they rushed her into surgery and tried to frog march joel out of the building with instructions to kill him if he tried anything. this is why the whole revenge plot doesn't work for me and therefore makes abby an unlikeable character."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"really hammer in the fact that joel didnt need to murder everyone in that building issue is that in 1 joel spent the entire time running tf away from the fireflies while holding ellie. and last time i checked, he only killed marlene and the surgeon and then took off. feels like in 2 they made joel even worse than needed."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i simply don't understand it. what ellie does is many times worse than anything abby did, and you're forced to experience ellie doing this awful psycho things before you switch characters. the whole point of tlou1 is that joel is a villain. a charismatic and well intentioned villain, but evil all the same. his comeuppance was the natural extension of the story and makes for a much better piece of art."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,dude holy crap i did the same thing. i thought it was like a small cutscene of hey look at her perspective and how she was doing. then i realized half the game was her and i still tried to finish her part as fast as possible lol.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"are you old enough to have played metal gear solid 2 when it first came out? at least in tlouii you get to play as ellie again later in the game, in mgs2 you spent the rest of the game as a totally different character."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"same. it didn't help that we had to essentially start from zero again weaponswise and skillwise. also, i didn't really give a damn about the dogs. they were trying to kill me first as ellie, i wasn't just gonna let then bite off my neck"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,feel exactly the same way! happy others do to and im not insane for not either loving it or hating it 100. game would work much better if they would've just rearranged some sections.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,right away i felt they were being transparently manipulative with the dogs and stuff. what a weird way to frame it as if all media is trying to manipulate you into feeling things lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"most people dont realize that ellie was the antagonist in that game, not abby, even though they tried to show the player that through ellies increasingly villainous actions. just looking at it from a little further away shows it. organized science group is trying to find a cure or vaccine to save countless lives and rebuild the world. one person is shown to have immunity and volunteers to be put down and examined feasibility of that method aside to try and find out what makes it work so it can be replicated. completely unrelated 3rd party decides to nullify her choice, murder everyone who is trying to help, including an unarmed doctor in cold blood, and abduct an unconscious girl without her consent. the daughter of the murdered doctor after years finds out where the maniac is and kills only him. side note, how many games, movies and books entire plot is the good guy saying i must avenge my fathermother! and then they kill everyone. they even let the girl go after only knocking her out. she then goes on a rampage killing every person she sees, even members of the same group who, although they were admittedly dicks, had nothing to do with joels death and in fact wouldnt have allowed abby to go do it anyway. plus a completely unrelated 3rd group. thankfully, they also sucked and were crazy, but she would have never met them had she not made the choices she made. speaking of choices, she double crosses her friend who had left ahead of her to accomplish the same mission she has, on the possibility that she might find abby somewhere. she leaves him to die, cornered and ambushed, and abandons her friend who helped get her that far in the first place when he goes to rescue the aforementioned friend. thats after endangering the life of a girl she loves, whom she knows is pregnant, thereby endangering the life of the baby as well. meanwhile, yes, abby shoots notglen in the head. after tracking the three murderous terrorist nutjobs who she knew were the henchman of the guy who killed her father, who came tracking over to her settlement and were killing all her neighbors in an attempt to track her down, even after she showed them mercy. then, when you play as abby, you only kill 2 kinds of enemies. infected, and cultists who you live next door to and are already embroiled in a war with after a failed peace treaty and who attempt to kill you on site. on top of all that, abby plays with a dog. and is, in my opinion, more fun to play as. she has all the same weapon combat as ellie but parkours faster and has better melee combat. but i just like punching the zombies."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"i'd say the game is definitely trying to frustrate you there. it's no mistake that the game tells you that abby's scared of heights...and then immediately gives you tons of high places to launch her off. they know that the player will likely be angry in that moment and that no amount of dogs will change that yet. the game uses the medium quite uniquely to capitalise on your frustrations with ellie and your hate for abby. a major theme of the game, and a constant thread throughout ellie's flashbackscharacterisation is learning to live with someone who you can't forgive. this is why you play as abby. the game is intentionally making you feel ellie's frustration. in the second half you're in a position where you're trapped with someone who you can't forgive, and who's motivations, moral choices and inate violence is offensive to you. just like ellie, who is in a constant struggle to forgiveunderstand joel. and just like ellie, you're seeing this person supposedly being good reflecting joel's kind and responsible behaviour in jackson, despite the dark truth that only ellie knows. this is a struggle that she never got closure for. this is also why abby is so similar to joel, both in gameplay style and characterisation."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,yeah that was the point
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i ran her into zombies about 30 times, then uninstalled the game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i always said that tlou2 gives you the biggest revenge boner in history only to slap it with a 2by4. still love it though.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,one is for fans of it and the other is for people to harass the creators of it on twitter and to make trans people bad jokes
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"wish it was treated better this is the most biased shit i've ever read lmao last of franchise has in no way been mistreated, that one sub is just full of psychotic losers"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"haven't played it in a while, and i forgot she was even in the game, so that tells you something. the abby side characters, with the exception of lev, were all pretty boring and forgettable."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"spoilers ahead, people. !i absolutely loved when she died. most annoying character in that game by far.!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i thought it was far and away superior to tlou1 in every way which is honestly a pretty mid game outside of the twist at the end. really interesting how people can have such strongly different takeaways.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"the only game i've ever played where i was wishing for it to end. but, there was always a new episode next. too long, too monotonous."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,you cant say that here sir
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,you know if you arent enjoying a game you can just stop playing?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,anyone who doesn't like conflict doesn't understand how movies and games are made in the first place. life is conflict. people that cry that they don't like a certain thing or way is working out is either too entitled or just idiots. downvotes all you want. this game was amazing and they took a huge chance. i really dislike how people treated the actress that played abby. i really dislike people who don't think the last of us series isn't one of the best made. along with the witcher series. are you even a gamer or just a stupid individual?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i grew to like her too. well maybe not like hersome things you cant come back from. but i at least understood her pov and the game does a good job at making you feel like everyone is a pos.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"lol you are 100 correct. it's amazing seeing these people just ignoring the fact that abbys dad only got killed cos he rushed ellie into surgery. had they woke her up she likely would have agreed to it but at least it was her consent and it let her say goodbye. he totally got what he deserved,"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,....you're kinda glossing over the whole this is supposed to savethis is our last chance to save the human race though no...? hes not vivisecting for fun lol cmon now
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,same
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"almost but not quite, abby targeted joel, ellie went for everyone. she made abby's friends suffer excessively"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i...what? understandable? only joel was understandable, he did what he did to survive, he didn't like it, but he did it. everyone else? did it because revenge. the game played like a bad fanfiction."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"and that might be true, but also yikes if you can relate with them. i too would totally allow a pregnant woman to join me on my high risk missions in the mids of a zombie apocalypse. very relatable bro. they are flawed in the say way as flat earthers, criminals and assholes are flawed. egoistical with 0 charm or redeeming qualities. just like ellie 2.0. edit people claiming i can't judge a game by watching gameplay, tell me your favorite part of the game then. because all the footage i have seen didn't sell me on the game despite being a huge fan of last of us 1"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,ellie is not weak.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"not having a sympathetic duo to interact with like in game 1 is far worse gameplay. better animations don't make better game play. it would be like cutting the ai companion from bioshock infinite but improving the animations...yikes, no thanks. what made bioshock such a master piece was the interactions in fights and in general between the two likeable characters, not the gunplay or animations. but of course you can't expect good reasoning from tlou 2 fans"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"it just felt... disjointed? like two people couldnt agree on the direction the story should take and just instead mashed their ideas together. but god forbid you criticize the game, you're automatically a misogynist and a transphobe."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,got some specifics?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"ah, yeah i get that. it was a bit disorienting at first for me but i thought it was well executed. felt a bit long overall at points but im happy naughty dog took a risk and made an experimental move. i thought part ii is better than the first in every way."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yeah no, i did not ever train with those 3 from the second party and playing with seriously underleveled i'm almost certain it's impossible to have both groups on level unless you played with squall ko'd. he can't be swapped out except that one part and enemy level is dependent on his level. not like that really matters with how op stat junctioning was..."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"not sure wasnt even snarky about it. but overall, im not seeing significant downvotes  was never below 10 when i saw the first reply, which is downvoted."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"gameplay was fun, yes. but i did not like the character. kid just ends up hurting everyone around him."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"haha yes! expecting to play badass, grizzled hero solid snake but whoops, you're actually some long haired pretty boy."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i finished it, wtf are you talking about? i actually liked young atreus more than teen atreus. teen atreus doesn't listen to shit  and even admits he thinks he should listen but is choosing not to anyway because he thinks he knows what's best. that alone sent me over the edge of not liking him."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,oh yes woke the most intellectual criticism along with the if i dont want to fuck it i dont want to play as it nice
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"lol and is gross looking. gg, not even worth engaging."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,lol the fact that one of your criticisms of the character is that she didnt make your pp hard tells me everything that i need to know about you.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,so women have to be attractive to you for you to care about them? do you apply the same logic to men in games? of course you don't.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,haha i hope this is a poe you just to perfectly hit on the outraged gamer talking points
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"saying she's gross looking really wasn't the best way to go about it. i agree that in terms of personality she is a horrible person, but physical appearance shouldn't really factor into that. i mean yeah, in terms of physical appearance, abby is 100 my kind of woman, but that's beside the point."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,of course! i would never say otherwise. there are plenty of reasons why the story can be considered good that have nothing to do with that. for example i think if you took literally the same story and put it into book form people would love it with some embellishments. i honestly feel people just got very attached to papa joel even though he was clearly very morally flawed. however different strokes for different folks and all that
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,if you play the game it makes perfect sense. all game she struggles with her need for revenge and commits atrocities to do so. she kills all of abbys friends and family. she let her live because she was finally realizing after beating up on abbys emaciated form and seeing levi there with her that killing her would literally change nothing and would just continue the violence. it was a final straw moment where she realized with vengeance at hand it simply wasnt worth it. i was overjoyed when she refused to kill abby. it meant a return of the ellie i knew and not the monster of revenge. she was finally letting go and that meant she could heal and get on with her life with no more bloodshed. she regained control instead of spiraling. which is the happiest ending you can have in the last of us universe.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,or ill what a weird way of saying the game was too hard lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"going even further !when given the chance in every instance where she actually had the upper hand and the ability to end ellie's life, abby chose to let her live.!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yea, an eye for an eye! perpetual violence in a blind world!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"to save fucking humanity, and ellie was cool with that, theres no comparison here to maybe save fucking humanity, and ellie was cool with knowing nothing about that, theres no comparison here"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the no hit speedruns are awesome
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i know i need to git gud but i found that game very hard. i got to the museum boss and i gave up. i tried picking it up again and now i need to restart because i forgot all the game mechanics. i'm playing on the default difficulty because i'm too stubborn to lower it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i never had a nintendo console, i played it on the 360. i liked the 360, it had so many games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"funny thing for me was, i played it on the wii as a kid then picked it up off ps and found never really get back into it. still want to finish it, but feels different now."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,you are kidding right? wii version was even more insanely unbalanced with the force powers which was insanely fun in its own right
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"it's actually bugged out depending on what version you play. the pc version doesn't vibrate when the controller should vibrate to tell you to pull it down. on the other flagship versions, the controls shown onscreen aren't correct to when you should be doing what. follow what kota tells you to do instead of the onscreen prompts and you can do it in one cycle of the tie fighters. edit it occurs to me that it might still not be obvious  you need to straighten the star destroyer so it's facing starkiller, and so the nose is tipped up. when the controls turn green and start vibrating heavy on ps3360, just gently use the controller to keep the sd in exactly that spot and in a moment kota will say bring it down, boy! pull r2 and then pull both sticks straight down. you can take a round or two of the tie, so if you're really fast you can do the whole thing in one pass."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,same until i found out what the other commented said and completely ignored on screen prompts'
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,rng thats kinda the point of the whole dlc tho. its the nemesis system on roids with no forgiveness
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i'm cool with her story and gameplay. i think they should have told her story reverse how they did. make me empathize with her for most of the game first and then reveal her target and backstory closer to the end.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,her story was great  and necessary to reflect ambiguity
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"only thing i didn't like was the armstrong fight, it is fucking brutal and if you don't time your dodges right you're screwed. also i'm pretty sure there are mods that ley you play as sam in campaign, i think i saw a video like that, or it might just be a mod that changes raiden's model to sam's."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"odin is fucking hilarious when you first arrive in asgard too, really helps sell how good of a manipulator he is because his humor is so disarming. the bar fight with thrud and thor is goofy fun. and of course ratatoskor voiced by the best youtube comedian prozd, with his alter egos bitter and anxious plus so many gags in gameplay. one in the dwarf area where you are getting 2018 flashbacks when you get grabbed by a troll, just for kratos to instantly fuck him up in 2 seconds. and other one in the crater where a dragon swoops in and killsteals your oger"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,was there ever an answer for the riddle? i heard so many wrong ones during the game but a few lines i didnt get to fully hear.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,as soon as you unlock the heavy runic that rains dozens of spears from the sky the spear becomes awesome
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i wouldn't so much consider this missable dialogue, as you get different dialogue because of freya. it's more a reason to play the game differently the second time through."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i just replayed it from the beginning .
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"from a lore standpoint it is very fitting, not so much from a gameplay standpoint though"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"idk, freyas poison cloud with fully upgraded lundas armor is a pretty nice endgame combo"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yes it's especially egregious because there's some times when they literally repeat themselves on something they said five minutes prior. it starts out really strong and the aftermath of it is also very good but the middle is uuh. jtunheim is really made well tho, love the colors and atmosphere, it's full of life. very surprising in a good way since in the last game the section we were in was bleak and abandoned."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"for whatever it's worth, my sister who watched me play through most of the game enjoyed that section a lot. narratively it's ok, gameplay wise...eh. definitely that part of gowr."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"can't believe we left sindri like we did tbh, never have i wanted more for a resolution to a charactcers troubles, but man we're probably going to have to wait for another game for that, santa monica doesn't seem to do dlc."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,dude i did way more dumb shit once i had a drivers license lol.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"forced is this game's mo. it has themes about the destructive cycle of violence and revenge and how those things are bad. it explores those themes mechanically by having you collect pills to get better at headshots and forcibly killing everyone in order to progress. then the game tries to force you to feel bad for participating in the violence that you had absolutely no hand in creating. the switch to abby would've worked if lou2 wasn't a sequel and we knew nothing about joel, but our connection to him from the first game means that even though he arguably deserved what he got, we still don't want him to die. so when abby kills him, we obviously don't want to empathize with her. if someone close to you has been murdered, does knowing the murderer as a person and why they did it really make you feel better about it?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the game basically forces you to feel... this is what a lot of complaints boil down to
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"my problem with the sequence was the timing, as the commenter said above it halts all momentum for the story at its climax. i wanted to know what happened to the characters i was playingjourneying with and the game forces your to spend hours to get back to that moment to find out what happened. i think i was going okay, yeah i get it abby and ellie are very similar people in nearly identical situations and this is basically the pain arc in naruto its like they took 8 hours to tell something that should have taken 30 mins my biggest issue with the game forcing you to kill a dog then making you feel like a shitty person for doing the thing the game forced you to do, that just feels dirty"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,well done for stating the exact problem. noone should be forced to feel.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"because her dad deserved to die for rushing ellie into surgery without waking her up or getting her consent. but ellie wanted it fireflies don't know that, joel is unsure of it, ellie just told him she will go wherever he wants to go after they visit the fireflies. it doesn't justify them not waking her up. they could have woken her up, treated her like a queen and let her say goodbye. but no. this forced joel to do what he did. unlike abby if i found out my relative tried to kill a child but get busted, i wouldn't want revenge. also abby turns her back on the wlf within 24 hours or something, people she has loved and fought with for years. she is not a good character."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"i like abby way more than ellie. joel fucked up and the consequences finally caught up. was it necessary? not really, but understandable. was it necessary for ellie to go after abby after knowing what happened, getting revenge on everyone but abby. killing 100s of people just to get to her, abandoning her gf and child. then because it's still not enough, you beat up and almost kill the girl who had already suffered way more than she herself ever did. and thats the person i should emphasize with? naa i won't. i hated ellie in tlou2"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"i think it was mostly just paced wrong. like arby's seattle story is completely detached from ellie's, and i think that is the reason it's hard for some people to empathize with her. like maybe instead of the plot of her becoming lev's surrogate mother, abby's storyline consists of her basically being caught in the wake of ellie's vengeance. instead of flashbacks to when she and owen were dating, we get flashbacks of her and one of her friends showing why they're such good buddies, then have the gameplay section being her finding the bloody remains of that friend. i think something along those lines would have solved a ton of issues for some people."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"the content from this account has been removed in protest by its owner in direct response to reddit's increased api charges for thirdparty apps, but also in protest of reddit's general move away from its founding principles, it's abuse of moderation positions and its increasingly exploitative data and privacy practices. it was changed using powerdeletesuitehttpsgithub.comj0bepowerdeletesuite."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,plus there was absolutely no guarantee they could even save anything from doing that surgery.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,literally joel's rampage could've been avoided if they just sat down with joel and ellie and explained everything after joel had woken up. it always bit at me that the fireflies just decided to not tell joel or ellie she would lose her life as a result until after she is sedated.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"eh, if youre a family member of guard 3, and he was killed while protecting what they thought wouldve been the end of the cordyceps, youd be pretty pissed. the rest of the world isnt joel, they dont care like he cares for ellie, they care about their families. revenge isnt always reasonable or well thought out, take away a persons loved ones and they might get a little unhinged. for instance, exactly what joel does, he kills a lot of people who think theyre doing the right thing for a person he loves. i think they shouldve humanized abby first, then go into the unhinged, maybe make her dad some random fuck guard, and i think it wouldve worked better."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"you say that about your relative, but they and those around them probably truly thought they could stop the cordyceps. especially if your dad was just a guard doing his job, if you heard some guy blew his brains out, you might be upset. if your dad is a doctor doing what think could fix shit, and a guy blows his brains out instead of knocking him out, you might be upset. if your reaction is the same as abbys, you could say what they do to joel is unreasonably cruelit was, but she likely thought the same for what joel did. like i said, they couldve done it a lot better, like if her killing joel was this spur of the moment thing, and you have ellie go through that same revenge."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i feel like that's a weird way to brush off abby wanting revenge. she didn't just have a relative die. she had her only parent, her father die because he was trying to save humanity. sure what he was doing was wrong but so was joel. it's all shitty. abby wasn't even in the room to see what happened. from her perspective, joel killed her dad, took off with ellie, and doomed humanity. how does that make abby unlikable for wanting revenge on joel? it doesn't make her a good person but what would you want to do if you were her? and guess what, ellie even tried to do the same thing when abby kills her only parental figure. the only difference is she becomes the better person realizing that continuing the cycle of violence will just make her lose more of herself. that's what both joel and abby couldn't do without having something to love ellie and lev. like i get if you needed more to relate to abby, but this is already like a 20 hour game. it would've been too cramped imo."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"people forget that 1. the fireflies had tried to formulate the vaccine and failed numerous times. killing those in the process 2. there is 0 indication that a vaccine is even possible for a fungal infection 3. the fireflies were going to execute joel either way 4. the fireflies are domestic terrorists who regularly killed cops, random people, blew up checkpoints etc. 5. there's no way they were going to distribute the vaccine either way. 6. abby's dad wasn't even a real doctor let alone a surgeon. he had a bachelors in biology and nothing more, he's closer to a veternarian"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,depends how you played it. i was a new dad to a little girl. i emptied that building out. i went out of my way to kill everyone and anyone who heard of what happened there.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"doesn't matter if he killed 1 or a ton, he killed for ellie. in the last mission joel definitely domes a guard in the cutscene, proceeds to murder many others during the gameplay segment, kills the doctors, then finishes with marlene. joel was definitely as bad as portrayed in 2."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"lol that is not true at all. almost everyone in the first game is flawed, they are all shitty people as tess points out. joel is neither a hero or a villain, he is a survivor. abbys dad tried to kill a child without consent. but it's what ellie wanted yeh but that's not a reason to rush her into surgery without waking her or talking to her."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the people here dont like the truth. youre correct in the first paragraph. not so much the second one. check my comment somewhere in this thread.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yeah, i remember playing mgs2 and being surprised by the change in protagonist, and had trouble accepting it for a while, but it didn't bother me all that much because i didn't hate raiden lol. i guess i can say i respect naughty dog for taking big risks with their choices but at least for me it didn't pay off to make me play as the very person i wanted to destroy. i'm not really sure what the message of the game is either other than some generic cycle of violence is bad which i didn't need a game to tell me. also the game is a contradiction because as a game it makes it fun to violently murder humans throughout its playtime."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"comparison barely works, as raiden and snake are working towards the same goal, itd be more like if after the arsenal gear lore dump, the choking sequence and the whole i made you into the broken person you are raiden thing the game then flashed back for another 6 hours of gameplay and made you play as solidus and tried to make you empathize with him. when your first proper introduction to a character is to make them horribly at odds with and generally responsible for the worst parts of the life of the character youve been with for a whole games worth of play beforehand, liking the new character is an obscenely hard sell. nearly the worst possible first impression you could give"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"it didn't help that we had to essentially start from zero again weaponswise and skillwise. that's the only part that really bothered me. storywise i thought the abby section was fine and from a narrative perspective the go back to day 1 and see it from the other side thing can be a great technique, but in a game it felt like a punishment being robbed of all my character progression like that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"it would have worked much better if you could finish ellie's campaign, and then unlocked abby's. the swap killed the pacing. that's my only complaint, the game was just too damn long."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yeah, you kill people crying to their friendsmompregnant whatever but people draw the line at a beast trying to kill you lmao"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"what i mean when i say that is it felt kind of cheap. like they were trying to achieve their goal by weaponizing cute dogs rather than by making the character interesting or likeable on her own. i can't speak for anyone else, but i just never really got over abby or her monstrous behavior, from my point of view joel's behavior depicted in the last game was justifiable so to me abby was a monster. and no amount of dog petting will change that in my eyes. furthermore, they surrounded her with a cast of characters, her friends, who were either unlikeable or dull and made us listen to them talk for long stretches of time just my opinion, obviously. it's a tough game for me to talk about because in so many ways the game is a master class. the presentation, the acting, the technical achievement, and yet by the end i just felt exhausted, kind of bored, and completely uninvested in any of the characters. again, this is just my take, if you got something more out of this game than i did that's cool."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,ellie was the antagonist in that game ellie and abby are very clearly the protagonists... the protagonist is not who is good or bad but who the story is about... it's like saying joel is the antagonist because of his actions at the end of tlou1
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"isnt it implied that the fireflies had found a few people like ellie, and they hadnt been successful before? been ages since i played the first game so idk."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"no it wasn't. it's amazing to me that people still think this. the game was trying to show you that both abby and ellie are every bit as bad as each other. they both mow through thralls of people to get to this one person they hate. in their mind, that is justified, because they have both been wronged. but in actual fact, they are both awful. abby's friend mel even spells it out to her when saying where she and her ex are going. she literally tells her what a piece of shit she is. even her friends think that. you're not supposed to like her at all. it's trying to show you what revenge does to people and how it poisons everyone around you. their awful actions are also reflected in the actions of the wlf and the seraphites. nobody in that game is the good guy. that's the point."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,thats because her friends killed joel to and also supported abby during his toture. i'll give ellie that but still didn't like who she became either.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the whole message of the game was lost on you then. sounds like you'd prefer a nice disney game where everyone's an uncomplicated shade of good or bad.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i loved the game and the abby character but i think it wouldve benefitted from having you play as her first. play it off like the game has a new protagonist and lets you get to know her friends and story then swaps it back to ellie. itd make the murdering of her gang feel more impactful. by the time you go through her stuff you cant really get emotionally attached to the side characters knowing you just murdered them.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"you aren't literally forced...you are only forced to feel in the way that you are with literally any other main character in any other story. were we forced to feel a certain way about joel and ellie in part 1? no, but by experiencing their story we eventually do. but abby is the antagonist, and we don't have a relationship with her at the beginning of the game, so we naturally want to take ellies side in the conflict. the only thing the story ask of you think about what happened objectively, and when you do, you realize that there is no correct side in their conflict. that's why i'm baffled. is it really so hard for some people to put aside their bias towards ellie and realize that abby is no worse? conventional wisdom tells us there are two sides to every story. so why was that so hard for people to accept?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"incorrect. ellie knows exactly what they want to do and agrees with it. joel is the one that acted without consent. ellie even says as much. also, because the wlf turned to murderous monsters. you see that throughout the entire game. the game goes through great lengths to subtly tell you ellie is the bad guy, and abby is the good one. they show you the wlf has turned bad, they show you through abbys actions compared to ellies. they even show you through old school film tricks. when a movie wants to use shorthand to show you who the bad guy is, or who is not to be trusted, they have them kick the dog. basically, they hurt or kill an animal. who hurts and kills several dogs, and who plays and hangs out with one?"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"joel kills hundreds of people, many of which are innocents. hell, it starts with him killing people as part of his organized crime work. nobody would ever say a gang member who murders members of a rival gang are good people. and tlou2 firmly established that ellie disagrees with joel's decision. further, joel also acknowledges that it was wrong, but says he'd do it again anyway. and that's the point! people with the right intentions sometimes do bad things. are they evil? good? it's entirely perspective. and grappling with that is hard."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i generally agree with everything you wrote in it. although i think that joel qualifies as the antagonist in the first game for the same reasons ellie does in the second. at the end of the day he literally murders a hospital full of innocents. in doing so, he also destroys the only faction with redeeming qualities, and damns the human race to decades of pain, death, and misery. further, his motivations for doing so are to save somebody who didn't want to be saved, and he lies to cover it up. the beauty of it is you understand his motivations for doing so, and sympathize with him. and that's what's so cool."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i think to some extent that exhausted feeling was intentional.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"youre right, i misspoke. they are both the protagonists of the story, from opposite objectives, which makes them both the antagonists as well. what i should have said hero or villain. although i hesitate to refer to either of them as the hero, while ellie is absolutely the villain. having a motivation that makes logical sense from her point of view doesnt change that. when you view the story objectively, from the outside, ellie is the main, negative driving force. abby is absolutely justified in nearly all her actions."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,that was a lie joel told ellie to appease her at the end of the first game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i dont believe so. but maybe? i absolutely remember the part that uimfromgoogle is talking about.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"it was only forced perspective, empathy is always a choice. people still talk about hating her online. edit were going to go round in circles debating this game for years to come. itll become easier if we try to talk about it more subjectively. and im at fault here too. in my opinion, i was always given a choice in who to empathise with and when. it took me a very long time to feel for abby. personally i still enjoyed the game whilst being forced to play as someone i didnt like. it was a new experience. i was pleasantly surprised at how much immersive emotion, different from other games, that was being imparted from this form of media. i think the cost for this was too great for some. tlou2 was filled with pain, i personally got great value from feeling that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"well if youre not going to naturally find empathy to another perspective, how else can you? right? im not defending the perspective of abby either, im just merely looking at it from a storytelling  design structure. you killed doctors as joel canonically, and care deeply for joel and ellie, but having you just see abby in cutscenes or whatever might not be enough for the player to detach from empathizing with joel and ellie. its an interesting and definitely divisive experiment that nd played with. i still had a hard time giving into the fireflies recklessness, but i think it definitely forced the player to try and have a more clear mind when weighing overall motivations."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"its funny. i think i mostly agree beyond the fact that i wouldnt really describe ellie or abby as bad so much as complex and layered characters with some really dark traits and horrible decision making. i was pissed when the switch to abby happens and thought, are we really going to do this both sides bullshit.? by the end i thought, well shit. they really stuck the landing on that one. i honestly liked that they tackled the moral complexity of the characters decision making and force the player to deal with philosophically interesting questions about what it means to be a good guy or even just a survivor in a post apocalyptic world. i get that some folks simply arent interested in that. at times i was like, can i just kill some npcs and not agonize over all my ingame decisions? but, ultimately, i like media that makes me think and feel. tlou2 is easily a top 10 title for me."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,they absolutely designed the game so that playing as abby would be unappealing
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,thats the point to you
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yup, the whole thesis statement of the game was that revenge does not bring closure only destruction but even letting go of that rage won't heal what it has done. there isn't a good guy and a bad guy, just one snake eating its own tail."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,you just defined empathy.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,exactly. tlou2 is about hatred and vengeance. there are no good guys in the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"that may be the point, but i'm not going to sympathize with someone who straight up tortured and murders joel. i don't give a fuck what kind of person they are, you can't go from ambushing and the murder and slow torture of an old man to oh abby has her reasons too. 2 wrongs don't make a right, but joel did what he had to do to save ellie. abby hunted, ambushed, murdered and tortured an old man who saved her. there's no comparison."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i dont disagree, ellie and abby are not exactly good people, but not quite evil either. my issue is with how the game presents these characters and the structure they chose to do it in."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"no it wasn't. it's amazing to me that people still think this. i think you should probably stfu and listen to the writers. feel free to have your own interpretation because art imo is open to that, but they very clearly have stated that the point is to make you hate abby as much as possible and then try to bring you back. see the podcasts they released about the game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"no thays the whole point is that abby didn't mow down thralls of people to get to joel. they slipped in covertly and only killed him. she's also the reason why ellie and tommy got to live. and after washington and ellie killed all of her friends, she was willing to forget and move on with her life iife ad ellie let it consume her and left a family she was building to kill her. ellie became a piece of shit throughout the entire game while abby actually growed as a character"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"most people dont realize that ellie was the antagonist in that game, not abby, even though they tried to show the player that through ellies increasingly villainous actions. just looking at it from a little further away shows it. organized science group is trying to find a cure or vaccine to save countless lives and rebuild the world. one person is shown to have immunity and volunteers to be put down and examined feasibility of that method aside to try and find out what makes it work so it can be replicated. completely unrelated 3rd party decides to nullify her choice, murder everyone who is trying to help, including an unarmed doctor in cold blood, and abduct an unconscious girl without her consent. the daughter of the murdered doctor after years finds out where the maniac is and kills only him. side note, how many games, movies and books entire plot is the good guy saying i must avenge my fathermother! and then they kill everyone. they even let the girl go after only knocking her out. she then goes on a rampage killing every person she sees, even members of the same group who, although they were admittedly dicks, had nothing to do with joels death and in fact wouldnt have allowed abby to go do it anyway. plus a completely unrelated 3rd group. thankfully, they also sucked and were crazy, but she would have never met them had she not made the choices she made. speaking of choices, she double crosses her friend who had left ahead of her to accomplish the same mission she has, on the possibility that she might find abby somewhere. she leaves him to die, cornered and ambushed, and abandons her friend who helped get her that far in the first place when he goes to rescue the aforementioned friend. thats after endangering the life of a girl she loves, whom she knows is pregnant, thereby endangering the life of the baby as well. meanwhile, yes, abby shoots notglen in the head. after tracking the three murderous terrorist nutjobs who she knew were the henchman of the guy who killed her father, who came tracking over to her settlement and were killing all her neighbors in an attempt to track her down, even after she showed them mercy. then, when you play as abby, you only kill 2 kinds of enemies. infected, and cultists who you live next door to and are already embroiled in a war with after a failed peace treaty and who attempt to kill you on site. on top of all that, abby plays with a dog. and is, in my opinion, more fun to play as. she has all the same weapon combat as ellie but parkours faster and has better melee combat. but i just like punching the zombies."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yeah, look at what happens to ellie she loses everything for revenge. family, friends, can't even play the guitar right, but hey, at least she beat the shit out of someone who wronged her."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,then they failed. they made ellie into a hateful cunt that deserved death as much as joel did and they made abby into a noble and pure soul. abby was clearly the hero.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,empathy isnt love. you said that wasnt the point then you described how you the point is to understand the similarities and differences of the perspectives. empathy the ability to understand and share the opinions of others.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"youre not supposed to like playing as abby people yeah youre right, i dont like this game shocked pikachu"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,for you. they absolutely did not fail for me and any of my friends who played it. tbh have your opinion but stating opinions on the internet as if they are facts is my biggest internet pet peeve.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"theres a whole lot of suggesting that the fireflies have competent scientists and that what theyre attempting has some chance of succeeding. whether you think its realistic or not is another story, but the game implies there is some sort of chance. whether its 1 or 10 or 40, it doesnt matter, the point is that the smartest of the available humans alive have decided that this is the best chance it doesnt matter that they havent provided you with enough evidence, the game itself says theres enough to believe theres a chance, so as far as the game is concerned, its true. how you reconcile that with joelellie's actions is another story"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,you can easily have characters who are bad but also likeable.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i mean, she might be weaker than abby but abby is a monster and is a soldier so of course she's going to be the stronger of the 2. but i wouldnt say ellie is weak."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"??? my favorite games ever are metroid and transistor... both of which you play as a woman. my favorite character archetype is badass punchy woman my low tolerance is for shallow stories that pretend to be deep and complex, but are really just one dimensional and easily impress people who's reading level topped out at harry potter."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"you know that sounds more like a fanboys comment right?  oh please, you just don't get the narrative and complex characters! the narrative flies over your head because you're not capable of dealing with such deep and controversial topics! this is how you sound when you make this type of arguments. yes tlous2 did something different than most 3a story driven games but having problems with its story doesn't mean that it's because you don't get to play as the bad ass grizzled dude or whatever excuse you want to come up with. the game does get shitted on for stupid reasons but it is flawed in some aspects, no matter what anyone thinks."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"that's exactly what ellie does the whole second game. that was the entire point, it was all about the cycle of hate and revenge. joel !killed her father, who was actively trying to help the world!, so it seems justifiable to want him to pay for that. joel's crimes weren't justifiable at all. ellie chose her fate with the fireflies to help people, it wasn't like she was kidnapped and he was protecting her. joel acted selfishly and murdered people to that end, he wasn't a hero."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"its not ellies character to kill someone literally tied to a fucking fence post. she saved her just so she could beat her ass and , at that time, kill her herself. you seemingly being unable to understand the nuances of the story doesnt make the writing bad. it just means you have low comprehension of the plot."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,not if youre paying attention
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"minor quibble but you find info in the game that 60 of the world's population was either dead or infected sometime around a year after the initial outbreak. that was in 2014, the first game starts in 2033, so probably much much less than a single billion. regardless of all of that potential to save humanity stuff, thags not abby's motivation. nor would anacting her plan have any affect on those past events. it was revenge, i feel like you're missing the point of the second game if you think abby's revenge was right"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,yeah i need to come to terms with me just getting older and not having the time i used to have to play games. it's hard to come to terms with it but my emerging grey hair begs to differ

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,it didnt even hit me until now that some people missed out on that piece of dialogue. im glad i chose to play by doing as much as i could before the main story line.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,ugh man i was so happy !i played that part with atreus. i looked up the alternative dialogue of doing it with freya and it does not have the same emotional impact. its such a good mission for him to undertake and kratos explaining to freya its punishment hes not doing it with him is such a less satisfying emotional hit.!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"oh yea i don't think he should be the same either, hes a changed man, i just...don't want to leave him as he is right now. quite the testament to how good acting and story are."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i never finished it for this exact reason so it wasn't without fault or totally effective. and trust me, i get it. the story being told isn't wholly original."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"personally i think it should have opened playing as young abbie as the prologue, introduce her friends and show how similar her life is to ellie as a person with limited time and too many good games to play i gave up on that game and just watched how it ended because i felt like they were beating me over the head with a super simple topic which had me saying yeah, i get it for hours and i just wanted to know what happened to the characters i was with"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"and that's where it fails because in the first game, joel and ellie were pretty much all we knew. then part 2 not only throws in joel's killer, you also have to play as her. playing as her after already playing joel and feeling strong attachments to his character, which millions of fans already developed since 2013. if anything your point is the only baffling thing here. you failed to see the very problem you unintentionally pointed out and made a total strawman to boot."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i think the last of us 2 is one of my favorite games overall, and when i see someone have to explain it like you did and people still dont get it..i just dont know. i think you explained it very well. people are getting stuck on the forced to feel, but its natural emotions that happen from another persons perspective to show that theres no correct side. you easily could have played abbys story first and thought joel and ellie were the antagonists. thats the point and what makes having to play as abby in the middle of the game so amazing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,why start at ellie when the mission starts him in the firefly building where he fights through dozens of armed guards before he even gets to ellie in the operating room? are we going to pretend that these armed guards don't matter and didn't have families?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"by definition, joel is a protagonist, cause y'know, hes the main character and you play him. marlene would be the antagonist at the end since she opposes the protagonist. now whether joel is a villainbad person is another can of worms entirely and part of why many enjoyed the ending and overall story of tlou."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"no she doesn't, in the giraffe scene she promises to go with joel anywhere he wants when they finish with the fireflies. are you saying elle lied about this? please tell me where ellie confirms she knows she was going to die."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,hell yeah it was. it was kinda cool for a game to make you feel that way tbh.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"could be what they were going for, but is it a good sequel? the first game left me wanting more at the end, second game had me just wanting it to end"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"when you view the story objectively, from the outside, ellie is the main, negative driving force. abby is absolutely justified in nearly all her actions. this seems kinda crazy to me since the story does not happen if it weren't for abby seeking revenge and doing so in the most brutal way to someone who literally saved her life. joel and tommy literally save her and she responds by crippling one and slowly and brutally murdering the other in front of tommy and ellie, clearly two people who love him. abby is, imo, less justified than even joel. joel didn't go in a torture anyone. he just did what he could to save the person he cared about most. it was bad for the world, if they were able to get a vaccine out of it but that wasn't certain either. anyway, i don't think i have a problem with you saying that ellie is a negative driving force, i just think its psychotic to say that abby is justified in nearly all her actions."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i thought it was also implied by a note or an audio log you can find earlier in the game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the writing and storyline definitely tried to make you empathize with her. it wasn't unbiased at all.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"thank you! ive always been intrigued by the idea of a game making play as both the protagonist and antagonist and, while i didnt love every story beat in tlou2, i thought it was well done. just because the game is putting you in her shoes, humanizing her, and making her motives more well known does not mean you have to like her. in fact, the game works well to me precisely because you are uncomfortable undertaking her actions. the game is forcing you in an uncomfortable position making you fight ellie and i thought that was an awesome artistic choice not really done before in games. its completely fine for the player to feel like you dont want to be doing what the game is making you do  that is the point. so yeah, i agree with you. you dont have to like abby and that is completely fine. i would probably agree theres maybe too much time spent as her but i think its a good parallel to show the lengths shes going through much like ellie for similar reasons. but you can ultimately still not like her, root for her, or want her to succeed."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"it's typically why you don't change the perspective of your story to be from two sides  especially if one side is more heavily established already and has had more natural character growth. if they wanted to do this story, they should have done it with the first game, make joel actually be ellie's father. then as the game goes on and we play as abby, we learn about the lab, and joel, and her parents, etc. we haven't gotten too attached to these characters yet, so the door to empathy for the 'villain' in this case is still open. but instead, they kill a beloved character, force you to play his killer, and then try to make you empathize with her  even though she is poorly written and really has no likeableredeeming characteristics to her. she's just a brute. so really they just chose the wrong game to do this 'experiment' of story telling in. there was littletono chance people were going to like abby."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i hated it, thought it was preachy, but then i actually bought it. became one of the best experiences i've had, gaming or not."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i'm an extremely empathetic person. abby was forced and cruel and showed no redeeming qualities to her character to make me want to give her a chance. i honestly don't see what people found about her to empathize with besides losing her parents.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,but abbys father got what he deserved for trying to kill a child. this makes it hard to have empathy for abby trying to avenge her fathers deserved death.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i like this. tlou took the protagonists you love and put you in the shoes of someone they totally were the antagonist for. it was such a perspective shift. initially playing as abby you have this ew, this sucks reaction and over the course of the narrative eventually you come to the realization that each character has layers that make them more nuanced and less cut and dry as the good or bad guy. as an aside, i hate when people critical of tlou2 say they should have done x. nah bro, write your own stories if you are such an expert in storytelling. tlou2 was a masterclass in storytelling. it made me feel things  not all of them good things  and that is art."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,art should create visceral responses. everything being said here is evidence of that
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"this is a great breakdown and is extremely well written. i honestly think some people are used to video games simply being power fantasies and weren't expecting to be challenged. but as you say, that's what good art is it's challenging. one point, however, where the game struggles is in grounding the characters. ellie is painted as sympathetic, but she's truly a monster in this game. she straight up murders a pregnant woman and stabs an innocent dog to death. she also tortures a person to death and causes the deaths of hundreds of people who didn't need to die. in real life, no amount of i feel bad makes up for that. now, the point of the game is to say, joel does this shit. that makes him a bad man. of course people were going to want revenge eventually. but the fact that they repeat it with ellie i think sold the vision short a little."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"they got lucky, it wasnt a conscious choice to not mow down thralls of people. also, the people in jackson werent killing intruders so they never would have had to do what ellie did. the wlfs actions are why ellie acted like she did."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"1. ellie did not volunteer to be put down. the fireflies never told her that she would be killed. whether or not ellie would have still agreed is debatable but i think she would have. 2. abby only killed only joel because joel and tommy were unlucky enough to run into them. she made it clear that torture and murder were on the table to get to joel. 3. ellie doesnt kill anyone who isnt actively trying to kill her first on her way to get to abby. the wlfs may have a giant stadium compound with kids and grandparents but they are lead by a psychopath whom the exfireflies gladly teamed up with. story wise, the game overstayed its welcome by 6 hours. i have no problem with splitting the story between ellie and abby but they needed to cut a lot of fat and also restructure it. abbys segment should have been first."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,clearly my comment is an opinion. arent all our comments opinions?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"which brings us right back around to my original comment  the game insisted that several things were true even when they were observably not the case, and it felt more like forced moralization than gameplay. moreover, it's absolutely not the case that the game is implying there's a chance. certainly the fireflies were insisting on that, but the game itself doesn't address it otherwise. really, the entire ethical crux of the first game was that there wasn't really any proof it could succeed, and you just had to end up trusting people."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,yeah that's kind of his whole point...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"but none of the characters were likeable, except the early one that were killed with the most disrespect i have ever seen"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,shes 130 soakin wet at most? her strength has always been her character and intelligence. phyiscal str is very much her dump stat.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,its not about playing as a women or not. you may have misunderstood my comment. you say that and yet transistor and metroid are both extremely simple stories that have very little complexity at all. dont even get me started on how something can pretend to be complex. it either is or isnt. and i can certainly say there are very few video game narratives that are even close to as complex as tlou2.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,is it? i disagree.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,ellie was a child. she's not a good age to consent to suicide. protecting ones 'child' is considered one of the most base instict in the animal kingdom. cycle of vengence does not include the village. a single person will be consumed by it but ur friends will not follow u into the jaws of death. for the record ellie behavior was also completely devoid of logic and was a simple copy cat of abbys.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yes, please explain to us more how murdering children for the greater good deserves sympathy."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,ok? so get ur self and everyone u know killed over it? never mind the 'cure' was standing right next him as u killed him. they should of made ellie the focus and joel just got in the way and abby just wanted a personal vengence on the side. if they did it that way abby story would of be so much better. that would of justified it to ur audience instead of the terrible plot they did. last of us had good plot and character interactions last of us 2 had terrible plot and good character interactions. the plot kills it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,excusing murdering children for the greater good. nice.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"like i said, if odin did not send baldur to their house, their story would be completly different... teenagers never listen to their parents, they try to find their own self's, making mistakes along the way. that's the way most of us learned. so, if anything, most people should emphatize with atreus and understand him and his motivations. like how would you keep a secret like ironwood from your father? if you knew when and how your father would die, would you go to his lengths to change it? all the profecies, his identities, being constantly attacked by the goddess freya in a unending fimblewinter, the threat of thor and odin, how could you not do anything to try and change a terrible fate that awaited everyone? in the end, many were saved and had a happy ending, but unfortunately the dwarves had the worse outcome, but mostly because of odin, atreus was a victim of odin's lies and manipulation"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i think this is a game much more about the journey and experiencing yourself than the ending. thats what makes it so unique to me. i have a friend that read the plot instead of playing it and i fully believe it changes how youd feel about it. i would try to pick it up sometime, theres no game thats done a story like this better that i know of"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"and it seems like you're missing my reply for some reason. we get it that abby felt justified to avenge her dad's death, it doesn't change the fact that you shouldn't expect everyone to like it. there's a good reason why millions did not like having to play abby, especially after how the story was presented."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"exactly, thank you! the phenomenon of haters around this game is truly bizarre. it's like they made up their minds before they even played it and simply refuse to see it for what it is. i played part 1 for the first time right before part 2 came out, then immediately played part 2. that was such an amazing experience and it sucks to see people so eager to hate on for the strangest reasons."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,oh you mean the people trying to kill him that stole all of his gear to throw him out so he would die? yeah clearly joel is in the right here lmao
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"not saying they didn't matter, just that they were actual threats to joel, unlike those present in the theatre."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i mean the antagonist of the situation not the game joel is clearly not a good man as we can see from his past and his brother splitting from him and joining the fireflys. except its very clear cut if you take notice of the state of the fireflys the state of the buildings and 1 of the voice recorders plus the treatment of joel and ellie that he is not the bad guy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"after that scene, when they get close to the firefly camp she goes off on a speech about being guilty, she talks about sacrificing herself, and she gets noticeably down the whole time. she also specifically talks about them having to dissect her to find whatever in one of the random little conversations while you walk around towards the end."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,yeah it was very contrived.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"it tries to make you empathize with her which is not the same as sympathizing with her, and critics don't want to admit it but it's very in line with the first game. the larger point of the first game was that people's morals are completely perverted by their drive to survive and so all these different communities have gone to further and further lengths to protect their own people while from joelellie's perspective they're just monsters. but joel is literally the same, and so are the fireflies, and at times in his life so was tommy. ellie is a kid because being a kid gives her an innocent perspective of events. in tlou2 they flip it, through abby's perspective she deludes herself that it was justifiable to do what she did because joel was the monster, and so its again justifiable for ellie because abby was the monster. you as the player just have the ironic perspective of knowing what the cost of all this shit is and who ellie and abby arewere. i get that some people don't care for the game which is fine but the idea that it is somehow ridiculous or contrived that 2 people see themselves as justified while the other is a monster is hardly reasonable imo. fun fact literally the prologue of tlou immediately draws attention to this with joel insisting they keep driving and don't help the family with the small child, insisting that it isn't their problem and someone else will come"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"joel was already a very fatherlike figure though no? dunno if it needs to be that literal. i dont think that would make it any better or worse. joel losing sarah was such a character defining moment for him in the first place, and caused his internal struggle while dealing with ellie. made that character dynamic that much more interesting. i dunno, game happened. some liked it. some didnt. i thought it was an interesting experiment to get people talking, even to this day lol."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,nobody let this dude read anything by cormac mccarthy.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,here's the real question would you play the last of us 3?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"disagree. i think it's executed near perfectly. the point is for you to be experience what it's like to be the main character  ellie, and then for you to be forced to come to terms with the awful things ellie does. it's extremely challenging to the user, because we don't like to think of ourselves and the main character we love as awful, but they are. this wouldn't work if we'd sympathized with abby from the start. she needed to be seen as a villain for it to be turned on its head. i would also note that ellie does way, way worse shit than anything abby has ever done. and it's amazing that she largely gets a pass simply because she's the one we see as on our side. some people don't like being challenged and i get that. however, personally, i think challenging art is what's ultimately most valuable."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"alternatively, tlu2 could have been abbys story right up to her meeting with joel. they hand waved her entire history, and that history between ellie and joel is what connected us to them. then, release tlu3 as a choice play as abby or ellie and choose to kill or forgive as the player wishes. yeah thats more development time, but fans were willing to wait years for tlu2, and the hype before launch was pretty high."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i experienced her as yet another joel. they conveyed that with things like her overall combat style, weaponstools available to her, and with the obvious comparison of taking in and becoming attached to and protective of a younger character. the major difference, imo, is with joel you only heard about the horrors he committed later, whereas with abby you watched her do them to you personally."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,what about when she repeatedly risked her life to save yara and lev?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i'm not sure you're as empathetic as you think you are...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"hard disagree. i found her far more enjoyable to play as than ellie and as a person is much more redeemable. personally, that i really enjoy that people had such different takeaways. good art should challenge would, and that's exactly what the game does."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"loads of people shit themselves over the fact that the game has a diverse cast and characters. id heard so much negative reaction to the game that i was afraid that theyd bailed on doing a good story in favor of doing diversity, but i personally found it all to be quite natural and not contrived. people can like or dislike whatever works for them. im not over here trying to convince anyone to like it. but i did enjoy it exactly as it is."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i could kick you in the balls and get a visceral response. that doesn't make it art.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"what innocent dog? those dogs were trained to find and 'kill' or bite outsiders. the aquarium section where the dog ran to ellie was in selfdefense. same goes for mel. she didnt straight up murder her, but acted on selfdefense. owen told mel that ellies 'lying' on not killing them from their perspective it seems likely but since we know ellie, she wont kill them after giving abbys location but since owen wants to protect abby, both of them got killed because of it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,it was a conscious choice. they were talking about the best way to go into town and ask about joel. if not they would have killed tommy and ellie. they even said when someone shot tommy in the knee that they were there for only joel.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"1 agree to disagree. i think she knew, i recall the dialogue, but im not going through the game again to find it, so, meh. i also believe that even if she didnt know, she would have agreed to it. 2 abby only killed joel because she only wanted to kill joel. otherwise, she would have killed ellie and tommy in that opening scene. if the roles were reversed ellie would absolutely have killed then both. ellie resorts to torture at least twice that i can remember off the top of my head. 3 abby only ever kills in self defense, and only to one group of people besides ellie and her cohorts. ellie sweeps through an area like the plague and kills everyone, regardless of what camp theyre from, and tortures to death at least 3 people. she also turns on and abandons her friends and willfully neglects the health and wellbeing of her pregnant girlfriend. if the player wasnt preconditioned to have bias for joel and ellie, they absolutely would be instantly identified as the villains in this story."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"hmm maybe i missed something then, you say it's observably not the case that ellie's operation would work... which part indicated that?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i'm not saying they were, i'm saying you can make bad characters that you actually want to be around or play as, abby and her crew were the worst and playing as abby was a boring slog because of it. joel was likeable, he made plenty of mistakes but he was trying to make up for them and he couldn't allow his surrogate daughter to be killed even if it was for a potential cure."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,protecting ones 'child' is considered one of the most base instict in the animal kingdom. you know whats also a staple in the animal kingdom? eating the childs if there is no food and the group depends on that to live like the first game ending is supossed to nuanced and you can argue both sides as being eight from their perspective but it seems most people just saw joel as a gigachad on a rampage to protect a kid from evil mad scientists lmao
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"because you save every living child and future kids from the misery of the apocalypse, id like to see you guys in that situation, 99 of the people you ever knew dead, all the little cities and communities falling off to madness, hunger or the clickers, im sure all of you would stand up to save a random unknown kid because evil doctors"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i find it ironic you think killing hundreds if not thousands to save one life is noble. i'm not even a utilitarian in the classic sense and i know that's fucking stupid.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"why you only blame odin? odin tell him the truth to atreus, he want it the mask to know the mysteries of life. atreus rob the mask from odin, it was odin mask and want it to take back, the dwarf attack odin and he kill him. and they all crying after they kill magni, modi, baldur and heimdall."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,clearly not. see you getting ratio'd
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"you literally failed at describing what happened. so yeah, you clearly didnt understand the situation. she didnt have to save her. but she did because its ellies character to do so. she was there to kill abby herself, and see it happen. she wasnt going to kill her tied up to a fence post so obviously she had to cut her down first and find somewhere where they could finish it. ellie would not have just left abby there and assumed she died. her entire point of going to kill her was to make sure she saw it with her own eyes. no matter which way you look at it you literally just dont understand the story beats."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"all the mainline story bosses are too easy. then they make some of the optional bosses ridiculously hard ok, usually the ones with multiple enemies."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"100 agree this would have been great showing the parallels between them before the game makes the player hate abbie maybe i'm alone in this but there's the scene when ellie is forced to kill a dog then when you're playing abbie the game makes you feel like a monster for killing the dog, but there was literally no way around it it feels manipulative to force a player to do a thing then make the player feel like shit for doing the thing you forced them to do, if a game is going to do that it should be for something you have agency to control not something they forced you to do"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,but the story has been told many times. the story in a nutshell.httpstvtropes.orgpmwikipmwiki.phpmaincycleofrevenge
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i dont expect everyone to like it, i think theres a nice group of people that couldnt get past joel dying no matter what. one of the braver moves in a game medium that i can think of tbh, and its a shame some people are too emotionally stubborn to expand on those emotions throughout the game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"been a long time gamer, played tlou on release day. i've played hundreds of other games. well written stories and the like. i played this for a bit until i was forced to play abby, then lost interest. i'm an adult with my own problems and things to do. when i sit down to play a videogame, i don't want to play a character who is intentionally unappealing. it's not like this almost exact story hasn't been told before. revenge is a vicious cycle. yup, heard that one before, now let me go shoot the people i don't like because i have to be up in the morning. no? cool, i'll pass."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"sometimes good stories aren't about right or wrong, only about whats left, kinda like the last of us or something."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"httpsyoutu.bezklpkdvs8g?t19517httpsyoutu.bezklpkdvs8g?t19517 no, she doesn't. the last conversation they have regarding the fireflies is when joel suggests going back to tommys, ellie says no because it can't have all been for nothing. but at no point does she talk about sacrificing herself."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"what i said only makes sense if you consider the first game. he just shoots the guy and walks off. he didn't slowly kill him in front of abby. i don't recall her only weapon being a golf club, none of her allies had guns? damn joel and tommy both had them. her unnecessary brutality was literally a plot point and is what ruined her relationships."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i must have missed that collectible because i never heard of that before. theres an audiolog where he expresses self doubt about being able to do it successfully.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i thought it was brilliant. i went from simply hating her to understanding her more. one of the best and hardest games to play.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"they're talking about trying to force empathy, not actually saying they were forced to internally empathise."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"gonna have to disagree with you there. i feel like it was agenda influence. but to each their own. abby was just a poor character overall for me, and not someone who can really be empathized with if you played the first game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"you missed my point  i was saying that if this was the first time i.e. the first game we were seeing ellie and joel, then we wouldn't have as much attachment and therefore be more open to empathizing with joels killer when we have to play as her  we'd be more confused and trying to figure out why she did what she did to this person we didn't know but clearly meant a lot to the other character we play. i agree that sarah was a major point for joel and it made him very easy to empathize with. and that is why it's so soulcrushing to see him murdered by abby, and why it's so jarring and aggravating to have to play as her for people. personally i don't think the game deserves half the awards it got. nor deserves the wordofmouth it has garnered. but here we are, talking about it. i'm gonna end it here."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,no.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yeah, that's all great, but i don't want to spend 60 for an unenjoyable experience. i don't care how artsy or deep it is  if it's designed to be depressing and you expect me to pay for the experience, i'm not going to have nice things to say about it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"in tlou part 1, joel murders completely innocent doctors who are trying to save the world, which include abbys father, and the player bears immediate witness to this. abbey seeks revenge on joel for not only killing her father but also single handedly dooming the world for his selfish prospects. its for this reason i never hated abby, because joel is og absolutely shit human. i understand why he did what he did, but you cant help but feel bad about it. how can we possibly put joel on a pedestal and demonize abby? peoples seething hatred for a character that is only responding to an evil mans prior atrocity is extremely strange to me. not calling you out specifically, your comment just evoked this thought from me haha"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"aside from killing joel, and the cultists that is at war with her group, what horrors does she commit? especially compared to ellie?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i am empathetic to a point. when you start smashing in the face of someone i care about with a golf club, i kind of don't care about your feelings anymore."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,and i disagree that tlou2 was art. to me it was a torture porn and a political message with an established following to profit from. it was propaganda if anything to me. sure that's gonna go over well with reddit.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"all these people downvoting these very rational responses are probably the same people that think aloy would look prettier if she smiled more, and that her proportions werent feminine enough."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,context is key my boy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"ellie breaks into somebody else's house to commit a murder and then ends up killing their dog and two inhabitants in selfdefense. if somebody invades your home in the middle of the night for the purpose of killing your best friend and then kills you, your pregnant wife, and your dog in self defense nobody would argue that the home invader deserves any sympathy. it's not just awful, it's borderline psychopathic. and that's the point it's truly, truly, unforgivably terrible, and ellie hates herself for it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"well just disagree on that. you see how brutal the wlf is throughout the game, pretending they wouldnt have done whatever it took to get joel out of jackson is just wishful thinking. sparring tommy and ellie can not be used as justification for what they might have done. ellie wouldnt have killed anyone accept abby had the wlf not been trying to kill her the whole time she was in seattle."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,the fact abbys dad rushed ellie into surgery without her consent means he deserved what he got but ellie wanted it that's not a reason to rush her into surgery without getting her consent or letting her say goodbye to a father figure she has bonded with.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i feel like this guy played a completely different game then we did lol.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"because joel had charisma. his motivations were honorable, protecting a little girl. instead of playing a freak that was mad because someone defended a little girl from being killed. only a nazi would sympathize with a monster like abby. violent disgusting humans that would do the most inhuman things because of their hate."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"no, first of all there is no proof the cure would even work. there is no proof the cure wouldn't be abused as a weapon to create a dictatorship. or that the industrial capacity existed to create enough of it. there is no proof that ellie is the only immune one then what, you gonna distribute it among everyone for free? walk up to warbands and give them the cure? yea right. there is no proof the cure would save anyone. all you did was just excuse the murder of an innocent young girl because a terrorist organisation said so. you gonna defend what the nazis did next with their bio research?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i also said atreus made mistakes, kratos also did, freya also did... odin told him his goal yes, but at what cost? sacrificing the innocent, killing thor, ruining his family, torturing others... the mask didn't belong to him... he had one piece, atreus collected the rest and was the only one who could read it. odin could do nothing with it. brok did not attack him, he was questioning him after all the lying. odin was disguised of tyr in their home spying on them, manipulating... all those you mentioned attacked kratos and atreus, odin commanded them to, but kratos did kratos things xd anyways, i don't think i will change your mind on this, but next time you play the games, keep in mind all of that"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"this game has you as the main character in all four parts of your linked cycle, thats the interesting point. im not saying its never been done but i certainly cant recall a game that did it as well as this"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"can you blame them? especially after having strong attachments since 2013 to a character who started out losing a daughter to the cruel world and that it left a sarahsized hole in his heart for twenty years, only for that hole to be patched by ellie? i think something like having abby's backstory be presented before joel's killing alone would have helped a lot."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"i don't blame anyone for wanting to feel simple, pleasant escapism while gaming. but that's why multiple genres exist in all mediums. you don't need to watch chernobyl, or the road, or the pianist, but they're still valid stories which are worth telling. even if they're so disturbing and unpleasant that many people would rather watch the sound of music, or top gun maverick. i think that diversity in genrefiction is crucial and videogames will never be entirely respected as a narrative medium if we insist that every game needs to be uncharted tonally. i also wouldn't say that revenge is vicious cycle is the primary theme of the game. it's more of an exploration of hate in all it's form. part 2 explores hate from every perspective, and on every narrative scope  from its literalmain plotting, to its metaphorical subtext, and minor stories told through foundobjects. it talks about revenge, prejudice religious, gender, racial and sexual orientation, war, political schism, jealousy and personal resentments. the wlf vs scar conflict is the biggest macrocosm of that theme."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,except the second game is literally druckmann retconning joel into a bad guy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"he shoots that unarmed guy who had his hands up, after tearing a swath through the entire group he was a part of, then walks away. her friends were off put by it, but owen had already distanced himself. she was brutal, but understandably traumatized by what happened to her when she was 14. that was her first and only catharsis and even then she only killed the man responsible. she didnt even kill ellie, who she could have made a feasible leap in logic to blame as well. also, she didnt seek out to kill him in front of ellie. ellie showed up midbeating. once she did, abby finished it immediately."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,its just cope from people that want to shit on the tlou2
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i'm glad you enjoyed it however i can easily see how people wouldn't at the same time.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i would understand why people would hate on this game more if it wasnt for the fact that they also closed the story of joel and ellie perfectly. you can tell a lot of people never finished the game as soon as they played as abby, because everyone thinks the story of joel just ends at abby meeting him. no spoilers, but everything needed to be said between joel and ellie was said. there was an end, and it worked so well because you know joel saw it coming. he knows what he did, and it weighed on him. joel stopped the world for salvation to give ellie a choice, and abby was what the world became from his actions vengeance, war, and brutality. abby was inevitable, and her perspective was a way to show that she wasnt an unknown face of consequence, but one of the many lives changed from one mans act to save a little girl. a view of the world and loss of life outside of the perfect jackson bubble joel would spend the rest of his life peacefully in. i thought it was well done."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,yep. by far the best game of the last console gen. the story was demanding but felt authentic. im just glad they left the first scenes with her as from ellies perspective. having that scene play out from abbys would have been just too much.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"yeah for me it was the opposite, it went from a very bland generic revenge game to suddenly play as the villain the first hour playing as her felt awful but in the end i feel like i liked abby story more than ellie tbh"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"oh! okay yeah for sure if this was the first game, it would have had to be structured  framed differently. i think that's why things were done the way they were though. i think nd wanted you to be mad and then overcome that over time. i think it worked for some, and less for others. sometimes it's just too hard to detach, but there's nothing wrong with that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"that's the one amazing thing about the last of us 2. it somehow made us think it's acceptable to kill one person over another despite joel selfishly killing abby's father to save ellie. at the end of the day, joel and ellie are both awful people, they were always awful people, even in the first game. i hated playing as both because the game didn't give me a choice not to be an asshole. i did not want to shoot that doctor at the end, i was hoping for some alternate solution to the problem, but the game forced my hand, and it felt awful. this is also why watching joel die at the start of the game felt justified. because it was. that same thing can't be said about abby, and her only falling grace was going to a dark place and seeking revenge after having her father taken from her, but even she realized how far she fell afterward and never felt quite good about her actions. and in some ways redeemed herself by not killing ellie's pregnant friend, something even ellie succumbed to. the last of us is an exceptionally compelling narrative experience. honestly, the real issue with the game is the lack of depth and innovation on the gameplay mechanic side of things. lacking combat mechanics, pisspoor ai, and basic puzzles that tend to solve themselves. i'll probably get downvoted for sharing this opinion, but y'all motherfuckers need to think for yourselves before parroting whatever someone else says."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"nope, i completely agree! i think it's a pure emotional reaction without any real inspection joel is certifiably not a good man, the original goes to pretty great lengths to make that obvious to us. abby being used as a vessel to challenge our prejudicial sense of who we care for in this world and the reasons behind it was a pretty cool choice imo."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i'm saying that, for the players perspective, killing joel in front of you ellie is more heinous than all of the stories joel has from his past, but still carries an analogous role for each, i.e. they did things they weren't proud of and have reformed as people. to be clear, i'm not saying they have 11 equivalent pasts."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,sorry im british is that sep or nov?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,itll end up on pc in 3 months after release so whats the point of releasing it exclusively on playstation to begin with. getting a bit sick of seeing this happen
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,only another few years before it comes to pc and i can play it. i actually really enjoyed the last gow game on pc
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,cries in european probably 9th of november yeah?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,is it september or november? i hate that the world has different ways of writing the same date in different places...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,now i just need a ps5
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,will the digital delivery for ps5 be included if i install the ps4 version via disc?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"does anyone else have a bad feeling about this? sequels are hard man i want it to be good tho, fingers crossed."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,will it be available on pc??
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"im excited for you playstation folk, sadness me that i wont be able to play it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,i was thinking 'holy shit in september already??' but quickly realized usa's date format is whack.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,this is september right? please tell it is and not november... can't wait to play this
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,can't wait to play it in september
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,gaaahhh!! i'm gonna say boi soo many times
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,let's goooooo
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,lets devour the gods togethaaaaaa
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"random destiny fan wanders by. you called for godslayers? aight, im game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,if you go to media blackout now you wont hear when its inevitably delayed to spring 2023.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,so before they dropped a date you were happy to watch potential spoilers? is there some kind of rule that nobody can spoil anything before theres a release date?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,better late than never i guess.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,god damnit i thought september was too good to be true
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,freaking usa ans their special date format..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,threw me off so badly at first and then i realised. those 2 extra months just made me depressed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,november...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,yes
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,911 lol cant be that really i think. so i think it is nov 9
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i don't even remember who won goty last year. it's just so insecure when people act like this. like, some people really only care about reviews and awards when it already conforms to their own opinions. regardless of whoever wins goty, people should play both elden ring and gow because they both are great games. i mean i assume ragnorok will be good."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,literally every gaming media outlet does their own game of the year. both games will take home a ton.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"as a fan of both, sales will probably dictate who will win goty and since gow is a console exclusive, i think elden ring will get it. elden ring sold 12 million copies within 3 weeks."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,isn't it releasing too late to be considered for this year's goty
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"gow was a reimagining of a franchise that completely changed the feel and gameplay, while having an amazing story. it was a masterpiece. i don't think there is a universe where the next gow could possibly be compared to the first one, no matter how good it is. it could be the most amazing experience ever, but will still be reiterating on the last games mechanics. elden ring has changed the game, and i think that is what makes for a goty. for the next 5 or 10 years, we will be seeing devs incorporate the lessons of er, in the same way that devs will be incorporating the lessons of the last gow game. i won't be butt hurt either way, i thought gow was one of the most amazing games i have played, but this is er's year, i would put money on it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,they don't consider games released in the 4th qtr for goty this year i thought? so elden ring shouldnt be up against it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,people still care about some award at an award show. dont understand why
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,if its anything like gow 2018 itll have too many movie game elements to win goty
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"god of war will win goty simply because it released later in the year, i mean i'd say no matter how good ragnarok is elden ring deserves the goty but recency bias will probably give god of war a unanimous win"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,it's ultimately a hype contest if gowr is better than previous one which i think it definitely will be. if gowr executes successfully then both of these games are worthy imo. but if it comes down to the hype contest then i don't see gowr winning
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,i literally can't do anything in elden ring  i die constantly.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i'm just glad, crazy sony fans will stop sending dick pictures to the people at sony santa monica demanding a release date."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,and some of us who enjoys both sit back and laugh.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,add also them complaining about how there is a black character
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"what drama? sony has the game awards and the puppet who runs it in the bag. not only gow will win, horizon will be a nominee and they will find a way for the last of us part 1 to win a bunch of awards too, hell it will probably spark a category, remaster of the year."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,gonna be a helluva toss up between the two. fuck me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,elden ring was the first game to surpass call of duty in sales in years it deserves to win
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,imagine what a sad life you'd have to lead to get impassioned about that...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"man, am i the only one who thinks dying light 2 has a chance."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,i think elden ring will take it by a fair margin. it blew up beyond all expectations.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,indeed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,unscheduled off world activation!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,i'm disappointed how far i had to scroll to find this reference.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,i see what you did there
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,should have stolen that 11.11.22 that starfield was supposed to have.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"thank you, wasn't sure if this was freedom time or not."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,shouldn't it be september 11th based on 11.09.2022?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,right on!

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,not our fault your dates are wrong.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,so true.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i played it 4 times, what more can i say that has already been said?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,is it next gen only?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,november
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,i am american and i was wondering the same because i didn't know who was developing. damn americans
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,basically 9 11
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i was asking the same, but i realized no studio in their right mind would release a game on september 11th."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"am american, and hate this date format. it's why i always use 09nov22. no confusion."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,well know who is at least partially responsible for pressuring sony to get the thing out the door this line of thinking needs to die a fiery death. this is not how businesses work.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"if sony releases a game early due to random tweets, then it's sony who is responsible for that mistake. i doubt any major gaming company is bowing to twitter pressure to release games early lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"nobody is pressuring sony. if its released a buggy glitchy mess then that's on the devs management for lying about how long dev time should be and sony for not giving them enough time. they don't have to tell us anything, sometimes saying nothing is better"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,it's definitely not coming to pc in a year or so. maybe 4
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"it will be, i'm thinking 2 years  yes previous exclusives took longer, but then that was before sony made it blindingly obvious they had a focus on pc now too."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i was really excited for a second! nothing against gow, just not a action game guy."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"my first thought was awaken, my love album cover."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,i think thats fenrir
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,it's november 9th
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i was asking the same, but i realized no studio in their right mind would release a game on september 11th."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"it took years before gow 2018 came to pc, most likely because exclusivity is a big deal to sony, so i wouldn't anticipate a pc release for quite a while."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"24 years later, maybe"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,yeah it really is too bad that playstation has opted to not port their games until years later. definitely a business level decision in favor of exclusives rather than a technical one too.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i assume it's american dates, so 9th november 2022, rather than 11th september 2022"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,it's november 9th

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,its november.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,i'd guess 2025
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,it's november 9th
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"it will he, a year later"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"i mean sony santa monica is an american company, so it just makes sense to use their date format. edit  imagine people getting angry over date formats"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,the why do you lot celebrate the 4th of july and not july 4th?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,or you could say 'the 9th of november 2022'
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,yeah.. thats not how we all speak it either.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,say you don't know shit about norse mythology without saying you don't know shit about norse mythology
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,recommend playing the 2018 one first
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,it will. they wont do a day 1 launch on both ps and pc. theyre still promoting their consoles above just game sales
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,3 months?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,neither. november 9
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,sony has delivered as many as they could and for a while outpaced ps4 sales. but no console has ever released in a time when the whole world was forbidden from going outside. chip manufacturers are still behind and there wont be any relief for at least 2 more years then in the 3rd year all 3 new facilities should be up and running in the us.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"not from their perspective....they have sold consoles as fast as they can make them, how is that bad for them?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,how would that even make sense when the games plot is focused around the coming of ragnark?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"god of war not ragnarok even though this game is about ragnarok and a character is very closely tied to the mythology, but nevermind, let's not call call this ragnarok, just to satisfy mrcydonia."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,sony's games tend to be pretty good in terms of being playable on release.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,boy is now teen
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,you're complaining because it can cater to two sony systems?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"sounds to me like you havent played the game more than an hour, because the combos expand a lot and the combat system becomes fantastic. but sure, go ahead and claim a game you havent played it overrated."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"it'll eventually be on pc, but not on release. probably 2 or 3 years."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,no
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,for now until it comes out on pc in a couple years or so
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,it's available for ps4 too
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"just in case you're mixing it up, it's november 9"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,november not september
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,it's available for both ps4 and ps5
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,american
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,not all people have a good running pc and console is cheaper are some of the reasons i can think of
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,if you have a pc this will probably come out there too
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,hate to break it to you buddy...

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"you never know, it might be santa monica, france."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,go off the format of the country the studio is hqd in. santa monica studios is an american studio so mmddyyyy. nonamerican will usually follow the ddmmyyyy.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"its based on how we say the date. we dont say the 9th of november, we say november 9th. technically we say both but month first is far more common. does that make sense?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,it takes two
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,copies sold doesn't really matter. i think rdr2 sold more than gow 2018..and still gow won the goty
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"god of war 2018 has sold about 20m copies. i don't think sales will play as big a part as you think. if it's as good a game as the first one, it will have a very good shot. also, nobody cares who wins goty. lol."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"that's what people said about rdr2 though.. but i think elden ring will win, mostly because gow already won once in 2018."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i loved elden ring but prior to it i considered god of war to br the best game i experienced, amaxing graphics, no loading times, etc. personally? impossible to choose from both sadly i wont experience god of war up until it releases on pc"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"god of war is just too one sided and safe to even compete with elden ring for goty, er is clear winner."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,console exclusivity didnt hurt god of war 2018 or breath of the wild from winning goty in their respective years.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,modern warfare 2 enters the chat
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"hang on, didn't the devs say that one of the reasons for delaying the game was that it was getting added to pc?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,sales plays no role but no doubt elden ring will fucking sweep this year.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"the first god of war sold just under 20 million copies as a ps4 only game, so before they even released it on pc. this one is coming out on both ps4 and ps5 to an even bigger group of players than the first one released to. that being said, sales dont really matter for goty."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,elden ring is another soulsborne game. its basically like playing the 5th or 6th game in a series. i am not denying that its a great game but nothing about it is really new or unique.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"if i may ask...how exactly did elden ring change the game? it's dark souls 4. it's the culmiation of everything from has learned and improved upon from working on the dark souls franchise. but it's still basically just another dark souls like game. the only real thing that changed was the openworld. which is a mixed bag. on the one hand, the world is huge, and each new place to explore is unique and cool. and i mean the world is huuuuuuuuuuge. on the other hand, the actual act of exploring in the openworld is pretty meh. a lot of horseriding. your biggest obstacle is cliffs. constantly getting railroaded into specific paths, because, again, cliffs. i just wish i had a grapplinghook like in sekiro, or a parachute like botw. it's not so much a big open world. more like it's a big spiderweb. still a fantastic game and probably the best game that's come out this year. i just wouldn't ever describe it as game changing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,what lessons of er? its didnt do anything knew. botw is still the best open world game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,lol changed the game. dude it's literally dark souls but the walls of the dungeon have an outside.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,in the same way that devs will be incorporating the lessons of the last gow game. what lesson from gow did the industry learn?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"this is stupid take. nobody will incorporate jack shit from elder ring because there is nothing to incorporate. it's just the same from software game as always but with bigger map. there is nothing groundbreaking going on. i'm sure god of war ragnarok also will not introduced anything revolutionary. first one acomplisments were hiding loading screens and making sure kid you escort is not annoying. but if those were the only game out there there is 0 reason to give goty to elder ring for simple reason. elder ring have decent boss fights and nice combat system. that's all. it has shit story, forgettable characters, horrible dialogues and overall shit writing. say what you want about god of war but first one was well balanced on all fronts and really well made and second will most likely be the same. unless santa monica drops the ball or something. that can happen. but even if they did  elder ring would be the last game in my head that deserve goty. even sifu is better candidate for goty than elder ring."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,not quite. the cutoff is usually late november.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i believe it is just games that are released in december get ignored that year and are put on next years ballot, because most reviewers wont have time to finish them before they have to vote for goty in december."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,companies who make good games get rewarded
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,this is the dumbest take. takes it easily over a game that's not even out yet.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i almost believe the opposite. since it's coming out so late in the year it'll have less overall sales not saying that determines goty, less time to be appreciated, and much less exposure overall. it'll be a close call for sure, but i truly do believe elden ring is gonna take the award."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,no matter how good ragnarok is elden ring deserves the goty even if ragnarok is legitimately a better game? this seems like a weird take.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,i really hope thats not the case
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,the hype of gowr is currently reaching cyberpunk levels.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"where you at ? this game is most accessible soulsborne game ever, summon someone or use spirit ashes or use op weapons. one tip i can give for the game to click for you, is play dark souls 3 first."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,gamescoop ep 724 already claimed it so gow claimed what they could.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,you are surprised that a studio based in the us with the us as by far its biggest selling market would use the us format by default?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,why would we use the conventions of our biggest market??
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,maybe because the company that makes the game is from the us.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"social media has been getting up sonys ass about this for months. the question of the game releasing this year has become a meme. theres at least a possibility that this has caused the sony investors and higherups to pressure santa monica to get the game out the door before the end of the year. granted, i dont actually think this scenario is very likely. i doubt santa monica and sony would let a flagship game like this ship till its good and ready. but still, there have been so many delays of huge games this year already, and i imagine sony would like another killer app for the ps5 in time for christmas."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,ill be happy when it comes to pc. i have plenty of things to keep me busy until then
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"jim ryan sees that pc money. more and more of their business is coming there, and sooner. just a few years ago the thought of any ps first party stuff coming to pc ever was ridiculous. give it a few more years, and games will be day and date."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"yeah that would make more sense actually with fenrir being a child of loki. could be teaming up to take on odin. in mythology fenrir kills odin during ragnarok, im super curious how kratos plays into it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"oh, absolutely. and it is a sunday this year. skyrim released on 11.11.11. in germany this felt like a joke as it is the official beginning of carnival fasching."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"i think the more they release their games to pc, the closer to release dates they'll get. jim ryan sees dollar signs. it used to be no games were brought to pc. then just a few, way later. now tons of them. give it a few more years, and they'll be day and date. and ps fans will lose their minds like they did with spiderman recently"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,the god of war 2018 port was in development for over two years and they're just getting started on pc releases ramping up so i'd expect them to be like 6 months to a year for future titles compared to the several years that god of war and horizon zero dawn took to come to pc. in the end they still need to sell ps5s and if there weren't at least timed exclusives many people wouldn't even think of buying one. i wanted to play demon's souls remake asap so i got one but since microsoft announced all their first party titles would come to pc i haven't had any obligation to get a series s or x.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,none of your reasons make sense. people not having a good pc doesnt mean the game has to be exclusive to ps5 for 3 months..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"the point im trying to make is whats the point of making a game exclusive and branding it to the wider population as exclusive when they plan to go against that statement down the track anyway. same happened to days gone. if its exclusive, then it should stay that way. if you want to play it, support the platform is was originally developed for and purchase it. dont whinge and moan about the fact that you cant play it on pc."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i think culturally, elden ring changed the proverbial game. many many people who never touched a fromsoftware game picked it up. many companies and devs threw shade at them, like i have never seen before in my life. don't get me wrong, i was surprised that gow won....until i played it, and then i fully understood why it won. idk, it's hard to say now. im excited that it's coming out. i honestly wish they would just come out like january 1st just so i don't have to be salty either way. i feel like i'm going to be salty no matter what. i bet gowr is going to be incredible. elden ring has my heart for one of the best games of all time at the moment."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,elden ring is so overhyped. it's literally just open world dark souls
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"it's not so much a big open world. more like it's a big spiderweb. i think this is what people liked. some open world games take that fact too far and let people go anywhere, and unfortunately most of the time there's almost nothing around. elden ring designed it's open world so you naturally feel like going the way it wants you to go. that way there's always something there. sure you can sequence break and do things out of order, but you're never going to spend 30 minutes walkingparachutinggrappling up a mountain with nothing on top. odds are you'll find some enemies, a dungeon, an npc, or a special item at the end of whatever path you take. probably more than one of each! my point is, that freedom of explore is not as important as that exploration being meaningful. elden ring does that meaningful part really well. not only that, the wow factor from your exploration is almost unparalleled at times."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"after well over a decade of reiterations of the openworld where more and more we see handholding and cluttered screens full of information, elden ring came in and turned the format on it's side a little. the fact that horizon devs were freaking out on twitter about er says a lot about how the format has been going and how the way from shook things up. i get that it's more dark souls, but that is not what they did that will make ripples. i think if we are lucky, devs inspired by er will start making thoughtful games with tighter stories and less exposition, and please god let me see the world instead of a million meters mission markers. aaa openworld games have become very formulaic and stale, and i think er's success showed that people were interested in a different take, and i think that is gamechanging."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"i think elden rings open world is one of the best ever made. no matter where you go theres something cool to look at, a goal in the distance, a little hidden treasure or a catacomb. the game world is extremely densely packed with interesting things but it doesnt feel crowded, and i never found myself wandering aimlessly trying to find something worth doing while i put off the next major thing, and even when i do that thing it still feels like im discovering something unique because the game doesnt actually tell you where to go. the world isnt game changing, its nothing new, but its just things that have been done before, done to nearperfection."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,it's game changing for both souls like games and open world games imo.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"elder ring is definitely the most overrated game of all time, hands down so its got that going for it, i guess?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"this comment screams it's by someone who either hasn't played elden ring, or watched a full playthrough of the game and then was disappointed by the game afterwards. the game definitely did revolutionize open world game design. you can tell it was different because so many open world game devs complained about it when it came out. dark souls revolutionized a genre, that's a fact. there's no way that the success from elden ring, with it's incredible sales numbers and popularity, won't change the open world genre in the same way. even if you don't think it will or it should, the amount of buzz and money it generated is going to attract corporate execs like a moth to light. i guarantee some of these execs are already having meetings able how they're going to create the next elden ring.moreover, aaa open world genre or subgenre games already try to copy whatever other open world game is doing well, so expect plenty of elden ring influences."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,ahhh looks like someone is mad they didnt make it past the first boss. elden ring sold over 13 million copies and is one of the highest rated games of all time. you seem like one of those story guys who plays the game on the easiest difficulty. theres no way you think story and writing is more important than gameplay and world design.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,oh ok. thanks for the clarification
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"maybe? i dunno like i know what i can expect from ragnarok vaguely, and i think its gonna be a great story experience with a solid ass gameplay loop, but i feel elden ring really deserves the credit for breaking out into the market the way it did and reaching so many that had never touched a soulslike game before plus like i said ragnarok winning is almost a given because it'll both be massively high quality plus recent in reviewers minds"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"its just kinda the unfortunate way things happen, you cant really avoid recency bias"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,i'll have to look at the numbers to confirm this. but both er and cyberpunk were multiplat games. they had more eyes on them.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"and sony, being a giant ass corporation that holds licenses for games that will sell well no matter what, can and should completely ignore them. their sales won't be impacted negatively at all if the game is late. it's an exclusive for a console that's selling like hotcakes, and is one of the ever shrinking reasons people even own the damn thing. it'll sell."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"according to thishttpswww.vgchartz.comarticle453293ps5vsxboxseriesxssalescomparisonmarch2022 back in april of this year the sales of ps5s was outpacing the xbox and the gap was growing over the course of 12 months, i am not sure how you reckon that equals ps is losing customers to xbox over the last two years. also, the specs of the xbox have small advantages over the ps5 but to date that has not equaled performance advantages, so i am not sure exactly how objectively sony is in its worst state in twenty years."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,graphics sure but gameplay? did i miss something that got changed from gow ps4 to gow ps5? also gow ps4 graphics was already impressive as it is or are you that type of gamer that only cares about graphics

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"elden ring is absolutely one of the best games i have ever played, but realistically it didnt innovate much. it basically just put dark souls in an open world, but did it with complete mastery over the concept, which was certainly unexpected for a company who hasnt done open world before."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"many many people who never touched a fromsoftware game picked it up. that says more about the inaccessibility of their previous entries than it does about elden ring. elden ring is their easiest, most accessible game by a mile and the average gamer probably still needed a guide to know wtf they were doing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"i liked god of war, but not enough to feel that it deserved goty imo. same goes with red dead, though i adored its story. ragnarok is shaping up to be a whole nother level though, and i havent played elden ring."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"not really. people like to talk about stuff, that's all. in the end, it really doesn't matter. to anyone. and we can't even agree as a group of gamers which goty award really matters many people hate the game awards, so the tiny percentage it might matter... it matters far less. i mean... sekiro won game of the year in 2019. red dead 2 didn't in 2018. is sekiro a better game than red dead 2? lol. no. it's just something to argue about every year, it means less than nothing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,another tlou2? well it won in 2020 so why not
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"which is why it's a mixed bag. always somewhere cool to discover. but sometimes discovering it can be annoying. like, you know that poison castle to the north? i almost completely missed it because i didn't see the single path i was suppose to take to it. and the funny thing is, it's not even a hidden path or anything. the world is just too open in some areas it can become confusing as to which direction leads you to where you want to go. another example is when i was exploring calied, i saw the beach area where you fight rodahn. i wanted to travel there and spent a good hour before i learned the only way to get to that beach is to be teleported via the boss fight which i wasn't at yet. that wasn't very fun. and honestly, sometimes, the game can go a little overboard with it's secrets. i get that some people really enjoy that kind of stuff, but to me, when sidequests become so obtuse that you need a guide, it ruins the fun. all the times i had to talk to an npc, exhaust their dialogue, rest at a bonfire, and then talk to them again. like, wtf? when does the game ever tell you you should do that?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i can agree on that, idk about dark souls but i do know that in elden ring i choosr whenever the fuck i want to sctually progress the boss. correct me if im wrong but i think dark souls is more skillbased that if you fight against a boss, you have to best it to progress while in elden ring you can just go explore another beautifully, living breathing locstion and come back later, if this is the case then it is game changing, but dark souls players, you know this bettee than i do so i personally want to be directed the right direction."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,ever heard of botw? the game which influenced elden ring.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i mean, botw came out 4 years before elden ring and had all that stuff you're talking about, with a less cluttered map and such. and it was way more fun to actually explore, that incentivized players finding or creating their own paths... as for the less handholdy, players discover the lore on their own...dark souls did that too. it's a fromsoft staple. so nothing you said was anything new that games haven't already done. i'm sorry but i fail to see how elden ring changed the game. great game, though. but it could have been called dark souls 4 and no one would have really noticed."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"oh i agree in that regard. it's just insane to me how many interesting and unique areas they crammed into that massive game. and it's places i've never seen in video games before. not just another forest zone or lava zone or dessert zone although tbf it did have a kinda generic starting zone, but that's fine. it had, like...hell. a demon world. university sitting in the middle of a shallow lake. an underground area that looked like outerspace. it was so unique. like i said, i like that stuff about elden ring. but the physical act of explore was tedious because the game isn't as open as it looks. you can't make your own path anywhere. you have to take the specific paths in the spiderweb like map. give me botw's exploration with elden ring's world design. that'd be the perfect game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,i think you guys use game changing when you really mean to say really good. because i don't really see what elden ring did that other games haven't done before it. the gameplay is literally identical to dark souls. the only major difference is how big and open the areas are. but it's not even a true open world. it's still just dark souls. just with really spacedout and wideopen zones. but you're still forced upon a predetermined path.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"you can tell it was different because so many open world game devs complained about it when it came out. besides the 1 dude from the horizon dev team, i'm not sure anyone complained."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,you say empty phrases with no real arguments. if your measure of success is money then cyberpunk 2077 is a better game than elder ring. hell... even fifa is better than elder ring. diablo immortal is most likely better than elder ring. using money as measure of success is moronic. there is nothing that elder ring is doing that was not been done. it was a blast for from software fans because this time studio did something different so in 2022 you could finally play open world game but that's it. and nobody complained about it. some people liked it because it's a decent game but that's ot. stop making shit up.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,baseless assumption from a fanboy. and you are not even original. every shitty fanboy out there is using same argument. because it's all you have. if you talk about sales then cyberpunk 2077 is a better game than elder ring. whole story and writing is not more important there is no omitting the fact that story and writing are horrible in elder ring.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"you can usually do other things in dark souls if you run up against a hard boss. you can sometimes do an optional area or farm a bit. however, it's not nearly as fun as exploring another area entirely, going down a different path and actually making progress in a different way, like you can do in elden ring."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"and botw was itself heavily praised for how it did its open world. er and botw both follow very similar concepts of focusing on exploration for their worlds, though imo elden ring does it a lot better."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"that sounds good in theory but i suspect it might actually make the game more boring. by taking the intended path youll probably see 15 more interesting things along the way which is obviously good, but if you just climb up a cliff youll miss all that and have no reason to ever go and see them unless some npc tells you to. a lot of quests work by an npc telling to you to go to x place, but youd probably have no idea where that was if you hadnt seen it already. by making the player choose from certain paths, it makes sure they see these places and remember them for quests so they dont have to go look up the wiki as much, which obviously ruins the fun."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,the combat isn't identical tho. guard counters and ashes of war are substantial changes to combat. and i'm not sure what you mean by true open world? there are many different ways to approach areas and demigods. i've 6 characters at the moment that have completed the game and not even a single one of them took the same path.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"i think botw and elden ring follow opposite concepts of exploration. botw is about forging your own path. climing. gliding. riding a horse. flying through the air on a tree like tao pai pai. using fire to create updrafts to launch yourself upwards. elden ring is taking one of the predetermined paths along the spiderweb like map. it's just a lot more open, now. you can think of it basically just like dark souls, but with a few wideopen areas and a horse. gameplay wise it hasn't really changed anything that from hasn't done before hand. but botw? no game has replicated it's exploration since. it's creativity. it's playeringenuity. botw's world feels like a real, living world. elden ring's world feels like a video game. everything is always the same. every time you bonfire, enemies are always reset in the same place. nothing is dynamic."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"the game is so massive, even following a wiki guide, i missed a lot of shit. regardless of how you play, it is inevitable for a game as big as elden ring that players will miss something. so i don't think giving players better traveloptions would ruin the game. also, a lot of npc's tell you to go to a place? when was this? most npc's say something super vague like i'm heading north or i'm sure we'll meet again one day. man, the sidequests in elden ring are an entire other issue this game has. but i digress. the map was so big and confusing they actually had to update it so npc icons appeared on the map because they were so hard to find and remember where they were. the game's overly obtuse nature worked better in dark souls and sekiro because those maps were a lot smaller. since elden ring is so big, it's so easy to miss important npcs. i never completed the jarman's quest because he just never showed up where he was suppose to."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"the combat is basically just an improved dark souls 3. lets not kid ourselves. it plays identical to a ds game. even with ashes and guard added. and the openworld isnt really open. its a spiderweb of paths to take. the only way to get to where you want to go is to take the specific path along that web. meanwhile, botw you have 360 degrees in which you can travel, with the ability to overcome any obstacle in your way. elden ring you are constantly being blocked off by cliffs and other obstructions and you have no other choice but to turn back and find another route."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,summons and ash of wars are new systems that provides a ton of options for combat. this were never present in souls games or sekirobb. and i actually feel the opposite about how real the world feels. botw had shrines and every shrine was effectively the same. er actually has unique places with their own unique secret and pathways. it's much better designed imo.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"oh yeah, combat is improved dark souls 3 combat. but that's what expected because it's the smoothest version of ds combat. and there's also spirit ashes that change the combat radically. botw you have 360 degree in which you can travel you can do this in er too. it's literally an open world, you can go wherever you want. for example, you can skip margit, godrick and renalla and straight go for capital just from the start within 1 hour. i know you are trying to convey some valid point here but i personally felt like it was one of the most freeing open world ngl."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"elden ring has a ton of variety but it isn't exempt from having a couple copypaste dungeons of it's own. the black knife lairs and the fallen hero graves are an example. and i agree the shrines in botw were too copypaste, but at least they were more creative. at least they incentivized finding your own way to solve them. meanwhile, elden ring over here going you do it this way, or you die. elden ring is just so...still. so static. you see a pack of wolves hunting some animals? guess what? they are always there. they don't dynamically hunt like in botw. they're basically just setdressing used to make the faux appearance of a living world. honestly, the openworld in elden ring was cool, but it honestly wasn't even necessary. they could have kept the map smaller like in dark souls and it would have been mostly the same experience. it would have cutout a lot of boring horseriding sections too. and hey? a smaller map means we wouldn't have to cut the multiplayer from 6players down to just 4."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"my 360 degree example was that you can literally walk in any direction in a straight line in botw and keep going. walls? climb em. cliffs? glide down them. water? swim over it. any obstacle can be overcome. elden ring you can go in a straight line for maybe 30 seconds before hitting an impassable cliff or something that forces you to find another route. my greatest enemy in elden ring is cliffs. so many fucking cliffs. really ruined the fun of exploring when i was constantly getting blocked off by more cliffs. sure, there's tons of cool areas to explore. but the actual act of exploring them isn't very fun."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"you do it this way or you die i was never forced to approach an encounter in a certain way. there are bosses which heavily favor some builds but the game never forces a single playstyle on the player. agree with similar looking dungeons though, it's not a perfect game. but given the size and scope of the game, it still has more varied design in terms of enemies, dungeons and gear than most open world games. i don't think open is unnecessary. it has that quality of ah! how do i get to that location that fuels my exploration big time. also agree with coopmultiplayer. they shouldn't have done it dark souls style. it feels dated for an open world"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,oh you meant traversal tools. i definitely agree there. botw and hfw both do better and modern job of providing traversal tools. that's something i'd like them to improve in er 2. new traversal options would be great.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"the problem is that everything always uses elder futhark. elder futhark was not used to write norwegian, or old icelandic, or even old norse. it was used on incredibly archaic germanic languages like proto germanic and gothic, it predates the words they're trying to use it on by centuries. when you see the hundreds of wooden rune stick inscriptions in bergen, they're in medieval futhork. not elder futhark. that was the only runic alphabet ever used on relatively 'modern' scandinavian langauges, save for the dalecarlian runes and lvdalska in sweden. on top of that, they just substitute latin letters like a font, which isn't how runes were used. they didn't use silent letters, except in the case of omitting nasal consonants and some initial consonants like hs. almost no mainstream western media seems to understand that there isn't one runic alphabet. writing what they do in the alphabet they always choose makes as much sense as writing modern polish in old church slavonic."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,they copied thor from end game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,belive me guys this game will be something like ac valhala open world micro transactions and graind
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,older atreus seems so much like puberty jaden smith. watch any scene from after earth movie and then the trailer for ragnarok if you dont see it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,damn they got thor from endgame.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,the kid actually sounds annoying now. what a weird artistic choice
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,is it just me or santa monica launching gow ragnarok is totally anachronistic?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,ragnarok has finally come i guess this the extinction of man kind
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,remember when we thought roger clark would be thor?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i like that tyr, thor and freya don't really look like gods besides tyr being huge. expected tyr to be built like a tank."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,...is here in two years
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,where?where is it?

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"kinda surprised not to see nolan north, laura bailey or troy baker in a first party sony game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,this is going to be a masterpiece
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i liked the first not that it was the first but you know but there was something missing for me compared to the older games. i really hope they give us some better battles, more enemy variety and some actual boss fights this time. i know there were the valkyries to fight, but it was optional and they were basically all the same fight so i couldn't even be bothered to do them all. not wanting to spoil but the end of the game was quite an anticlimax, even if storywise it was pretty good. i really missed the big fights with a lot of small enemies and a couple of cyclops, things like that. gow 2 and 3 i played over and over and absolutely loved, but just the once for gow and haven't felt any urge to replay it. i think the whole open worldness of it came about 510 years too late for me, with my desire to play open world games at an all time low."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,mimir
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,the yellow part of artreus's outfit gives me infamous vibes. maybe its the colour choice
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i'm beyond hyped for this game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"so that was totally tyr on the mural at the end of god of war, right? same color scheme on his skirt blue and red, and tyr looks out for blood and wanting to kick off ragnarok while loki is trying to stop it? i think tyr succeeds and dies, while loki curses him realizing that ragnarok was going to happen anyways, but now he loki is at the center of it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,this will be the sole reason i'll get a ps5.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,it's here!.....with no release date.. lol

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"never got into the god of war series, what does kratos have to do with norse stuff?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,where the fuck is jrmungandr?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i'm seeing lots of clues about a future possible egyptian mithology and i'm out of my mind it's literally the one thing i wanted since forever, adult atreus or older kratos facing blood thirst horus and anubis and also the biggest mithology together with greek and northern ones many years from now, i 'd also like to see south american mithology coming into game another mithology i' m waiting since forever is indian one, thinking about meeting shiva and co is pretty sick if you ask me, those gods have pretty awesome designs"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,guess im actually going to have to buy a ps5
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,any planned release date?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"the real question is, will i be able to ply it on pc with playstations streaming platform. most likely no but its hard to find ps5"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,finally i can cosplay as thor and not feel bad about it '
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"since durlin is here, are we getting a version of tyrfing?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,need to play more god of war games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,dad thor is the best
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i need a ps5. this looks great as usual
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,its awesome that not only is atreus va the same model for the game but hes growing up like the character so his focus matches perfectly!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"wonder if freyr will show up, or be left in the dust while his sister gets the limelight? and if ragnarok indeed comes, will surtr and the flame giants along with the wolf trio show up?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"ive never played a god of war game, would i need to play others before this or could i just pick it up with this game?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,inner child screaming
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,this dlc or a separate game?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,and i still can't have a ps5

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,im just holding onto hope this means the last one is gonna hit pc eventually!!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,atreuss voice actor didn't sound that good is it just me?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"wait that's still sunny as atreus? shit, i thought it was a new actor he sounds so different. i know it's been a few years but goddamn they really do grow up fast."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,will it be on ps4?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i dont like sunny suljic
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,wake me when kratos gets to the modern era and deals with all the religions in his hunt for their nonexistent gods
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i bet ya thor is going to be a unit of a boss fight.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,damn they got the thor who let himself go
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,they went with fat thor i guess
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,thor became a discord mod
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,its not actually here yet.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,by looking at thor. i can finally say i have the body of a god
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,weird. i thought his name was boy.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,this was never asked in the dev interview but i hope the game retains the one camera shot or whatever it is called from the first game. it really helped with the storytelling by not having any cuts in the scenes.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i am glad these actors are getting the credit they deserve here. phenomenal, incredible work in the first game. i cannot fucking wait for this game to come out. i can't think of having ever looked forward to a sequel so much."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,dad bod thor returns
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"not a fan of thor's design, but to their credit it actually makes sense to portray him that way"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"ah, time for another drinking game when the word boi pops up. maybe....."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,this is so cool! im so hyped
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,isnt that the guy from fortnite?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"for those that dont know, ryan hurst is opie from sons of anarchy if youre a fan of the show!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,excellent
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i kinda wish it had more action on cover.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i see durlin.... where is cran?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,will odin be in the game at all? he showed up last thing in the previous game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,so is kratos gonna be ragnarok or is it gonna be atreus?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,freya looks like she should be starring in a my chemical romance music video
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,is brok a real god or just a local frat bro
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,thor took a couple of bear
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"surprised the 3rd picture didn't cause the post to get nuked. would've made for a good post on rsubredditdrama, especially with how spicy controversial is on here."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"well... super excited about this game, but have the feeling that i'll dislike atreus character here. hate teenagers with a moody behaviour."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,freya looks like lisa bonet
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,why does tyr have both hands??? and what the heck happened to thor!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,when do you think tyr is losing the arm?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i hope in the end tyr sends kratos back in time to egypt...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,here as in its announced or its out?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,but the ps5 isnt!!!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,thank god they didnt call it god of war 2
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,why is thor fat
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,your son is chris finch from the office uk
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,me cant wait.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,is it gonna be on ps4 too
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"honestly genuine question but is tyr? powerful? how powerful is he to have kratos, literally a killer of all gods, reach out for help from him?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"seriously freya looks really pissed. judging by her actions in the trailer, she's going to take the part of her late son baldur and becoming a stalker and assailant of kratos and atreus. i think she eventually will even reclaim her valkyrie armour and then all hell breaks loose, because imagine having to fend off someone who is even stronger than the valkyrie queen from the previous game. man i'm so hyped."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,no it is not!!!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"tyr will die and kratos will take over the role of god of war only after defeating odin or deceiving odin with atreus though that could be in the future because theres enough to make a 3rd, atreus may betray kratos, im interested to see the loli dynamic i was like holy shit when they said it in game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"man, freya looks pissed."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,so glad i don't have to get a ps5 for this game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,ah tyr ac valhalla flashbacks
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,remind me of that fat thor at marvel
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"freya, hela, what is it with mad evil female villains that's so fucking hot."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,kids watching this trailer properly screamed. it's the guy from fortnite they must have.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,i'm fuckin excited despite the fact that i'm not gonna be able to play this game in a million years.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,he was my favorite part of the whole game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,the theory was interesting but dont you think hed be able to read norse language if he was?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,and with both hands
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,that would have been a cool twist too  kratos just being tyr with amnesia.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,and the funny thing is people are still tying in a time paradox with it. i really don't think that's going to happen anymore since it already happened in the last gow series. it would just be cheap
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i was really thinking it would be atreus with his thirst for knowledge and gift of languages. but who knows, it could go so many ways and i love that about this series."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"strange, how would that work with the prophecy that loki will kill him?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,definitely more surprising to see tyr than anything since it seemed like they were setting up kratos as tyr via the time loop associated with ragnarok but is that really tyr? he has both of his hands
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,loki was the one who got into an eating contest with logi though.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"finally someone made thor look awesome! i love the character designs, good job!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i got a chuckle at the way tyr is holding his arm. he should keep his distance from wolves.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,seeing these devs interpretation of fenrir will be interesting. jrmungundrs design in the previous game was awesome.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i commented about the hand, never thought of the option to explain it in game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,wait whats gonna happen? its been a while since i last played so i dont remember some stuff
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,username checks out
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,ryan hurst as thorbesity
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i look like a god
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,he looks like end game thor
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,what did you expect from a fatdobber?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i didnt even see that was thor. i was too distracted by the convenient gut window in his armor for sexual appeal. so shameless, women only want one thing and its fucking disgusting."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,don't worry he can dance in fortnite for you forever
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"spoiler from last game, but you remember the hall in jotunehim that depicted all of the stories on the wall that the giants knew already but still had yet to actually happen? one of the scenes on that wall shows kratos death. so, unfortunately, when it comes to the end of kratos, the writing was actually on the wall."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"end of kratos for the main series game, possibly. they could still pull off a game bridging the 2 together. and of course atreus could try to revive kratos in the next installment, which could be pretty cool however they try it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,wont be the end. atreus and angrboda still need to grow up a little bit and have their kids. fenrir and the world serpent.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,since he's a god doesn't he only become more powerful with age? i really hope he doesn't die.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"possibly. kratos said that the drawings were your story in reference to boy. kratos probably dies permanently at the end this game of or in the beginning of next game. slowly introducing atreus as the main character. gow4 he's just a background character, just a few buttons little more but yeah gow5 largely playable but kratos will be your main character gow6 atreus is who you play as for the entirety of the game. little knowledge of norse mythology, just speculation"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"looks as old as in the last game, he kicked all kinds of ass. if he dies in the game, won't be of old age lol."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"leaked script thor you stupid old manyou dont get to rush this. thor swings mjonir into kratos head atreus father! get up! father, fucking up! please stop! please dont do thisfather, please get up!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"strictly speaking, olympians are usually regarded as immortal. think about how old zeus looked in iii."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,spoilers kratos will die
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"he died 3 times already, he always finds a way to live. if he dies again, valkyries will help him live"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i think they mentioned in the ps connect that this game is drawing the end of the norse story line so maybe
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"they pretty much confirmed in the little talk with the director afterwards that this is the end of the norse saga and that ragnarok does happen in it, so yeah id bet money that someone gon die"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"well we're gonna need a reason to go to valhalla, i still think he's gonna come back though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,yes
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"in the poetic edda, she was loki's lover. even bore him 3 children. but they were never married. wonder why."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,shes robbing the cradle

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,metoo '
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,why do characters from the same mythology have different symbols then? i don't know what the symbols represent but i'd say it's not mythology.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,here in a few years..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"thor in the eddas was known for 1 eating an entire wedding feast because he forgot he was pretending to be sif long story and 2 drinking so much seawater disguised as beer that in 3 drafts the sea had lowered enough to reveal new islands, before turning around and lifting jormungandr and almost beating death in a wrestling match longer story this is a thor who looks like he could do that shit."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"the giants once invited thor and loki to a friendly feast where they used illusion magic to make the aesir appear weak. they gave thor a drinking horn and he chugged as hard as he could but it only went down a tiny bit and all the giants laughed and asked him if he needed a smaller container. the beer in the horn was actually the fucking sea. which thor lowered by several feet, even exposing new islands. he drinks so much that you need an actual ocean of beer to make him look bad."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,hes a bit depressed.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,well they called him fat in the first god of war... so...

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"remember, giants aren't always big. atreus is half giant, and he's still small. laufey was full giant and still around kratos' height."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"the last of us part 2 was incredible, so this game could stand to do worse than be like it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,have faith in santa monica. they know what they are doing.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,do u hate gays
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,well it's part 2 of the atreus story
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,the original games played all the same
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"yes, it looks the same and combat is probably very similar, but the original game was great, the graphic was photorealistic, had a great story and a nice combat, so if it's just an expansioncontinuation of that with more realms and better boss fights because they admited they had a limited budged for the first game i'm up for this!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"because everyone calls him a big, dumb, fat idiot in the last game. he is a drunkard and violent person with no selfrestraint in either eating, drinking or fighting"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,he looks like that in the original mythology
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,educate yourself first
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,you do know that thor looks exactly like that in mythology right?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,because he eats a lot.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,because its accurate to mythology.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,atreus is loki.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"he is a guy that drinks enough water to lower the ocean and eats enough to outpace the personification of fire loggi. also a drunkard and generally unrestrained asshole, it is supposed to give abusive dad vibes"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,said only one person.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,what exactly was the old ps3 style?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,also thor looks a bit tubby lol. that is the accurate representation of thor in norse myths
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"danielle bisutti played her last time, what do you mean?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,hows it an artistic choice when its the exact same actor
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,how?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"gow 1 through 3 and all the in between titles covers his warpath through all of greek mythology. in the end he hates gods and being one and all the ruin they bring. so being the last god left, he gets on a boat and starts sailing, to leave it all behind. he ends up on the shores of the world of norse mythology. he does his best to live quiet and as hidden as he can but since he is a god the other godsbeings of norse mythology sense something is differentalien about him. the open seaocean, seems to serve as a void between all the different pantheon of gods. norseland is just where he happened to have ended up."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"definitely play the ps4 one first, it's awesome anyway"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,new game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"shut up, head."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i would quite literally just sit on the voat to hear his stories
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"agree, mimir's voice, tales and accent made the game for me as well."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,just listening to mimirs stories just made feel giddy and child like
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"no, the theory was that he would go on to become tyr and learn everything along the way and i believe they hinted at tyr being able to time travel so that's the basis of it. not that i agreed with it. particularly but it could've been a cool arc"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"the theory was based on the idea that time travel was involved. the world serpent was supposedly thrown back in time by ragnarok, and the tyrkratos theory posited that kratos was also going to be thrown back in time as well, where he then takes on the persona of tyr. as tyr, the norse god of war, he then travels to other lands gathering things he needs and setting up his temples and stuff so that past kratos and atreus can get to where they need to go."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,first thing i noticed too. but it makes sense if this current atreusloki hasn't spawned fenrir yet. of course jormungandr is timeywhimey
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,tyr in the picture holding his hand like
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,oooooh shit maybe its another god and they fake us all out? itd be a very odin move to disguise himself as tyr or someone important to get close to his target and learn their secrets
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,oh yeah thats right whups
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i'm half expecting fenrirhel to just be some kind of atreus spell
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"norse mythology. so, spoilers."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,it gets bitten off by fenrir
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"he's not obese, he just... drank half of the ocean"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,that's a weird way to spell melted ice cream
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,oh no
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,hiss!!!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,removed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,he's died like 3 times already
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,he died in god of war 2 and came back. if he dies again he is just going to end up in helheim and make his way back to midgard
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,this.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"the director apparently said this is the end of the norse gods, and someone in another sub said maybe kratos dies at the end and atreus takes him to the nile to try and resurrect him. and that's how the egyptian gods are introduced since we already know they were playing with the idea of kratos visiting the egyptian gods."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,but i don't want to play as atreus
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,and hel
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i don't think norse mythology has much to do with it gow4 mostly used the characters and world in their own way rather than following the myths, sort of like marvel does. for example, balder is not a vengeful psychopath in the myths, and he's not freya's son he's odin and frigg's, alongside thor and hder."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"makes sense from a story point of view but then again, kratos is so iconic with the god of war series, it would be the same as removing master chief from halo. they actually tried that with halo 5 by making you play half the game as some other spartan called locke and fans didn't really like it. besides, kratos died a couple times already and always came back soooo"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"yeah i ain't playing any more gows if they make atreus the main... sorry, but i just won't stop seeing him as a kid. same issue i had with ellie in the last of us 2. they killed off the character i wanted to play to pass the torch to the new generation or whatever."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i can guarantee that this part of the script will be repeated a whole lot.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,my favorite part in the script is when the stars align and kratos stumbles into the asgard cafeteria during lunch time.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,not the first time...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i just realised. if kratos dies at the hands of thor atreus will want vengeance against the norse god for taking his family and the cycle of hatred begins anew.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,he was already married to one of the gods. she would hold a basin to catch the poison from the snake when he was tied to the rock. when the basin filled he would get dripped on in the eyes while she poured it out.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"lets fucking goooo, i dont have to buy a ps5"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,he might not want the downgraded version.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i think it's the different races. thor, tyr and mimir have the same symbol aesir?, freya has a different one vanir, the dwarves all share the same one and atreus and angrboda share the same symbol."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,wasn't it originally slated for this year? i'm kinda expecting it next year. plus what we've seen in the trailer looks like it's pretty far already
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,what is mythology? i only know marvel. s
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,do gods get fatter like humans? was the bubble belly mentioned?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,let's kill him properly this time
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,thorbelix
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"yup, in the actual mythology its just really fucking heavy"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i learn something new everyday
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,don't know why you are down voted. brushing your teeth 30 second is better than never brushing your teeth. at least we know a bit more about the next gow
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i kinda agree on those golden ones but most of it is new.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,noobmaster69 strikes again
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,hes actually an ally in gow4
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"he is. only to the jotnar, though. not sure if in the games universe he is the one to bring ragnarok. would be sweet, though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i guess. i'm too use to their depictions as tall, muscley , blue people"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"kratos is technically jotuun as well, though the game doesn't mention it directly, lokis father is a jotuun who's name translates to he who strikes dangerously. the jotuun live in a land seperate from the gods, but are equal in power, the ps4 game made a very very smart analysis that that could mean the jotuun were gods of foreign lands"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i know. she just doesnt look norse like every other character in the game. so i was wondering if there was significance to that. maybe she creates the tie in to the next pantheon of the third game?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"erasing white history in a game with a completely fictional contest and they couldn't be any diversity in a game with dwarfs, dark elves, giants and gods?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,same thing
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"ok ok, soo ankboda in the norse mythology is loki's wife and the mother of jrmungndr, hella and fenrir"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-01-15,you sure?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"agreed, they have not disappointed yet. still skeptical."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,and we were very happy with cd projekt and then cyberpunk came out. i truly cannot think of a game where the hype train was better than it would've been to not hype it so much.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,what do you mean?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,dude she hasnt been revealed till now wdym out of character?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,yeah but kratos is greek
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,reee black wamen bad.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,forced diversity and interracial agenda since they will be hooking her up with atreus
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-14,forced?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,but cratos is white? and also from greecesparta?? what youre saying is irrelevant. the ethnicity of his real world voice actor has nothing to do with the story
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"when everyone else looks like scandinavian brok too, despite his blue skin her appearance does break immersion, made me go huh? for a second. then again, she's the only proper jotunthere's the world serpent, but he's a snek we see for the first time since atreus is half greek. maybe that's what jotuns generally look like in gow world? still odd that they found a need to do this though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,then why is she west african and not giant looking at all
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,characters had blue skin in norse mythology...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"yeah that's kinda my point. that particular character seems like the least preferable to choose. it would be like making the only non greek looking character in the original gow medusa. it seems like the worst possible way of going about it to pick a character that is already somewhat stigmatized in the source material. you just as easily could have had him run into a trader from a far off land and involve them in the story i bet you didn't know that the vikings traded extensively and the archeological record shows they were visited by traders from africa, the middle east and asia"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,because of the blackwashing advocacy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,because they are nervous about the skin color of one of the characters
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i guess like it's automatically a problem
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-13,"wonder why you're getting downvoted for stating the literal truth, probably salty ps fans."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-10-01,"all right so a white actor for black panther is fine, it didn't happen, they can do what the fuck they want, it's not disrespectful right?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,nope
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,respectfully that game sucked and ruined what could have been a great franchise.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"yeah i know and i am sure it will be great  i was just hoping to see more different areas and characters  and maybe a new gameplay twist. like i said i expect to really like this game it looks awesome, i was just hoping for another 10 and this looks more like an 89."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,i think this could have been a dlc. love the downvotes of al those god of war butthurt fanboys btw
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,wait what?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,that was half drunk and has room temperature iq
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,huh. i always thought she voiced freya in 2018. turns out she had no role in that game. my bad.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"yeah, i figured it's the same actor, but he chose not to go the earnest, arrogant, or unsure route. he was just going to be a whiny zoomer. not a huge reach for said actor."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"the span of time , i mean maybe because of covid gow 4 seems very recent."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,is there a specific title to get? god of war something?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"yup, they were quite enthralling"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i agree but i think the loki reveal was already the big focus and it would have been a little hat on a hat
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"yeah he wrestled an old lady instead, and lost. but she wasnt any old lady."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"thor basically chugged an olympic pool worth of mead and lowered the ocean, that's a few calories"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,oh yeah right haha
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,oh no oh no oh no no no
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,why are you just copying other people's comments?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i mean sure, when he was a much younger god in his own realm. theres like 2,000 years between greek mythology and norse mythology. so i think its safe to say kratos has probably aged a thousand years or more since he was cheating death last. those were all in the last series as well, back in the fixed camera angle button mashing days, this is a new series with a different direction. also, in case you havent noticed, the giants dont usually miss with their prophecies. its why odin hates them, they can basically see the future because of their different perception of time and he was immensely jealous of that gift. however, kratos does like to fuck shit up. who knows what will happen, i just wouldnt be too surprised if he did die next game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,make his way back to midgard and then egypt please.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"see my reply to the other guy that brought up how hes died before edit you arent wrong tho. i think hell die, but honestly who knows."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,well mjlnir can resurrect the dead...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i think its the only logical way to move the series forward. theres still years between the greek and norse eras that we could look at too. like how did kratos get to norse, how did he actually survive the end of gow3. and, again, i think well be playing kratos the majority of this game. i just think it would feel right to finish the game as atreus, especially since hes been learning from kratos this whole time."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,but do you want to play as fenir? because it looked to me like that's what is was implying for kratos.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"fenrir and jormungadr are overrated, hel is the most badass"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i'd highly recommend watching this video. httpsyoutu.beyegrhiaao7u it shows how all of the changes made were actually very deliberate and centre around the big reveal of atreus being loki. loki is one of the gods who appears the most in norse myths, by removing him it completely changes a lot of the relationships between the gods which leads us to getting things like baldur being as insane as he was."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,didn't mimir say that freya was another name for frigg in one of the boat tales?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"frigg and freya are largely seen as being one and the same, though it is debated."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"that's why you slowly change the main character, rather than just immediately drop kratos. by working in atreus you get the player more familiar. you start the game where he's just some arrows and a whiny voice, by the end he's a crucial mechanic in tougher gameplay and stopping baldur."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i see your point but atreus has actual character growth and you know where his power comes from, not to mention he can be worked in over the course of 3 games. why is abby so strong? we don't really know... i've never seen a woman with arms like that why is atreus so strong? he's a part god, part mortal, part titan, part giant who is trained by kratos the greek god of war, the ghost of sparta who is apparently world renowned for killing gods. and sm isn't neil cuckman, they put actual life in their games, and is built around a love for their players, their employees and the story they create. just curious, what would they have to do to make atreus look more like an adult?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,dying is routine for kratos
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,yes and sony can milk da shit out of it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,and he would scream so loud that the earth shook. that's how earthquakes happened
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"could be, but atreus and angrboda is kinda weird isn't it? angrboda is usually a giant isn't she?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"everywhere ive seen says 2022 but nothing concrete. and yeah they wanted it this year. im assuming because when you finish the game brok says when fimbul winter starts it means three years until ragnarok, and 2021 wouldve been three years after the game released"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,ive been hearing it's been pushed back to 2023. also that this will be the end of the norse arch instead of a trilogy. so my thinking is they combined the 2nd and 3rd game together in this. i hope it doesn't feel too rushed storywise...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"to their credit, he got fat in the mcu, too!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,no he is never described as fat in the eddas nor depicted as such in ancient sculptures and art. he is mainly described by his hair and such and the fact he is very hedonistic. terms like sloppy are used but never fat.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,so heavy that he needs to wear a belt that gives him 1 strength to be able to wield it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,also it is not even really true in marvel as other characters were able to wield thors hammer like captain america
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-15,that's how fans shows anger
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"yeah, i just didn't want to spoil it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"he did kill baldur with a branch of mistletoe, so its entirely likely hes meant to be the same loki"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,not sure if in the games universe he is the one to bring ragnarok. ... kratos literally did that when he killed balder.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"she is supposed to be atreus's partner, so they have to be the same age so it does not look rapey for a fullblown adult to go after teenagers."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"you are downvoted by numbed mind people. a black teenager girl doesn't really suit the role. she looks so out of place i had to check if i remember who the heck was angrboda correctly lol. well, nothing i can do anyway. it's a deliberate and conscious artistic choice."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"not every other, you're forgetting one very nonnorse character that plays kind of a significant role in the story... kratos."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"she does not look norse because jtnar are not norse, or worshipped by the norse. they are a completely different species that loves in another dimension of reality"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,removed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,oh cool thanks for the info.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,finally someone whos excited by the prospect of having angrboda and atreusloki in the same game and around the same age!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,wait.. we were in hels domain in the first game. how could this exist when loki didn't know his wife and mother of hel yet?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-01-15,"i know, i know"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"dance kratos dance, strip for me in fortnite"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,greek gods had ambrosia and nectar
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,you want to check your spelling before leaving a comment. women has letter o not a.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,how is it interracial agenda to have a interracial couple in media? thats like saying the bible has an interracial agenda cuz moses wife was black
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"yep, they know exactly what they're doing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-14,"yes, thats what i said. do you want me to repeat it one more time? forced diversity."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"who cares what color their skin is? the very fact that people are mentioning this is the exact problem. the whole gow world has been loosely based on mythology and doesn't represent the real mythos at all. in this universe, the jotungiants are apparantly black. move on."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,by that right every voice actor for any darth vader adaptations should be black aswell.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,hes white because hes covered in the ashes of of his first family dude was not pale the entire time
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,isn't she a shapeshifter? that is probably just what she likes to look like.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,she's a fucking giant dude. use your imagination.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-20,brokkr did not though
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"lol, do you know what was wrong with my comment that got me downvoted so hard? i got downvoted even harder than you, but your comment was far more politically incorrect, as far as i can tell..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,they worry about the integrity of the cultures that are being appropriated frequently nowadays
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,to even imagine that vikings were as diverse as modern america is absolute disrespect to norse culture
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-10-01,yes
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,don't know why it matters so much but go off
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,so this is really the hill you want to die on?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,there was 4 of the original games until the formula changed so i wasn't expecting it to change here. the norse games will all be the same until they move to egypt or something.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"if it' 20 hours long or even more, some says it will be 40 hours long, then it deserves to be a stand alone game. they already changed everything with gow 2018. too many changes wouldn't have been necessary."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"egypt is most likely out of the question. they already referenced the gods of egypt when in tyrs vault. and if you think about it from a time standpoint, the civilization we know as ancient egypt existed between ancient greece and medieval midgard. so egypt already came and went by the norse era. kratos mustve lived through that time period somewhere else. wouldve loved to have kratos fight sobek tho. egypts part animal gods wouldve made for some fucking awesome boss fights"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,'the only logical way' x200b in a series that can be summarized as 'kratos was pissed off then killed all of greek mythology then decided to murder norse mythology' has to have logic?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"then be illogical. kratos is a goddemigod whatever. he shouldn't be aging in the first god damn place. i hate passingthetorch stories because it kills all emotional investment i've put into a character. the only time it was acceptable to me was the end of red dead when john's son got his revenge. thats the one exception. but everything else just feels like we're bored of making this character, so we're gonna replace him. here's he's infinitely less impressive replacement who you have no real investment in! if kratos dies its' the death of the gow series for me. just like killing joel caused me to completely shut down tlou2 and never finish it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"no, i want to play as kratos. i want to be kratos forever. he's the character i grew up with, i don't want him to be replaced with his son."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"you know now that you mention it, loki was the vibe check to the gods. a constant reminder of the bad they had done and the bad they could do. there was an overall theme in norse gods to just despising loki for being so open about truth rather than silent about even when odin wished for such. without loki there is no vibe check which means gods ultimately have free reign to do as they please."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,do we know if atreus is loki? or if he is just named after loki?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,odin damn it. now i have to replay gow4 to confirm this or not.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"if i remember correctly, there is an actual theory with evidence that suggests frjgg and freyja were once the same goddess, but got split later on. many of their domains seem to play off eachother in ways that make sense when you put them together goddess of weaving and a goddess that can see things in a weave, they have a number of similarities such as a husband that is often travelling, stuff like that. plus, i think frigg is more of a title than a name. so their decision does have some merit in that there are debates on this idea between scholars. i think one thing i had heard was that some christians decided they didn't like how important and powerful a woman was in their mythology and so they split her up, but i'm not a scholar so... could remember it wrong though, someone can inform me otherwise, it's been a while since i looked up a lot of norse mythology stuff."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i can see where the connection comes from both are goddesses of unions and shagged with odin on the regs, and they have similar names, but outside of that, it doesn't make sense. freya owns folkvangr, is known as a war goddess and is attributed with abilities, relics and allies that frigg aren't frigg is a goddess of visions and dreams which freya isn't though freya does do sejd or ritual magic. freya is also a valir where frigg is consistently a regular aesir."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,but in the end hes still just some arrows and an annoying voice i get your point for sure i just dont think hes a likeable or iconic enough character to replace such an iconic video game char in kratos. i personally dont think id play a game thats just atreus
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"just curious, what would they have to do to make atreus look more like an adult? it's not that he looks like a kid, it's that i've been playing his father. it feels wrong to go from playing kratos to playing kratos's kid. like all the emotional investment is fucked up because the character i have played is dead, and now suddenly i have to be feeling and thinking what an entirely different character is feeling and thinking and it's really jarring. same thing that happened with joel. i know that joel wasn't ellie's father, but it was like an adopted relationship  so that getting completely destroyed kind of just killed any emotional investment i had going forward and i couldn't play through all of tlou2 because of it. so if they kill off kratos to have atreus be the main character, it's just not going to work for me. because i'm kratos, i'm atreus's father. i can't suddenly just be atreus and be fine with that mentally. it's why i hate the passing the torch storylines  because its basically throwing out all the investment you've put in to that point. just doesn't work for me."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"another rumour out right now is that the game is going to be 40 hours long, no idea if that means 100 completion or just the main story. if its the main story being that long then this game is roughly double the length of the last game the main story in gow2018 can be finished in around 20 hours of gamepla"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"so, it's a bullcrap claiming that fat thor from here and from avengers endgame is more accurate to mythos? i think that it's pretty logical that people will worship gods that are idealistic and perfect in their essence. not such absurd claims about accuracy to mythos"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"yup, the enchantment on thor's belt meginjord gives him a lot of extra strength, though he is quite strong on his own. the hammer mjolnir's enchantment is it's accuracy when thrown such that it will always hit it's target as well as thor being able to recall it to him. marvel actually got that part fairly accurately compared to the mythos. odin's spear has a very similar enchantment. the dwarves who made the hammer actually thought it was a failure at first bc they ran out of materials to make the handle a proper length but thor really liked it and was able to use it anyway."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,but in marvel the implication was that cap was worthy ti weild it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,thanks foe replying! id rather have the people who are bothered by it comment and engage rather than leave me wondering what i did wrong. kratos is greek so i dont mind them mixing pantheons. but if shes not norse id like the game to explain why.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i mean, from what i know they take a lot of liberties in these games. isn't atreus supposed to be loki? never heard anyone complaining about that but in the little time since this was revealed i've read many people complain about how innacurate she is. makes you wonder what some of these people think realism means."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,well shes certainly from the norse mythology isnt she? shes wearing norse clothing. so at the very least shes a part of an interconnected culture.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,they already do that every day. wasn't there a white horus and ra in god's of egypt.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,yeah. who cares? it's not like one or two characters with a different skin tone would make the whole plot collapse...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"the time line in gow is a little fucked up. for example jormungandr has been around for a long time. mimir talks about fenrir and we see things showing skol and hati already chasing the sun and moon, that indicates fenrir was bound a long time prior. it could be time travel, or maybe the gow universe is cyclical in nature. like when the end times come it just resets. or santa monica could just be playing loose with the mythology and try to come up with a new interesting spin on it."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,conversation lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i'm quite certain the series do not follow the concept of the time in which each pantheon was worshipped in the real world. if i remember correctly, each pantheon rules a different land at the same time, so the egyptian gods most likely are alive and well during gow ragnarok, but merely in egypt. also, i think it is mentioned in the book or comic that it has been just 50 years between gow 3 and gow 2018, which goes hand in hand with cory statement right before the launch of gow 2018 that the game happens before the time in which the vikings were around."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,so we have an even better excuse to have a midage kratos in egypt?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"if you think kratos in 2018 gow just started murdering, you didn't follow the story x200b he only started because he was forced to start doing it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"its ok for one story but not another? dont get me wrong, i love red dead, but how can that be a stronger emotional impact than literally getting revenge for the death of kratos? i can only imagine how crazy it would be if atreus was able to use the blades of chaos once kratos died, and in a duel of rage he just goes to town essentially bringing the end to this chapter of the game. kratos has had his story. im sorry you dont understand the payout of seeing a story come to an end. weve had 4 main series games, going into a 5th, with kratos at the helm. he has been around for ps2,3,4 and now ps5 eras. kratos trained the shit out of atreus in god of war, trying to make him a better man than kratos ever was. i wouldnt say you need to currently have an emotional attachment to this character, but hopefully by the end of this game you realize how important this is to kratos and his story. hes not some angry guy searching for vengeance anymore. that died with him in gow3."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"lol how is your one good example rdr? that was so limply handled and honestly made no sense. it exists solely so you can continue to enjoy the open world and awkwardly wrap up any sidequests. and in this case, we would jump to atreus who we have had for 23 games already. jack had like 3 cutscenes before taking over."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,if kratos passing kills all your emotional investment into the character then you weren't really invested in them or that is a you problem. having him live forever cheapens and limits his character and story and also makes any threats to him seem silly.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,we shall see what happens. but given the studio i'd be surprised if they never changed something up.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,thats a great way of putting it haha. he fucked with them in a way that no one else could.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"it's heavily implied he's the game's version as his mother is named laufey fey, as kratos calls her and the tapestry called kratos farbauti loki's father in mythology."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"it seems like he is loki as there wasn't any reference to another loki in the game. obviously, he's not the loki from norse mythology though because it doesn't seem like he is thors brother etc."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i mean, you still can if you want, but i finished the game not too long ago and can confirm that that is indeed what mimir said. specifically, because freya was one of the vanir and odin couldn't have anyone thinking the vanir were anything more than dirty scrubs to be slaughtered, whenever freya did something awesome, he attributed it to frigg, which was explained as his pet name for her."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i'm pretty sure mimir did actually say that ! i know i've heard it when i was boat riding looking for treasures
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"an important thing on norse myth often overlooked is that much of it wasnt all at the same time. some gods and stories appeared and then disappeared from common myth years and years before one god showed up. if i recall freya and frigg may have been separate entities, but over time they merged in the myth."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"oh, yeah, i see your point. i dont feel the same way towards atreus, mainly because i usually don't feel like i'm the character in a game unless it's 1st person. to me, atleast when i'm playing, the main character is different from me, as in i don't believe that i am kratos, mainly assisting him get to his goal. i think what would be different in gow5 from tlou2 is that kratos's death wouldn't be for shock value or an interesting twist or to pass the torch or even to make gameplay different kratos's actual death would serve as a pivotal part in the story showing how atreus's growth that being kratos's training has well... grown. like i said earlier, atreus is strong because kratos was strong not because the studio wants it and as you play as atreus you will have the pleasure to know that probably one of the greatest god of war there was."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,he will!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"my bad, makes sense then"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"if i remember right, his belt and his gauntlets both double his strength, and he's already one of the strongest among the aesir. mjollnir is kind of a failure since the handle got screwed up, which is part of why thor is the only one that can use it properly. it's awkward as hell since the handle is too short for something meant to be balanced on a two handed hammer. you're also 100 right on the hammers enchantments, but there is also one that is often forgotten he can shrink it to fit on a necklace, so it's really portable. the dude loves that hammer. after ragnorok, thor dies and the hammer is taken up by both magni and modi because they aren't as strong as thor, so they have tovwork together to use it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"the gloves being back mjolnir, not mjolnir itself."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i reckon she is norse and will be portrayed as norse going off the clothing. i believe the reason why people are not engaging with you is that the previous game took many liberties with the mythology, for example elves were portrayed as humanoid insects when in the mythology they can be described as winged but not as literal bug people, and loki is the god of mischief who fathers hel, fenrir and jormungandr, yet in the fourth game he is a good natured child unrelated to the characters i've just mentioned. it's highly doubtful you and others who are upset by the skin colour of angrboda were critical of those decisions, therefore it's quite clear that you're quite happy for them to take liberties with the appearances of the characters and their stories, as long as they are not ethnically black. this leads us who are against racism to assume that you are at the very least prejudiced in some form against ethnically black human beings, and that's a you problem. you may wish to protest that you only want the game to stick within the boundaries of the mythology when it comes to human skin colour but many people are indifferent to what skin colour angrboda has, so again it leads back around to only you and others who are prejudiced against your fellow human beings. kratos for example is not voiced by a white greek man, but a black american man, and kratos the video game character does not speak greek but english, yet where is your displeasure at that inaccruacy? it all circles back to you disliking one visible ethnically black person."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i think the dispute there is younger versus from a racial demographic that wouldn't step foot in northern europe for several centuries for the sake of modern concepts of inclusion. does it fundamentally change the video game which is, of course, a work of artistic fiction we're talking about? nah. it's just a silly, pandering move that is disjunctive with the historically based narrative. i'd love to hear from an african american that said...yes, including a young aa teenager in a game about greeknorse mythology is going to positively influence my purchasing decision with regards to this game. sincerely. if you're reading this and this casting choice makes it more likely you'll buy this game, i'm dying to hear from you."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,some people also bothered by thor. since it's a work of fiction they can make whatever they want but it doesn't mean consumers shouldn't have a say about that. it is nothing but simple deisgn criticism imo.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"because john marston was only one game for anyone who didn't play red dead revolver anyway, which i didn't so the emotional investment in the character wasn't something that was carried on over multiple yearsmultiple games. kratos, however, we've basically been with for what, almost 20 years? through multiple games? he has a much stronger emotional investment to me than john does. started out as essentially an arcadey gorey beatemup into one of the most emotionally impactful stories i've played in years. atreus can never fill krato's shoes, and as far as i'm concerned kratos is god of war. without him, you don't have a god of war series anymore. and i'd rather not end with him fucking dying after everything he's gone through, just to have his unlikable son take over to repeat the process. i'd like him to finish his fight, and them end the series with him triumphant. but they won't. they'll just kill him off and drag the name along for more sequels of lesser characters... because nothing can ever just end these days. god i'm going to be so pissed if they do this shit..."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"what about my comment suggests i'm upset? it's white people myths. greeks and norse. no one is arguing greeks and scandanavian people weren't historically white, right? it just doesn't make any sense to include a dreadlocked black teenager to the cast at this point. any more than throwing john hamm into a movie about anansi or kali. that said, i agree completely that representation is different than pandering. is the suggestion that the devs finally got the message after eight gow games without any racially diverse characters and absolutely no publicized comments or complaints about it? or is it a marketing reaction based on the current sociopolitical climate? as i've argued elsewhere...i don't have too much of a problem with the decision to include a black character...i have a problem with the motivation behind the decision. i guess if i were african american, and female, and a teenager...i'd still wonder why the hell i'm being represented in a hyperviolent video game story about a bunch of white people."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,yes. here i am. crying. deeply insightful.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-14,your satisfaction is secondary here. im happy not to give it to you.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"except, as i already said the story is barely historically based. firstly its inspired in mythology, not history, mythology is already a fictional medium, the norse from back in the day most likely didn't think angrboda was black, but thing is angrboda didn't exist, there is no correct way to represent her either because descriptions are very vague from what i've seen and they vary quite a lot. i'm not saying every videogame should have black characters and women and disabled people but i believe its nice when they do. and there's absolutely no reason a fictional game about the fictional stories ancient norse people told each other to not have a black character. and it's not as if the games were thaaat faithful to the actual mythology. atreus acts as loki with all the changes to the story that causes, because the difference is not only race, last i checked loki was not raised by kratos. kratos didn't kill the whole greek pantheon either. actually, making angrboda black probably changes the story way less than making her a preteen. i mean, hela already exists in the first game and she's supposed to be the daughter of loki and angrboda. idk mate i just find it hella sus when realism and fidelity only matters when it comes to race, sex and sexual orientation."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"disjunctive with the historically based narrative. yeah, all that history, like a fake greek god fucking a giant and having their kid be loki? it's not like they're sticking to the mythos very closely. criticize accuracy as much as you want, but you're a hypocrite if you also don't criticize the other, much more blatant inaccuracies as well."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"idk mate, i can't think of a time when criticising the design of a game that doesn't even have a release date has been productive whatsoever. i understand people being surprised by the designs of thor and angrboda because most people did not expect a fat thor or a black character. thor critics get shut down fast because there's always someone to explain how thor acted in the mythology and how that looks more like a strongman than mcu thor. but the only criticism against black angrboda has been that it's not historically accurate. and saying that about a completely fictional game about a greek demigod killing norse gods sounds pretty dumb. like you're not being historically accurate on your mashup of two historical fiction lores"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"no, because its artist interpretation. if i felt compelled to be upset or butch about ill just make my own. but the thing with this is when you hear african most automatically think darker skin, but the greeks had a foothold in africa so its possible the god could be fairer complexion"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"in india, the buddha is consider one of vishnus avatars."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,what do you think greek people look like exactly?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,id say most of the cast from the original games had greek motifs. although the design to evoke the cultural aesthetic has definitely improved with time. i mean the norse costume design is fantastic.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i thought i remembered mimir saying that, but i couldn't remember if it was actually him or some fan theory i read on reddit. for skol and hati i think the only other thing that validates the idea that fenrir was bound a while ago, is that mimir mentions the unbreakable chains and says that they're a legend. however, if we look at tyr in the trailer we can see that he has both hands... meaning fenrir hasn't been chained yet since that's when fenrir bites of tyrs hand. damn time travel."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"well in the myths he ended tied up in a rock with a drop of poison burning his body from time to time... but then he breaks free and dies in ragnarok in a fight with heimdall, so i don't personally think that atreus is a reincarnation of loki"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i get a feeling that angrboda being black will actually be a plot point. i'm thinking she has some relation to tyr and his travels. maybe she's originally from some other mythology like kratos and like atreus has a name from that mythology and from norse mythology.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"so i am greek, kratos is whitewashing greek mythology, you sir can fuck off instead."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-14,"yeah man thats the only reason people like black representation in stories. anyway, its me. im forcing diversity."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"yeah honestly modern day people place way too much emphasis on a ripped bod. the stories of old usually just mentioned strength of the heroes, they never went into specifics of how toned their bodies looked. i myself have seen several freakishly strong people with a a decent amount of body fat. so i am looking forward to seeing kratos and boy getting their asses kicked a little bit by thor in the next one. bosses should always be difficult."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"can kratos really have a triumphant ending? the series started by his family being killed, by him. hes gotta have a tragic ending. but, honestly, kratos will probably be resurrected by atreus at the end of ragnorak or maybe in the next chapter, wherever that may be. theres other things they can do with kratos, the years between the 2 series for example."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"yeah, fucking a giant and their kid...it's like they stick to the mythos very closely. criticize accuracy as much as you want. see how silly and fruitless a discussion becomes when you select parts of a comment without context to respond to?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i never really bought into the criticism of if you cant make it yourself dont critique. people dont need to be game developers to have opinions. dissent is allowed. personally, i would not be thrilled if they did an yoruba pantheon for example and made some of their gods white."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"that could very well be it. but my broader point still stands that, unless her skin colour is really relevant to the story, we shouldn't even give a shit about how she looks"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-14,"you mean an underrepresented depiction of deities black and african to be made white? shit, maybe like gods of egypt, that shitty movie? yeah, thats the same as making a frost giant in a game that takes liberties artistically a black teen. stop. just stop. its nice to have a character like this. it reflects the society that made the game. democratic, pluralistic. if you want a white power fantasy, fuck off."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"well, im scandinavian and since this game is based on our ancestors gods, maybe they could check ours view on it as well."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i understand your view but i still think that, as much as i despise the corporate progressivism for marketing, it's good to have representation. not to mention we don't know where the idea comes from, maybe it was the devs who have changed their own minds after ten snowwhite games. maybe, as someone pointed out, this character being black ties into the story, or maybe they decided to make her black because her skin colour is irrelevant to the story and they wanted to not be snowwhite anymore. but i still stand by my point, regardless of the reasons i don't see anything wrong with the character being black."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"except you butchered what i said and i took a direct quote from you? do you not understand how quoting works? you're saying the criticism is it's not historically accurate, and i'm saying that's a stupid criticism because the entire damn thing isn't even true to the fake thing it's based on. there's multiple layers of inaccuracies all stacked upon themselves but you're drawing the line at a black girl? really?"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,alerting people of the presence of a product isn't the only reason to advertise. everyone knows what mcdonalds is but they still put millions and millions into advertising every year

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"it took them 2 and a half days to paint it. why would a driver give a shit he drives a different vehicle for 3 days? he could drive a different one everyday, he won't care as long as they're the same model."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"probably stenciled the logo, the other elements of the design are definitely spray painted"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"graffiti, i really don't understand why are there so many armchair expert redditors in this thread."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,i hope they got paid really well for it. even if they enjoyed every second of it.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,do you know if this was commissioned by playstationsanta monica studios or if the artists just decided a gow tram would be neat?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,that's actually awesome knowing that it's authentic and someone got paid to work on it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,none of what you said proves its hand painted lol. thats all cute but doesnt support that

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"well yeah, i mean, theres no reason to think about this any differently than any other art project."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,might as well change my comment since it has no use now...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,is most graffiti painted by computer?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"or foot, your choice."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,no. it's gotta be done by foot.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"hand painted means done by hand, not a machine."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,so then it's hand painted.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,it was done by a graffiti group.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,i'm surprised they do it this way instead of just printing it out on a decal and placing it on the side of the train like the rest of the world does for ads like that. the turnaround on swapping this ad out for another or even just removing this ad must be super long
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,as a person living in bucharest i can say that most big tram lines have at least a couple trams pained

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"lol, we have 30yearold trams that are never painted, nobody cleans or covers paint, my man"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,why would they? those guys are payed to paint the trams. the trams in bucharest are not the newest or the prettiest so the city hall contracted artists to give them a fresh coat of painting.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,they'd have better food but make less money. also guessing thousands of people would be out of a job but i know that's not the point you're making

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,i think it's because in the past the subway trams in bucharest were constantly covered in graffiti by artists sneaking in the depot and going wild. it was always a sight when such a train would pull in the station in the morning

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"i haven't even finished god of war 2018 yet since i got sidetracked by other games and i preordered gowr because the first one's pc port was so damn good. respawn needs to take classes from sony santa monica, nixxes and jetpack interactive on how to optimize and engineer their games. eurogamer interviewed jetpack and a cool tidbit from one of the devs, who did the gowr pc port, was it's a lot easier making a great pc port when the baseline game is in great shape. also, like 15 people did this port. makes rockstar's delayed pc ports look even more pathetic. httpswww.eurogamer.netdigitalfoundry2024thebiggodofwarragnorakpctechinterview"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,most of sony's ports have been solid.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"uh, is it actually a good pc port though? steam says its mixed 67 for all time reviews was thinking of getting it on steam for steam deck so i can play portably, but then i saw the mixed and noped out"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,eh.. runs really well only if you have a top tier pc. it's poorly optimized otherwise.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-23,but not every game runs well on pc....and not all pcs can handle that kind of graphics....
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,can i get a tldr for your comment?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"if people didn't do this, reddit would hardly exist"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,people like to cry
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,released on the 19th via steam.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,it just recently released for pc.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,no he means staphylococcus aureus
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,don't worry mate. there's a wip emulator now. we might be able to play it by the end of this year. if sony won't give it to us we will take it instead.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,nah rgaming is roasting ea this week i think sony is back in rotation in two weeks.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,fr
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"yes, there's not much improvement in graphics. looks very similar to gow 2018"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,it looks the same
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,creating the account is free
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,the devs added a setting for it with the pc release.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"i think there is an option named puzzle hints, try to disablechange that one."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-24,no come on it also has a stupid and incoherent plot
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-24,ahhh that tps feeling in a melee game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"i can't speak for it as i only played for the first time this week, but can imagine it was very frustrating. most of the puzzles take a minute of exploration so yea, not sure what feedback they listened to for hints to be added in the first place. it should be auto toggled off, but one of the first things i saw in the pre game set up menu was that toggle. i know people rush into the game but it was staring everyone in the face"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"that's wird, because i can't even remember any of them spoiling any of the puzzles. to be fair, every single puzzle was super easy and i figured them out right away. i remember hfw being a lot more intrusive than ragnark"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,!freya is the worst because shes so bossy lol. atreus is like trying to help dad out and mimir is the smartes man ever and is helping his brother. but freya is a fucking karen being a pain in the dick!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,i don't get why they didn't do it the other way around tbh. let people solve the puzzles themselves and include an option that let's people that are just playing for the action basically skip them.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,worst part about the game imo. that never should have been included the game it could have been almost perfect otherwise.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,it's like they learned nothing from the complaints about skyward sword.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,as a dad with young children who loves video games and gets literally no time to myself it was my favorite part of the game. let me play and rush if i was short on time and if i had some i could change it up and exercise my brain
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,i didnt get gowr to think! i got it for touching father son moments and cleaving mfers in half with an axe
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,doubt it's 10 seconds cause i usually solve the puzzles faster then then the help comments can come in
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,its a modern game. if you use your brain at lest 10 you wont get stuck for sure
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"the naughty dog games did it really well, it was extremely clumsy in this one. they tell you what to do instantly. i felt like gow2018 was very immersive but this was the opposite of immersive."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,there was no option on launch not sure if it got patched in later for console and horizon had it patched in post launch too. definitely not standard
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-24,i dont mind it if its a story game with easy puzzles if it feels seamless. when it feels like a punch to the face or the gameplay is puzzles then its bad.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"yeah fair enough, i lasted about 2 or 3 hours and then i just sold my copy. i heard something about santa monica not being sure the game would be any good like 2 weeks before it dropped, i feel like its cos it wasn't good it was just pretty and riding on the coattails of the masterpiece of gow2018 how about the crawling sections every 2 min for the ps4 version to be able to keep up? this game made me irrationally angry it was so disappointing"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"reduced is off in my experience. i've not had a single one since turning it on, at most an occasional 'up there' which never makes any sense anyway. just finished alfheim where the puzzles were abundant and had no help"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,i had that option on the ps5 version like last year or whenever i played
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,removed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"if you say gullible really slowly, it sounds like elephant"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"we can have both, the ps5 games have been good on pc with a few misses here and there but generally they're very competent ports, some even have ray tracing elements implemented. we'll soon enter the 4th generation of graphics cards with dedicated ray tracing hardware, it has come a long way since the rtx 20 series came out 6 years ago, we have ai upscaling and frame generation for a while now. sony even added their own ai upscaling to the ps5 pro. ray traced global illumination is becoming more and more prevalent, avatar and star wars outlaws have it as default for example and metro exodus enhanced edition came out more than 3 years ago. while the more taxing ray traced options weren't really attainable before the 3090, that card came out 4 years ago. this current gen of console is starting to hold back more capable hardware and it sure doesn't help that they still develop games for the ps4 and that microsoft shoot themselves in the foot with the series s."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,it can be a double edged sword. games like uncharted 4 and god of war 2018 don't look that great on pc to me and have noticeably lower quality textures due to originally being a ps4 only game and just having upscaled assets. but developing both versions in unison seems to be a good way of having lower quality settings that actually do what they say. usually when you play a game at low settings it's more like high and has a 10 difference in terms of performance vs ultra.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,you need a psn account. i think that's where the majority of the negativity is coming from.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"i get 40fps1280p, mediumlow settings on my legion go. don't know if you could call that poorly optimised. a ps5 game running on a handheld apu  30w is insane imo."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,tldr im an angry person and need people to know that im angry
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,thank you
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,not on steam?

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"yet it barely runs on my 3080 laptop,while 2018 runs very well actually"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"that doesn't matter in the slightest and is in fact part of the problem. when the product is free you're the product. account linking means sharing of personal information across platforms and data compromising. it's more about the principle. i'm not going to budge on it. psn can get removed and then i'll buy, but i won't spend a cent for a product with strings attached. account requirements have no place in a single player game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,oh thank god
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,it's extra odd because uncharted figured this out on the ps3. after a couple minutes a press r3 for hint would pop up. then you could decide if you wanted a hint or not.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,it was really annoying. i'd reach a puzzle section. start having a gander around while thinking in my head and then atreus shouts the answer as i'm about to have my ahaa! moment it happened very frequently
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,hopefully its patched in ive been sitting in my ps5 version
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"oh damn, it might be bugged for me as i didn't really notice a difference when toggling it to reduced!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"i just found a thread saying this feature will come to the ps5 version in a update soon, maybe it was something else"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,the atreus parts are a slog on replays. never wanna see ironwood again
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,i've never heard this saying before but i love it lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"sorry, you cant have highly optimized and chase an ever changing best graphics finish line. you can choose to keep complaining about it, as you did."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"just look at gtav, it looks like it still has some of those ps3 assets in game. its weird to have it on ps5 supporting some form of raytracing and then being able to pixel count the resolution of some textures."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"oh okay, then maybe i will get it then. i already have it on ps4 and ps5, so ive already got a psn account, but ive just not been able to buckle down and finish it. i keep getting to that first realm in that dwarf city, but then life takes over. the portability of steam deck would really help me buckle down and finish but its full price right now, so im fine waiting longer until a sale pops up"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,it's on steam.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,i mean its all ps4last gen graphics. its not bad but its nothing newamazing.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"i'm so glad i don't have principles, this game is so much fun!!!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"you know reddit is collecting your data too, right? if i had to guess, i would say reddit collects way, way, way more than sony."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"or you can just lie on the account creation, but you enjoy that imaginary high horse"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"i like that idea . sidenote i've really been enjoying the dialogues when you do something, odd? e.g. going back to the yggdrasil jump and artreus says something won't spoil, also throwing your axe at the 'creatures' from the 'treehouse' triggers one. i've come across a few and each time i find myself responding irl"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,well i guess they thought people that play god of war were mainly playing it for the action and would get annoyed by puzzles. uncharted is an action adventure so puzzles are common in this kind of game and why people play it between all the other reasons.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,maybe each studio not talking to each other
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-24,"i think a tomb raider game also did that, but for some reason they figured pressing a button is too difficult for people"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"hmm yea that is interesting, sorry i can't help much more than that really. maybe verify the files and see if that makes a difference? hope you get it sorted"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"i'm redownloading ragnarok to double check, but i'm like 90 sure. edit apparently 10 idiot is enough"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-23,"i hated the atreus parts the first time through they're a big reason i'm hesitant to play through again, unless i find a mod that let's you skip them entirely"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"im sure there are a lot of ps3 era assets in the game across the board. when they ported to the ps4 era they didnt upgrade every single thing, some old assets snuck through. at the end of the day its still a ps3360 era game with some new paint on top"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"you can't play it offline on steamdeck if you sign into psn, at least, at the moment anyway. maybe that's a bug idk, and maybe it's fixed by the time i'm writing this, someone can test it. i got deluxe on cd keys for 45  depends how you feel about grey area sites."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"oh, it's published by sony, isn't it? my region doesn't have psn, so is not on steam for me. gg."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,no. it's a modern game on pc and you can run it in actual 4k. looks awful on the ps4 in comparison.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"from what i can see there are already options to reduce hints, but new update is to turn it off completely"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"been awhile, but the pc and ps4 era versions did see increased fidelity. im sure you can find endless comparison videos on youtube. hell, just the resolution jump itself was huge."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"i see no need at all to be connected to psn, such a stupid decision that prevents many from enjoying this fabulous game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,its not a modern pc game graphically. it was built for the ps4 and ported over to pc. it clearly shows. i play it dlaa 4k on a 4090 and ive played every cutting edge graphics games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,dude i was so wrong. i apologize to you.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,yeah a lot of it was but my point is theres still some thing you can find that went unchanged as well
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,cool story. it still looks fantastic.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"it's okay lol, i'll be keeping a eye on for the update, i want to replay the game after seeing people playing it on pc"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,agreed. people arguing the latter just seem ignorant to how game development works
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,it looks like a ps4 game at 4k dude
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,don't have the ps5 version but you might have stumbled over a similar worded setting which allows to extend the time to solve some puzzles. like when you have to hit two points consecutively within 5 seconds it will grant you 10 seconds instead. i know i did. got ragnarok on pc launch day and having heard about the annoying hints and the newly introduced option to reduce these hints i immediately went to the settings. stumbled over the timing setting and thought that can't be it.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,ya none of this is skyrim and even if it was you would still be wrong about mods and how awesome they are

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"i enjoyed the combat for the most part in ragnarok, its got quirks, and theres an ebb and flow to it. desperately needs a more fleshed out poise mechanic. getting stunlocked made me want to rip my hair out. returning to er made it extremely clear at how much better it could have been."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,was gonna say the combat is great when you get comfortable with it and find that rhythm. bought when i fought modi  magni is when it clicked for me and the experience went exponentially better.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,you've got to be the only person on the planet who thinks this. the combat is fantastic
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,what is your point? nothing in this picture is skyrim.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,yes god of war is on pc as is elden ring. sony started releasing their exclusives on pc and generally they are the best version of the game. they even purchased a studio that specializes in it. nixxes
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"someone modded an elden ring weapon into gowr. the lion fists edit its actually the other way around, kratos is in elden ring"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,i mean i appreciate it well enough. never seen his weapons modded in.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"you realize you're arguing for my point, right? there's a hundred ways to do it....but taking a picture of your monitor from your phone is horrific and has the same energy as a boomer not knowing how to email. i only mentioned lightshot because it's my favorite screenshot software."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"that would be in gow 2018, which i think actually had better combat than ragnarok."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"nah, is not. is a massive downgrade from the og trilogy in that department."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"no he's not. playing as artreus is painfully boring. the pacing on this game was seriously bad. i couldn't put the last one down and i truly do not care if i ever play ragnarok again, having stopped around halfway. edit if you enjoyed the tedious, awful agraboda section you are a masochist, a liar, or can't accept you wasted 70."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,is there even need to explain?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,"might be, yet i still find it disgusting to see such a great game end up like this. go mod sekiro, great game but still lacking some stuff."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"the game is too good to end up being modded. i would understand doing it to minor games, but not to this kind of games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,"oh definitely not, mods are awesome...with different games. mods should go into games that aren't that good like sekiro for example, great game but there is a lot which could have been done. or like minecraft which has lot of potential which kinda gets shown by mods. i could tollerate like graphic mods even in elden ring but this is just too much."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,never played elden ring but thanks bc u almost had me tripping
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"no shit , i know"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,yeah you're right idk why you're getting so many downvotes
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,all that effort for a screenshot
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,weird comment. looking good for its time implies it doesnt look good now.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,wanna provide an example?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"its definitely amazing, it always surprises me how much talent the community has."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"i was agreeing with you and adding to it, not arguing against."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,to each their own i guess
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,if you want people to understand things that don't make sense
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"yes, please explain your absolutely wrong opinion"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,i dont understand what is wrong with a game being modded? a game has to be bad or mediocre to warrant mods?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,you're good haven't played it either but that big glowy tree in the background is in tons of screencaps.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"thanks, that was a nice thing to say."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"he was stating something obvious and being a picture of skyrim makes literally zero sense, there's no elden ring map mod on skyrim and the graphics look like elden ring anyways, even with mods skyrim doesn't look as good as elden ring or god of war."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"i didn't make fun of colored people, so the joke didn't stick."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,all the effort for a mod then all the comments shit on it for a bad screenshot why not just do it right?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"cant remember the name, but that underground cave with the glowing mushrooms is pretty fuckin dank"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,but what is there to explain? skyrim and fallout being on pc and having mods completely killed them as games s
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"it is a shame that such a great game like elden ring ends up getting modded. i would understand for a game like fifa or any basketball game or similar also non sport game, but for elden ring?? nhaa"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,"more or less. when it comes to moddig already great games, i honestly don't see the point. like sekiro could be modded without any complaints, it is a good game but still isn't as great as this one."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,dude said elden ring or skyrim. and i didn't notice it was elden ring at first so there you go obviously it's not so obvious for some people.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,skyrim with mods looks wayyy better than elden ring.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,fuckin what?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,do it right he says!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,blackreach?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,its cool but doesnt look as good as this area
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,yeah that place is pretty cool.. haha okay maybe there are a few examples
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"ahhh so that is what he meant. i guess that makes sense. being able to modify your single player game in the way you want, in the privacy of your own home, is detrimental to the entire franchise of course. i apologise for not getting that sooner"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"wow. maybe you should try having fun sometime, you might be less of an asshole. who gives a fuck what people mod into their own game? i personally love the mods that change some move sets. i like to beat the vanilla game first then see what crazy shit some random modders come up with. some people are very creative with what little they have to work with."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,what the hell are you on about? skyrim is mid? minecraft and terraria are mid?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"no, it obviously isn't skyrim, the exact game isn't 100 noticeable but it's very clear that it isn't skyrim."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,funny joke.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"ya know, people like it when someone makes fun of some charcoal orangutans from time to time, and since i went with the pc route people didn't like it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,bingo!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,if were considering how old skyrim is tho.. it holds up pretty well
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"apart from that, you should count in the age difference. skyrim is close to 10 years older than elden ring, yet it can keep up and at some points even outmatch elden ring."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"elden ring isn't single player and that isn't entirely what i ment. what i really wanted to say is that it is a shame that a great game like that gets modified like this, thus certain games should never make it to pc to avoid this kind of situations. ofc that's just my opinion."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,"and i am not saying they shouldn't do it, just do it with different games. what necessity is there to mod such a great game? like what is it, are you not satisfied with what the game is? why do you feel the urge of changing this masterpiece. i would accept graphic mods but don't change the gaming experience too much...it is such a waste on an already great game. try mod sekiro, great game but could be even better with mods."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-18,"skyrim is an old game just as minectraft and terraria never playied terraria. plus they all have so much potential which isn't well used by the producers. but i want to remark that i never said that skyrim nor minecraft are mid, i simply said that skyrim can be modded for the same reasons i have mentioned in this comment."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,thank god if you read his comment he says elden ring or skyrim.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,only someone who has never properly modded skyrim can say that elden ring looks better than a modded skyrim. or maybe you've not played games that actually look great to see that elden ring has mediocre graphics when compared to other aaa games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,charcoals orangutans????? ha
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,some people become messed up from the internet but others like you are messed up long before using it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,that's what people don't really consider
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,it can certainly outmatch elden ring in how many times they use the same va lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,it definitely hasnt outmatched er in any regard
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"actually, if i'm not mistaken, it becomes a single player game once you start to mod. as from is very strict against alterations. so it is a single player game at this point. and you still haven't explained your like this. what the hell's the problem?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,it is a single player game with optional multiplayer functionality. people should be free to mod singleplayer aspects as long as they don't force those changes unwillingly upon others through multiplayer.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,what a stupid fucking opinion
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,"ok, i get it now. you really are just an asshole who thinks he knows better than everyone else. for the good of all mankind, please don't procreate."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"yes, but the map of elden ring is very unique and it's very clear it isn't skyrim, his comment wasn't exactly needed, and he wouldn't have gotten downvoted if he hadn't said something both stupid and quite obvious."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"i've played spiderman 2018, god of war 2018, spiderman miles morales, and god of war ragnark, and more but those are just the ones i'm listing, all of those games look better than elden ring yet skyrim doesn't come close, i've seen it with mods."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"or mud donkeys or whatever else the left calls black folk, politics is also fun to bring up."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"probably, still on here interacting with normal people on the regular, and guess what? they don't even fucken know just how radical my political agenda is becoming."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,"i would tolerate like graphic mods or similar stuff but adding moves, weapons and anything that essentially changes the game is just too much. and also, considering that the company itself won't allow you to play the full experience with mods doesn't change the fact that the game remains a multiplayer game even if you can't acces the feature says it all. games that were supposed to be modded had an ingame feature which allowed you to do so, i am thinking of skyrim and fallout 4 on console you have a mod menu right from the start, idk about pc or like minecraft. elden ring is just too good to end up being modded, go mod sekiro, great game but lacking some stuff."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,there is nothing wrong with modding this game but the thing is that i consider it too good to be modded. i would accept graphic mods or similar but mods that change the gaming experience too much are just ruining the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,as you wish buddy.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,so your saying that there is a point in moddig that game? i would kinda tollerate adding new moves or animations...but kratos????? what on earth?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,its obviously elden ring or mario kart
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"i can't help but notice that all the games you mentioned arewere ps exclusives. and you are saying i've seen it with mods, so i can safely assume that you are not a pc gamer, and haven't played extensively modded skyrim yourself. which would make the assumption in my previous comment accurate."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"by radical, you clearly mean it in a surfer bro context. like a totally radical political agenda that's far out dude!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,"actually, it is a single player game then still. it just has a few multiplayer features, which are promptly turned off. you still play by yourself 99 of the time. ever played an actual multiplayer game? you should be able to tell the difference.. bethesda games don't have a mod menu.... have you ever actually modded anything? it's a debug menu, modding is something different entirely. try understanding modding first before judging it and again, that's still their own damn decision. if you can't grasp the simple fact that people's mods are their own damn business then i don't know what else to tell you. sorry that you dislike it, but your dislikes are your problem. using that as a reason to ban a game from an entire platform is just petty, and the kind of behaviour only toddlers are expected to deal with"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"no, those ps exclusives are just the best looking games i can come up with, i play pc too, and have played spiderman and god of war on pc actually, you can't just assume that because the games were ps exclusive and actually not even exclusive because they're on pc too, your comment was not accurate."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"nah, extremist middle all the way bro"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,fallout 4 and skyrim do have a mods menu in the main menu...go look for it. moddig great games like elden ring has just no meaning. i would understand kinda additional moves or additional features...but this kind of nodding is just too much. it would be like buying a ferrari to then have lamborghini stickers on it...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"god of war ragnarok is ps exclusive. and the rest were ps exclusives initially. you have never said that you have played properly modded skyrim on pc. in which case you don't have enough information to base an opinion, making our discussion pointless. have a nice day. bye."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"noice broh! i ripped through the extremest wave today bro. i shot down the middle of a friggin' gnarly tube dude . i rode that wave all the way to shore. i totally like, vibe with your vibes bro. for sure"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,"no, that is the creation club. it is not your standard mod menu, it is an attempt by bethesda at monotizing mods. mods are an effort by a large useroriginated effort. not something done by the original devs. if you want to see what an actual mod platform looks like, visit nexusmods. and again, you don't decide shit on what is too much. it's really fucking amazing that you think elden ring is perfect the way it is, truly. but there are people that want something to add to it, which is when mods come into play. how completely and utterly selfish do you have to be to declare that your opinion is the rule? to declare that elden ring is not to be modded? if you can't grasp utterly simple fact of life by your next comment, then i have nothing more to say. have fun living in your fantasy world mussolini"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"brou, that's totally fire. haven't surfed since my bitch ex gave me aids"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,"man jeez luise creation club is a thing separate, there are mods created by people. have you ever played skyrim or fallout 4 on console??? there is an actual mod menu in the main menu. you know, technically you are ruling over me since you are imposing that only because you can mod something it means that you should. can and should are totally different btw. i am not saying that elden ring is perfect but from a small mod to graphics and animations to adding a totally not related character to the game there is big difference. too much is just too much and that it too much. i am not saying that my opinion is the rule, actually quite the opposite. i am just trying to share to some people that what has been done in this post is an example of how people will never be satisfied with anything. this game is one of the best ever made and even just the thought of moddig it is extreme, imagine how much more out of the ordinary is to actually do it. in addition to that, you were victimising the poor modders who spend time and energy to create mods. they are true artists and i am amazed with what they do and sometimes wonder why companies don't hire them all...but i hope that you do realise that the same thing can be said about the original programmers which spent much more time and much more energy to bring to you a game that not only you are enjoying and have enjoyed but you also dare to suggest because if you mod it and add stuff which isn't there in the first place it means that it isn't enough that the game they have worked on isn't nearly enough to what you would like to have. this is an exaggeration ofc, just like yours."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,you actively suggested that elden ring should never have been ported to pc because it is being modded upon. how is that not forcing it?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-18,"it isn't forcing because i didn't come to your house to make sure that you will never be able to download the game on pc. i am just sharing an opinion which i think should be in more people's minds but i am not in the need of you thinking the same thing. i am explaining to you my reasoning and my claims, nothing more."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-19,"so what that you don't do it in practice? your opinion is entirely based on not being able to let others have their fun. that is garbage no matter how you look at it. and the fact that you think others should think the same way is just revolting. i'm done talking to you, quite frankly. maybe your parents can still salvage some of it. have a good day. i'll have one too, as it's my damn choice"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-19,"again i am not forcing my opinion on anyone, otherwise it would be much more effective. i am simply sharing an opinion dude, why do you keep saying i am imposing it on ppl?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,"awesome. the previous pc port for god of war was great, and i've heard ragnorak has been a great sequel."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,oh hell yes! i've been waiting for this ever since god of war 2018 made it to pc. that game is a beautiful experience and send me scrambling to play the rest of the series. hopefully this pc port will be just as a cleanly executed as the previous one.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,"the comment section on the playstation blog website is just full of people malding over more people getting to play the game. kinda sad to see people supporting exclusives, because i think the more people that get to play a game, the better. but people seem to think that they can't enjoy a game unless the other team isn't able to play it."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"lol it's not coming to pc, pc games when they release are not region locked, this one is. it's only coming for the select few privileged countries, make that clear. the game is going to be locked behind psn accounts again and only launch in supported countries like tsushima did because we're not all priviliged american. the americanos stopped giving a shit about us when they got their helldivers demands met, helldivers got removed from our steam stores and now the 170 countries they pretended to care about are nowhere to be mentioned anymore on their never ending culture war videos."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,totally awesome sequel.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"honestly controversial but not so much no. having played both 4  5, both are kinda pale imitations of what god of war used to be. the greek era games were a lot better. ragnarok kind of wrote kratos into an endpoint you can't narratively recover from, and more or less ruined what the character once was. that and the changes from 4 that didn't appeal made me give ragnarok a 610 and 4 a 710, as compared to the masterpieces of the greek era which i universally give 1010 and 1110 scores, especially god of war 2 and 1."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"good mechanics, awful main characters with ultra cringe lines like bow before the queen!!! and super stupid main plotline."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,mind the psn account that is required to play.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i game on ps5 basically exclusively i have a steam deck but mostly play emulators on it seeing other ps players upset over shit like this is so fucking cringe and weird. why would more people enjoying something you like make you upset, it makes no sense. if anything the more the merrier, if the game does well and you like it supporting the devs is the right and best thing to do. it at the least would raise the chances of a sequel or expansion, this situation is a win win for everyone involved"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"sony simps are actually insane. as someone who already owns the game on ps5, i'm underwhelmed that this is the only announcement, but of course i'd be excited about being able to play the game in more places."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,makes them feel superior. as if ports can't take advantage of superior hardware. invariably it is always the other system that is inferior.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"wtf? i've been a playstation guy for 25 years and nothing makes me happier than seeing my favorite gaming franchises get more recognition. i wish xbox users could play helldivers 2, it would make the game better. what a weird cultesque mentality to have over a gaming console."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it's all about the power. people want to do everything to feel it. one way to achieve this is to believe you belong to exclusive group, silently thinking this group is superior. simple psychology. surprising thing is, people don't grow out of it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,can't understand those people. i got my ps5 because of ragnarok and i'm happy my friends who don't own one will e able to play it on pc.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,kids being kids. this stuff is life or death stuff if your balls haven't dropped.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"doesn't matter, those people won't affect the company's decisions, what speaks to companies the most is money, not a bunch of immature fans who might be loud enough so you will recognize them but are still insignificant compared to the majority of their audience that supports pc ports or doesn't care if the game will come out to pc."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"one argument is that these games were original and good because they were exclusive and financially supported by sony. so if games are going to lose exclusivity, sony may not invest so much, because they will no longer be system sellers. therefore the quality could decline."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the people wanting it to be exclusive and the people screaming about making a psn accountlink should all be forced to live with each other in some shitty gamer camp.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,unfortunate and quite sucky. the game doesn't have an online component to it. all this does is restrict who can play the game. because psn is only available in like 60 something countries.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"serious concern so does that mean it will be subject to region blocks, like tsushima?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,fuck sony! fix this shit!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,gah!!! bunch of bitter little bitches in there because more people get to play the game. i dont understand those people at all.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yup. i won't be buying. there is no reason for singleplayer games requiring yet another account and internet connection to play. i don't have a psn account. i will not make one.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,and thus here comes the wave of gamers likely unaffected but still angry they have to make a free psn account. it is a bit odd to require it on a sololy single player game however.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,hopefully modders will fix that bs like with simcity.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"this new drama is such a nondrama, it really is a slow news time... guess what people i had to log into my ubisoft account to try xdefiant. i didn't write an article about it."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yes. i actually quit the game in the middle of the first area, because i had heeed and boy just yelling out, have you tried this rope?!, what about this platform over here?? looks suspicious!! you don't even get a chance to look over the whole thing before they start yelling out the solutions. i have no idea what the hell they were thinking, why not just put in a qte, push x to solve puzzle?"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,turn the difficulty up so the combat becomes a challenge. once you have to master the mechanics to make it through fights i think it becomes a lot more fun. just my two cents.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,what parts are you talking about exactly?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,if you hate america so much you're on the wrong website.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"some people do not want to deal with the time and cost of building a pcpc ecosystem or buying an expensive prebuilt or dealing with driver issues, faulty components, or growing number of launchers and accounts for games. they just want a simple, reasonablypriced plug and play machine."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you need to spend about 300 usd more for a custom pc that can match a ps5's performance. that's not an insignificant amount of money for many people, and if someone is going to be playing mostly singleplayer games, pc isn't going to be worth the extra cost. playstation will be fine, you're overreacting."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,people shouldn't preorder games honestly. it just reinforces the we'll fix it later mentality that's seemed to infect a lot of companies. look at the awful tlou release where the game was an unpotimized waste until the performance issues were fixed.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i preferred 2018 to ragnarok. but i think valhalla is my favourite of it all.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,oh dear you seem to be injured in the head
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"this is shit redditors get mad about it doesnt actually affect sales or public opinion. same with drm. im not with it, but it doesnt matter"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-02,oh noes!!! not a psn account!!!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"cool, and?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"and ragnarok is still a great game, god damn some of you need like actual irl interaction lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,could not disagree more. imo ragnarok builds on the previous game and surpasses it easily. the last 6 or so hour stretch is some of the best video game moments ive ever had. ready yourself!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"pc gamer here, the reason why is because it devalues their purchase. why did i buy a ps5 when every game i want is coming to pc anyway but with higher settings."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-04,because theres absolutely no reason to own a playstation aside from their exclusives. it took two years for the ps5 to be able to display the most common gaming monitor resolution never again lol.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,sonynintendomicrosoft simps are actually insane ftfy.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i got it for free with my ps5. havent bothered to play it yet.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"given all the people replying to me about how much they enjoyed ragnorak and are happy for pc users to share in this, i'd wager that most playstation players are like you. it's only a tiny amount of fanboys who would be upset that a good game is able to reach a new audience."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,if they actually would do it silently but they don't. they are fucking loud.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yeah, i can't really see a positive to sony pushing psn on pc. dunno why they'd want to limit their own sales."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"but without it they wouldn't be able to steal your information, won't you take pity on a poor megacorporation?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"so sucky, making a free account. literally, makes you want to give up, right? crying about the most trivial stuff and the gaming community. name a more perfect pairing"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"its opening it up to the same people who could have bought and played on playstation but now on pc, in the regions where sony makes business.... how is this drama even real"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"unfortunately, yeah"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,downvoted because people from 170 countries can't buy this shit?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yeah. same reason i skipped out on baldurs gate 3. larian doesnt need my personal data either.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,so you wont be gaming at all for the rest of your life.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,maybe they're affected because they can't buy it? they can't even access the steam page for fucks sake
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,a bit odd to require it weird way to say absolutely unnecessary and that it brings 0 value to the customer and only benefits sony in this case.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,what argument exists for requiring a thirdparty account for a single player experience?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,"aside from encouraging sony to release more on pc, i can't find a reason."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why not? steam has a good return policy.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,i really liked gow 2018
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,"yeah, should have released on pc and ps5 at the same time."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,kiss normal tie books alleged arrest nine cagey close ask
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i think this is more towards the comment that was literally just made from a sony exec that pc players would definitely buy a ps5 for good exclusives that just happened today. the irony of this turnover is absolutely hilarious.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"eh, i would say 1.5 years"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"oh shit, i need a psn account to play half life?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i don't think they would because they haven't before but who knows, maybe they'll start since they keep insisting on a psn account"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i definitely did not master the mechanics and admit that's on me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i didn't used to hate americans until they poisoned the world with their woke politics and culture war, i still like the ones that aren't part of the far right or far left cult don't worry."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"guess what, we can play xbox games and emulate a ton of previous gen exclusives without a problem too."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,cool. i'm still not gonna waste an extra 300 when i already have a pc that plays most of the same games and way more
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,this is the truth of it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,that was mainly because they wanted to release it as close as possible to the release of the tv show
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"honestly i think ragnarok was a 710 game. 2018 was fantastic but i thought ragnarok was kinda up its own ass. the entire plot focused on !destiny and how atreus was destined to kill kratos. then at the end he just doesnt? like its that easy? then the entire time kratos is telling atreus he doesnt want to go to war and doesnt want atreus to end up like him but, doesnt make any concessions or try to deescalate the conflict once. that and the loading gates every 5 seconds! it certainly had its highs but also some very low lows."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,theyre gonna be disappointed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i could see it being this, but well for me personally, i feel the tradeoff of getting to play the game much earlier is fair. sure it'll eventually lose its exclusive status, but thats usually a couple of years away from release. also its not exactly a certainty that the game will go to pc eventually. one of my favorite games, bloodborne, has only been in the ps since 2015."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,like all companies it is because they think that someday it will make them more money. eventually they may even try to do the ea origin thing and make their own platform and pull everything off steam. having their own drm baked it can help with that.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,they want to get into the data mining game just like everyone else. they want to be able to sell anonymous user statistics to big name publishers as a side hustle.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,ypu can't but they can. that's why they're doing this.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-02,because the psn accounts give them more than those limited countries would get them in sales
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"what information are they stealing? you're on reddit, you likely have a smart phone. why is this the last straw?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"when over 100 countries that have access to steam but not psn and can't even buy this... yeah, it's kind of a big deal. maybe not for you personally, but the world doesn't revolve around you."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"you don't need a larian account to play bg3. it's optional. you only want to use it if you're playing with other people cross platform. i bought bg3 on gog. when the larian launcher opens, go into the launcher settings to stop asking you to sign increate an account. again, it's optional and not forced on us. i chose not to create an account. next time you launch the game, you will get the launcher pop up, though this time you only need to click 'play' on the launcher."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"literal tax laws, government laws, distributions laws. did you know that australia ban violent games unless they change the color of the blood? am i really teaching you about laws like what the fuck. if you can't buy a playstation and god of war in a region then these people already had no chance of playing that game in the first place, it being on steam changes nothing and in most case, these regions usually have bigger problems to deal with in the first place than fucking videogame distribution. ask their government if you want a real answer. you wanna talk about stupid account for stupid shit then why aren't we roasting peripheral companies? why do i need to sign in for razor to be able to configure the lights on my keyboard? now these accounts makes no sense and have no laws to explain them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ok? they're not gonna run out of copies. of course you're free to spend your money how you want, but if it's a bad port you don't get to complain because you gave them your money without even seeing how it would be."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"haha! i will agree that the extreme of the left and right are annoying. most people are moderates, they just don't make a lot of noise."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i play on pc. i know its advantages over console. ps5 definitely has a customer base, mostly people who play sony singleplayer games and don't want to shell out the extra money for a pc. playing xbox games isn't going to be a big draw because they'd have an xbox over a ps if they cared more about xbox games. emulation will fall into the same boat."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,im a pc gamer and hope that one day this elitist cringe will stop.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"...okay? i think you're misunderstanding what i'm saying. i'm talking as if i'm someone deciding to go pc or console, and i'm saying that there're still plenty of reason to choose the latter. if you already have either of them, you're obviously not going to buy the other."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"while an understandable reason, they should've just started work on the port sooner so that they didn't release an unstable mess"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"!kratos is trying to deescalate the whole game, and even succeeds in not having to kill thor. and as for the fate thing, they didnt just not do it. they reveal that atreuss mother, who was a giant, went against the rules of her people and changed fate by destroying the murals they find in ruins in the first game and creating the new murals that angrboda shows kratos at the end.!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yea the final act of that game was a let down. definitely would've been much more ballsy to do what you suggested. and would've had a much greater impact in valhalla.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"nah, not really. both games are great."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"party pooper, you love to ruin someone's day don't you? look, i just want to see the continuation of my gow 2018 experience, idc if it's not as good as that one, at least i can continue the story on my pc."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,dont underestimate peoples pettiness
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"fanboys in the term of fanatics? idk, but xbox does have a ton of fans"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"used to be one, until i bought a gaming pc and never looked back. shoulda done that 10 years earlier"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"man i fucking hate this website. i try to crack a sarcastic joke, and along comes that one guy who has nothing better to do with their limited time in this hellish plain of existence than to try and make me look like a moron. seriously is it so hard to go 5 minutes without going um aktchually? why do i even fucking do this to myself. why am i even wasting my limited time replying."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,try living in a real country
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,true enough. brainwashed individuals
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,you have to make a larian account to play steam bg3.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,we also care about people in affected countries. you dont need to live there to have some empathy and stick your neck out for other people.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"so just because i don't live in one of the affected countries, i don't have the right to be pissed that sony is intentionally limiting access to their games for millions of people, simply because they want to force pc users into their ecosystem and deem them a worthy sacrifice? yeah, no. it's bullshit through and through. and fwiw, i hate every game on steam that requires a third party launcher. i shouldn't have to log in to ea play, ubisoft, battle.net, larian's launcher they don't get a pass just because bg3 was good, whatever to play my games i buy on steam. when i click play on steam on a game i bought on steam, it should just fucking launch."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,there are like 170 countries affected. we just want to play the game legally.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,holy shit youre so cool bro
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,it's called empathy you bootlicking son of a bitch
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i am aware australia has some weird laws when it comes to m and 18 ratings for games. but that's kinda besides the point. linking a thirdparty account achieves nothing here, as the storefront or the publisher can ban the product from sale anyway. sure, there can be other stupid products requiring accounts and people shouldn't have to put up with this sort of bullshit. but just because other companies do it in a more egregious fashion doesn't mean we can't complain about sony doing it with 0 benefits for the customer."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,steam has refunds.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"me playing gow2018 on pc made me hope they'd release ragnarok on pc without a huge delay, so... yeah. i am glad we didn't have to wait 4 years."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,why should it only be one way?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,right on.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"as a centrist myself who used to be left leaning, now im neither leaning, i know many americans are centrist i still have american friends i love dearly, but overall as a country, their politics, the way they screwed us over here in the balkans, especially my country, macedonia makes it very difficult for me to tolerate let alone like america and its culture as a whole now."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i've played console for most of my life. i just don't like the direction consoles are going. especially when sony and microsoft has few exclusives. it just doesn't make much sense to me
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,oh ok. yeah i guess i did. that's my bad
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"the entire story of both games was the idea that you are not destined to achieve a certain fate, and prophecies do not have to be followed. it would be edgelord worthy if they wanted to fulfil the prophecy without going back and completely overhauling the story of ragnarok."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,the ending is awful
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i have to side with the anarchist here. ive played and enjoyed gow iii remastered and gow 2018 and loved them but whenever i tried ragnarok out it didnt intrigue me one bit. i got bored in the first hour or so and havent picked it back up since release. edit probably couldve chose to say something better than anarchist
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,have fun with cringe ya romance
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,yea i am thinking of the guys that carried the xbox banner during the height of the console wars who insisted that xbox was the be all end all. i don't know if it's just because i'm not young enough anymore but i just don't see them. i still see the sony stans though.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,could use s for sarcasm.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,try exiting sony's asshole.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,nah man you can click past all that shit. it even has a box saying don't show again. i never once made a larian account and just finished that game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,no? i don't have any larian account and i'm able to play online with no problem.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,lmaooooo you don't
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,no
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"they're doing it because they do not have the right to sell their shit there at the moment, how hard is it to understand... do you think sony hates money?????? do you think pornhub is happy to be unavailable in texas right now???? do you think they want to be unavailable to people in texas?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,idk just seeing what you want trying to make u happy man
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,there are far less console exclusives than ever before.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,its a great game what you mean?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"personally i didn't like those segments either, but they're such tiny nitpicks overall to the rest of the game that calling the game bad as a whole is being disingenuous."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"out of the entire game, that's your focus?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"we will, and?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"yeah if you go on shitter you will find them in droves, usually coupled with a blue checkmark i don't recommend this though"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"figured it'd be obvious, but i suppose there's an argument to be made."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,i dont even like sony. dont even have a ps5. just think its dumb that people cry about a free account
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"exactly, you can even use the executable to bypass the launcher altogether"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"how were previous games released on pc without psn required? horizon games, spiderman, last of us, first god of war..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i got a backlog on pc that could fill the gap between ps5 and ps7, i can wait. thankya though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,all the more reason why i'm gonna stick with pc for now
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"i personally dont think it is, but hey that is what opinions are for my friend."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i mean the rest is just a retread with a spear added
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,i personally take it at face value as it is something that people have been saying haha. didn't mean to cause anger.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"then don't comment on stuff you know nothing about. literally over a 100 countries don't have psn access, whereas around 70 do. now think about why people are crying over a free account."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"it could probably really help to clarify why. most people who enjoyed 2018, enjoyed ragnarok, because fundamentally it's just one really long game. the gameplay is the same, the quality of writing is the same, the tone of the world is the same, ragnarok just expands 2018 into a wider world."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"ironically enough, your comment was the actual last straw that released like 2 years of pent up anger. that's why the response was so disproportional. i wager if i kept saving it up just a bit longer, i'd gain the ability to manifest tulpa pipe bombs. all good now. no hard feelings i hope."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"like i said, live in a real place. i really dont care."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,as if vpns dont exist
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-31,"all good dude. in a weird way, glad to help! haha"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"if you actually think that that's funny, i suggest you see a psychologist."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,you leave out the most notable part. chad gaspard died while saving his 10 year old son from drowning after a riptide caught them. a true hero meant for valhalla if there is one.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,i think this is fantastic and a wonderful parallel to the games. kratos' whole goal is to protect atreus and shad died protecting and saving his son. what a good man.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,shad gaspards was welcomed into valhalla 2 years ago.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,pop a 40 and check your rolly! its cryme tyme!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"he took care of his boi and died with honor, like a real man"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,sacrificed himself to save his son. art imitates life.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"when i had been playing gow, i caught myself on thoughts that some of kratos moves really remind me of wrestling moves."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,i'd recognize that nipple anywhere
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"i had no idea about this that he was motion capture actor for kratos, nor about the circumstances of his death, even though i love the game so much! i also didn't expect this sudden knowledge would hit me as hard as it actually did. almost like the whole game now have additional hidden underlying meaning. real men don't cry!, yes, they fucking do..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,i remember him from cryme tyme back with jtg in wwe. one of my favourite tag teams in that era
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,it's so cool knowing the physical actor and va played 2 separate roles in the same character to get kratos right
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"strange that all the documentaries on the making of the game never mentioned him at all when it comes to mocap. instead, it's being credited to christopher judge who plays kratos and eric jacobus who performs the combat. gaspard's name does appear in the credits, but not specifically as kratos."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"especially the big boots kratos throws, shad definitely threw some of those in his day."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"he wasnt the motion capture actor for all the acting scenes, just the combat animation i believe"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,i mean they generally kept kratoss facial features from the original games. itd be weird if he looked like a totally different person.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,they changed so much it's probably more accurate that they used his outline as a reference and then did whatever they want with it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,a black voice actor wasn't enough?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"kratos is from sparta? sooo, he is spartan."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,username checks out
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,given this guy passed away id assume they had to go with someone new for ragnarok.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,three people portrayed kratos. shad gaspard for the model and some movesets. christopher judge for performance. eric jacobus for dynamic action.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,what? kratos is greek. of course they changed the facial features to match that. but the rest? the human body its self is fairly racially neutral.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,he was the mocap guy. that's what's meant by digital image.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"it's motion capture, you thick racist cunt."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,its called a change in character also he has a son now yet hes still the god of war
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"sometime around 2010 or 2011, he was arrested for jaywalking. that was sometime after i got the chance to meet and befriend him briefly. he was part of some kickboxing seminars."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,someone tried to rob him?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,someone looked at this dude and said ayo imma rob him? mustve been a skyrim npc smh

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,that sounded more epic then it probably was when i read it in my head in kratos voice
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,and then he literally threw his son to the lifeguards like 12 feet away.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,atreus?!!??
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,shad gaspard probably.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,yes. his son survived
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,i assume that died saving your son means he saved his son. just an assumption.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,bringin the hood to youuuuuu
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,i think they got away with it largely because the characters were roguishly lovable faces. can you imagine how much worse they would be if you had heel characters whose entire gimmicks were being black and stealing things?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"they knew the whole time they were taking a big risk lol. i remember seeing the disclaimer before their first appearance on tv and i just looked it up for the exact wording tonight a new tag team, cryme tyme, will be introduced to the raw audience. in an effort to humor and entertain our fans, the tag team known as cryme tyme will be parodying racial stereotypes. shad gaspard and jtg do outlandish, outrageous stunts to ready themselves for tag team action on raw. this attempt at saturday night live like humor is bound to entertain audiences of all ethnic derivations. we hope you enjoy the weekly adventures of cryme tyme."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"wwe and racist gimmicks, name a more iconic duo"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,based off of how many behind the scenes have the voice actors for both kratos and atreus doing their lines in mocap suites i'm pretty sure this is correct.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"multiple black vas, even."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,or just limit the types of actions kratos is capable of.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,it's called cratos can fit in all ass holes. and in next game he will become gay trans. ohhh and i don't mind it's okay to be gay with trans kid

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"it was updated daily httpsbleacherreport.comarticles630012wwenewsupdatenumbertwoshadgaspardsagaconitinues and the charges were dropped after three months. it was definitely racial profiling, as gaspard wasn't the only person crossing that road, and there were many witnesses who attested to the incident and conditions, which again, in the video we see multiple people crossing the road while gaspard is detained. this one tmz uploaded shows four police holding him down while another says why they're arresting himhttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vp6km3yuzwe. this had occurred during already tense times between black americans and the police, who were already under fire across the country for police brutality."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"that last sentence could've been talking about 50 years ago, 10 years ago, or yesterday"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"true. though i suppose i mean that, since the incident at fruitvale station in 2009, more people were starting to stand up against police brutality, and the brutality had gotten so bad by 2013. black lives matter movement started roughly at the end of that year as a whole. before that, incidents like these were treated as a joke."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,by white people. this has been a sticking point in the black community since before i was born.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"by the corrupt and the racist, who can't be caught as often that people can joke about police brutality as much, now that the communities across the country are standing together against it."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,plant
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,they specifically spell out that other pantheons were visited by i wanna say tyr. i had the strong impression in the last game that they were building a reason to turn the series into father and son road trip through the pantheons. probably ending in the roman pantheon that built itself up from the greek pantheon.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,these trees look like that prehistoric type of tree found around summits of mount kilimanjaro in africa if i recall correctly. they are called giant groundsels or something like that.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,don't mind me just thinking of kratos wrecking the egyptian realm. bye bye anubis
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"they are called frailejones or monk trees. they are native to the high altitudes of south america, more prominent in bolivia and colombia."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,vanaheim or svartalfheim
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,clearly dick bouquet trees.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,most likely vanaheim. they are tree hippies after all.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,i remembered seeing similar looking trees in freyas window into vanaheim
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,my first thought is it was vanahiem.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,game developers release a game with mind blowing graphics and an engaging story. gamers i dont believe those trees are historically and geographically accurate.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,fiction. its a fictional game

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,looks like vanaheim to me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,they gave us the fat thor and what you're worried about are trees?!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,as someone who lives in egypt i can confirm we don't have those here
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,they meet tyr. so i'm guessing that because he has travelled through the ages. i'm guessing there is gonna be some mythology travel
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,y tree
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"also, those are the oldest tree species on earth, dating back to well the dinosaurs, they were alive when the asteroid hit."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,the girl at the very end of the trailer looks like she could be egyptian?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,good eye. honestly mexican mythology would be insane. its not in any games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,might be vanaheim
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,looks like a really chubby joshua tree.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"the game will travel to all 9 of the norse mythology realms. we've yet to see svartelheim, asgard and vanaheim, so i imagine it'll be one of the three! pretty sure we saw svartelheim in the trailer the dwarves' realm. you'll note midgard was clearly frozen over, but we saw brok and sindri with other dwarves in what i assume is their sunny home realm. the rest of the screen looks similar to those sunny places, so i'm assuming it's just the same realm with some different trees although we have actually seen vanaheim through freya's house window and it looked more swampy"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,fruits
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,i'm starting to think the last god of war game is just going to be him finishing off all mythological gods and then deciding to go to the middle east and changes name to jesus...

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"you can also see a centaur in a few frames of the trailer. centaurs are a part of the greek pantheon, not any other. i think there's quite a bit that they're not telling us"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,that's an exeggutor. judging by the height i would say this is alola and not kanto. you're welcome.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,might be a different realm like we had muspelhiem and all that
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,kinda looks like plant in australia xanthorrhoea or commonly called black boys
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,could be constantinople. vikings are known to have travelled there as mercenaries.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,yeah teacher pretended in the first game thats where they were going to head to
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,grass trees. simply they not trees iirc
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-20,we have also such trees in morocco
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"the giant groundsels are found in the alpine zone of the mountains of equatorial east africa  mount kilimanjaro and mount meru in tanzania, mount kenya, the aberdare range, and cherangani hills in kenya, mount elgon on the ugandakenya border, the rwenzori mountains on the ugandademocratic republic of congo drc border, the virunga mountains on the borders of rwanda, uganda and the drc, and mitumba mountains mount kahuzi and mount muhi in the east of the drc. africa dendroseneciohttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikidendrosenecio looks pretty close."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,spot on!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,or they used its design for a different realm... hoping for egypt tho
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,egypt is next seems to be the popular belief.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,you mean the part where he said it's the end of the norse saga? lol. like there's very little room for interpretation for what he meant.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,the name ragnarok didn't tip you off to that? that's literally all gods are killed and only 2 humans survive lif and lifthrasir being the 2 surviving humans. it leads perfectly in to the judeochristian setting with lif being eve and lifthrasir being adam. but most devs don't really have the balls to go after that pantheon.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"he didnt so much hint as straight up say.. this is the finale of the norse saga, he said it straight up."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,end of the norse saga hopefully this means we get to massacre aesir like olympians in the third game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,next game will be god of war the age of mythology
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"honestly, i'd rather see a ton of games set in one mythology before moving to the next. we spent the ps2 and 3 eras in greece. it would be a shame if we only got one or two games in scandanavia before moving on."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,if true i hope we get aztec one day. its oddly rare for games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"spoilers. in the last gow it was !foreshadowed that kratos will die!. and tbh i think this might be the last game of the franchise, or at least with kratos."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,pretty sure they dont care about historical accuracy which is fair. people need to not get but hurt over things a game does. god of war has always been scifi and magical and not real except the myth stories on the gods they try and keep accurate. characters and areas and effects are all fake. its a video game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"most definitely, the recent god of war comic was about egypt and it's gods and creatures some of them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,i just realized that gow no longer stands for gears of war sadge
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,well... ragnarok is the end of the norse world so the game being titled this should clue you into the end of the norse saga for kratos.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,indeed.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"it would appear so, o'neill."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,undomesticated equines couldn't stop him
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,well their body goes around the entire world so maybe they could say that their head pops out at different parts of the world and is interpreted differently by different religions?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"a new realm, accessed via a stargate."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,oh my god i hope so  im already on fire

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,lmfao facts
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"how would the roman pantheon work though? many of their major gods were originally greek, like mars ares, jupiter zeus, pluto hades, neptune poseidon, and vulcan hephaestus. gods that kratos already killed."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,yeah i think youre right. the dendrosenecio kilimanjari or giant grounsel are found only on kilimanjaro. amazing looking trees!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,i am guessing that is autocorrect and you mean midgard.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,nah jtumheim is a cold place. this looks more like a savannah type of tree
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"why not, its interesting to think about what realms we might end up with maybe egypt or india or whatever is behind that , or could be nothing  i believe in santa monica and also little details"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,i think they are just looking for clues about what settingsrealms they may encounter in the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"that was angrboa at the end of the trailer. in norse mythology she is a jotunn so im not so sure this explains anything. shes the mother of fenrir, jrmungand, and hel."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"if you played the game youll know what i mean , there are four different world in this game greece , egyptian , japanese and celtic  im asking because they are very carful with the details especially with trailer"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,why is this downvoted? pretty funny. gamers are so fucking lame.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,so ?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,nope
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"that's not the point op is making... god of war 2018 !teased egyptian and shinto pantheons, so the sight of a nonnorse tree in the sequel is fuel for some theories on the game's content.!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"without spoiling anything, the point is it may be hinting at areas that are not usually expected in a norse mythology themed game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,what a dumb comment. a major thing about fiction is that it needs internal coherence that every element of the world makes sense within the limitations of its setting.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"so if a game is set in feudal japan you would have no problem with one of the locations containing aztec architecture? not to mention i don't see anyone complaining that the trees aren't from scandinavia, they all seem to be excited that we may visit other realmsinteract with pantheons other than the aesir and the vanir."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,someone has to
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,we saw brok and sindri with other dwarves in what i assume is their sunny home realm why would nidavellir be sunny though? isn't it supposed to be a subterranean realm?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,i thought svartalheim was where the dark elves came from.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"as a result, old plants have the appearance of candelabras the size of telephone poles, each branch with a terminal rosette. that's fucking badass"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,they got the reeds right there my friend egypt was the land of the reeds my friend.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,the devs talked in the past about wanting to do egypt before they settled on norse so it wouldn't surprise me if they're coming back to those ideas.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"i don't remember exactly what these panels were about tyr's journey i think, but it shows references to religions of egypt, greece, japan and the celts httpsi.redd.itmmgyjxr3zht01.png so at the very least it's acknowledged that they exist."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,maybe its still a trilogy after all. ragnarok ends the north sage and they have to run away to egypt or some shit and the third plays out there.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"yup thats what i was referring to, but also been duped by developersstorytellers with shit like that before."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,because it's boring? 1 god? bleh. waste of time
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,to be honest i thought it wasn't going to be the end. i thought thor would be the main boss in this then odin the final boss in the 3rd game similar to the first trilogy where you fight zeus at the end as well as kill the rest of the pantheon.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,technically magni and modi are supposed to survive ragnarok as well. but then they met kratos.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,it did but the format of gow123 worked through the pantheon i expected the new series to follow that by thor being the big bad then a 3rd game with odin as the big bad
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,keyword most. bayonetta is all the more impressive for having you blast  to smithereens.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,i thought ask and embla were the norse equivalents to adam and eve?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"i had never realized how good of a lead in that would be to the judeo christian setting, that's awesome still though, the judochristian pantheon doesn't strike me as something that would work well in gow. there's only a handful of archangels and god himself, all of which are effectively immortaldon't have any beings close to them in power."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"magni and modi, sons of thor are fated to survive as well, but as you saw in the last game... good news is some other gods survive too like vidar and njord."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,yea but as iv said in another reply. motherfuckers misdirect all the time. and god of war 1 2 3 had a pattern i thought this new series might follow it mainly did in gow4. kill one main boss plus a series of minors then in gow2 we killed some more and worked up to zeus in the third. its not outwith the realms of possibility that the new series would follow this format. at this point i'm not entirely sure i'm still wrong on that as them jus saying it makes me dubious as to why they just out n revealed that. could be to prepare us for the end of that journey or to misdirect
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"could also be tyr, though right? also yeah death is a minor setback for someone like kratos. he's too big a character to die permanently."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,kratos has died multiple times before.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,death does not tend to stick for kratos. curses worse than death don't even stick.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,they just got their stride with this new series and people love it. they would be insane to end the franchise now with so much left to explore.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,yes. if it was kratos in the mural thats going to be his fate... i hope it was tyr

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"they said we'd be visiting vanaheim, svartalfheim, and asgard, in addition to the realms from the previous game. my assumption is this is vanaheim or svartalfheim, possibly the latter since it's more rugged being the home of the dwarves."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,theyre crossed palm trees at every in n out. all of them.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"for all that he went on a killing spree through the pantheon, he didn't kill everyone. i imagine a bunch of minor godsentities usurp positions and build up a mythos. the roman pantheon was big on grabbing mythsheritage from everywhere and making it fit. especially as the roman religions had a bunch of religious cults adding their own gods to the mix. the norse pantheon is setting the stage in this as well, as its the merger of two or more tribal mythologies and several of the characters presented in the last game spell out that they were from other pantheons and they definedwere defined into their current positions. i personally think the son choosing which name to go by is going to be a key point in ragnarok, and the consequence of that would go into further games."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,they could have them all be reborn as their roman counterparts. though that seems like it would be a bit dull tbh.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"i dunno , in the last little section of the game where the big reveal happens , it looks just like an arid desert type landscape. i mean im sure there is cold places too, but i cant rule that out."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"jtumheim in god of war 4 was a more desert type area, this is probably far out into jtumheim"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,nope not indian. it seems more like a tree that is found around mt kilimanjaro.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"to be fair though, god of war 2018 was already kind of loose with the mythology. in the myths, loki's biological parents were both giants, mimir was beheaded by the vanir, magni and modi survived until ragnarok and beyond, et cetera. it's possible this version of angrboa is african, as opposed to a jotunn."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,yea this could definitely be a part of whatever land she comes from

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,i think the reason they didnt end up doing egypt was because they couldnt figure out how to make the environment work since it would be just mostly flat deserts

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"you should read the unseen realm. there are many scholars who support the idea of rebel gods who god put in place but rebelled. under this assumption, there's only one true god, and all the other gods from other religions are real spiritual beings with power that rebelled. it wouldn't be as simple as demons and angels. under that worldview, all that kratos has gone through would make sense."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"that's true that he didn't kill all of the greek gods plus the romans had some of their own, but as i mentioned, he killed most of the major ones. i suppose the minor ones could assume their titles, but they wouldn't necessarily have the control over their domains. a minor deity could take the mantle of jupiter for instance, but they wouldn't have control over the air like zeus did. same thing with pluto and mercury. triton or oceanus could take poseidon's place, but other than that, the fallen olympians wouldn't have someone to fill their shoes. not to mention mars was a central figure in the roman pantheon, and kratos is the greek god of war now that ares is dead. i doubt anyone would want to potentially provoke him by claiming that title. plus many of the minor deities, titans, and other powerful supernatural entities are gone too heracles, charon, helios, thanatos, kronos, et cetera. the norse pantheon wasn't merging two distinct ones, at least not in gow 2018. in norse mythology there were two tribes of gods  the aesir of asgard, and the vanir of vanaheim. both were part of the norse pantheon. freya wasn't an aesir, she was vanir, which i think she mentioned in the game. the only one who might not be norse at all in the game at least would be mimir, who mentioned he traveled quite a bit. even if he wasn't aesir, vanir, or jotun however, it's hardly merging two pantheons to have one character that isn't a native."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"perhaps. that seems like it would trivialize kratos's struggles against the olympians in the previous games however. and i'm not overly interested in some supreme being overseeing everything in the god of war universe. i prefer the idea that there are separate pantheons, each with their own distinct realms."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"true. the dev cycle length might be why we are seeing more liveservice titles like halo infinite. rdr2 took 7 years with a delay to make, infinite took 6 and they're still going to add features after launch, god of war ps4 took 4 years and if ragnarok isn't delayed it will have taken 4 years as well. and with games being more complex it will only take longer to develop games in the future."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,exactly. the abrahamic religions says they're monotheistic because it only considers 1 member of its pantheon to be an actual god. but sure as hell have a lot of other beings in their mythos that would be considered a god in any other religion. it's like if the greek only called zeus a god and called every other god a saintangeldemon.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,"there is a debate about that, particularly because the prose edda was compiled after the spread of christianity in the countries that once worshiped the norse gods iceland specifically, as that is where snorri sturleson was from. i've heard claims that the entirety of the fall of the gods was attributed to this conversion tactic, and others that say only the part about anyone at all surviving was from it. part of the problem is the fact that so little remains that can be definitively attached to the time period in question, as opposed to the classical mythologies. the eddas, a few sagas like saga of the volsungs, and tales of the time from closer such as beowulf are the vast majority of history we have to go on."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,we have been so spoiled since the ps4 released.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,microsoft can learn from this.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"man, i love ratchet and clank. been playing those games half my life."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,sony really love horizon series huh?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"just finished rc rifts apart on pc maaan, i'm a middle aged man but this game turned me intoy childhood. such a pure, innocent fun with astonishing graphics and lovely characters. i want more of this!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"all of those games are really good, so they deserve the game nomination"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"im an old guy i dont really like cutesy cartoon games, but after seeing astro bot as game of the year, i decided to check it out. wow! so fun and creative, and no one has come close to leveraging the dual sense like this game has. it really is a love letter to the playstation."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,that 2015 game looks interesting. i wonder if theres a remaster of it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"and if there was a worst game of the year, sony will probably have a nominee for those every year as well."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they pay for it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,they havent made any of those games. they pay studios to make games which they then sell.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"ive never played any of these games, am i missing out or not"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,i suspect bribes. death stranding was a lot of things. goty candidate it was not.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,should death stranding really qualify?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,does death stranding still count now that kojima bought the rights back so he could release it on xbox?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"was death stranding worth it? never played it. genuine question, i'm looking for good solo games"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,astro bot is so boring! a cheap game that's not worth it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,is this not like all other industries where you just fill out a form and pay a fee to get nominated for industry awards?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,how the heck did death stranding sneak in? that game was a turd.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,cool but forbidden west does not qualify as a goty nominee on the grounds that it's a sequel which is inferior to the first.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,this would be like saying i won a popularity contest every year when my mom is the judge. those fake awards are sony bias.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,i wouldn't count studios that they don't own as playstation
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"13 games listed, and if i'm being generous, maybe about four of them are actually worth playing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,and only one of those games actually deserved the nomination lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,but wins nothing
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-05,idgaf about those snobs at gaming awards
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-05,"you see that 2015 game, do that again please."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,red dead redemption 2 not winning goty still pisses me off so much
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,shouldnt rebirth be listed here too? i know its square enix but its still a ps5 exclusive the same way bloodborne is a ps4 exclusive despite being made by fromsoft.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,astrobot's gonna win this year. for sure.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"honestly some of these being up there feels in support of the idea that nominations are rigged and that geoff just wants a designated sony spot to ensure they keep supporting and show up to the event. ratchet and clank was not a top tier game and uncharted and death stranding were so niche in their audiences that they feel forced. one of my biggest problems with the game awards rn is how token a lot of the category nominations feel. theres always the token indy, token sony, token pc game and then the 23 games that actually got the most attention buzz surrounding them that actually will likely win. then they have 16 categories so every triple a game can get something despite the title really grasping at straws."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,hot take all of these are mid
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"a. the nominees are chosen by industry shills. b. that doesn't make them good games. c. goty isn't a real thing. it's a popularity contest decided by industry shills. d. sony didn't make death stranding or bloodborne. i own every single one of these games. i've played all of them, more than once. the second time was only because of pc releases so i could get the achievements. they aren't experiences i'm desperate to have again, though i will definitely buy ghost of yotei, venom and whatever naughty dogs next game is assuming they don't somehow fail to deliver a very well produced game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"they deliver but i still dont like ps exclusives games, im glad final fantasy will no longer be a ps exclusive."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,looking at the nominations for goty this year astro bot is the clear winner for me. team asobi taking an already great game in astros playroom and somehow improving just about every part of the gameplay is a rare achievement in game development these days
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,well considering there are probably 100s of publications giving out goty awards thats pretty meaningless.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,because the whole thing is pay to win advertising.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"yes, playstation pays to have a goty nominee every year."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,wow this is some serious glazing
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,death stranding is playstation?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,literally every game is a goty nomineewinner somewhere.. this isn't an achievement got nothing against those games just that this stat is worthless
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"same goes for pc, not sure what the big deal is."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"astro bot is good, but it's hard to believe there wasn't any other game this year that would take that spot."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,it's pretty wild when it's listed like this. what an absolute banger list of games they've put out over the years.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,shows how good sonys first party games are. ive bought most of sonys steam releases.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,well it is the sony awards.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,ghost of tsushima is such a good game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,uncharted 4 should have won that year
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"from 2020 onward, only sequels.."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,the last of us 2
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,breaking news major game company makes games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"yet only two were actually exclusive to playstation, so what's your point?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"okay, what even is astro bot? i know every other game but i've not even heard of astro bot until it came out and every game journalism gave it 9s and 10s. does it play like little big planet?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,okay how many of them won?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,meanwhile xbox hasn't had a single goty nominee in the past decade.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i'm not surprised since a lot of sony's games are the oscar bait of gaming. i'm not hating though, they're generally good games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"it's honestly insane that god of war actually beat red dead redemption 2 for goty in 2018. god of war really hasn't aged well with its level design and ragnarok was a huge step down. meanwhile, people are still discovering amazing npc and world interactions in red dead redemption 2 over 6 years later."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,helldivers 2 should have been there as well
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they make good games too bad they also force me to join psn on my pc to play any of them
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i was about to say where the hell is returnal ? but i realised it wasn't nominated as game of the year. damn, the public was rude with this one."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"with my new pc i plan to build in spring next year, i can't wait to tackle all the playstation games i missed god of war 2018 uncharted legacy of thieves collection ratchet and clank rift apart horizon forbidden west ghost of tsushima god of war ragnark spiderman 2 i really hope astro comes to pc as well next year since i love 3d platformers."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,almost like sony makes good games
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,bloodborne is still the best game on that list as far as i'm concerned. and not even for it's time. i mean it's still the best game. edit downvoted for having an opinion? fucks sake
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,longer than a decade
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,feel old now.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"in 2025, lets bring it fullcircle with bloodborne ii."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"tbf all of those are bangers. the 2 that maaaaybe wouldn't deserve to be nominated are ratchet and clanck and astrobot.and even they as far as i know they are really good games, i just haven't heard that much about them"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,what about ff7 rebirth? isn't that playstation?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"you can't be telling me that god of war, spiderman, and horizon zero dawn are from 2018 and 2017"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,id hope so. theyre the second biggest gaming company in the world lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"anyone else get floored by the ps1 startup sound? i don't want it to go away, best console startup sound ever."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,lack of a nom for returnal in 2021 is criminal
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,games were nominated and won game of the year selected by people
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,9 years and i'm still hoping for a bloodborne pc release
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,isn't that a given that the platform has a nominee for goty? why would they not have a nominee? that's like a political party not having a nominee during an election.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"and that is why the ps5 pro is 700. you want quality games, get ready for a quality monopoly.  sony executive probably."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they make a certain type of games that attract you or not. noy sure if i would spend money on any of these games. but i'm also not such a hardcore single player story fan.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"what is that game at the bottom? it looks funny, like it doesnt exist anymore."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i mean, obviously? they're one of the largest video game manufacturers in the world lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,rift apart still feels like the only next gen game on that list.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i hope astro bot also releases on pc
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,gowr changed my perception on single player games. i was almost exclusively a multiplayer  competitive gaming person but this game was insane
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"and here are the firstpartyindependent developers of these games astro bot team asobi spiderman 1 and 2, ratchet and clank insomniac horizon games guerrilla god of war games santa monica death stranding kojima uncharted 4 and the last of us ii naughty dog bloodborne fromsoftware"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,yeah but how many actually won? not being condescending just genuinely curious
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"bloodborne is due for a remake. seriously. if sony can get bluepoint to remake demon's souls and quite excellently at that then surely we can get the same treatment for bloodborne? it's probably some sort of licensing quagmire but if there's a will, there's a way, as the old saying goes so hopefully it happens. at some point. yeah."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,man im behind. i have played none of these except bloodborne.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,2015 was almost a decade avo excuse me while i enjoy cobains last meal ye ole 12ga
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,uncharted 4 should have won!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,we have no ips sony
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"2024 should have ffvii rebirth as well. it may be a temporary exclusive game, but so are some other games here like horizon or god of war."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,xbox could have won it all if they stopped being cowards and made a third viva piata
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,couldn't even vote for most of these games cause i don't own a playstation. it's been getting better over the years but seriously give me bloodborn!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,most of them are available on pc.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i feel this is like congratulating a movie theater for showing oscarnominated movies.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"is astro bot really that good? i have read such high praise for this game, but the only console exclusives i have played in ages are those that trickle their way onto pc."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,goty from one random outlet that is meaningless
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"goty for who, though? there are about a thousand gotys every year from every publication and website known to man. its literally the most useless accolade. lol.httpsyoutu.behqmblpsqhgm?sitj5mhozlf4d16td"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,why isnt ff7 in 2024?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,2025 bloodborne again! 10y anniversary!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,how many companies are left?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,wow what was sony doing wrong in 2014
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i have yet to play a single one of these games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,which goty? arent there about 30 gazillion of them now?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,god of the year 2018 and 2022. not a sony pony myself but god of war is peak gaming.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,playstation i sleep.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,your title says playstation but you mean sony. playstation having a nominee every year is not remarkable as there are only 3 consoles and pc and like 5 nominations. but sony as a publisher is different.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i mean, i would hope so. seems like a bare minimum requirement if youre going to ask people to invest in your system."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i mean, there are only 3 sources for goty contenders and playstation is one of them lol not the biggest flex"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,nominations are wildly different to a win
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,9
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,whole lotta xbox shiii
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i wonder what this stat looks like for other platforms though. it doesn't seem that crazy, like you would think each year there would be at least 1 nominee from other platforms like switch, xbox, and pc. am i totally off here?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"astro bot and bloodborne are the only two not on pc yet. death stranding is the only one that just recently came to xbox, but that's because of ownership change. would it even be considered a ps title anymore, technically?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,so...sony studios make good games? that's new
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"every single year apart from 2024 companies were doing stuff, now sony does not want to cash out to the devs so please enjoy astro world, a game no one really cares about. now sony works on something way bigger than games, i dont think the next year and a year after will have any worthy titles."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"horizon, god of war, spiderman. horizon, god of war, spiderman... i'm sensing a pattern"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i miss player bloodborne day 1 co op with my buddy. just exploring the levels . good times
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,duh
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,great games. but is it really surprising for one of the big 3 companies in gaming to be putting out at least one excellent game per year?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,bloodborne is from 2015?! mf im getting old
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,goty nominations are made by big companies like sony. it really is not that weird they have a nomination every year once you understand that.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,ill preface this comment by saying i dont know if all of these games are ps exclusives but im pretty sure most of them are if not all of them. so to the people who were whining about microsoft buying up big developers like bethesda and activisionblizzard and freaking out over the titles from those companies becoming xbox exclusives. this is what xbox users have been dealing with for well over a decade
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,sly 2 rerelease should be a goty nominee
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,where is rdr2?!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"wait youre telling me bloodborne, the game that everybody bitches and moans about getting a remake, is only 10 years old"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"20152020  great era in music, movies and games"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"that's why i'm still keeping ps4 and haven't even considered ps5, doubt i ever will. just so many cool games year after year and some still haven't played."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"as someone who has not had a playstation since the ps3 days, is there a way to play playstation games without one? ratchet and clank is probably the first game series i fell in love with, and i'd love to replay the old ones andor play the newest one. i have both xbox one and pc."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,only one of these is a standalone with no prequel or sequel. sony we need to change that
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,sooo one of the most dominant gaming consoles in the last two decades paid had games of the year published on their platform? what a nothing burger.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"ps4 games and their sequels more or less, sony needs to get some new ips in the mix, or maybe revive some more ps3 era ips."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"not to rain on the parade, but sony is one of the biggest distributorsdeveloperswhatever, where one of the 4 console including pc choices are made by them. idk how many nominees there are in total, but if they werent getting 14 of them every year i'd be surprised"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,mmmmmmmm
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,yeah i probably should have bought a play station back in 2015
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,astro bot is just mario galaxy.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,why did they stop at 2015? seems like they had some in 2014 too ...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"that's because sony is a whole ass platform that farms out a bunch of games, and the rest are typically made by individual publishers who make a game every few years outside of the yearly garbage like cod, fifa, etc."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"that forbidden west banner is a little baffling. you can't make the protagonist look like that no matter what camera angle or postprocessing you use, so i guess they just reused an asset from the first game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"fun fact, every single game on this list other than the newest, and bloodborne, have either come to pc or are scheduled to come to pc soon"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i think playstation has perfected the third person action game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and yet no bloodborne 2
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,the existence of bloodborne in any list should be a shameful reminder to sony of how they let the franchise die
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,all the single player games just goes to show ppl would rather just be left alone sometimes
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,death stranding isn't part of sony
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,deserved
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,what is astro bot?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they do make games after all...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,bangers!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i have never played bloodborne and probably never will, but wtf? it was released in 2015? i really thought that it is only 4 or 5 years old game. time flies way too fast nowadays."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i'm not following. 1 game nominated each year for game of the year? seems like it should be more. how many has nintendo had in the past decade?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,did any of them win?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,never heard of astro bot
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,ratchet and clank for 2024
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"damn, like what is even the point of xbox anymore? gamepass? why would i buy that, when i have a console with so many great games on it. xbox need to step up with their exclusives."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,how's astro bot?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,horizon got smacked both years. releasing beside a zelda and elden ring. amazing games and incredible story telling.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,that happens when you pay a lot of money for your games to be nominated.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"jesus christ, bloodborne was 9 years ago"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,bloodborne man! what a game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,bloodborne 2 and they'll actually win it as well
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,why was spiderman 2 nominated? it was aggressively mid
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,bloodborne is the best game on the list by far
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i have played 0 of these games lol. i'm 34 and i own several of these on steam. where is days gone? that game was really good.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,wouldn't really call death stranding sony's game. they don't own the developer and wasn't sole publisher for the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,20152019 are goat and winners in my eyes. the rest up until now not so much. except astro bot that was a unexpected surprise
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,call of duty bo6 could be up there this year
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,good god 8 years since nathan drake
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,the only game i've played and didn't enjoy from the list was bloodborne. does anyone else share the experience?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,oof xbox.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i gotta play that ratchet and clank game appearently.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"what a surprise with them having the largest market share in gaming, truly baffling."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i've only ever played uncharted out of these.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,this is the sign. bring back singleplayer only games they were peak
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i have never heard of astro bot
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,three of those games have already gotten a remaster
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,2018 was crazy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,i picked up spiderman remastered over the weekend and it's sooooo boring. how did that get nominated for goty?!? i love spiderman but even that couldn't keep me playing. after 7 hours i gave up
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"2018 might be the best year ever. god of war, spiderman, and red dead redemption 2. what a year."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"my favourite of these is bloodborne. i think i'm officially old, media's not being made for me anymore"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,i liked death stranding but game of the year nom is a stretch.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"you're telling me that one of the biggest video game corporations in the world, nay one of the big 3 sony, microsoft and nintendo, has games that are constantly seen in the mainstream public eye and are nominated in awards shows that target mainstream games? what's next, you're gonna tell me nintendo owns pokemon?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,bloodborne should have won goty.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,hopefully we get another ratchet and clank game by the start of the ps6
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,the power of money.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,probably because playstation is all modern gamers know about gaming
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"it's a shame that as a company, sony and subsequently playstation are fucking terrible. why does every company that makes legitimately good blockbuster titles also have to be complete scumbags who treat their communities like shit?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,2020 was a helluva year.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"weakest year 20, 22 or 24"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"hmmm, i've got some platinums to catch up on. couldn't do that all these years later if there are multiplayer trophies looking at you ac black flag"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"i think ill play bloodborne again, thanks!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,4 years later last of us 2 still not on ps premium smh
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,thats crazy to think about
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,only one nominee? or are there others?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,astrobot definitely deserves it. amazing game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,bloodborne
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,how the fuck is bloodborne nearly 10 years old...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,you know it's a slow year for gaming when astro bot makes goty. not saying i dont have love for platformers but i felt like there were better more mature nominations imo.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"only game i like out of those is bloodborne, the rest i dont care for."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"maybe sony should just dedicate to games  forget consoles. same with xbox, go pc software streaming"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,tlof is really good
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"not surprising. nintendo was on life support for the first couple years, third party publishers have mostly been chasing rushed live service nonsense, and xbox has been an alsoran since the end of the 360."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,have they won?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,ghost of tsushima is 4 years old but i still cant buy it for cheap
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"that reminds me, i still have to play death stranding and ghost of tsushima from my physical backlog."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"that reminds me, i still have to play death stranding and ghost of tsushima from my physical backlog."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,that is so crazy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,with how big helldivers 2 was i'm surprised it's not beside astro bot. they really shot themselves in the foot with that one.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,spiderman2 on the ps5 is hot garbage. hopefully fixed on pc release.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,horizon twice goty??? how?? it is a boringass game with good graphics
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"it's the entire point of this. they aren't just sony games, they are sony exclusive games, heavily subsidized to attract attention to the platform. yes, the studios are extremely talented, but they sony was only able to pull this off because they had a big market advantage with the ps4, and they saw this as an investment in their ecosystem. most studios, even aaa, cannot afford to pull this off."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"a lot of comments like 'it's come to pc or other platform, then it's not sony game', lol."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"i question the legitimacy of this. as majority of console players i know only ever have a sports game such as nba2k, nhlfifamadden, gta and every years cod."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,and an ubisoft infection by the looks of it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,2022 i was eating good
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,at least 80 of these games are mediocre at best. but these awards are all paid.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,spiderman and horizon are so overrated.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,that 20152018 playstation run was legendary
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"2018 was such a good year, god of war, mh world, red dead and spiderman celeste. im blessed to say ive played each one"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,if astro bot is all we can muster for goty then it was a sad year for gamers
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"meanwhile, xbox with all its fantastic ips sitting in a closet like what gives?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,nothing to do with marketing.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,2022 and 2023 is a joke although i liked the ragnarok.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"man, 8 years without an uncharted? and we got that shit movie instead? sad."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"in fairness 810 of those years nintendo was nominated too. of course 8 is less than 10 but the variety on offer is broader than sonys. i cant get behind sonys current business plan, we have a pro console, the portal and a bunch of bluetooth peripherals but barely any ps5 exclusive games. most users are still using the ps4 platform."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"i thought astro's playroom and astro bot are just little funny games and was even a bit angry when i saw astro bot is selling for full price. then i got to play both. amazing games, totally deserved goty nomination, amount of content per level is just... i have no words for this, amazing"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,sony sus
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"you have to remember  award shows are highly sponsored and often skewed to make those sponsors happy. nominations are the easiest to do, even if an award isnt won. sony has a huge budget for pr, and they love to use it. not really a marker of pure quality not saying they dont make quality games  but there are many others out there similar or better, but a marker of how much marketing money they have to toss around. or are willing to use."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,they could do something really nice and given us bloodborne sequel and port the game to sony's steam lineup... surely with 10 years of goty nominations they could spare us this?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"last of 7s, spiderman, gos, and gow only deserving spots."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-05,"is uncharted 4 actually any good? i played an uncharted a long time ago, i think if was ps34 and it was just a very bland and uninteresting gameplay"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-05,bloodborne and astroboy are the only ones worthy of the title tho. the rest are just generic triple a blockbuster games. the fastfood of gaming. it would be like calling mcdonalds the best restaurant of the year...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-05,crazy part is from that list the only games i kind of care about is god of war and possibly death stranding with maybe spider man 1 coming in third.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-05,atrobot saved this year... next year will be hard to partecipate
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-05,"nominating horizon for goty shows what's wrong with the industry these days. an absolute average game, with all sort of mechanics that has been already invented before just put in one game with apart of hunting which is the best part of the game, but still only hunting. brand new universe with new characters, story and few twists is way too little to be considered a goty pretender."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-05,i am sorry but horizon game are not goty contenders.......
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-13,"i have a playstion 4, yet as a xbox player. i dont even think any of those games are fun. its definitely rigged."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,we throw the word goty around too loosely
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"completely deserved, as a person who plays a lot of single players, almost every one that releases per year playstation have some of the most quality games i've ever played"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,would be interesting to see all games of the year since 1994 and first playstation.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,what is an action adventure game for 500 please
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,astro bot
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and next year its ghost of yotei. mark my words. it will win
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,which goty award? it seems 610 games release a game of the year edition these days.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"and not a single game in there i give a f about. well, except maybe astro bot. the playroom was decent. shows how much different personal tastes can be. none of these games would be even in consideration for goty for me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they all deserve it honestly
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,do you think this could be related to selling more consoles than xbox possibly
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,with all due respect i see absolutely no reason astro bot has a goty nomination let alone half of the nominations it does
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,final fantasy vii rebirth? that also got a nomination
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"jesus, i did not realise uncharted 4 was that old now...still replay it once a year at this point!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i just want bloodborne on pc
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,tried to like bloodborne. i have the game on disc. couldn't get into it. the witcher is better. looks more beautiful too. bloodborne tries to hide graphic quality with darker environments. too me doesn't look as good graphically. but most importantly there is just more to do in the witcher. horizon games was awesome too. the ones i have played on ps4 that has frozen wilds expansion. i paid for the expansions for it separately.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"playstation really does know how to make amazing games, especially single player story games"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,at least half are mediocre
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they make the best single player games out there.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"just release bloodborne on pc sony, omfg you absolute clowns"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,of these i have only playing death stranding and can 100 recommend it for game of the decade andor game of the century.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"wow its almost like sony releases good games every year and it has that something to do with it! op  no, this is clearly sony paying money to have their games listed on nominee. there is no other way. it must be this"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,astrobot militaryclown.png
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,why is this notable to anyone? sony is a megacorporation that is also a game publisher. they arent the ones actually making the games. stop praising the suits and higherups and give credit to the game studios who actually worked on these wonderful projects.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,lots of those shouldnt have been nominated honestly
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,we all kno some of them don't deserve the spot but it's sony
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,and i wouldn't have voted for a single game on this list. shame.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"it's simple, a certain type of game tends to win these types of awards. same goes for the oscars, a certain type of film always gets best picture sony is publishing a lot of these types of games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"every single one of those games i don't give two shits about, reminds me why playstation since the ps4 era is dead to me. and i grew up adoring the ps1, ps2  ps3. i'm just expressing a personal opinion. i don't mean to shit on all the millions of people who like these games. it just got to a point where sony stopped making games that interested me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,xbox sucks
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,most of these games aren't very good frfr nocap.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,what worthless content. goty means nothing but marketing
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and they're all on pc expect astrobot and bloodborne....
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they make good games
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,death stranding  walking simulator.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i hate exclusives. no reason to have them. you are literally taking money away from yourself. consoles are sold at a loss.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"well when you have money and own a massive portion of the industry you're going to get benefits even if they're undeserved. i say this as someone who enjoys my playstation, but god damn do the stinkers they pump out get absurdly high reviews."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,major publisher has had a goty nominee every single year in the last decade
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,all sequels lmao
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,never played any of them
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,which is sad since many of them dosnt deserve it...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,so what? only one really good game  bloodborne
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,theres like maybe 3 games here at most that deserve it lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"hzd is mediocre at best, how is that goty worthy is beyond me"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"and yet they still want to triple down on live service bullshit. they were banking so hard on concord. how did so many people see that garbage and go yeah, a ton of people are gonna love this. all it took was one trailer for everyone to know it was a dud, but none of the people making it knew? or did they all know but didn't say anything because they'd get fired?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,astro bot is nice but i dont think its worthy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and they only won 2
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they absolutely didnt deserve one in 2023.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"games that are platform exclusive should not be nominated for game of the year. they def shouldn't win, at least."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"they didn't make these games, they published them. at least the few that i know of. fromsoft made bloodborne, for example."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,bg3 best gave ever
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"as a selfproclaimed sonypony since ps2, a bit worrying ive only played 2 of those games, being bloodborne and ghost of tsushima, although all of those games interest me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,helldivers 2 should be nominated.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"spider man 2, hfw and got don't deserve it, ratchet was a great game, idk if it is a goty candidate, the others are worthy."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,honestly hell divers should be on there too. butttt lets just go with the single player narrative.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"like give them a category where they can shine, but none of the games are truly addicting, which was what games use to be. i like these games too."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,2018 should've gone to red dead 2. absolutely ridiculous.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i really want to play astrobot but i'm 100 certain it will be a ps monthly or ps extra game at some point and don't want to buy it. i really wish sony would do more day one releases on big names like xbox does. psn is a decent value so i'll keep it, but waiting for shit to be added is annoying."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"my only objections are tlou ii  astro bot. because, why?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,nice to see the walking simulator got nominated death stranding
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,love all these games but you can also just see a downward trend in overall game originality and quality each year as well for their best game..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,crazy how oc players play the hzd or ratchet and clank and its all  okay games
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,returnal was not even nominated?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"just so everyone is aware, every single one of these games are also on pc."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,greatness is what that is.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they don't deserve to claim bloodborne
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,wtf is astro bot? playstation people are so weird man. tou can get an xbox with literally double the amount of games and the controller isnt designed for sangheili. like wake upppppp
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,seeing bloodborne pissed me off because it reminds me sony is about to own fromsoft
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,streak probably should have been broken in 2019 lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"bloodborne and death stranding are not playstation games, otherwise impressive."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,what the hell is astro bot?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,sony owns and pays the judges thousands of f dollars i don't give a s what their game wins. i love all those games though. but f they're b! like they're the only goddamn gaming console on the planet! why don't you go remaster another 5yearold game you f moops!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"how many won again? not being salty, just busy at work."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,not to mention rdr2
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,no returnal is insanity
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,the crack someone was smoking in 2016 to nominate uncharted a thiefs end for goty mustve been some good shit
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,2018 was such a good year for gaming
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i have almost all of them and never played them...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i liked the game, but spiderman 2 didnt deserve to be nominated"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,ghosts should have beat lou2. a story of a jin throwing away all honor and samurai tradition as they have showed to be a weakness kahn knew. to start fighting using stealth and less honorable means to defend there homeland over a story of basic revenge that doesn't solve anything
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,surely this isn't that notable? it's hardly surprising that a major games console has a nominee for game of the year every year. all that means is that the console is popular enough to have games developed for it which are good enough to be nominated for game of the year. i'm pretty certain the same is true for pc.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,to bad they are a shit company that scammed me out of 180 after their paper thin security got breached for the 10.000 thousands time.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i think this kinda shows that in some of these years, either the releases were not that impressive, or a sony game must always be nominated. like, you might have liked it, but it's ratchet and clankle that memorable in comparison with other titles in this list? i don't think so in all honesty."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,how many did win goty? i only remember god of war being a winner? not sure to be honest.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,bloodborne and spiderman are fantastic games but everything else seems pretty mediocre. astro bot looks like a nice little game but i wouldn't expect it to be groundbreaking.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,tbh no console exclusive title ever deserves to be goty
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"and for half the years, they deserved to have one"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,crazy how bloodborne is still the best on that list
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,how many of them won it ?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"ratchet being nominated in 2021 over returnal is so wrong...i'm happy astro is nominated this year, i just think rift apart was a forgettable platformer that overpromised and underdelivered"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,most of them are the same game with a different skin.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"and i'll never get to even try most of them since i won't go for a low effort, cash grab pc port. something getting goty or even being nominated for it used to mean being worth buying a console for, but that value has gone down and the games aren't getting better by enough to make up for it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,weak
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,honestly only a few of those i'd ever touch. but it's cool people get into these awards and think it means something
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"if they can pay for exclusives, they can pay for nominations. sony buys a head start to every race it enters, and still manages to lose most of them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,whos game of the year? culture crave? gaming awards? aunt beth?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,helldivers 2 is better than astro bot. but thats my 2 cents.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"great list, but spiderman 2 was riding on the coat tails of the first one"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"gonna be an unpopular opinion but horizon is one of sony's most overhyped just ok games of all time with no real reason being nominated. 2017 was really only between 3 games and they had pubg on the nominees to fill slots, 2022 was when elden ring released and you could argue they put half of the nominees that year also to just fill slots cause it was definitely between elden ring and god of war."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"isn't the goty just an industry price, where everyone is petting there own shoulders and say how great they are? also isn't the goty a pay to get nominated price?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"nominations don't mean much when you are one of the big 3 consoles and spend hundreds of millions per year pumping out aaa exclusives. if they weren't gonna get any nominations, they wouldn't be paying for those games to be made since if they aren't good enough to be nominated, they aren't good enough to sell to make up for the dev cost."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,game of the year according to whom?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"to be real, even though they're all good games, some of them were nominated only because playstation."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,so you're saying sony's list for games of the year is all sony games.... interesting.....
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"death stranding, nah. definitely not a goty"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"how are these even playstation games? most of these are on pc as well, and death strandings on xbox."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,but sony will ruin fromsoft!!!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,the only good game on this list is bloodbourne. the rest is the equivalent of oscar bait. pretty games with shit gameplay.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,almost only counts in horshoes and hand grenades. how many did they actually win?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,astro bot was great!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-05,what in the world is atro bot..?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"spiderman 2 doesn't deserve the nomination, game just automatically gets nomination if it sony at this point"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,lobbyists
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,astro bot making this list is a sign of things to come. goty quality games have just shifted to platformers designed to only be played for 30 minutes. gaming is officially dead as we know it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"you would hope so right? i mean, they're a massive share of the market."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"l these games look pretty...but they're boring. 95 of these games nowadays are boring to me. if a game can't hold my attention for years, it ain't my type of game. not for the prices they charge nowadays. i have a ps5 and still play the same games i bought on my ps4. i don't think i have a single ps5 exclusive game that i playenjoy more than the games i've been playing for 6 years"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,the fuck is astrobot?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,reminder.... they think astro bot on the same level as wu kong or elden ring... goty really means nothing
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,what about sekiro?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,dont let the xbox fanboys see this.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"playstation just doesn't miss. the worst game on this list is probably tlou 2 which is a damn great game, just has some questionable plot choices."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,how did uncharted 4 get nominated that game sucked. nevermind it's just the game awards.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"feels odd that i have not played any of them and none of them appeal to me, in the least, to warrant me playing them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,pussies allowing for dual winners in a year
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,cant get into horizon
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"horizon, gowspiderman horizongow, spiderman. what an eventful decade!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,looks like a downhill
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"this is a shame, because all these games are mid."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"if this is the list of their best games from each year, it's no wonder they're losing"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,couple of those didnt deserve to be nominated to be fair lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"just to five an honest opinion as an xbox player. none of these games would ever make me want a playstation. i've bought 2 play stations in my entire life, one to play grand theft auto 3 and one to play little big planet when it first came out. the games on this list aren't enough to make me purchase another."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,a thiefs end was sonys end.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,shame that 4 of the 9 years had the same ips.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"all this shows is that the nominee list is far too wide for things like horizon 2, rift apart was shockingly mediocre, death stranding, last of us part 2, and spiderman 2 to get the nods as goty. im not sure if there is a more disappointingly generic open world series than horizon. it's so close to being great, giant mech dinosaurs are cool, but holy hell that story and gameplay."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,how the hell did horizon get nominated?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,sony should make more multiplayer games
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i get people fanboys will celebrate this, but does anyone else feel like when they look at this list, astrobot while good just doesn't really stand up compared to the rest? like blood borne, god of war, spiderman, uncharted... such a feast. it's just strange to put astro bot next to ghost of tsushima, or death stranding, you know? it also feels this year's goty are a bit light. like no game is really bad, but it also feels like none of them would be in the list in any other year."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,it's almost as if industry awards are supporting the industry...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,really? death stranding? i felt like a ups delivery guy the whole game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"western gaming media has a strong bias to the type of games sony make, so not surprising."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,really? astro bot? i feel like goty should be somthing much bigger than that
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"hell yeah, two good games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i would argue that a few of those were undeserved tbh
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,hd2 is so much better than astro bot.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and none of them deserved goty. gow stole rdr2s win and tlou2 was a joke.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"sony's built up a good reputation of making great games but that reputation is at risk now with things like concord, requiring psn on steam, their focus on live service games etc"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,lots of sequels though
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,every console does d what bullshit marketing is this?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and its still has no game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i see 2. two worthy games. what the hell is this?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,meh conveyor belt games with marvel writing.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"playstation didn't have those nominations just because the games in question are exclusives. sony didn't make most of those games, third party developers did. credit where credit is due."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,you can really see the decline
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"bloodborne, good but not excellent. u4 meh! horizon meh! gow wokeshit!  spiderman meh! deathstranding good to meh! ratchet good to meh! horizon wokeshit!  gow wokeshit spiderman 2 good to meh! astro bot good but not excellent. i think thats the way!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,horizon is a cookiecutter ubisoft open world clone that holds itself back by trying to be everything it shouldn't be.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"you do realise that they have a fix spot on the list? they could release a total shitshow and they'd get nominated. that's how those awards work. i'm not saying that they don't deliver, but having a spot alone isn't that special."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and they had to reaaaaaallyyy stretch to get astro bot to fit
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,these awards are such a joke what even is astro bot and why would it be getting game of the year over something as epic as the other games on that list.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,wow..one of the big three consoles had a goty nominee? insanity
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,how is astrobot on there? is it actually a good game?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"the only games on thatt list that i consider worthy of goty aare bloodborne, god of war, death stranding, ghost of tsushima and astro bot."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"really good games on that list, but i have an unpopular opinion about game of the year. if the game isnt available on multiple platforms, then it shouldnt be considered for goty. if the majority of gamers cant play it, then the game is really just a best of insert system here to me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and more than half of them are mediocre at best. conclusion ? goty awards are fucking trash
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,well yeah they're on the committee that chooses which games get nominated lol.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,its a fucking 2hrs commercial. sony buys adds there and therefore gets awards and nominations.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,when ya bribe the award ceremony!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"some are these are surprising to see tbh. they must've been slow years. uncharted 4 really??, last of us part 2 remake remastered and remade again, and death stranding the walking simulator should never have been contenders lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"yes, we all know journalists have a playstation bias."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,horizon games are cheeks
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,horizon is such a generic game. it's only popular because the incels love the mc.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,what a shitty list of games... glad im a pc gamer.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"lets be real though, astro bot isnt going to win shit."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"wth is astro bot, and why is this my first time seeing anything about it?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"lol rc a goty... this game is a joke and for kids really. the fun, the humour and difficulty of the previous rc were gold, this rift apart is just bad..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,death stranding being nominated is a joke by itself
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,death stranding imo is the odd man out here. that game launched at the pinnacle of reedus and kojima fanboyism. i will die on the hill that game is not good.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,guess what? so did pc
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"...? ......? .................huh? this is supposed to be content? this is engaging content someone thought to share on reddit?...as if there was some controversy gripping rgaming as to whether the hundredsofbillionsdollars media giant sony, had defied all odds and managed to reach the dizzying heights of scoring a nomination for checks notes the unironicparodyofitselfgamingcirclejerk that is goty? how can the gaming zeitgeist ever possibly recover from this tumultuous upheaval of any and all expectations?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,playstation has had a goty nominee every single year in the last decade be a surprise if they didn't with that may ips.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,k
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"as a massive ratchet and clank fan, i don't understand how ra was nominated for goty. it's objectively gorgeous and a fun game overall, but it's painfully easy compared to past entries, even on hard mode, and i was really disappointed by how short it was. why are you booing me? i'm right lmao"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,so the demo that got some dlc was the best they could do
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,ok
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"game of the year is a generic term, they are hundreds of goty each year so no surprise sony is nominated each years, unless it's for a specific ceremony?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,except death stranding isn't sony production and they don't have any rights. they only published it for certain time before it went multiplatform
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i have played 0 of these and have almost no desire to play any of them. edit wrong, ghosts of tsushima was excellent."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,shouldn't there only be one game of the year for each year? seems weird that god of war has to share
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,we were all lost to the pandemic era.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,fr wtf?! is there gonna be another one? im not up to date about rc stuff
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i just picked it up on the steam sale since i don't have a ps5. wow, it's good."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i'm on the pc timeline so only 2023 for me
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"this is the second recent one, the other came out around 2016"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"hi there, i tried to make a post but it got deleted saying i need karma? i'm not sure what that is but i would really appreciate someone helping me out by answering a question. i'm trying to find games for my 21 year old grandson who is getting a ps5 for christmas, and the man at best buy tried to sell me a blue paper card that had a yellow plus on it for 100. i'll be honest, i'm in my 70s and i'm not sure if he was trying to scam me or not. was that real money for the ps5 or fake? please help whenever you can, thank you so much!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,why deal with the toxicity of people when you can have an enjoyable experience
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,except overwatch only sp games have won the award
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,not only that but they're all thirdperson games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i mean single player games are much more likely to win goty regardless, and multiplayer games are more often than not going to benefit from being cross platform not exclusive. the big 3s major ips are all single player focused, even halo and gears are usually touted for their single player campaigns over their multiplayer."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,why is this a noteworthy question? the ps barely even gets multiplayer games that aren't crossplatform to start with
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,sony publicly announced that singleplayer is their focus since the ps4 era. makes sense they are recognised for what they focus on.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"funny enough, i think of multiplayer and single player games as completely different media, and i often immediately associate something like game of the year or greatest of all time with single player games. i love multiplayer, but to me its like comparing a sport to a book not really compatible"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i mean, this is also a brand new reddit account go for easy karma farming posts so i wouldn't give it too much attention."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"nope, it is not a coincidence. single player exclusives move consoles. i was thinking about getting an xbox but i can just wait till spring to play indiana jones so no more xbox console for me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"not that sony makes many multiplayer games in the first place, aside for their yearly mlb title and occasionally some others they do also publish mp games every now and then, such as helldivers 2 this year."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"sony pictures understands movies, and their playstation division understands games. together they help make some banger stories and adventures. i'm a pc gamer, and i will gladly admit ps is probably one of the best gaming studios and will probably buy a ps5 just for gta6.gta games hit pc 23 years later sony has an exclusive marketing deal with rockstar games, and also looking to acquire the fromsoft studios."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,no. single player games are just better
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,console exclusive multiplayer games are rare nowadays. people usually expect multiplayer games to be live service too. you cant do that and limit your player base
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"probably also the same reason i'm interested in gaming for the first time since the early aughts. i dont want to have to keep a schedule like a job to be able to keep up and compete, that shits not fun. im so glad single player games are coming back to be the norm. now if only i could get some couch coop games to play with the kids."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,really fond memories of bloodborne multiplayer.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,the best experiences are single story games. online is nothing but toxicity.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,does ps even have an exclusive prominent online multiplayer game?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,or that they are mainly first party games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"you could consider 2 of them multiplayer games that promote healthy gaming habits. i mean, with bloodborne and death stranding, you definitely benefit from playing with the multiplayer element of them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,probably not. most of the voting party probably cant play multiplayer games at peak due to that being after the review embargo is over.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"rhetorical or not sony has gone away from multiplayer games they used to have a stable of them just for shooters they had socom, killzone and the resistance games. they seem to have 0 interest in these games anymore , the concord disaster wont help things but thats on them just poorly developed. socom was and still is my favorite shooter of all time but they screwed that series up too and have buried it since."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and how many multiplayer only games sony released over the past 9 years?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,what was the last multiplayer game of the year? overwatch?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,bloodborne?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,2015 was five years ago!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"helldivers deserved a nom this year over astro, imo. i love both, but helldivers is a game that will actually influence the industry moving forward, the ones nominated are just the most popular games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and all are jump and runs with different skins
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"multiplayer games are more prone to ongoing and changing player responses, especially as changes to the game come by the way of patches and updates that can affect how players view the game. i remember earlier this year people saying that helldivers 2 should be up for consideration when it first launched but sentiments around the title seems to have shifted ever enough since then that it wouldnt be as considerable now."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,i think not!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-07,this!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-16,"my best guess is that, they can focus more on the single player experience meaning they wont spend time on multiplayer functions, wifi problems such as the common grounds on multiplayer games, with those servers being up and ready, the resolution would be much more accesible to the players meaning they could make the gameplay as beautiful as possible."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,its not a coincidence. they barely make multiplayer games. so stop.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"praise phillydillydee, well said"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,bruh multiplayer is already dead. no need to kick the horse further
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and then ea shows up  singleplayer games are dead
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and ea wants us to believe its dead
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"they are story based games but a few of them aren't single player bloodborne, death stranding, ghots of tsushima."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i still wish for a 5, but i understand that they can't just keep coming up with these massive lost cities that somehow were never found in the modern world"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,uc2 still unparalleled imo
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,what really sucks is it has a fun multiplayer mode.... that you can't play on pc  it's a great game with a fun mp mode locked to ps4 only ps5 has to run the ps4 version to play so you are also stuck on 30fps.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,grant us eyes!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"it seems like the more we ask for it, the more sonyfrom software wanna starve us"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"between how much fans are clamboring for it and how reticent the higher ups are to even acknowledge that it exists, i honestly think that there's something actually wrong with bloodborne. like, they lost the source code, or the ghost of kentaro miura is threatening to sue miyazaki for copyright infringement or something, and they only recently started making headway on solving the problem."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,the fact that fromsoft has the same number as bethesda and capcom is pretty remarkable.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,that simple list took a lot of work.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"this requirement wouldve been limited to only the largest publishers. who else can fund the production of many high quality games in a year? also, who publishes the title would have less to do with quality than who created the game. is this criteria resulting in a list that is more about size or quality? are they the best of the big publishers or the best publishers?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-05,if supergiant gets another nom with hades 2 i would guess they will based off the ea it would be kind of wild to see them tied with the likes of blizzard and square.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"if i remember, god of war won 2018 and tlou2 in 2020. that is it from this list i think."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"quick rundown of the goty category of the game awards in this time frame. 2015  witcher 3 over bloodborne, fallout 4, mgs v, and super mario maker 2016  overwatch over inside, doom, titanfall 2, and uncharted 4 2017  lozbotw over horizon, pubg, mario odyssey, and persona 5 2018  gow over assassin's creed odyssey, celeste, spiderman, monster hunter world, and rdr2 2019  sekiro over control, death stranding, the outer worlds, re2 remake, and smash ultimate 2020  tlou 2 over animal crossing, deem eternal, ff7 remake, ghosts of tsushima, and hades 2021  it takes two over metroid dread, deathloop, psychonaughts 2, ratchet and clank, and re village 2022  elden ring over a plague tale requiem, gow ragnarok, horizon fw, stray, and xenoblade chronicles 3 2023  baldurs gate 3 over alan wake 2, loz totk, spiderman 2, re4 remake, mario wonder"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,just did a quick search god of war 2018 and tlou2 are both winners
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"at tga? only a few. but overall gotys they win more often. like uncharted 4 had the most gotys tracked in 2016, but overwatch won at tga. death stranding had the most in 2019 but lost at tga. i'm still shocked that horizon 1 finished 2nd in 2017 behind botw obviously in overall gotys. it finished ahead of mario odyssey even."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,horizon had the misfortune of going up against breath of the wild.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"oh man, socom was so good."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,some of those old ones are so funny. like wow didnt get a single nomination in any category in 2004 or 2008. madden 04 beat kotor. cod 4 didnt even get a nomination for goty. as stacked as 2007 was and there was only 3 nominations to begin with.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,well this post seems to be about goty from tga. i don't think there were tga goty awards before 2015.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"uc2 being the one that won it is kind of wild imo, and maybe im looking at it through 2009 lenses but for as much as i love uc2 i think arkham asylum was a far better game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"idk about that, spiderman 2 felt like a step down from the first one. i liked it alright, but i was a little disappointed as a followup to sm1."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"not when some are taking up space where much better games could be included. the outer worlds being there in a year that gave us outer wilds and disco elysium is crazy. another example. nominating deathloop when you had games like hitman 3 and inscryption. then you've got cookie cutter open world games like odyssey, horizon, tsushima etc. games that have great elements in them but the lack of creativity in their open world design is very apparent. so not games that really stand out enough to be one of the best of that year"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"eh uncharted4, horizon fw, and ragnarok don't really deserve it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"please pull your head out of your ass, or at least develop better taste."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and now they're competing for goty with a childfriendly robot whose purpose is to make players experience all of the playstation's features. no kidding. and from what i've played of it so far astros bot is fantastic. it reminds me of the old mario galaxy games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i've only owned a ps4 and ps5 but i have zero regrets. i've had some of the best gaming experiences i've ever had on those two consoles. i have limited time to game so i'll take one good single player experience a year over endless multiplayer.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i just miss the ps3 days when they were more wild and experimental
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,bloodborne on pc.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,now if xbox could manage to step up their game. because at this point they are looking more like late 90s sega. which isnt a good sign. we need at least 3 big consoles. especially since 2 of them are dominated by 1 country.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,naughty dog hasn't released a new game in 5 years.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,to me it's now that i'd rather play their big games on pc and knowing i'll get them eventually means i won't get a ps5. they have blockbuster exclusives but the thing is this list basically is all their notable exclusives for the last 10 years. i can't justify buying a 500700 dollar system for that few big exclusives. also this spans 2 generations of consoles.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i agree. the first console i ever bought with my own money was a playstation 2 with gran turismo 3 and ive never looked back. nintendo nes was my first actual console  bought by my parents, of course. i cannot say the same for them. they have declined so much."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they had a definite slump during the very early ps3 era but theyd recovered from that by 2009. and tbh it was more of a hardware pricing issue than bad games
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,as a pc gamer. i always buy the latest generation of playstation. it becomes my media hub in the living room but also means i don't wait or miss out on some genuinely fantastic first party titles. astros playroom and more recently astro bot is an incredible casual game for me or anyone who comes round to just mess around with while having fooddrinks. takes me back to super mario days of pick up  put down casual gaming.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i will be bitchin until i get bloodborne 2, bloodborne remake, or at the very least bloodborne remaster  pc release."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"sony kills it when it comes to their games. their quality standardsdemands are up there but it leads to games like these time and time again. this is why i thought it was so odd when this sub and the fromsoftware sub had a meltdown at the prospect of sony obtaining fromsoftware, people were genuinely acting like it was ea obtaining them and that they were now doomed."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i think people want a bit more variety in the portfolio as well as more games that put gameplay first. and some smaller budget but more creative stuff like shadow of the colossus was back in the ps2 days. i think tbh they should do a different genre than third person action more. like astro bot i'd love to see them do a single player fps or a western rpg
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"aloy is the most forced fucking godawful character a games company has produced. i platinumed hzd and i did not touch hfw. i am tired of seeing this stupid red head everywhere like she fucking earned it, she did not, sony is just desperate for another game mascot."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"ps3 era was dominated by xbox 360. xbox had more exclusives and they were more successful, with the exception of uncharted and last of us which was at the end of the lifecycle. i dont think anyone would take killzone over halo for example"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,3 stellar spiderman games8
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"real talk does anyone here actually think that sony doesn't deliver or something? to me sony hasn't delivered in a long time. ps4 was meh. but ps5's catalogue us downright embarassing when it comes to exclusives. even flops like the sega saturn had more exclusives than the ps5, by several hundreds of differences. their hardware experimentation is going after what others have done before. as far as i'm concerned, there's only one console developer called nintendo, with sonyms making pclites."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,microsoft has really gone down hill but besides that id agree
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"if you were following basically every gaming sub while microsoft was buying up every major publisher, then you would see that a huge number of people think sony only cheats. none of these titles were a case of being bought by sony and removed from other platforms."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"ha everyone, look at this nintenerd with his wholesome opinions. nerd!!!!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"hey there, i think their games are mostly same repeated mediocrity, 3rd person action adventure with mostly meh story, whatever gameplay and games mostly focused on being movies not games"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"sony doesn't make games the same way nintendo does. they're a publishing company, first and foremost. insomniac is the 3rd party team behind spiderman. also, you really should check out more indie games. the switch has a ton of them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"first of all, 2024  massive failure for sony. not one single game they made this year besides what, astro bot? no one cares. concord  massive failure. helldivers 2  not made by sony, not exclusive, not good. second, sony literally only had 1 or 2 first party exclusives during ps1 era  gran turismo and what, twisted metal? there weren't many impressive sony games then and even ps2 barely had first party games. sony bought all the developers who made their ps2 exclusives, after or during the ps2 era. sony didn't make spiderman. insomniac did. sony acquired insomniac after they made spiderman 2018. like 45 of sony's games were made by insomniac and that's not including all the other third party exclusive games from developers they eventually bought like naughty dog. third, nothing here is competing with anything. it's not a real competition. it's industry shills deciding which stupid, overrated aaa production is their favorite. there are countless better games with actual gameplay available. i would play something like factorio, hollow knight and 2000 others long before i'd worry about a generic third person action adventure game with platforming and other elements, which is all sony is capable of making anymore. good on them. they're a shithole company that has done their best to strangle the gaming industry, no different than nintendo and ms."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,mostly just the console warriors and the anti woke idiots. reasonable people who play games as a hobby and dont make it their entire ideology recognize that sony mostly makes quality games that are fun to play
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"as a non single player video game fan i'd say that sony doesnt deliver. on a personal level. the only game i really give a shit about from this list is bloodborne and it's not a first party game. i wouldnt want to play the other games even if i could get them for free right now. well i should clarify. i do like single player games, in fact most games i play are single player. but not single player stories or campaigns. roguelikes and strategy games sure. returnal is the only sony game i care about in recent years."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-06,in 2009 they had uncharted 2. it was the winner that year too.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"everyone knows goty is a circlejerk until it validates your opinion, then it's a flawless and objective judgement of quality"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"not only that but they're just not interesting games for the most part. or they're sequels, or cousins of other games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,how many goty editions does it take for people to notice?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"matpat has a good video about goty bias. basically it's all old dudes deciding the games so the picks are all cinematic dad games, which is exactly the type of game sony makes."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they celebrate the developers too lmao. they litterally bring them up on stage and are personally handed the award every year
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,shoutout to microsoft's hifi rush for being nominated in other categories
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"per the psychonauts 2 docu though, ms buying double fine absolutely expanded the resources available for the game. it was only as good as it was because ms helped out, they definitely deserve the credit on that one."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"nintendo doesn't have one this year either, do they?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,xbox had forza horizon 5 and flight simulator in 2020 which were two of the highest rated games released that year and neither got a goty nomination because they're from niche genres.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i mean from this list nowadays the only exclusives are bloodborne and astrobot arent they?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"forza horizon 5 was the single highest rated game of 2021. ori will of the wisps wasn't nominated with no explanation given but presumed because it was too small with a 90 metacritic, same for ori and the blind forest with an 88, but stray was nominated with an 83. gears 5 84 and halo infinite 87 were not nominated, but death stranding 82 and ghost of tsushima 83 were nominated. there was no chance an xbox exclusive was ever going to get nominated at a show where the dorito pope chooses selection panel."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,whose game of the year is this? dont a ton of places release their versions? is there one that is definitive?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,deathloop was exclusive to ps5 for that year it wasn't. deathloop was a multiplatform release pc  ps5 in september 2021.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i still think we need to take a step back and appreciate microsoft once had a goty that was exclusive to playstation 5. this timeline is weird, man."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,do be fair regarding your last sentence they don't make any console only exclusives anymore.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,nintendo also missed this year.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"death stranding probably shouldn't count as it's not sony exclusive, and isn't just published by sony."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,removed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,probably the geoff keighley show featuring geoff keighley and geoff keighley. but he did do a great job at making his awards show the definitive one also thanks to the name.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"the game awards, the by far biggest award type thing we have had going for the last 5 years? at least that's what i assumed because its the obvious one"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"agreed, seems like this is to just fill the vacuum left by no e3. these are just to drum up hype for whatever is next."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"it sort of replaced e3, so yeah, their awards seem to matter more to people now for some reason. i don't see any value in it, though it is nice when good developers like larian get their spotlight."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"an industry controlled by two companies might not technically be a monopoly, but it's certainly not healthy. the concerns about industry consolidation are a lot deeper than just the fanboy console wars."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,it was until recently.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,none of which are made by valve. edit downvote all you want. doesnt change facts.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,it's from the specific and prestigious goty award known as the game awards aka the geoff keighley show featuring geoff keighley
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,god of war and the last of us part ii
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"not really because bloodborne isn't just made on ps4, it's a sony intellectual property it's not just a game that fromsoft made on playstation, it's a sony game that fromsoft made for playstation same deal as demon's souls, fromsoft doesn't own either of those games' trademarks"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they are listing sony published games. rebirth is from square enix as usual for the franchise.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"bloodborne like demon's souls are sony ips... sony didn't even want to release demon's souls in the west which is why it was published by atlus in the americas and namco in the europe. they did similar shit with earlier ps ips like devil dicebombastic xi  xi go for the ps12. sometimes they fund and cocreate great things and lock them in the closet until another publisher recognizes its worth and brings it out for the people to enjoy. sonys play with final fantasy and a lot of other 3rd party ips is the opposite, they throw some cash at the publisher in terms of marketing or lower license fees for the privilege of not releasing the content on other platforms. they have no ownership there just a fuck you contract to owners of other platforms."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"this is just first party stuff or else youd be seeing ff7, black myth, and alot of other exclusives here."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"in that same vein, should death stranding even be on that list as a sony nominee? kojima productions is an independent studio and ds is now on xbox."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,calling uncharted niche is wild. it sold 15 million copies.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"did you play rift apart? it was an excellent game. i'm not sure how you could call uncharted niche in any way, it's a third person shooter with puzzles. crystal dynamics made an entire trilogy of lara croft games, which the first two were great, almost based entirely around the same gameplay aspects. metaphor refantazio is nominated for goty and is about as niche a game as you could get. a lot of the categories are for specific genres too, do you want it to just be 16 awards for indie games? what are you even complaining about?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and spiderman 2 was completely mediocre.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"dude you bought and played most of these twice, and liked them enough to state you will be buying unreleased and unannounced future games, but they're not good? lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"sonys japan studio approached fromsoftware for a new game, it was a cooperative development."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,seems like they're just stating facts. like the fact that xbox hasn't dropped a game that's been nominated for like a decade
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,thats what she said
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they owned the ip until just this year when kojima bought out his contract. i do agree it's kind of a grey area where more 3rd party though.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,it was funded by sony.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"it was a playstation exclusive at launch, but was made by an independent team and has since come to pc and xbox."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"it's only referring to the game awards, which is generally the award show people mean when they don't reference a specific one."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,astrobot and metaphor refantazio are the best reviewed games this year and share the highest metacritic score of 94. no other game this year scored above 93
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,guess they werent good enough? i dont get the point of down casting games cause my favorite didnt make it. hell i didnt play balatro but with the way ppl spoke about it all year i aint gonna say it doesnt deserve it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"making consistent bangers for a whole decade and winning multiple goty awards isnt some mundane accomplishment, its the epitome of consistency"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,it's a platformer like super mario galaxy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,same. not heard anything about it until i saw it was a nominee. thought it was one of those free demo things you get with sony and really didn't know what it was doing there
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,1st 3d platformer outside of nintendo to really hit the quality of mario imo
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"meh, not really"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"nah, both those games are fantastic, and that's coming from someone who never played a previous ratchet game or astrobot game until these ones. they're both so well polished and pure fun to play."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i didn't enjoy god of war. i skipped out on astro bot
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,they definitely putting money in someones pocket
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,god of war won that year. and i believe tlos2 as well
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,the game awards hasn't been going since 1994 though.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"out of about 14k games released each year, a list of 10 games is pretty short."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,this list is just sony owned ip nominees.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,youre not alone. couldnt care less about a single one of these titles
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,ip wasn't owned by playstation at the time of releaseit's why death stranding is on this list ff7r is a square enix game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,which one?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"i quite enjoyed bloodborne, tlous2, and uncharted 4. rift apart was quite fun, tho the game was a bit light."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"bloodborne maybe, but you are right about the others."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"there have been many winners and nominees that aren't cinematic and graphics heavy tho. but yes, sony does make a lot of cinematic heavy games. from that list tho, bloodborne and astrobot are very different from the rest."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,what games do u like?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,hey if you want to play on pc thats perfectly fine!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,who cares
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"with thier new timed exclusivity policy, it's probably a matter of time before astro bot comes to pc. no comment on the other one though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"there are several very valid and legitimate reasons to dislike the game or find it boring, but calling it walking simulator  ''i didn't play the game and i'm not basing my opinion on what the game actually offers''. it's more of a logistics planning game like eurotruck simulator but in the apocalypse, with horror touches, tons of unlockable futuristic devices to tame the terrain and optimize your deliveries, an innovative asynchronous multiplayer system, and fights against bandits, terrorists, antimatter ghosts, lovecraftian tar monsters and sometimes skeleton soldiers revived from the world wars."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,exclusives are the reason that sony is dominating the console market. seems like a pretty good reason to me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"there is a business reason to have them. say i wanted spiderman, id have to buy a playstation when it released. and now that i have a playstation, what am i also going to buy? the other exclusives. sony continues to get a cut from software because you now are in their ecosystem. you dont have an incentive to buy all of their games if youre not invested into the hardware to play them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,exclusives allow for games to be developed faster and better. having to optimize for a particular set of hardware is a huge advantage in that process. it should allow for better games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i think as a publisher, sony is the best in terms of the quality of games that come from them and their owned studios. if they released their games to all platforms, they would sell so many games, it wouldn't matter about playstation or not. people who like playing on consoles will still buy them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"well when you have money and own a massive portion of the industry this reminds more of microsoft xbox, do you know the 75 billion dollar activision acquisition is the biggest gaming acquisition of all time and the only comparable acquisition in the entire entertainment industry was disney buying fox in 2019. xbox has more dev studios than playstation and nintendo combined."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,ms is proof owning the market and having all the money don't mean shit if you have 0 talent.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i would love to hear what you find good games then with ur incredible and divine taste.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"you say that like it should be expected, but no other publisher has achieved that not even nintendo"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"platform exclusive? most of these are on pc now, just still owned by sony."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,sony owns the vast majority of the studios that made the games though.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"bloodborne was made in collaboration between sony japan studio and fromsoft. sony also owns the ip. guerrilla gamessony studio helped with death stranding, it was also developed using their engine. sony owned the ip, but they transferred the rights to kojima this year. all the other games came from their own studios"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"santa monica studios god of war, naughty dog uncharted, the last of us, team asobi astro bot, insomniac games ratchet and clank, spiderman, guerilla games horizon, killzone all fall under playstation studios. so yeah, sony made most of these games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,bloodborne and death stranding are the only 2 where sony had no say. all other games are made by children studios of ps.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,literally every game listed here expect for bloodborne is from a playstation studio
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"largest console in the world paid to have good exclusives that mostly didn't win goty isn't as good a headline, i suppose."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"death stranding is more like eurotruck simulator but in the apocalypse, with horror touches, realistic traversal and management mechanics that no other game has, tons of unlockable features, tools, weapons, exoskeletons, vehicles, accesories and infrastructure types to optimize your deliveries, fights against bandits, terrorists, antimatter ghosts, lovecraftian tar monsters and skeleton soldiers revived from the world wars, and an asynchronous multiplayer system in which players collaborate with each other by leaving ladders or climbing anchors, building bridges, roads, safehouses, watchtowers, recharging points, ziplines, donating gear and materials, signaling dangers and points of interest, returning lost cargo, even during boss fights another player's character can emerge from the ground to give you weapons and healing items."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,if that was the case why is balatro nominated this year lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,journs and shills
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,not sonys list. the game awards.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"have you played it? it has 92 positive user reviews on steam, the majority of people who actually played it enjoyed it, that's why it's getting a sequel. obviously there are seas of people who don't like it, some for very legitimate and valid reasons but many others just for prejudices and absurdly reductionist memes that don't even correctly portray what the game has to offer."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-05,one of the highest ranked games of all time.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,these are nominees not winners.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i think they are referring to nominations
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"nintendo had both botw and mario odyssey nominated for goty in 2017. if the company delivered, they should be rewarded  beside, every year sony had 2 games nominated, both were great games."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,there damm well better be. or at least make the old games playable natively. my internet sucks and i cant effectively stream them. and the less said about trying to emulate them on pc. the better.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,the devs put out spiderman 2 after but i think the leak showed that the devs are basically gonna be a marvel studio for the next decade
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i played both so my timeline is all sorts of confused. the ps version feels more recent and the pc version feels like it's been longer.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"also, multiplayer games only have a shelf life of a few years until the player base moves on to the next call of duty. the game of the year award typically goes to something more timeless that can be played again in a few years. so you can actually play the goty 2014."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,100 i just recently started playing wow again after almost 10 years i know... only because they've finally introduced actual singleplayer end game content. you can run regular dungeons with a team of npc's or do delves by yourself or with a single friend. it's so much more enjoyable when you don't have to play with a group full of tryhards that exist purely to shit on people that don't spend every waking moment minmaxing their characters and playstyles.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"man but that is part of the fun of playing online games listening to hateful morans talk utter nonsense is always a good laugh. don't let some 13yearold call of duty shitter ruin games for you. that means the troll has won, well in their eyes."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i love toxicity, i don't take it too seriously."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,worked for overwatch year 1 !!!!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"yeah, i almost divorced my wife playing overcooked and it takes two. back to single player for me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,ok but i like my coop 14 player games. and i think more single player games should add the option like halo to play with friends.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"chuckles in the last of us 2. i hated it, but the insanity on the pro vs against is over the top."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,when you can enjoy your own toxicity.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,why deal with the toxicity of people when you can use it to balance game like yugioh did.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"this. not only can they make really fun single player games, i do t have to listen to some 12 year old screaming horribly offensive words for ten minutes straight."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,this is why i stuck with nintendo. single player and local coop for the win.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"sir, we are on reddit."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,it's not like they're not desperately trying to capture the multiplayer scene
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,not just that but a pause button goes a long way
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,ea singleplayer games are dead
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,true fucking story.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"after a decade of dota 2  csgo around a combined 12k hrs i thought i was getting tired of gaming. quit online games, started sekiro, hzd, hollow knight, hades, etc and realized i still loved gaming very much, i was just completely done with the toxicity of esports titles. i've exclusively played single player games since 2022 and it's been the most fun i've had since discovering diablo 2 as a kid not knowing shit but having fun. recently played an online game for around 34 weeks and deadlock was fun as hell but i'm already done with it and back to single player games lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they should stop making every multiplayer game an mmo. maybe i just want to play a single player game but with a friend.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,imagine having to pay extra to enjoy the toxicity of people
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"that's where i've been lately, for the most part. wow classic refresh has been reminding me why."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-06,because multiplayer games are just more fun and challenging tbh
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,you can also have friends.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and even overwatch winning came with lots of criticism as overwatch didn't have the most nominations that year but won anyway.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,it takes two ?!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,baldur's gate 3 has a very robust multiplayer including splitscreen but it's not competitive multiplayer if that's what you mean.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"there was also it takes two, that wasnt single player"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,it takes two and baldurs gate 3
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,true
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"also most reviewers can only spend relatively little time per game, leading to easier story driven games getting higher scores."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,even halo and gears are usually touted for their single player campaigns over their multiplayer. in halo's heyday i would very much disagree with this. the single player campaigns were fantastic for sure...but that is absolutely not why most people bought it or what most people were talking about during halo 13 or even beyond. you can laud the single player experience while still recognizing the majority of its buzz was due to the multiplayer.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"yeah, i mean, wtf would playstation have on there? they don't make multiplayer games often. the only ones in recent time i can think of is concord and helldivers."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,because some random exec once said that it's better to focus on multiplayer than singleplayer and reddit gamers felt so insulted they can't let it go years later
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,concord
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"in 2023 they publicly announced their focus would be live service multiplayer games httpswww.polygon.com22914172sonyplaystationbungieacquisitionnewliveservicegames they planned to launch 12 live service in like 3 years. ryan adds the way people play games has changed a lot over the last few years. we have created some wonderful properties over the course of the last 25 years, with characters that people love and resonate the world over. offering the opportunity to enjoy those experiences in a completely different way is something that we are very excited about. httpswww.gamesindustry.bizplaystationbungiewillconsiderablyaccelerateourjourneywithmultiplatformliveservicegames"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"single player exclusives move consoles. probably true, but consoles are usually sold at cost or even cheaper, so moving more of them isn't worth much. there's a reason playstation titles are going crossplatform and xbox is abandoning the idea of a distinct console."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i mean honestly xboxs first upcoming first party output looks really good imo. i know the general consensus is that their finished and all their games are going multiplatform, but until it actually starts happening en masse i still think its pretty worth it to support what they got. i mean, other then gears eday and state of decay 3 and even then both start out as single player games, a lot of their first party exclusives are single player. with at least avowed, south of midnight, and fable confirmed for this year, with other stuff like perfect dark, clockwork revolution, outer worlds 2, od etc. maybe im just being a dumb fanboy, idk but i personally think theres plenty to be excited for."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"agree. look how many units nintendo moves because of the new zelda, mario, pokemon, or other mainline series release. on the other hand, xbox has always wanted to compete in the multiplayer arena. i personally stick with playstation because i prefer single player, storydriven games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"sony pictures understands movies, do they? madam web is a flop and just 7 years ago sony was very close to selling off their studio division after like 8 flops in a row. let's not act like theyre a blue chip studio pushing out hit after hit."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i'm on my 2nd, very long, playthrough of red dead redemption 2. the first playthrough was on the ps4. i've never been able to really get into the gta games, though i did try and totally get why people like it. if rockstar can make even 1 game every 2 years on the same level as rdr2 or gta  i feel comforted in knowing that there will be something really immersive waiting when i'm ready. rdr2 on the ps5 looks incredible, too. as far as i'm aware there's no ps5 specific patches for it either."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,it's the other way around. kadokawa fromsoft parent is facing a hostile takeover from a chinese company and went to sony to get ahead of it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"the people behind morbius, madame web and venom does not understands movies thoo."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,they don't have a deal with rockstar. the game is also coming out on xbox. going with consoles first was the devs choice
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,you say that but people play multiplayer games way more. people that have friends at least.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"while i love the series and would love another go at it, i dont want a 5. nates story is done and they wrapped it up in such a fantastic way i hope they leave it be. they can still do more uncharted games, but not with nate and the rest of the crew."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,4 is close because the story and gameplay are better. but that uncharted 2 pacing is just unmatched
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"yeah the spectacle might have gotten a little too grand imo. but 2 was the perfect upgrade to 1, which was fine but nothing special. the set pieces, solid gameplay and awesome mp, and extras like playing with 0 gravity or fat drake lol was so fun. plus, the graphics looked so insane back in the ps3 days."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"im pretty sure multiplayer is 60fps on the ps4 version, only single player is 30fps."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,classic naughty dog. they did the same thing with the last of us.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,just sony. they're big fans of buying ips and then sitting on them.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"surprised gow beat rdr2. but from what i recall sony and nintendo just time their releases to not get in each other's way. like the year before this breath of the wild and mario odyssey released, and the year after was smash bros ultimate."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"funny, those are two times sony had 2 nominees. personally i would have picked spiderman and ghost of tsushima over those but that's just personal preference."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,2015 was such a good year.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"2017 was an insane year and they didn't even nominate xenoblade chronicles 2 which could've easily been in the list. 2023, also an insane year. so many great games that didn't make the list but could've."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,tbh you could play any game listed there and have a good time
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"bloodborne, uncharted 4, and ghost of tsushima were robbed blind holy shit"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,2020 was some bullshit goddamn
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"my assessment that nobody asked for 2015 bloodborne robbed 2016 doom robbed, inside would have been acceptable too. 2017 i'd have picked p5 but i can't say robbed here botw definitely earned its place. and odyssey honestly would have been a fair pick too, year was kinda stacked. 2018 my pick would have been mh world, or maybe celeste, but i can't really find fault in giving it to gow. 2019 control sadly had to go up against sekiro, wish it could have gotten a goty but... sekiro was the correct pick. 2020 what the actual fuck. in a year that stacked you pick the only incorrect option. everyone was robbed. 2021 i'm.... actually not familiar with this year it seems, i'd have picked metroid but only because idk about the rest. 2022 man stray and plague tale were so good but... yeah elden ring. unfortunate for those two they had to fight er for the crown. ragnarok was also worth a shout but i think it was against a lot more and higher quality competition than gow 2018. 2023 super stacked year... but it doesn't matter because bg3 is in the list, a game that could have won any year on this list with ease."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,was it controversial that bg3 won instead of totk? i can't recall the discourse last year.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"just looking at which ones could have been reasonable choices as winners 2015  witcher 3 or bloodborne 2016  only overwatch 2017  only breath of the wild, though horizon zero dawn or mario odyssey could be winners in another year 2018  god of war or red dear redemption 2, even though celeste is a perfect game 2019  only sekiro except maaaybe smash ultimate if you squint 2020  the last of us 2 or ghosts of tsushima or hades what a year 2021  i guess it takes two but jeeze 2022  only elden ring 2023  only baldurs gate 3"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"cyberpunk not even nominated in 2021 was a joke. tga are such a safe, dull show. before it was broken on ps4! hello broken ass bg3 that just got finished this year."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"yeah, the horizon series has a track record of releasing extremely close to the biggest and most hyped game of the year. i love the horizon series and feel fully confident that horizon 3 will be released the same day as a surprise collaboration between fromsoftware and nintendo for their game zelda link to the erd tree, written by a resurrected tolkien."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,even if it was a step down i would still list it as one of the best games of the year.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i quit playing it and i really wanted to get all the costumes and 100 it. it was so bad is so many different ways.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i don't think spiderman 1 even deserves to be nominated, other than the web swinging which isn't even new everything about the gameplay was pretty generic."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"ps2 was the actual innovation era. ps3 was the beginning of the modern triple a market. further, ps3 actively inhibited developers because of its much more arcane and closed requirements. hence why we have never had a port of metal gear solid 4 unlike the first three ps2 games, because it was designed to work with ps3 hardware and that made porting it a massive headache. compare the ease of transition for example from ps4 to ps5 generally smooth frontports, compared to ps3 to ps4 needed its own emulation service."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i really miss mag. id like to see it done again in some form.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"as much as id like to see microsoft step it back up to their glory days of the 360 era, i just dont see it. theyve had multiple chances to catch back up and reclaim a foothold by acquiring multiple studios, only to close them afterwards, and every time they try to bring a classic franchise back to prominence halo infinite, or introduce a new one starfield, it seems like they take one confident step forward, and if theyre lucky only one step back."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"meh, i own all the consoles and still spend a lot of time on my sx. gamepass is the best gaming deal available today. nintendo and sony digital prices are ridiculous and whilst ps is better than it was it still lacks a lot of exclusives sadly which is all i want from it. plus a few decent gems over the last few years from ms backed studios too imo. just because they aren't console exclusives people dismiss them. people always apply the wrong metric which is sales, without realising that microsoft still move a ton of units given they have always predominantly struggled in the east and sonynintendo have heritage"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,rather have game developers instead of more consoles.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i was there when the phrase ps3 has no game was coined  and then they came back with games like uncharted 1 o
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i feel like something went wrong with bloodborne, because if it wasn't the case, fromsoftware would have made a sequel, a port andor a remaster by now. instead, they went with dark souls 3, sekiro and elden ring. those aren't bad games, but a port or a remaster wouldn't have taken most of the team to do, like they could have dedicated a few people to port the game on pc while the rest would have worked on the other games. we... are getting close to bloodborne's 10year anniversary o they did use bloodborne at the end of their 30thanniversary video, so... maybe there's hope"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"they do, but based on last years awful showing it seems like congratulating the creators is a low priority compared to marketing. they barely even got time to thank anyone before they were getting shooed offstage"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,i'm talking about op and the other teenagers in the comment section sucking sony's virtual dong. they seems to think that goty means something.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"generally microsoft has a ton of games getting nominations in other categories other than goty. and i personally think they were robbed many times, with hifi rush potentially being the most obvious one."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,nintendos a half a year to a year out from launching a new console by all the rumors. it's understandable for them to have a lighter year.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,yeah it's kinda ridiculous echoes of wisdom didn't get a nomination. that game is so much fun and really creative.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,the game awards and yes its considered by most to be the definitive one
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"microsoft is prioritizing availability, having the most games from the most studios, and then offering as many as possible in their gamepass service in order to become the netflix of gaming. honestly i think its a winning strategy because i havent needed to buy games for years, and im playing a wider variety than i did before, as well as discovering some hidden gems that i would have never otherwise played. even their cloud gaming is coming along great. while i wouldnt use it for something like cod, i regularly play it for slower paced games on my quest 3 while lying in bed."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"they technically had 2, but they bought both studios around a year before the game came out and both games went on playstation day one, one of them was even console exclusive to ps5 and not on xbox the year that it won"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,the reveals are what made it fun for me. he also realised it and effectively replaced e3 with sgf.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i'm guessing because you equate steam with pc gaming in general that you were born lately?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,the downvotes are probably because no one assumed they would be in game of the year? they barely make games so why would they be there? your comment doesn't add anything. not just valve fanboys or whatever.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"...that is 100 irrelevant. did you know tablecloths are bad at giving mustache rides? if we're tossing random words in buckets, that is my contribution."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,who gives a fuck? are you the type of person who buys xbox only to play microsoft games on it or playstation only to play sony games on it? thats kinda sad not gonna lie.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,so?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,valve barely makes games anyway so why would you even argue that lol. no one gives a shit tbh

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,you played baldurs gate 3 right?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,see i want games to be available on all platforms so i can play with whom ever i want. they make good games except concord. higher quality is not really true as we have seen much better titles come out from smaller studios like baulders gate 3 from laurian studios. sony has good games yes. corporations like sony destroy the quality of games over time. the profits always need to go up. this is why we are seeing studios shut down. studios need to be smaller and create good games without messing them up with corporate over sight.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,yeah they would give them more sales and help finance bigger games but it is what it is w sony being wierd
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"ok? but sony does have talent, 910 sony games are great, i was just saying the bad ones get treated the same as the good. spiderman 2 was to put it nicely, bad but it still got shoehorned into awards when other games very obviously did better."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"and sony killed off japan studio, so there goes the neighborhood."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"actually sony had 100 say on both of those games and ip and still do for bloodborne. they just this year sold the death stranding ip back to kojima, and they can do whatever they want with bloodborne with or without fromsofts permission or input. it would be pointless and stupid but they could give any dev studio and have them release bloodborne 2 if they wanted to"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,and those are the best two on the list.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"bloodborne was actually codeveloped with a playstation studio and they own the ip, it isnt a stretch to call the game itself a first party game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,death stranding was from kojima studios which is independent from sony. they had a contract for ds and kojima fully owns the rights again as of this year.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"ive played like 40 hrs of it and it literally requires you to hold and release the damn shoulder buttons in order to walk into cutscenes. you're essentially a deliveryman who walks. if you don't press buttons to walk you trip over yourself. it's hours of just walking at times. it was talked up to be a whole new genre of videogame entertainment called a strand game by kojima. the first question i ask when playing a game is is this fun? if it isn't, it does not matter how interesting the plot is. in my opinion this would've been better as a short series on hbo or something rather than a game. i don't like his opinion so i'll just say he didn't play it i enjoyed being able to throw piss and shit bombs at the things. i'll give you that"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i think the last of us fans are mad at me.  uncharted is like a 7. it's not bad but it's not goty worthy of any year.  walking simulator is a 5 if you didn't want to watch a movie. if you like watching your games play themselves than i can see this being a 10. it can't be those that did it people must be mad i scorned last of us part 2. i didn't even rip into it.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i really wouldn't say that's mp. it's basically a tradtional single player games designed around coop. most mp games aren't considered because they lack story elements.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,maybe nonpvp is more accurate
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,yea but the point is that goty awards talked about campaign more than online
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,or what most people were talking about during halo 13 or even beyond. halo 1 and 2 didn't have the online multiplayer base in the slightest. most people definitely played the campaign more than anything else.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,definitely not making multiplayer games anytime soon after the last one
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,bless you for finally figuring out the real question i was asking.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,the strategy shift that brought us concord
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,nowhere did they say they would focus on live service. the majority of their ongoing projects are single player games. of those 12 included gt and mlb.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"which is fucking stupid and i think might be start of the decline of sony. sonys brand is built upon high quality single player games. a lot of the people that buy sony consoles are single player gamers that like their single player games. to completely ditch that to go to live service is basically alienating the type of people that buy your console. im guessing they recognized this was an overall bad decision and thats why factions and the spiderman live service was cancelled. yes they need some live service games so they have a secure moneymaker that allows them to pump out high quality single player games, since costs of games keep rising. however to turn all their brands into live service shit was dumb from the beginning. last 4 sony games, only 1 was the usual sony good quality. concord was the biggest flop in triple a gaming history. the until dawn remake got questionable reviews, and same with the lego horizon game. astro bot was the only one of the games that you would expect from sony. they might be fucked and there is no right answer. they clearly want to shift away from single player games because dev costs keep going up which makes them to risky to make. however out of any dev or publisher on the planet, sony is known for its single player titles. they are literally built around that market."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"playstation is going cross platform because they recognize they can profit from pc players who continually ask for their games to be made available to them. they have been successful in their ecosystem and recognize that they can profit even more from pc players who quite literally demand their products. yes you are right, consoles are typically sold at a loss, thats what makes exclusives so important. they are the incentive to invest in a specific console. similar to what i said about exclusives move consoles. xbox is abandoning distinct consoles because theirs have been underselling by comparison and need to offer up their products across the market to remain profitable after purchasing the largest casual gaming market for close to 70 billion. the difference is sony has done well in their contained ecosystem and now they are pandering to pc players while microsoft needs to offer their products everywhere to help them turn over a profit after spending way too much of the companys monopoly money to make overpriced purchases."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,avowed and clockwork revolution might move the needle for me. those look good from what i saw. but will they stay exclusive? microsofts strategy now is taking the moral high road and make their games multi platform. nvm you that they are double dipping in profit margins because they recognize that in order for gamepass to continually release quality day one exclusives they need to sell games as well as take in subscription money. im worried xbox is going to be more about profits than quality experiences like ubisoft or ea became. the examples you provide do help dissolve those worries a bit.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"one thing i've appreciated about the games microsoft has put out over the past generation is the fact that they seem to be taking risks with the games they put out. yeah, they've released a lot of stinkers and haven't really managed to achieve sony's level of quality when it comes to their games, but just look at the kind of games they put out this gen. we've gotten multiple flight simulators, multiple rts titles, a wonderful survival crafting game grounded, a multiplayer pirate fps sea of thieves, several smaller scale rpgs from obsidian, as well as a game like psychonauts 2, which in all likelihood wouldn't exist if microsoft didn't purchase double fine. meanwhile when i look over at sony's first party titles while i see nothing but great games, i also see almost nothing but single player third person action games. that isn't necessarily a bad thing, and those titles would absolutely make me pick up a playstation over an xbox. i just appreciate that xbox seems to be letting developers take risks rather than be stuck in the back half of the 360 era where everything was just gears of war, halo, and forza."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,right? sony has a couple exceptional movies surrounded by an ocean of garbage. the gaming division is probably the only thing keeping them afloat. even then i'd argue it's not even thanks to a superior platform. they simply own the right devs and have the recognizable brand
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"sony can afford to gamble on bad movies, it's part of their strategy. but acting like they haven't delivered absolute bangers like spiderman into the spiderverse, venom, bullet train, elysium, or even the delightful chaos of cloudy with a chance of meatballs? that's willful ignorance. heres the thing, sharknado 7 isnt a masterpiece that demanded sequels. it exists because studios can milk tax writeoffs from movies that bomb just hard enough. its not about the audience, it's about the balance sheet. when you're as rich as sony, bad movies arent failures. theyre calculated losses, paving the way for even bigger wins on the projects they actually care about. it's the cinematic equivalent of throwing a pawn to protect the queen."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i mean... if you're a game studio and you run to sony to save you, than sony it's probably the preferable game studio you would want to work for."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,those are called tax writeoffs. that's how spiderman across the spider verse and the new venom movie can be fantastic with extra funding. lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"he said marketing deal, which means ps gets all the commercials, if that matters to you"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"they don't have a deal with rockstar. yes they do. look it up.httpsm.imdb.comnewsni64805121 there's even rumors of sony acquiring take two, rockstar's parent company. but that's just a rumor. the game is also coming out on xbox. and spiderman is and horizen zerodawn are now on microsoft pc.... they are allowed to release games on other platforms...xbox purchased bethesda, but elder scrolls 6 will still be on playstation. what's your point? i'm just saying sony makes good games and having that sony money to support these studios will be nice. sony is pretty good about giving studios the money and funding they need, and just leaving the artist alone to create their true art."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"people that have friends at least. you say this as if the modern multiplayer games weren't designed around matchmaking complete strangers with each other. i'm not sure there's any correlation between having friends and playing popular multiplayer games, and i'm certainly not confident which direction that correlation would point."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"playing a game more doesnt necessarily mean you enjoy the game itself more. personally my enjoyment in multiplayer games come largely from the social aspect, whereas i only play single player games if i really want to play that game itself. i can only speak for myself, but ive hopped on a game countless times for countless hours that i didnt necessarily feel like playing at that moment, but did anyway because some buddies hopped on."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,others addressed that sony didn't buy the ip and sit on it but also sometimes things don't need 27 sequels.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"yeah but i really wonder what they're getting from that. from a financial perspective, there's absurd amonuts of money to be made. instead, they remaster demon's souls..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"you are thinking of bethesda the studio, the stat refers to bethesda the publisher which has way more games than fromsoft"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"this is about bethesda as a publisher which would include the games from id software, machine games, arkane etc. in fact, of the 4 games counted here, only one was developed by bethesda game studios."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"we may be confusing bethesda the publisher which has many more games than 4 in the past 13 years and bethesda the studio. based on the ops description, i had assumed their list refers to bethesda the publisher, but i could be mistaken."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"yet, the scale of that achievement really depends on the competition too. this is especially true for this years nominees in my opinion, not that these nominees arent all fantastic games, but lets be honest here, most of these wouldnt have stood a chance against games like breath of the wild, elden ring proper, god of war"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"you know you could say this in 2018, but really in hindsight? rdr2 is a big large rockstar level game, but it's not as great a game as people make it out to be, it's a large game, sure. the story is a bit repretative, almost every mission 34ths of them become shooty bang bang. you shoot up a town multiple times, you rob a train multiple times, and so on. god of war though was excellent from beginning to end, it had a new level of story telling who was expecting it to explore kratos as a father after the first three games, and excellent world, an exploration of a new mythos, and a fantastic ending. it was game of the year."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i like both games but i don't think there is any justification for saying rdr2 should have won. i really love that game but it was so boring to play at times and the combat was completely void of any character compared to other 3rd person shooters that i really struggle to see how people can say it should have won over gow 2018 when that game has one of the best single player gameplay loops in recent memory. they both had great story's, both had amazing side characters, amazing worlds etc. but quite frankly only gow had the gameplay to back it up."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"it is too  it combined things from several genres to be it's own unique thing, but delivering things and all the playable depth that entails is the core of what the game is trying to be, if you actually played it you should know it. also, in the gameplay reveal trailer, one of sam's first lines was i make deliveries, that's all'', and then we see him traveling through rugged natural landscapes, unholstering an assault rifle in front of an enemy camp, and sneaking through bt territory."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i asked you a question. do you have an answer?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"the term ''strand game'' refers to the game's social strand system, the asynchronous multiplayer feature in which players collaborate with each other by leaving ladders or climbing anchors, building bridges, roads, safehouses, watchtowers, recharging points, ziplines, donating gear and materials, signaling dangers and points of interest, returning lost cargo, even during boss fights another player's character can emerge from the ground to give you weapons and healing items, a multiplayer element about connecting players instead of having them fight each other."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,seriously? and the vehicles? the tons of new features and devices of all kinds that you unlock throughout the entire game? building infrastructure to facilitate and optimize your deliveries? the bts? the mules? the terrorist faction? the travels to the world wars? planning your route? planning the gear and tools you will take with you to overcome the dangers and environmental obstacles along the way? the collaborative multiplayer features? it's also valid not selfimpose you to walk everywhere and ignore the interesting game content just because the first opinion you heard about the game was from someone lying that that walking was the only thing it had to offer. that or you only played for 1 hour and assumed you'd seen everything

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,which game are you talking about?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"that makes some people not want to play the game this argument falls a little bit flat considering that rdr2 has sold 67 million units and is the 6th best selling game of all time. for as popular as god of war was, if even only a third of the people who bought rdr2 wanted to play the game, it still had more people who wanted to play the game than god of war... rdr2 has been a monumentally popular game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i think it's because rdr2 was a much more popular game than gow with nearly 3x the sales. so i don't think it's so crazy for people to assume that would reflect in awards.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"the length of rdr2 is one of my favorite parts tbh. it added a lot to the world and characters and made the emotional moments hit a lot harder. i would disagree with it feeling empty, maybe if you compare it to a linear game like god of war but for an open world game, the world felt very alive and there were always unique moments wherever you went. its not for everyone but for the right audience me rdr2 is basically perfect, ive spent hundreds of hours doing nothing but hunting, fishing, gambling, taking care of my horses, robbing, and just riding around looking at the world."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"rdr2 had better story and character writing, better world design, and more attention to detail across the board. gow had more engaging active gameplay on average though. still red dead was the better game by a long shot."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i think we have different ideas of what makes a game. like how exactly did you find so much of the game not finished or abandoned? likeseriously?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i donthow does the amount of fanboys and attention add up to own games quality being better then the other?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,plus add the amount of attention rdr2 still gets critically and analytically. sure gow also has a story and themes that could and have been looked and discussedbut to the level of rdr2? id be real surprised if that was actually the case.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"it's still elden ring, even looking back on it. i've played through both multiple times, but gowr doesn't hold a candle to the worldwide capture that er had on the masses. it literally got casual players into the souls series. it's still being talked about. it's still innovating with the dlc this past summer."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"true. it was one of those years where i wouldn't have begrudged a win for either game. i might prefer ragnarok a bit more personally, but both are great."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i'm not sure that would normally work in elden ring's favour. many times games just exit peoples conscience a couple of months after it is released.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,hell even its wiki page says halo 1 is widely considered one of the best multiplayer games of all time. its a wiki page literally anyone could write that for their game. hell i could write it for a single play game and itd be there for at least a minute before it got removed

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,exactly
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"honestly that's my current favorite live service game. the only reason i don't think sony has gone all in on it is because they don't own arrowhead. they own the helldiver's ip, but the studio that made it isn't owned by sony. sony struck gold with helldiver's, and i think if they owned arrowhead they would be doing a lot more support for it and advertising it, as well as having support studios helping out with content. iirc arrowhead doesn't want to be bought, but i can see them being worried if arrowhead changes their mind down the line and microsoft offers them a fat buyout. that would completely fuck them over."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"not exactly. why do you think sharknado 5 and saw 7 exist? because they were sooooo good they needed more sequels? of course not. they released something just good enough, but usually rushed and underfunded. marvel does the same thing. did you watch the marvels?.... did you even know it existed? the black widow movie sucked along with eternals.. do you know why they won't create another hulk movie? because they always flop too hard to pass. lol they know what projects they want to dump tons of money into and which ones they don't want to fund at all."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"what does this do with it? gta5 has sold 3 times more as red dead and both red dead and gow are better than gta5 not saying its a bad game, just not what it could have been this isnt a popularity contest. should i say minecraft is the goat just because it sold over 300 million and every other game did not?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i think you have it the wrong way round. god of war was a cinematic masterpiece, red dead 2 was a great story driven open world game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i think it has an incredible story one of the best ive ever seen. ive been a fan of the series since the first game and seeing the evolution of kratos going from a vengeful hate filled monster hellbent on killing everybody who did him wrong or simply was in his way to a father who is desperately trying to keep that person on the inside from getting out was gripping. his character growth felt earned. even in the original games this was a man who was tortured by his past he was never just some dumb rageaholic like some insinuate, his repeated betrayal by the gods fundamentally broke him as a person. i mean even the first scene in the entire series is him trying to kill himself. the scene in 2018 gow where he retrieves the blades of chaos and he speaks to the ghost of athena and tells her i am your monster no longer is one of the best scenes in gaming, to see kratos finally throw off the shackles of his past was phenomenal. i also think the gameplay was just way more innovative and entertaining than rdr2, while rockstar has changed virtually nothing about their combat system since gta iv. i also believe the soundtrack was better in gow, not to say rdr2 has a bad soundtrack its a great soundtrack but bear mccreary put together a soundtrack that even howard shore would be proud of. there were so many times where i was just in awe of his compositions in that game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"woahreally?? genuinely asking here, like for real? what puts it there for you?   dont get me wrong i think its a great game as well, but top 5? i'm not sure if it's top 5 for me, but i've been playing video games for over 30 years and have beaten countless games i can't remember... if gow 2018 isn't in my top 5, it's just outside the only games i know i would put ahead of it are oot and ct. i thought the storytelling and writing was phenomenal. as the other person indicated, kratos showed he wasn't just an angry rage monster and learned to grow while seeking to atone. the world was beautiful. i'm not a huge open world fan but enjoyed exploring the world and seeing what it offered. the combat was challenging but was never aggravatingly so and was fun from start to finish. if someone that never played video games asked for a recommendation for games are works of art, gow is on the shortlist."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"the entire western portion of the map is like they ran out of budget, and after chapter 4 is seems pretty clear they started accelerating things to push the missions through areas that are not nearly as well fleshed out as others guarma, van horn, etc that still have elements of abandoned storylines, side quests, etc that are indicative of rushing to complete something and not having the time to clean up those old loose ends."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,the entire epilogue area is basically a big empty map only consisting of animals to hunt. and the whole island area of the story is just lame. the combat is pretty bad too.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"because goty isnt only about game quality? 90 of the vote is done by jury and 10 done by fans. think about the backlash that can be caused by the louder fanbase. thats possibly something the juries have to take into account. and even then, if the juries just prefer gow over red dead 2, then its simple as that. the winners are determined between the jury 90 and public voting 10. according to their wiki."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,lol i'm assuming you're joking but i genuinely loved miles. it was shorter than other triple aaa games but it was cheaper and still longerhigher quality than plenty of other games at that price point.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i did absolutely loved the ongoing side missions though. doing side missions with an npc that was part 3 of 9. made the side quests feel important as compared to just being a one off thing that happened. very clever. i'm surprised we're not seeing more open world games attempt this.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"yeah i just finished ghost on pc a few weeks ago, and while it is a gorgeous game with great art direction and some really clever navigation mechanics, i was pretty bored with it halfway through. the only thing i started looking forward to was finding new scenery to enjoy. otherwise, the entire game is basically run into random banditsmongols on the road, kill them, then speak to your friend to continue side quest where you... kill more mongols. most new, openworld games are pretty barebones like this i suppose while they build out their world and mechanics, but i was barely engaged for the last 20 hours of that game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,its just opinions lol they are all good.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"none of the games that were nominated that year were bad. dread was amazing, village and psychonaughts were both very good, and deathloop was a great premise but i found got a touch stale after 30 hours. the only game i found to not be worth a nomination is ironically the winner it takes two. the problem with that year is that, imo, any nominee from any other year would have likely won the award that year. ff7 or ghost of tsushima gets delayed or horizon or xc3 release earlier? sure win."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"the discourse around that game was such a mess thanks to an influx of culture war tourists trying to either attack or defend it, but i found tlou2 to be an absolutely miserable experience. one of the reviews i saw on youtube called it a petty revenge story filled with shitty unlikable people and compared it to things like the last jedi and game of thrones season 8 and i couldn't have agreed more. almost nothing about the game's narrative worked for me. it's 20ish hours of misery porn that i wish i had never played."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"it's incredibly deep and polished, just in a genre that we would normally not see a top tier game take over the cultural zeitgeist. definitely worth playing."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"i just wrote that definition  as i said in my first comment, it's okay for people to dislike it for legitimate reasons, but if you say that the game is exclusively about walk everywhere you clearly didn't played it for 40 hours, that's the length of the main story alone, you would have seen bosses, enemies, vehicles and everything i mentioned and more."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"if after the first few hours you are walking everywhere instead of using vehicles, raiding enemy camps to farm resources and building infrastructure to facilitate your deliveries, you are doing something deeply wrong, did you stay in the tutorial area for dozens of hours or something?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"no, but you only said that uncharted is a 7 game that shouldnt be goty nominated, and ds is a dumb movie walking sim. that to me is shoving your opinion as a fact and not an opinion"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i think some people just expect every main story quest in a single player game to be mission impossible the entire way. imho those are just adhd teenagers used to high octane cod campaigns or some shit. sometimes single play rpg's and action rpgs need slower pacing at times to have dialogue with new characters and build relationships. such as atreus and angrboda going around the realm on her little quest. and so forth. i am okay with all of this. its developing a well written story with fully fleshed out characters etc.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,ive been playing it a lot recently since they did a halo 2 throwback playlist halo 2 maps and settings adjusted to make it play more like halo 2 and its super fun. infinite had a really rough launch and while its not the best halo game the current multiplayer experience is fun and active enough to be a good time. i still usually pick it over the sweatfest that mcc has become and the more or less dead game that 5 is.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,yeah cause then it would be mostly cod with a random hogwarts legacy last year.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"ok, but the argument from the person i was replying to was makes some people not want to play the game. which is the same thing as people buying the game because they want to play it. his post implies more people wanted to play god of war, which is just a logical fallacy. far more people want to play rdr2 than god of war. if that's the criteria, then rdr2 is the clear winner. if it's not a valid criteria, then saying it as an argument for god of war makes no sense. this is why i said his argument fell flat. rdr was also an amazing critical success and has a better review score than god of war too. we aren't talking about call of duty here."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"ok, so rdr2 actually sold 67 million not 50, so thats 16.75 million people who finished a game that takes 50 hours on average to beat. as opposed to 10.6 million people who finished a game that takes 21 hours on average to beat? think its pretty fair to say a lot of people enjoyed the shit out of rdr2. 60 more people beat a game that was over twice as long god of war had a high completion rate due to being relatively short for an open world game campaign. 25 for rdr2 is still a very strong completion rate for a long game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,that is problably because gow trophies list was really short and easy.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"this isnt a popularity contest. it's almost as if i was responding to a guy who had the argument of makes some people not want to play the game which has to do with if the people playing the game are liking it. yes, some people may not want to play the game. a hell of a lot more people do want to play the game, so the argument that some people don't is relatively meaningless for evaluating if it's good or not. that's why i said his argument fell flat. seems to have gone over people's heads."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"a lot of people have this opinion. we were dry on good games the last decade because of covid. it's only recently picked up again where we're seeing good games and a lot of them. uncharted is a popcorn game. it's not a 9 or a 10 imo. i didn't say it was bad... a 7 is good... a 910 is like zelda level. is this anywhere near that? hell no. why don't you talk to me about the game you're mad about. last of us people tend to be unhinged and have fringe opinions. it's like what's going on with that wicked movie. you have movie watchers last of us fans who want to just watch a movie in a property they enjoy and a bunch of theatre kids are singing and being rude in the theatre last of us two fans, gatekeep it, and start crying at a child's movie. if someone asks them to be quiet or stop crying about it they go on a long winded explanation on how a tropefilled story is the best thing ever written and you must not get it even though it's the most simple story concept ever. i'm only expanding on my opinion btw because you had to ironically say i'm wrong on my opinion. i'm not shoving shit in your face that you didn't ask for."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"sorta. the psn debacle and arrowhead's own nerfhappy changes did drop it off a cliff for a while  but for the last few months since september it's experienced a resurgence and honestly the game is more fun than it's ever been. once arrowhead reversed its terrible dev philosophy to one incentivizing player fun, things have greatly improved. in some sense the damage is done most of those players aren't likely to return, but it has improved and has much better retention now, and for anyone who does come back every loadout is way more viable and fun to use than it was before."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"a lot of players came back after the 60 day patch. the balance is much better and arrowhead stopped nerfing the fuck out of things that didnt need to be nerfed. they even rebuffed a lot of old stuff that they originally nerfed. the game is in a great place balance wise now. now they just need to focus on actually putting new content out for the game. they got behind because they were way to focused on balancing and nerfing shit that didnt need it, and then had to use their time rebalancing the game getting rid of the nerfs, so its likely just in the last few months they have been focusing on content. if the last time you played was before the 60 day patch, id recommend giving it another try, its a much different game now."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"absolutely. they're allowed to make money off of it, but they normally spend more than they make back as calculated, and will not even spend much or nothing at all on marketing intentionally. if a shitty underfunded movie magically does well and breaks even than it's just a bonus. movie studios don't care about movies, they care about money and balance sheets. you pay directors to care for you."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"i believe 100 you and thousands of other players think it's better but the game is still dropping players each month. they're at an all time low of 27k on steamdb, the chart is kind of sad, when you look at it through max. wasted potential."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,i can see you get your retorts from the sane playground that you get your girlfriends from. your mother should've made sure the coat hanger didn't have lead in it

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"its kind of impressive in a way. a sad, sad way."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"you know, thats fair. i can't think of any excuse why they weren't in the game, but i also don't think it would have extended the lifespan much because the setting can only do so much to compensate for gameplay people aren't enjoying enough to play the game for the sake of it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"that happened in early september and it's been at or near 70k multiple times since then...if you don't call what you see on that chart leveling out compared to what came before...man i don't think we're looking at the same chart, lol. it's really not dropping more and more each month. hell it was lower than 27k in august!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,"thats now from the lack of content tho, which is an issue. before it was dropping players because the balancing was fucking terrible. they rebalanced the game and people flooded back. since then we have only had 2 warbonds, and the dss is kind of meh. steam leaks in the change db basically confirm arrowhead is working on a new faction. this will absolutely spike the player base back up. arrowhead kind of fucked themselves when they were on a nerf fest, because instead of adding content, they kept nerfing stuff. players left to the point where there was only 15k people on on a saturday on steam and ps5 combined. they knew they had to correct course, rebalanced the game, and were holding 80k players peak between both systems for awhile. any live service game without content for a long period of time is gonna have people moving on. a lot of people are already maxed out on helldivers with nothing else to get, and the ship fully upgraded. they most likely have set the game down till arrowhead adds new content. yeah the players are falling off abit now due to this, but at least its because damn we wanna play but there is nothing new instead of holy shit they ruined this game, never touching it again."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-03,27k isn't bad though. it's a lot less than release but tons of coop horde shooters survive years with player counts below 10k. vermintide 2 plods along around 5k consecutive and spikes a few times a year thanks to steam sales. payday 2 has chugged along at 25k players for nearly a decade now. killing floor 2 barely ever got off the ground compared to helldivers but it's managed to keep 510k players throughout its life cycle. this is just the second stage of a game like helldiver's lifecycle. it's gone from short lived phenomenon that everyone's playing to the well established game that will live for another halfdecade at least. the peak player count has been higher in each of the past 4 months than it was in july that's a good sign.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,"if your complaint is that the game supposedly exclusively offers walking bored for hours, you probably didn't play it, played 1 hour and gave up, went in circles in the tutorial area, played it blindfolded or something like that."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,true but the ps4 consoles are by far the worst. all the ps3 models got loud but not as loud as an xbox 360 and while the ps5 is louder than the series x it's whisper quiet compared to a ps4 or ps4 pro.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"yeah ragnarok is pretty much a dlc for me. there's no next gen on it, technically. i finished it in 32 hours and haven't gotten back to it again. i enjoyed my playthrough and the game is great but it's not worth buying a new ps5 and a new tv just to play it, which i did  same with 2018 which was very much worth it. i could have played it on ps4 pro and my current tv and my experience would have been essentially the same."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"survival set gang brother. never took it off, got it to level 9 and beat the entire game with it. also never used anything but the standard handles on all of the weapons."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,ps4 pro doesn't do 60 fps. its around 30 to low 50s.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,"don't ever get a pc, i've turned into a big frame rate snob. 240 fps ruined me for life. 60fps is still great for games like gow or elden ring. now i need to get a 1440p high refresh upgrade. i'm glad consoles are now supporting both high resolution output and options for 120 fps mode."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"the gpu of the series s is less powerful 4 tflops than the xbox one x 6 tflops, which was the most powerful console of the last gen. it can't possibly be more powerful than a ps4 pro 4.2 tflops. it's based on a newer architecture though, which allows it to make use of features that aren't possible on ps4 pro and one x, like ray tracing, if only to a limited degree, and it has a more powerful cpu as well as fast ssd storage instead of an anemic hdd so that it doesn't hold currentgen games back. ram is also more limited though, since there is both less of it and it's much slower than on xbox one x. as a side note, this lower gpu processing power compared to the one x is also the reason why backwards compatible games have none of the enhancements resolution, frame rate they are enjoying on xbox one x. in that sense, the series s is just as limited as the old xbox one s, with the added handicap of no discdrive making it impossible to make use of cheap used games."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,"well if a game is leaning on graphical experience, animations should follow the same perfection, you can't have kratos head go through a log that he has to carry for the story and not expect people to lose some of the bedazzlement that was intended. i'm not saying it's bad, i'm just saying, when you cater a specific audience, you should follow through with it or at least, fix the obvious flaws along the way. watch the first couple of minuttes of a playthrough and you'll understand what i mean. x200b unless you are one of those, that just wants to argue because you think we have to, just because our beliefs are different from each others."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,"it wasnt ment as the games had nothing else to offer, i was just focusing on the graphical aspects of the games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,its very nice but rdr2 and forbidden west both sweep it away
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,"and that's being hold back by the ps4, imagine if they could actually use the hardware. it's a real shame"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,30 fps is absolutely slow in 2022.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,games have sound though
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,no wonder. its about 60 weaker.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,ha! i got rid of my disk edition and bought a digital edition. haven't bought a game on disk since 2018. i have a friend who has complained about disk drive noise before.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-10,"it is huge. i had dark plates on my disk ps5 before i sold it for a diskless, and it does make it blend in a lot more. i think i prefer the white plates though. even if it is hidden behind my tv now."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,yeah? i don't know where people are getting their systems at but seriously i've had two ps4s and neither one has made a sound. my first unit i had to return because i couldn't make the payments but my current system i bought is used and yeah no noise at all.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"man same here, i keep reading about how loud gow makes the ps4 get but i didnt find it that bad at all. red dead redemption 2 made it sound like a jet engine for me though"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,obviously both!

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,to be fair it isn't an open world sandbox like red dead so a lot of the processing power can go to rendering a lot of assets in closer proximity to the player giving you better visuals. red dead does still look amazing.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-03,agree. difference in graphics vs. 2018 gow are not really noticeable
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"i've dabbled with a couple other sets when i didn't have the resources to upgrade the survival set, but whenever i can get it upgraded i always seem to switch back to it. haven't followed that philosophy with the weapon handles though. do the standard ones get significantly better with upgrades?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"it's hilarious that you mention games from 2003, because here we are, almost 20 years later, still playing games from 2005, with just a few graphic upgrades. i agree it looks better on the ps5, but it looks beyond good enough on vastly less expensive, and far more available, hardware."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,we dealt with plumbing issues earlier this summer. i do not envy your position. good luck!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"yeah, sadly the performance mode is so unstable that i find the better graphics options at 30 fps much better"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,ya haha i can see that. i have a gaming laptop that's super outdated now but i played that for a couple of years and went back to console. man it literally hurt my eyes with the combination of low fps and low refresh rate on my tv. i didn't want to invest in a brand new computer setup so i decided to just go next gen. 60fps is the minimum i play now. i don't even bother with ray tracing since it forces you to be at 30fps. not worth it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"i briefly had a 180hz screen for a few weeks before it broke and returned to my more than ten year old old 60hz display which actually has a slightly higher resolution, 1600p instead of 1440p. honestly, it's quite easy to go back. took me maybe half an hour to get used to the much slower reaction times of the old screen again, a screen that was slow even at the time."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"so around 46 years in it would be reduced, so 2 years time makes sense?"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,the exposed armor gives more strengthless defenses. he has super tanky looking armor think warhammer that has huge defense without any boost to strength. you can build him to sacrifice health for more offense if that is your play style.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"red dead does look amazing. boring af with shoddy controls, but gorgeous and vast with a solid story."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,yeah if you hover over the handle and scroll over the upgrade levels you can see where they get to. the starter armor and handles are the most well rounded in the game i think. they give you a bit of everything which is kind of my style

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,just the part that you can't crouch or vault small obstacles i understand that's part of the level design the fixed camera is also a thing i'm not big fan of. i'm just big rdr2 fanrockstar overall before the gta online era don't mind me. cheers

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"yeah. i guess i just dont see crouch as really necessary or helpful in the game. and idk what small obstacles youd vault over. but if you havent played it, ragnarok offers a lot more mobility than 2018 gow did. rockstar is cool and all, i just feel like their games are wildly overrated and the flaws are consistently ignored. the movement and controls in them feels janky and outdated. like, shooting sections sucked in rdr2 and only worked because of dead eye mode. cool games, fun, but by the end of rdr2 i was so sick of janky horse rides that would randomly crash into boulders and trees. i dont mind the fixed camera. it works for the style."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,i haven't played ragnarok because i'm mostly on pc don't feel like upgrading from my ps4pro yet. so yeah maybe a good point. i know it's on ps4 aswell but rather wait  pre gta4 rockstar games were very different in way of character movement ect . but because rdr2 is one if of my favorite games ever i can't agree with the rdr2 bash no offense. end of the day to each its own. but that's a good thing
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,google lies then?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,ok so its just easier and more convient for me to hookup and find something to play on my xbox than my other consoles not trying to say one console or the other is better im merely defending xbox.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"i see why people don't like rdr2. it's a pace thing, some people want games that're more immediate with their actions. attention spans and all that. rdr2 is definitely one of the best crafted games i've ever played though. everything just goes so well together, and the attention to detail is as good as it gets last gen."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,personally feel rdr2 on console is a whole different experience to pc because the shitty frame rate just makes the clunkyness feel even worse. i couldn't play through it at all on my base ps4 but loved it on pc. i think a lot of the rdr2 critiques you see here are people who have only experienced the console version and i would absolutely agree with them on that.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i just finished it recently and honestly it felt like a bit of a letdown from the previous. the story didn't really grab me so much and it just didn't feel as fresh. it was probably an improvement in most ways as far as graphics, gameplay, etc., but it didn't have the same wow factor or emotional draw between the characters. the previous god of war felt like it had more of a purpose and i liked the dynamic between the characters better. it felt like the makers really had a story they wanted to tell, this just felt like an obligatory sequel that didn't have the same passion behind it. still a solid 8.510 but the previous was a clear 1010 in my book."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i have trouble not seeing past the fact that the previous game had more punching moves available. there used to be a stance change that expanded the punch combo  one would think like every other part of the combat in ragnarok we would see an improvement to the formula  instead it got cut down to one combo and my day is ruined just remembering that.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,solely for just how many amazing classic solo story based campaigns they have....a ps5 or ps4 pro is a must 2 x god of war 2 x last of us 2 x horizon 4 x uncharted 2.5 x spiderman ghost of tsushima detroit become human man the list of games that get you emotionally attached just keeps going

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,im getting flashbacks to everyone sucking this game off at release and being branded a hater for saying anything critical about it from people who were in the honeymoon period
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i think so too. loved every bit of it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i just finished it and i never wanted a game to end more than this one ok maybe fear3 but that's another category of bad. the whole thing is generic copy paste of the same stuff troughout the whole game. puzzles don't exist and when they do the npc's give you the solution within 5 seconds after you start looking around. boring generic fights every few steps. every area feels the same just a different skin on each one. i seriously can't fathom how anyone can give this game a 1010 unless it's the first game they ever played and don't know about anything else.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"glad youre enjoying it. for me, it was too similar to the first one to be a true 1010 game though. kind of felt like an extended dlc."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"in my opinion the game is too slow with too many cut scenes and a boring story, gow 2018 was much better because of the way it felt despite ragnarok being a big tehnical improvement in all aspects"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i'm playing now, the last one i played was the first god of war on ps2. i'm surprised how linear it is, you are almost completely on a rail, and the puzzles are so simple they take almost zero thought. also if you don't figure them out in .5 seconds you are bombarded with hints. there are also like 80 ingame currencies that only work for a narrow band of upgrades so you get barely any choice in what you are upgrading. the number of enemies is about 2 to 5 at a time so you are almost always fighting single enemies. it's fun, but you really don't feel like a bad ass god. i feel like i'm just watching a movie."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i love how the developers listened to players when they complained there wasnt enough enemy variety and then proceeded to craft dozens of unique monsters for ragnarok.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"more walking and talking. i have to finish it yet, turn a hiatus after all the walking and talking started getting to me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"purely in terms of interacting with and looking at it, ragnarok whips ass. i felt it was both a little bloated in terms of mechanics and story, while on the latter front also powering through a number of ideas that couldve used more room to breath or been tastefully edited out so i was, relatively speaking, not as blown away by it as 2018. but importantly that feeling mostly developed in hindsight, because again, in the moment the game as you say demonstrates a clear mastery of its vision. other than some of the puzzles, which can be one new mechanic too many."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,completed it and feels like a walking simulator to me. glad you enjoyed it though.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,ill be the guy i love hard games i am speedrunning souls got 1000's of hours into thwm and play everything on hard to very hard but i fucking hate the overloaded combat of ragnarok i am fighting the controller more than the actual enemies

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"if you're a fan of older gow games, wait until you get to valhalla dlc"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,did you like the bit where kratos eats jrmungandr to gain his strength?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i uninstalled this game when it required kratos to use a rope in order to descend a very short height. the killer of gods is unable to jump from there but had to use the rope.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,its a fun game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-20,"perd la empuadura de forsbrandr y solo esa me hace falta para platinar el juego, que hagoooo?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i concur with you mate. ive been in love with this series from the beginning and ragnarok just brilliant! keep having fun! i hope you are playing it in god mode
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i couldnt play any other games for like a week after i beat it because it was such an amazing gaming experience. they really nailed every aspect of what i look for in a single player experience. and when youre done you get a free dlc thats pretty damn fun too!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,lovely game im sure the graphics are off the charts but can i bypass the puzzles and thinking parts of the game. just wanna play lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,then your standard is too low
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i couldn't get in to it. the little kid character whines too much and i don't care about his problems or motivations.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,the combat is no where near as good as the first game. real smart of you to judge a game before you even finish it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"and there's me getting bored of that franchise because of too many cinematic and assisted gameplay. give me the game story into a tv show and i'll binge it but as game, i'll skip. i want to play a game, not watch something. too boring as video game and sorry, but kratos kinda lost his badassness in those 2 recent gow"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i bought the game a month ago, but had to finish 2018 before going into it. i already spoiled myself with the valhalla dlc lol. i played every entry besides the mobile game and ascension. i loved seeing kratos going from a vengeful little shit to a dad of boy."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"it's one of the best games of all time. if not, the best game of all time for me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,graphicsperformance 1010 art direction 1010 music 1010 voice acting  sound design 1010 story 910 gameplay 810 absolute masterpiece and could easily have beaten elden ring for goty in 2022 except that it's a ps5 exclusive so not as many people played it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"good for you. i could never get into gow 2018, its way too repetitive."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,blew my mind on my ps4pro because of how awful and soap opera like the writing was. also whenever action gets going midgame its stonewalled with that awful exposition.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i'll never understand when people think any game today is video realistic. we are so far from not having to suspend disbelief its crazy. i can only assume their thoughts are relative to an atari game or some other old ass platform. this game isn't even unreal 5..... awesome game but come on.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i liked it much better than the first one too, although both are top notch but i prefer ragnarok due to amazing boss fights, better set pieces and story."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i just got it on boxing day sale and it is indeed even better then the last one, between the visuals the story and the gameplay its just top notch"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"if gow ragnarok doesn't blow your mind, you have the wrong opinion."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i couldnt finish it. its too much. you have three different weapons with all different move sets and two main characters each with a different companion and they all have different moves. i felt like i was that guy playing eddie in tekken 2 and just rolling my face on the controller because i couldnt remember all the weird little moves.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,yeah its decent
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"ragnarok was the first game i played coming from the ps4 to the ps5, and it truly blew my mind as well. so silky smooth gameplay without any bugs or glitches. and the detail like in kratos beard was so good as well. i loved that experience so much"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i agree! 1010 for gameplay, frame rate and smoothness, story, graphics, and art style."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,only thing is kratos is now a little bitch
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i feel like they just nailed the writing in the game. characters were just excellent. the fact that i finished the game is a testament to how good it is as i rarely finish games anymore.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,it definitely blows!!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,give horizon zero dawn and forbidden west a try when youre done.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,yeah it's rad
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,it looks amazing and if you have a tv with vrr it runs uncaped at over 80 fps.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,2 is hole game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,as a huge gow fan i agree. ragnarok is an amazing game. i do think 2018 was slightly better though.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,the game came with my ps5 but i still haven't tried it yet there's so many things to play lmao
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,glad you're enjoying it. hoping it gets ported over to pc in a couple of years myself. really enjoyed the previous one.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,loved the game. one of my favs. but i regret selling it and deleting its save data to free up my ps5 space. now they released valhalla and i gotta buy it again smh.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,cries in pc
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i liked it except the ending. the build up was so high and it ended in a big low in terms of story  satisfaction for me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"just a tip, if you're planning to platinum it make sure to at least get the trophy for collectingcrafting relicshilts, there's a bug in ng that prevents you from crafting relics. i had to go back to my old save after finishing ng just so i can craft what i didn't for the platinum."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,just wait to play valhalla then...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i found the story and writing stronger in the first game by a mile but everything else is incredible and an improvement in ragnarok. one of the very few first party games where using the performance mode doesnt feel like a compromise in fidelity. this game is running black magic under the hood or something, its incredible"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,wait till u get to the atreus missions
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,on a proper display it's easily the best looking game there is.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i just completed it last night, amazing game with a great story but had a few things really pissing me off on it. i had to lower the difficulty all the way down skill problem i'm getting old now the camera and movement of enemies was really winding me up lol."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"yeah this is up there for me, minor quibbles aside still a top notch h linear experience."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"unpopular opinion, but i couldn't even finish god of war base version, let alone ragnarok. i felt like the old games were better for my style. i liked the arcade nature of the fighting. this new one felt more generic."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i liked the story of the last one a tad bit better but the combat and flow of ragnarok is superior imo.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i got shut down by the axe throwing puzzles which really disappointed me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i feel the same way about spiderman 2. so good!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,was going to wait for pc port but maybe picking up a ps5 will be worth it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"santa monica is just so good! released really good games, without gamebreaking bugs and a free story dlc which has a high replay value, awsome story and is free"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,lowkey makes me want to buy a ps5
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,my only complaint is about halfway through i had to drop the level down as i was spending hours getting killed over and over. the difficulty is just insane to me on balanced. some battles i need about 100 well timed hits to kill them while it takes one shot from them to kill me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,yeah i kinda regret getting the spiderman 2 console bundle instead of gow. spidermans ok but its a kids game really.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,wait till you play final fantasy vii rebirth.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i would be very surprised if it blew your mind on another platform.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,its a decent movie
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,you reminded me its about time to do another play through
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,the most recent ratchet and clank looks amazing as well
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"the mechanics of the game and the general story have been good so far, but what i hate about this one compared to the last is the lack of all the little lore stories that were told while you were just running around exploring or on the boat paddling around."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i love where they took this game. 1010
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-08,"definitely, to be honest i havent really been able to enjoy games for a long time and it sucks, knowing how i enjoyed them in the past. god of war  god of war ragnark just reignited that feeling of gaming i had when i was much younger. its a beautiful story, gameplay and all the mechanics feel realistic and finished. its the full package. even after beating the story, it has so much more to offer with side quests that actually have some lore and story to them and are not just filler fights or walking events made to make the game feel fuller. with all of that they just drop a valhalla dlc for free, absolutely incredible game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-08,it's ok for half of the game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-08,you're going to love the secrets of the sands part of the game. i've never stopped playing a game so much to just stop and look.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-08,"i just got into the game as well for christmas. i beat it pretty fast but there's a ton of fun to be had, even in the dlc. the visuals alone are great and the final parts of the game were both full of hype and satisfaction. its definitely not for everyone, but i enjoyed it a lot."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-09,"it's really just more of the first game, hardly an improvement at all. not that that is a bad thing"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-09,ok
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,valhalla dlc was so good. it's awesome it was free. i would've paid money for it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"seriously, valhalla feels like a free separate game. it blew my expectations away. and it was free!!!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"goddamn, i never heard about this free dlc somehow. my mind is kinda blown that they added even more to this monster of a game. how did you like it?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,f what happened to the first year spoiler warning
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,spoiler the second he does so very brutally.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,indeed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"pcs i think will always be a necessity, fps games are great. but consoles just have that calmness. they do give a different experience for whatever reason get a couch, great lighting around your tv  a console. it's worth it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i did this last year. been gaming by myself playing fun single player games. the fps games were getting too sweaty for me. i'm the worst of my friends at these games, i had no desire to get better either, but loved playing with friends."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,and then another 4 to 6 months to patch out all the problems with the port.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i do prefer to figure it out myself but it is a pretty minor compaint
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,there is a option in the settings for this exact thing
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i wish my companions would just shut up and let me figure out the puzzles sometimes this is why i dropped those game after 12 hour of play. it's annoying and a break the whole concept of video game. those game are all about great visual and play like a movie. let player be player.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,agreed one hundred percent. loved 90 of the game. last act of the story felt very rushed and unsatisfying with weak af boss fights. replayed the last one a couple of times. dread replaying this one cuz of that one whole bit with angrbodas grandma
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"agree completely, i think the pacing of ragnarok was all over the place, and it just felt like too much content for the sake of content at times. a good chunk of the preatreus going to asgard content, like the ironwood, could honestly be cut and the narrative would benefit from it in my opinion."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"totally agree to you. the moment in the first one, when you get your blades of chaos back, was awesome  sadly never had a moment like this for example in the second game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,100 this! the toneatmosphere is so different in ragnarok. it feels like a marvel movie. its a good game but the first one was better imo. i really did not like the handholding in ragnarok. companions constantly telling you how to do a puzzle or where to go. very annoying.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"fights with gods were really a let down tbh, i expected them to be much more difficult and epic... and here we go, 2 strangers with axes give me more challenge than entire heimdall fight lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i agree that 2018 is the superior game and had a stronger vision behind it. however i think its unfair to say that ragnarok is just a paint by the numbers sequel. there are lots of compelling and memorable moments, and you can see that the drive to tell the rest of the story was there from the start. it just suffers from the fact that the story doesnt stand on his own without 2018, and the pacing is off at times."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"that's a shame to hear cause its the opposite for me. i can't seem to put it down because i'm so invested in what happens next. every clue, new reveal that i find out gets me excited and engaged. it's been a long time since a game actually made me feel this way."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,played the first and second games back to back and the 2nd is worse somehow. the differences are subtle but a lot of the changes were for the worse in my opinion.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,yeah even though the gameplay was better than 2018 game the storyline just didnt do it for me. definitely has replay value though
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"the story was truly awful this time around, the writing was very poor, the dramatic scenes felt like something out of the worst marvel movies."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,it was the main plot for me. i don't want to spoil anything but there's a certain part of the story they build up as being a clash of epic proportions and it ends up kind of wompwomp. felt rushedlike they cut a corner somewhere.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i didn't even finish ragnarok. it is so far from the god of war series. kratos is just soft. it is just too mopey and it is trying so hard on the story. anywhere you go, the stupid head tells you that that is the wrong way or something. you can't explore or shoot an arrow without someone telling you it's the wrong direction or you're using the wrong arrow etc. i loved god of war. all of it from the beginning. but the last one was just bad. it's sad to see. but hey ho....it is what it is. where is the angry, mean kratos who wants to kill all the gods? not in ragnarok and that is for sure..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"it's great but the pacing is all over the place, some parts are just so boring we didn't need an hour or 2 of atreus picking fruit come on. the story is also whatever."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,my only grip is that we deserved at least one more encounter with thor before the endgame and the end itself was very short... valhalla came to complete that so... maybe before 2025 ends we will have a new game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,should i grab a ps5? all i've been doing is playing online competitive games and i think it's maybe time for a console.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,ghost of tsushima dude
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,armored core 6 goes insanely hard
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"treated myself to a ps5 digital after a long 23. feels like such an upgrade in a way. ageing gaming pc, xbox line up was kinda weak so sold it, and game pass isnt as big a value proposition to me as others with families for example. solid machine. been playing cp2077 2.1 and have been absolutely absorbed into it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"try returnal! also out for pc. i will always evangelize returnal. such a great, slepton game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,yes
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,the first one is better so yes
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,removed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"if you haven't gotten far enough into the game, there's a good reason for that"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"but it didn't. it entirely changed the combat, outright removed fantastic combat options from 2018 writing took a nosedive, and the pacing is awful compared to the first game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"that's a shame.. i'm playing through god of war 2018 for the first time, on pc and i'm finding it a chore to get through in alot of ways. i just finished elden ring then tears of the kingdom so i got used to that level of freedom in an open world.. gow 2018 feels really linear and the combat just feels dull and not engaging and the puzzles are basic. i'm enjoying the environment art, graphics and production value more than the design."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,filler? are you kidding? they had to cut stuff out to release on time.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,funnily enough i loved all 3 games you mentioned there more than the original. gow is probably the closest because i love the new gameplay mechanics but prefer the original story. although ragnarok is actually the only game ive ever 100 and platinumed on my ps5
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i'll say it angrboda was a huge negative point. i loved the giant boss but the rest? everything angrboda was ugggh i loved getting to know odin's family though, especially his granddaughter."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"it has its issues but most of the criticisms i'm seeing here are x thing i don't like means it's a trash game. the gameis good. majority shows, but anyone reasonable recognizes its faults as well"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"well i'm not exactly a hardcore gamer like alot of other ppl. but the best single player games ive played personally are red dead 2, ghost of tsushima and fallout new vegas. ragnarok has brought the same feelings i had playing those games. ive enjoyed it an immense amount. its easily in my top bundle of games ever, and again thats my personal preference. its all subjective bro"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,what's wrong you don't want to spend 45 minutes complimenting a random girl on her paintings?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,kojima cutscenes would be better than this shite.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,it's not for everyone. i read a review a while back calling gow and tlou 1 dad simulators which made me chuckle. both games are great but that critique was on point.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"idk, i feel the reverse. i could never get into souls games because the controls were so braindead simple"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,people are saying that? why? didnt the gta 6 trailer break a record for views or something? gaming isnt dead
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,who is saying gaming is dead?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"gaming is one of the biggest industries in the world. no one is saying it's dead, in fact it's just getting bigger and stronger every year. some of these games made today are bigger than most movies put out."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i haven't heard anyone say that since 2022
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"man, now i want to buy ragnarok."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,that seems like a really weird and nitpicky take tbh
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i mentioned in another comment that i just finished playing through elden ring and tears of the kingdom, and now playing gow 2018, and yikes, i feel this. i realize now i took the freedom of movement in those games for granted.. so funny that kratos can't jump down a small ledge or even fall off one."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i'd suggest to skip the main game and just play valhalla. it's atleast actually fun.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,after finishing it i started it again on give me god of war. only have gna left to beat.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"youre in luck because fourseconds after a puzzle starts, mimir chimes in with the solution."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,no. but the puzzles are easier than they were in 2018 so far
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i mean that is playing... it's part of he game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i feel like yours might be too high
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,always that one user. yikes.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,did he? i feel like it's just a different sort. old kratos was edgelord supreme wreaking at every opportunity and upset if he hadn't murdered something in 5 seconds. older kratos is worn down and outgrown those old ways but no less of a beast. this one doesn't need to yell to be heard and has wisdom to impart. honestly the story of these two entries trumps the original trilogy quite handily
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,honestly it might surpass red dead 2 for me by the end
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"im sure almost every critic played both, which is like 90 of the vote."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,nah elden ring was perfection. i get frustrated by being a literal god who can't go passed some rocks or rope and has to do this really obtuse climbing and problem solving. like in some scenarios and cut scenes he can jump like mountains but others he cant make it 10 feet? that alone makes it not as good.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"elden ring deserves game of the decade, no game would've stood a chance against elden ring as goty."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i miss the old games. those were my jam. huge boss fights, loads of different types of enemies. not these games. 3 different enemy types, all with different colors. both of these games are guilty of this. i beat them both, but the last one wasn't as good as the first. felt fairly hollow comparatively."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,skill issue
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,shut up
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i don't get this take. new kratos is way more mature than old one and doesn't need to yell to be heard. the growth from shitty absent father at the beginning of 2018 to genuinely heartfelt moments in ragnarok feels organic and hits hard. heck, 2018 was already a good father son story, after mine was born in 2019 i played it again and it just hits harder"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"wooow , how so?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,gow is the only reason i bought a ps5
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,ng increases difficulty so i just did it on balance without ng
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"the old ones gameplay haven't aged particularly well.. in terms of cinematic scope and the whole game feeling like a huge, grand adventure missing from the modern games for the most part, totally.. but the button mashey combat isn't as fun anymore.. there's very little feedback in what you're doing and the blades of chaos just don't have a ton of impact. plus all the button mashing to open doors and chests. it's definitely an amazing game though and product of its time"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i beat it on the second to hardest setting and for me the most annoying thing was the narrow fov during combat. all you're doing is watching for purple indicators that are telling you you're about to get hit by a projectile that will one shot you. just pull the camera out and let me see what's going on for fucks sake.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i loved it then hated it repeatedly getting my butt kicked on the final fight and then having to work my way back there but it started to click and i loved it again and the satisfaction and feeling of finally beating it was amazing. very cool that it was free.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,the dlc was annoying af imo.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,wait what! i got ragnarok ps5 bundle in march and didn't even know there was a dlc. guess i know what i'm gonna go do lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"sucker punch did the same got ghost of tsushima, that legends mode was so good an free"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"having binge watched all of sg1 just before playing god of war, it took me a while to not hear teal'c every time."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"this is the only way i game now. had a good pc for a while in my 20's and very early 30's, but now all my professional life is on a computer and i mentally need something different during my gaming time. i'm a couch and console gamer until i retire, i wager."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"get a couch, great lighting around your tv  a console. it's worth it they could do the same with their pc. just connect it through hdmi and it will the exact same thing than a console. we're not in the 90's anymore and consolepc are pretty much the same thing and offer the same kind of game and accessories.."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-08,"i agree. used to have to defend this position and somehow try to explain that consoles just feel different, even when you use a controller on a pc it does not feel the same as a console experience. theres just something to it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,no it very much was a big reason i quit the game. it is insufferable having them constantly treat kratos and the player like they're too stupid to solve a puzzle withing 5sec of me entering a room. just give me a fuckin second to look around.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"no, there isn't. httpswww.polygon.comgodofwarragnarokguide23453949atreusmimirpuzzlesolutionsmenuoption"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,really? i looked for it and didn't find it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"god of war 2018 great story and buildup ragnarok generic mcu story and ending, shat all over the 2018 buildup. x200b the game should've had a different story with more gods to fight and a follow up using the same engine and assets where you deal with odin like how gow 13 went. ragnarok felt really rushed and only the starting hour and a couple of moments felt as good as 2018. still a solid game tho otherwise and valhalla is pretty great.."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"writing is just ass. all the dialogue is worse in ragnarok. from constant quipping to constantly treating kratos like he has amnesia. i dunno how ragnarok is so praised tbh. i thought just about every aspect was worse. especially the combat goin from doom2016 kill em all! to ah ah ah, simon says combat of doom eternal. removed the hand to hand and shield combat? fuck outta here. everything staggers the god of war, everything skates around, and every enemy has a ranged option. it's fucked on harder difficulties. i could go on and on but i'm genuinely shocked at the praise it got after the 2018 game. it waa day and night to me even just an hour in."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"in addition to the hints, i just generally got annoyed at always having someone with me. kratos and boy are fine but a lot of the beginning is atreus hanging out with a girl and kratos escorting freya boring"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"while 2018 has the better story id still argue that ragnarok has better gameplay, 2 weapons from the start !and the spear halfway through! the different rages, shields, and not every boss being a fucking troll and more then 3 enemy types really makes the gameplay part refreshing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"im an adhd gamer that has issues finishing games, ragnarok is the first game i had played in a long time that kept me playing all the way until the end. such a good game. i wish i could forget it and start all over."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,im in complete agreement with you  ragnarok was one of the few games that ive wanted to continue playing even after the end credits and ended up near 100 everything. i found the games story so much more engaging and fleshed out and the combat and enemies so much better than the previous gow. it felt like that game laid the groundwork for this game to shine
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"100. play god of war  ragnarok, uncharted 14, the last of us, and ghost of tsushima."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i'm a huge ps5 fanboy but honestly the single player exclusives are the reason to own one... i think xbox does online better but i don't own an xbox or do online competitive i despise it for killing off good games for this fucking micro transaction fomo bullshit.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i own all 3 plus pc, and if i were recommending a console to a new player, i'd probably recommend ps5. if budget were more of a concern, i might point towards xbox and gamepass, but while i enjoy all 3 consoles, the consistent quality across ps5 wins the day."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,only if you like singleplayer 3rd person games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,play ps4 exclusive titles that came out on pc. if you love them and cant wait to play the sequels then you might want a ps5
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"its funny that the only game you mention is multiplatform, lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"the story is better... but the sequel beats it in every other aspect. gameplaycontrol, graphics, side quests, varied locations, villians, etc"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,you a elden ring defender bot?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,what fantastic options did it remove other than making elemental weaknesses way less important than individual build options and making runic attacks way less oppressively op
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"this one has a different game director, and if i remember, kratos' voice actor had some health issues, who knows what else went on, but the fact that the game went through development hell and had to have content cut because of too many cooks in the kitchen doesn't mean there wasn't filler content. those scenes with atreus and the giantess were so painful. i was mostly disappointed as well by visiting all the other realms.. none of them had much wow factor."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,but toxic masculinity bro. the gaming landscape has changed bro.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,we went from kratos brutally annihilating gods and being a savage to 2 kids picking fruit for 45 minutes
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i didnt make that connection on tlou 1 since it had a bit of action. tlou 2 was too walky talky for me as well at some points but i did get through it. dad simulators makes me laugh though, i can see it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,yeah i dont really think anyone is saying that idk what that comment is talking about. anyone claiming everything is copy paste or shovelware is clearly not at all tapped into the gaming scene.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,people!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,sad nerds on the internet.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,old guys that get mad at people buying skins
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,people don't really say it's dead but i see so many saying modern games suck. i think a lot of gamers let nostalgia hit too hard
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"oh yeah , thanks for tip."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,dig it!! ur right
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,oh i thought it was 100 fanvoted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"this is a really odd point to argue, this kind of thing is present in pretty much any rpg. in elden ring you can take down an eldritch god with a stick and swing a boulder around with one hand but god forbid you come up against a locked wooden door... they're gameplay elements that provide a break from endless hack and slash combat and drive the exploration elements. if you want exploration, you need barriers and obstacles. unless you want everything justified as 'you can't pass here because magic' then you've got to lean on the old suspension of disbelief. start adding in kratos cutscene capabilities to gow and you'd just end up with a poor arkham knight or spiderman clone."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"elden ring is seriously held back on a technical level by the dantelion engine. this engine looks and runs like shit, it's really obvious when you compare it to the demon's souls remake which was made using bluepoint's engine. but yeah if all you care about is gameplay and art direction, elden ring is the best of both."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"yep, its definitely that and not the recycled enemies and mini bosses."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,did you play the game? he gets verbally slapped around by his own son
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,for the platinum
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,you can play ng on the easiest difficulty.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,sounds like a roguelike to me!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"weird, i think the boss was the easiest part of the dlc, very generous with the health drops."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"the final boss never seemed particularly difficult, but the game can screw right off with how often the bonus fight in the second area is king hrolf."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,stack relic refresh glyphs and get the invincible barrier relic and you can give him a taste of his own medicine. almost infinite invincibility makes for a funny fight.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,do you mean the regular final boss before the credits? weirdly i thought it was pretty chill and did him first try every time without any problems.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,that's almost exactly my experience lolol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-08,"the unlock at the end is great. nothing game changing, but it's pretty cool."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,idk why man it just works with consoles for whatever reason. i think it's the experience of optimization in general with pc games. most ports today are trash. unless you have some rich tech the experience just doesn't feel as smooth
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,think its under accessibility.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,they both use the same engine and assets.?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"literally just cleared ng give me god of war this past weekend, if you have a decent build you'll do just fine, but with it being gmgow and ng it will punish you if you bring in random shit. x200b gna can eat a bag of dicks on ng gmgow though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,every new sony game has some aspect of the npc tagalong now if you've noticed. i'm guessing it's a directive from higher ups to increase engagement or whatever other bullshit buzz word executives are jerking themselves off over. they look at how successful and beloved tlou is and want to replicate it in every game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"days gone too, if theres room for all 4 uncharted games in there!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,dont forget tlou2 or death stranding.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i believe both ps and xbox do online the same way. there's no difference at all.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i also second this opinion, compared to my other consoles and pc, i am getting more enjoyment out of my ps5, but mostly because of the exclusive games are absolutely top tier"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i do own all of it except xbox but who need xbox when we have pc and i'll recommend the switch as video game console. ps5 top game tlou, gow, hzd, etc can barely be called games. they are mostly interactive movie with their assisted help and their constant interruption with cinematic or useless dialogue. want to play game? it's pc or switch the best option you want great visual graphics? then ps5 could be a choice"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,yeah i was thinking about getting a switch and playing mario and zelda etc. cause i love those. what are your favorite ps5 games? and how come the switch isnt one youd necessarily recommend?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"not funny, just what ive been playing"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,oh wow that would actually explain the comment.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"entirely removing hand to hand and shield as valid combat options, similar to doom eternal overhauling melee. along with a shockingly low amount of alternative finishers. like in 2018 where you could use melee hand to hand to build up the stagger meter or whatever faster for a finisher. with various finishers depending on the weapon you use. the combat was completley overhauled in ragnarok and it's weird a lot of people didn't really notice lol."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"it plays amazing, i have a lower mid range pc, i am easily able to run it at 1080p 60fps on medium settings."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"lame complaint, given how extraordinarily good the rest of the game is"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"no i didnt , why you think i asked?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,ik but then its kinda... too easy i guess?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"repost from under another comment i was an idiot and didn't realize you earned a ridiculous amount of fleeting echos in !greece! and was neglecting to spend those on chests or upgrades before my final fight attempts. the first time i upgraded my attackshealthrage, i won without even using a resurrection stone."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"nothing on sigrun from 2018, screw that bitch!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,you mean 2018 and ragnarok? they do a lot. but i meant a third game with the more or less just the same to expand the main quest line.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,same with movies and other media. theyd have better success sticking to the formula for longtime fans but who knows
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i think the same too, it's not the 360ps3 era anymore."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"you might already know this but most of playstations best games are also available on pc, so if you were already considering a switch, id go the nintendo route. its also worth noting that the switchs successor will likely be released this year."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"algorithmkun saw god of war praise, thought it was the 2022 game awards season and swooped in playing defense for elden ring."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-09,it would not
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"except you still have that stun focused stance in the third weapon, it's just not unarmed anymore. 2018 was co.pletely reliant on runic attacks or stun blitzing. there's so many more viable options now, but still runic or stun builds for those that want them. almost every enemy has 1 or 2 finishers for each weapon atill"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"yeah, except when a major part of the game is fighting said enemies, lol."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"i said that because you said ng increases difficulty, which is not true."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"yeah okay, thats the problem then. i always got 2040k echoes there and spent it for everything possible"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i meant he was obviously missing something. that was definitely not a hard part of the game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i have heard that i am guessing if i wait for the new switch that i can play all of the original switch games on the new console? does a switch look good on a 4k oled tv?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-09,that does make sense!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"again, hardly an issue"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"yeah sorry, it increases difficulty on gow 2018, not on ragnarok. im an idiot"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"the next console will likely be backwards compatible, but theres no official announcement yet so its not exactly a guarantee. it wont look bad, but you definitely wont be taking advantage of it since the switch tops out at 1080p docked and the internal resolution of most games is typically lower than that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"yea, youre delusional at this point. tlou and uncharted better lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,no biggy.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"tlou and uncharted are great. gow 2018 is a phenomenal game with the one flaw that it suffers from limited variety in enemy design and you couldn't play it? that seems delusional to me, but it's your opinion, albeit a strange one."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"your complaint about gow is lack of enemy diversity and tlou and uncharted are your choice to compare against? there's less than 10 enemy types in either of those two across their whole series hell, uncharted has guy with gun, guy with automatic gun and guy with rocket launcher and that's about it. don't get me wrong, they're both fantastic games but when your complaint with a game is repetitive enemies, comparing it to those two is quite something."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"yeah, its a pretty big flaw if you ask me. also garbage side quests and a lot of backtracking."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"your lack of understanding game design is astounding. uncharted and the last of us features combat encounters that are different from one another. uncharted has these big, sprawling fights with different map designs, varied gameplay, crazy ass set pieces and cover placements, which force you to adapt. the last of us, in the same nature, also has different approaches to level design, from cover shooting to hide and seek to all out kiting enemies while utilizing every thing in your armory. these games make it a point to always expose the player to varied combat encounters, even with the enemies technically being the same. god of war however has no variety in enemy type or environments. youre always going into a zone and fighting the same enemies in a big circle for 20 hours. there is no strategy or randomness, just stand there and hack and slash until every thing dies on screen on repeat. the story isnt as good as tlou, the set pieces arent as good as uncharted. its a solid game that is brought down by its horrid repetitiveness, which critics agree is the games achilles heel."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"yeah, the 94 metascore says otherwise. sounds like you were just bad at the game and need a place to lash out."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"wow, you either really like to exaggerate or you never played more than maybe an hour of gow? in your second paragraph you state no variety yet you can google the enemy lists and see the good 20 or so different enemy types split down to 7 or so sub groups. i'm not even arguing that it has a wide variety just that it most certainly has more variety than tlou and uncharted. remember your original argument was that there's no variety in enemies. since it's pretty clear that's not the case you also shifted the goal posts in the first paragraph from enemy variety to environment and encounter design. you're comparing apples to oranges here though since in both tlou and uncharted you have stealth as an option most of the time. this isn't a possibility in gow and would be weird if it was considering the nature of the game and it's story. gow does have very simple combat arenas but they're not just flat spaces. there's often an element or two of traversal but it's limited because when melee is your primary mode of combat you don't want to spend all of your time running up and down annoying obstacles to chase down enemies. as far as strategy goes in fights, stick gow on an actually challenging difficulty and try playing it then. if you're just hack and slashing and everything is dying you've got to be on story or casual difficulty. you say i've got a lack of understanding of game design which i find hilarious. i think you've just got a hate boner for gow and it pisses you off when people actually like it. is it a flawless game? no but no game is. do those flaws make it unplayable trash as you seem to think? not at all, hence the astounding success it had."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"you cant be bad at god of war, its made for children lmao. i did not die once in my playthrough. i also can name 10 better games than this garbage."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"yeah, i know what difficulty you played on"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,what was the most time intensive part of that costume?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,it looks like ash in apex legends

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,a quick estimation for this one i'd say was around 200300 euro.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"that would be the belthip armor. it took a lot of time to measure, draw out the patterns, create a mockup, and then cut out all the seperate parts and start detailing them. and after that, priming, painting, assembling the whole thing, making sure you can still move and sit etc. it was intense, but fun!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,that doesn't seem too bad considering the quality of the final product.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,wait. did it come with the dice? cuz that's fucking neat if it did.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,unironically the best depiction of mjolnir i've seen in media.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,too bad the bag is clearly too small for that warhammer.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,how does the hammer feel? does it have any weight to it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,i just want the dice.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,does it include a cd?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,i cant justify ces without a physical copy of the game  all dlc.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,hows the quality of the hammer? im waiting for mine.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,this is badass as fuck
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,that looks sick ngl.. does the hammer seem to be heavy?

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,i didn't know that had a set of dice to go with it. i know it's got other cool shit but honestly i'm jealous of the dice haha.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,i thought this subreddit agreed on no preorders?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,wow a cheapass plastic hammer. surely that was worth paying several times normal price for a game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,enjoy your plastic toy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,looks cheap. makes sense tho because sony has never cared about quality
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"too bad the hammer sucks, how can they do a collectors edition without a badass statue of kratos??"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,so how exactly did you get the game 3 days early?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,that's fucking cool.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,imagine having the gow mjolnir and mcu mjolnir then going out with your sibling dressed as loki for cosplaylarping nonsense

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,where did you get yours from? i bought mine on psdirect and mine says preparing to ship.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,i also ordered the ce  hope mine comes early tooo

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,it did! collectors edition and jotnar editions have different ones
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,it is very accurate to described norse mythology.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,it fits. its a bag of holding.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,you just have to warm up it first
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"it looked pretty hefty from the official unboxing video from the way they were handling it, so i too would like to know lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,its a digital soundtrack
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,game discs aren't included anymore due to digital consoles. you wouldn't buy the ce if it came with a disc you couldn't use with a digital console. edit  typo
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,2 cds actually. 2 cds nuts.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,very good! has a good weight to it and feels solidly built. it does not feel like a prop you would get at spirit halloween.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"it does, its probably between 23lbs"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"yes, it let me redeem the pre order items but not the game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"yeah i guess, the hammer. the hammer for thor, the hammer made especially for thor, thor's hammer. that hammer?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,yes you are the only person in the entire world to think that.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"who said that? i sure as hell have no issue preordering from game devs with good track records. i preordered elden ring, and i preordered this."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"that's typically what plastic toys are for, yes."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,looks pretty nice to me
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,get rid of the mcu mjolnir it wasnt even close to the real and how effective it was.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"and now i have an idea for the next convention. one brother dress as captain america, the other as mcu thor, and me and gow thor. i have mjolnir and storm breaker, just gotta wait for my collector edition to come in"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,those dice might be the coolest addition items i have ever seen. that shit is dope.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"i'm honestly super jealous. the little minis you can use too! as an avid dnd player, i would kill for those! so cool looking!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"why?... i mean sure... cool, but why? do have to roll damage on every hit?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,so cool. 8
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,have to be able to fit it through the opening though
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,came here for this
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,they could still give you the cdkey with the cd then theres no problems.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"that logic is entirely backwards. if you don't want a physical edition of he game, why is a steelbook case a selling point?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"then they should make a digital edition of the ce, instead of pulling this dogshit move of no discs in any edition."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,does it feel like it would break if you swung it? definitely not asking because i wanna act like im thor or anything
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"can't wait for it to come, 3 more days..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,oh nice

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,i really wish i could have justified 350 for the jotnar edition but alas it was just way too much money for something not even including an artbook and i say that having the stalker 2 ultimate edition on preorder
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,nothing can top my butt stallion plush from the tiny tinas collection treasure box. nothing.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i've just got done playing the sinking city, a lovecraftinspired adventure game which is sandbox style. it was overambitious of the studio and it has some jank, but there are some interesting ideas. one of those ideas is that since you're a newcomer, you don't know the town and no one will tell you shit, so if you're looking for a guy, you don't know where he lives, if you're looking for the old steel mill, you don't know where it's located. so, you actually have to talk to people, or go to city hall, or the police department and try to scrounge up some records, then you place a marker on your map. i liked the inmersiveness of it, but there is definitely a flip side to the qualityoflife ease of markers."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"start playing more indie games. modern aaa games are designed for broad market appeal, which means they need to be playable for the lowest common denominator, i.e. the stupidest person you personally know. can't have them getting stuck and complaining to their friends how confusing and stupid a game is, because that shit will hurt sales, and less sales might be the difference between your studio getting the axe or not from some bean counter in accounting management. indie games don't need to worry about that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i feel the same way about a lot of aaa serious games. try ghost of tsushima. it's got the ubisoftassassin's creed style open world, bases to beat, etc, but the gameplay is actually fun, there's minimal hud, and not excessive hand holding. the swordplay is top notch, possibly the best in any video game ever. one of the few serious aaa game i've enjoy also, nintendo games. mario odyssey and super mario 3d world, both new zeldas  fun gameplay and not really any of that stuff you're describing."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"the pinnacle of player agency is a game that nobody even knows about. lamulana. this game is a journey where you do all the work. record hints, find hidden rooms, unlock areas. you can hard and softlock yourself. there are failable puzzles related to the main plot that require you to load a save or restart the game. there are traps everywhere that you need to remember. enemies are assholes. everything is a puzzle, the world is interconnected. the map is gigantic, the bosses seem insurmountable at times and you are married to your jump direction at all times. and the remake is the nice version. the original version has only one save point, you cannot cross spikes by walking in from the side, and you have to figure out what software combinations even do, ranging from life changing comfort, like being able to warp to certain map areas, to stupid bullshit, like changing the end credits color, or transforming all your weights into oolong tea. you really had to experiment and learn. the game rewards you for being persistent, but it also rewards you with...more game! it's a soulcrushing journey to do blind, but it lets you be the master of your own success. and i respect that."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i would recommend you play elden ring or any of the from software titles. challenging and no hand holding. the witness is a great puzzle game with no hand holding. for fps go play tarkov if you want immersive.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"try switching up genres and styles of games. sometimes the things we enjoyed aren't what our brains are craving as we get older. that's okay. but i promise you there's others out there you'll enjoy. maybe look at what your general life looks like and try and find some games that help support it. for example a super high intense stressful day isn't always the most fun and enjoyable to then throw ourselves into stressful gaming environments. if you work a very mind numbing job. play something that's very brain game kinda feel. puzzles and things like that. i hope this helps! i felt very similar at one point and eventually switched up to some more cozy and party games, did the trick."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i'm deep in my obsession with the connected games made by remedy, so i'm gonna say check out alan wake, control, and alan wake 2. rather than hand holding, they reward thorough exploration and sometimes the solution or path forward is so unclear you might even get lost. the gameplay style varies quite a bit between all 3, but the story is connected and really the story, characters, and world building are the best part of these games. if you like weird fiction like twin peaks, xfiles, house of leaves, scp, etc. combined with some fun and quirky finnish humor throughout, and great multimedia elements like music and live action tvcommercialsmovies within the games. alan wake is the oldest of those games, and in terms of gameplay it shows. it plays like a 3rd person action shooter with horror elements. the combat is basic and fine. you have a flashlight to burn darkness off of enemies and guns to shoot them to death once the dark is gone. you basically are stephen king trapped in your own story, trying to save your wife and yourself. control is not a sequel to alan wake, and is instead an over the top action shooter with badass superpowers. they do take place in the same world so you can find references to the events of the first game and some characters featured in alan wake. it has a story based dlc called awe which is a direct tiein with alan wake, dealing with some of the aftermath of the first game. control has spooky elements still, but since you're basically a super powered jedi in this one it's the least horror of the games. alan wake 2 just came out a couple months ago and is straight survival horror. limited ammo and resources, dangerous enemies, combat plays in the vein of a modern resident evil. you alternate between playing alan wake and a new character, an fbi agent investigating a crime that she doesn't know is connected to alan wake at the start. you also get a fun detective crime board like something out of true detective. the pieces of evidence you find by exploring the world, don't explore enough and you'll miss information that helps flesh out the world, characters, events, etc. you can beat the game with an incomplete board without punishment, finding those little details is left to you if you like that. if you don't want to buy 3 games, skip the first alan wake and watch a youtube recap of it so you understand the story. you won't develop bonds with any of the quirky characters from it that show up in the other games, but it's not going to ruin the experience."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,baldurs gate 3 gave me that feel where you goto bed thinking about the game and you're excited to wake up and boot it up again. lies of p also did that for me. i do find that harder to come by as i'm aging since i've experienced a lot of good video games. i think a masterpiece or a game that feels like it was made for you comes around every few years.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i only find that problem on aaa games or what you want call them. they don't trust players to do anything and have nice graphics and tell you all you need to do. i couldn't finish god of war because that got bored after 3 hours.. i do enjoy games that are older like recently started playing skyrim again. and was fun. new games from big game studios aren't worth of anyone's time since they either focus only pvp or make sure everyone can finish them no matter how bad they are at games. i don't find any challenges in modern games really. try some indie games they are awesome most parts. they not have resources to solve puzzles for you and some are challenging but not many have good graphics etc. they may not look pretty outside but inside they are better that any big game studio can give
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i think it's your choice of games. those games are all mediocre and kinda the same in a lot of ways. try a different genre, maybe. if you find those games boring, then maybe we have similar tastes, and i could recommend some if you want."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"try baldur's gate 3. make your own damned decisions and live with the consequences. its not an action game, though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"maybe try indie studio games. my recent and probably all time favorites are from such indie studios. the long dark from hinterland studios frostpunk from 11bit studios don't know if they considered indie studio anymore, they have some interesting games in their repertoire both produced my favorite games in the last couple of years. admittedly with the early access trend bs you really have to do your homework and have faith in unknown to me indie studios, but in those cases it paid off greatly for me"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i have the same problem with hogwarts legacy. my character keeps repeating shit even when i am doing that part of the puzzle, it annoys me a lot. i believe that in the tomb raider games you can set the frequency of tips and i love that. set it to low so if i get absolutely stuck i get a tip."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,check out ghost of tsushima if you haven't already. they only system they have for hints is the wind blowing in a certain direction and even that you essentially have to manual trigger with the touchpad. probably the last game i got lost in.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i grew up addicted to gaming. then around 19 or so, halo 4 came out. i beat it and had zero connection or interest in playing again. the game was good, just had so much going on in life it was hard to dive in and feel lost in any game. gta5 was literally the only game i could enjoy just cause i like driving. took until about age 28 before i got lost in a game again. this game was rust. 3k hours later it's still my favorite game. i absolutely just get lost in it. star citizen is my newest game i've been able to get lost in. what i'm getting at here is, you may never feel the same about games as you grow older. but there will be a game eventually lol."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"this is part of why i have been playing more indie and aa games than aaa games these days. the aaa games definitely are moving towards lowest common denominator gameplay, and the ability of indie and aa devs to make really solid games has increased."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,yeah the constant hints are ruining the experience. in my opinion the game that stuck gold in balacing hints with letting the player figure it out themselves was uncharted 1 with its hint system in the puzzles. although i don't know if that will work just as good in open world games.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,a ton of triple a games are like this and on purpose. they want their game to be able to be played by literally everyone. this includes people who will drop a game if they get stuck for a few minutes because they missed something. it is just another reason why indie games have the amount of popularity that they do. i get into slumps sometimes as well with thinking maybe i don't like games anymore. i usually swap genres or try something new to relight the fire.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"the first issue is an issue with ubisoft, ea, and actiblizz most vibrantly. sometimes also capcom depending on the game. avoid games with microtransactions. the second is an issue in particular with sony games, i find. an edgier person would describe it as soullessness but i think it's more to do with development mentality. the combat, story, and exploration of many sony games feel like they are made by separate teams, and designed to be completely skippable. difficulty settings are flat tuners and the games don't have obvious, polished defaults. puzzles are hinted so aggressively they may as well be cutscenes. the actual story is through cutscenes, rarely with major player interaction. the result is that, for me, gow, horizon, ghost of tsushima, and the new spidermen all feel like the same games, and all are 3 vaguely flavorful parts of games stapled together as a polished but incongruent amalgam, designed so that anyone who wants any one piece of any can enjoy that and ignore the rest. the result is that people who want a game that feels like a cohesive whole can't get one, but can't quite say what's wrong because these beautiful, polished, open experiences aren't satisfying. the successes lately have been games with singular visions, cohesive wholes, and frankly crackhead passionate dev teams. fromsoft after miyazaki became a lead director and then president became nothing but this, and sekiro and elden ring remain crown jewels as modern cohesive games. indie games like hades, hollow knight, and celeste all succeed for similar reasons. doom 2016 and eternal present fantastic, polished single player challenges that are easy to get immersed into. bg3 is so functionally cohesive that it goty'd as a crpg in 2023, and not just for astarion's voice acting. and finally, there's nintendo. metroid dread alone got me off the keyboard and helped me appreciate single player games, and the game is very happy to let you get lost and kill you. both modern zeldas are excellent immersive unguided exploration games, happy to let you die and get lost and hide their deeper mechanics for you to find. there's plenty to enjoy. what you're seeing is primarily an issue with microtransactions and projects too big to risk failing. both are avoidable."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"it's sort of important to remember that most games, especially big aaa blockbusters like the ones you listed, have to be lcd because they need to sell as many copies as possible just to make money back. the average adult in the us reads at a 7th or 8th grade level and, given the typical work schedule, can't afford to spend 30 minutes of the 3 hours they get to play during the week failing a puzzle. or, at least, they are unwilling to stay engaged when they feel like they're failing while clockwatching. i'll be 40 this year, so i don't think it's necessarily aging out of gaming but more my tastes have changed dramatically since i was in my 20's here's some stuff i've played recently that really sucked me in cyberpunk 2077 with the pl expansion  the main game is way better than it was, pl is amazing. still has some bugs and it still has the optic batman vision thing, but it doesn't really lead you around by the nose too much. baldur's gate 3  just solid all the way around. tons of choice, tons of secrets, puzzles and quests that will just let you fail, while the game continues. pentiment  honestly sounds like the most boring thing on the planet, but it's well written and is willing to let you just fuck everything up. not much action in the typical sense though, kind of like disco elysium where it's mostly just talking to people. neon white  pure action, story doesn't matter in the slightest, so maybe not what you're looking for. it will show you where some of the planned shortcuts are after you've gotten a certain number of points in the level, but there are more shortcuts they don't show and it doesn't preclude you from finding those shortcuts before they're revealed. if you want a pure puzzler that's not going to help you in the slightest i'd recommend return of the obra dinn or the case of the golden idolwhich, to me, isn't quite as good as obra dinn, but still scratches that same itch. i'd also point to rogulites and metroidvanias as genres that generally don't do much in the way of handholding. if you haven't played hades or hollow knight, those are great entries in their genres. there's also a ton of games these days where the whole point is to drop you in a world where you're clueless about everything and have to piece it together yourself, maybe even what you're supposed to be doing. elden ring is a big one, and i think most of the souls games can fit into that genre but i'm talking about games like tunic, outer wilds, and chants of sennar. also idk many good memory games, but card shark is a game that's solely about learning how to cheat at card games and then executing those cheats under pressure."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"play project zomboid, the tutorials pretty helpful but not very handholdey!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"part of the immersion is being a child, the game could have had graphics from the 90s and people were still immersed and hyped. if you're just after stories many mediums provide great stories for less effort and less time investment. community is one of the last things that get me excited about games and interesting mechanics. this is why some mmos are good for me and some esports. ultimately you don't have to play games. i only really played one game for a long time and i wasn't really much for a gamer. after i quit i tried other hobbies like reading and historypolitics, last year i even bought a piano."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i highly recommend the metro series. once you've played the first one you can pretty much turn on ranger hardcore mode, which disables hud. the immersion is absolute. only your eyes, your ears, your weapons and a hostile, haunted world to navigate. metro last light also has such a great story for a shooter, and some really gripping moments. love creeping around and onetapping fools with throwing knives and silenced revolver. just don't kill anyone important if you want the good ending, in fact follow a guide to get it, because it is that good. i recently started playing cyberpunk. i don't think i've ever been so impressed with a game world. i spent 30 hours in act 1 just exploring, doing side quests, finding movement exploits, and holding my jaw so that it doesn't drop to the floor and hit me in the balls. yes it's still an open world game with objective markers. but even if it were a walking simulator with no story at all, it would be worth full price just to explore the incredible detail sculpted into this world and characters. it's also surprisingly optimized. it's the bestlooking game i've ever played, yet i get 60fps on 3060ti with everything on high including raytracing, 1440p with dlss set to quality. i turn raytracing off during combat which gives me 100fps."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,some aaa games are like this but still lots of games that will give you a run for your money. i just went through my steam library and for third person action games yeah probably gonna be tough to find a game that isn't going to hold your hand. i went through a point n click phase just because i needed some harder games. i also went through a gamecube emulation phase for the same reason. i got stuck on chibirobo for like 2 hours and it was just something stupid i wasn't looking for. it's bitter sweet. i don't want to waste time doing stupid stuff but i don't want to be told how to do everything. i played witcher 3 with the compass off for 3040 hours and that definitely enhanced the experience. npc says go talk to that person on the hill and instead of just looking at my compass i actually look over and see them waiting in the distance.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"it's because you play shit tier games. my rule is to only play genredefining masterpieces or games i really want to play. don't play games just for the sake of playing them or engaging in the discourse. just finished witcher 3 and mass effect legendary currently playing elden ring and baldur's gate 3 for me to invest 50 hours in a videogame, it better be a masterpiece. good or really good games don't cut it for me anymore. i'm too busy, so i only make time for the games that are actually worth it."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"it's about target audience. some games want to be as inclusive as possible so they have as many sales as possible. had a friend literally say yesterday that puzzles in games are stupid easy these days. one thing to consider is not everyone is a gamer, but lots of people enjoy games. so while things are obvious for you, this might be their first noncod game or something and they might not recognize all the things you do in a game. we've played for decades and know off colour walls can be smashed, or whatever. to others, it could cause them to stop playing. also, keep in mind, these studios do a lot of play testing. and i'm sure the points where it says hey check that out is where a lot of people stop playing, or at least the data shows that. i think a worthwhile consideration for developers is an assistive mode that will take a line like we need to find a way through here, find a path! and that after a minute or two, if on assistive mode, the dialogue will say hmm, those stones look loose, maybe we can knock a way through there! kind of thing. gives them a chance to figure it out, but get help if they need to. not to mention, games are so god awful huge that sometimes, there's too many things and some people might get overwhelmed without some assistance. very rarely are games, outside of soulsbourne games, designed for long term hardcore gamers."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"interesting once you leave the tutorial area in tears of the kingdom, the game really stops holding your hands. like its really easy to miss some key basic power ups like expanding your inventory, increasing your battery capacity and auto build which is the thing that makes the building mechanic actually useful. hell its even easy to miss the paraglider if you go out to explore before heading towards the central hub first. the game also rewards players for solving puzzles the wrong way which is pretty unique."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"annoying as it may be, there's valid logic from the dev standpoint. if you think of all the games that you stopped playing halfthrough in the past, it was typically that a weird puzzle or unclear mechanic stumped you in a way that broke your immersion by over exerting your patience. it's not as if in these days we have shortage of alternatives, so whenever a game is either under or overstimulating, we won't hesitate to just play something else. that said  i agree they're indeed going too far in the handholding direction. an option to turn these hints off would indeed be an ideal middle ground, for sure."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i would wager hand holding in gaming is becoming more popular because of the rampant microtransactionbattle passconstant stream of information offered by most free and increasingly, paid games now. the constant dopamine drip caused by these trends in gaming has created a generation where they crave it causing attention span to suffer as a result. if you didn't have the hand holding in longer, narrative driven games, it's likely the modern generation would give up playing them. unpopular opinion none of the games op mentions have difficult or even somewhat difficult puzzles in them. they're just perceived that way because of what i mentioned above. even the talos principle 2, a masterpiece in the puzzle genre, has easier puzzles overall than its predecessor. game design is just reacting to the trends in the industry and the shifts in behaviors and attitudes of their general audience. edit my childhood was spent playing games in the mid 90s to early 2010s. the gaming industry overall approached game design entirely different from what it does today. game guides were popular both in print and online and i actually felt rewarded for completing a game. i agree with op on their take on today's games. i pick up a lot of them and can't even push myself to complete them, not only for the reasons they mention, but for other reasons that just weren't prevalent in gaming a decade or two ago."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,being force fed the obvious is media in general these days. it's exasperated by the fact that it's never been easier to do research and look up information on gamesmoviesshows. but it's hard finding things that force you to use your brain. i think it's too risky for business so companies are afraid to do anything but force feed you the answers.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,play oblivion or older fallout games. no handholding there buddy and they are still very playable just dont look to hard or closely at them if youre a graphics freak
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"sony games are probably the worst games for hand holding, which is odd as the actual gameplay in their first party games is always rather shallow and simple. i was recently playing through the last us part 1, and got very frustrated by the game design. there isn't much to the game already cutscene, go down a corridor, combat, cusctene, cutscene, cutscene, combat, but then to make things worse, after each stint of combat, i just want to look around the environment, find stuff or just appreciate the environmental design, but after 5 seconds you get a loud noise, and a big flashing button icon to press for the game to tell you where to go. sure, it's giving you the option to get the hint, but you are interrupted over and over by the noise and massive button prompt over and over. the game is already frustingly basic regardless. i've loved playstations games since ps1, but probably about halfway through the ps4 era i started to get really tired of their lack of gameplay mechanics and over reliance on cinematic set pieces, qte, and just an overall lack of engaging gameplay, or actual gameplay for that matter"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"turn off or minimize the ui in games that you are good at or very familiar with. in a game with good level design the world itself will guide you where you need to be, and you'll find yourself doing more exploring and noticing the world around you since you aren't just staring at a marker on your compass or checking your ammo. combat without a ui is a bit different from game to game, but in most games once you click with it you're already most of the way there. you just get a feel for how you're doing based on the sounds and feedback. sorry if this is a silly answer i've just been playing doom 2016 and eternal with no ui lately and realized how much cooler of an experience it is!"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"not all games are like this and if you're someone who grew up with the development of the game market it's especially off putting. i think the reason they did it is because gaming is a vastly under utilized market that is growing very fast, so big developers sometimes care more about accessibility to the masses, i don't think it's having the intended effect though. but it's still an emerging market and people and companies are experimenting. both of those game your mentioning are by far the worst offenders in recent gaming news too. try lies of p. for a new game it's amazing and very hard. so much so that immersion has to be a part of the design otherwise you will die or have no motivation to continue. fromsoft and their style has grabbed a lot of my attention lately because of that. also fuck ubisoft. they just destroy franchises at this point."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"first off, you can get lost in a game. depends on the game you're playing for how much it will hold your hand and guide you. crpgs like baldur's gate 3 will tell you where the main quest is, but otherwise it's on you to find side quests, hidden items, npcs, etc. second, knowing where to gowhat to do is a good thing, some older games could result in hours of retreading old ground just trying to figure out what to do and that sucked. it's just a matter of how aggressive the game is about it. god of war definitely backseats way too much, but there's a middle ground that works. dead space for example got it right imo. it has a button to press that will give you a guide if you need it, otherwise do as you please."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"the problem is you're playing aaa games, aka trash. in recent years indie studios have been putting out the most innovative and immersive games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,play zelda tears of the kingdom
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"to me it seems like most modern games aaa are afraid to allow the player to fail, they also seem to assume that you've never played a video game before. i had the same problem in horizon forbidden west, most of the time aloy told me there was a puzzle in the area before i'd had 2 seconds to notice it myself. i guess its so they can have more mass appeal but at least let me turn that stuff off in the options, i have played the first horizon game, i know to use the focus any time theres a puzzle around, i've also played tons of games, i can figure out if theres a cracked wall it might be breakable. subnautica was one of my favourite games of recent years because they just plop you on an ocean planet and task you with finding a way home. you get vague hints as you go but it relies heavily on the player scanning things and reading the entries as well as thoroughly exploring themselves. the sequel, below zero, went and added these typical modern game features, you get more hints and they are more obvious too, any time you go vaguely near something important they give you a marker for it, it really ruined alot of the fun for me after the first game. this is also the reason i like soulsborn games, they aren't afraid to let you fail and the only hints for puzzles you get are item descriptions and npc dialogue."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,the handholding has been a trend i've been upset about since legend of zelda oot like 25 years ago. it's gotten worse for a lot of mainstream games but the core problem isn't new. the live service problem likewise has been growing for a console generation or two now. on one hand it sounds like you might need better games many great suggestions here but also you might need to look beyond video games for managing your mental health.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i really enjoyed metroid dread, but when i finished it, i just thought it felt. . . off, somehow. i loaded up a second playthrough and it didn't take too long before it clicked. ah ha!! you don't get to explore in that game! yes, the map is very big with lots of branching paths and twists and turns and hidden passages, but you never get lost or have to backtrack. in fact, you can't get lost, so you never need to backtrack. that game does a very good job of railroading you along the one correct path that you need to be on. especially in the early game, you are constantly falling into pits that you can't jump back out of, or sliding down hills that you can't climb back up, or closing thermal doors that can never be reopened, but the end result is always the same you have no choice but to forge ahead the intended way. great game, but i felt it was a little lacking in the exploration department."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"idk man, if a game drops me into a huge open world and goes ok go explore, have fun i'll get so overwhelmed and just drop the game entirely. i wanna start elden ring but i'm afraid i'll hate it. i love a good, linear story."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,it normally boils down for me that i'm not playing the right game... why game pass or ps is great ..i can start a couple games until one clicks and then find games like that.. i'm in a lull right now so going back to my favorites that i haven't played in a few years
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,you're playing the wrong games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,one of the very few complaints i had with hfw was that aloy would start giving hints before you had a chance to think about the puzzle yourself. sometimes the hints would be in a textrecording you had to scan. i much preferred this kind of 'assist'.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,try system shock remake
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,play elden ring or baldurs gate 3

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,get away from aaa and all this melts away. the indie scene resparked my love for games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,try remnant from the ashes or remnant 2... those games don't hold your hand at all.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,rdr2. thats all imma say
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,play divinity 2. its kind of confusing at the start but once u understand the controls the game is super immersive. 3 hours pass like nothing and u feel u can do sooooo many more things as u explore.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,play tears of the kingdom
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,escape from tarkov definitely doesnt hold your hand
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"play morrowind. it barely tells you shit. no quest markers, you gotta figure out where that secret drop is by reading the journal providing directions to the tree off the path down the way. the only hand holding that game does is tell you the world is doomed and you need to reload if you kill a story relevant npc when they need to be alive. it's also old af so cheap as chips these days if not outright freeware also factorio. it has a few tutorials for how mechanics work, like train signalling. but otherwise it's up to you to use your big boy brain to get from mining ore by hand to automating a factory that will launch a rocket."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"play elden ring. no goals to do, you're completely free to do whatever in the lands between."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"lol people recommend the ultimate game for not giving you directions, elden ring, and this guy is all nah not for me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"for some puzzle immersion without handholding, i liked cocoon."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,zelda botw  totk are perfect for this gripe.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"mighr get me lynched, but i got tears of the kingdom for christmas and was impressed by how much it just lets you figure stuff out. it gives you a basic premise for the puzzle, then a trickier, practical application for the premise. just like the older games. very much enjoying it so far."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"have you tried breath of the wild, or tears of the kingdom? they aren't handholdy, do not have any invasive popups, and for the most part, don't tell you where to go. if you haven't, definitely do botw first, as totk is a direct sequel."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,elden ring and baldurs gate 3 dont hold your hand at all
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"might i suggest monster hunter world, its poppin right now but it has always been super fun, and it wont hold your hand as much"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,47 and going through my longest streak of not gaming since i stared when i was a kid. four months now. been wondering if it was me or just the games these days.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"if you want a game that pulls no punches, and you can really get lost in that has a sense of victory and loss. play escape from tarkov. super realistic shooter, no ads or popups in game, hell forget about a tutorial this game doesn't even have a map for ya. quest descriptions are vague and only point you in the right direction, you gotta do all the figuring out yourself you die, you lose all the gear you brought with you. definitely no handholding. but not for the casual gamer either really."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"kingdom come deliverance hit just the right notes for me, i felt lost in it's world just walking and seeing what would happen and who would i find, and whenever i wanted to go back to the main plot the game would point me in the right direction if i needed it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,it's been a while since i've played a game that was challenging in a fun way.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i don't mean to sound pretentious but i think the problem is all of those games are aaa mainstream games that were designed as products first and video games second. its sort of an unspoken thing that even 'm' rated games have tutorialshints that are made for children because children are their target demographic even though the game is 'rated' for adults. adults generally grow out of video games obviously all of you reading are here with me and exceptions to the rule, they are made for children, and so you have to make every game as if the player's very first video game because for some of them it is, and if that first experience is overwhelming and confusing they might never buy another one. thats my theory. all that being said, not all games are like this. i find that almost every single 'action adventure' genre game like the ones you mentioned are like that, but actual puzzle games would never tell you their solution even if you desperately want it, actual platforming games would never tell you wherewhen to jump. actual exploration games wouldn't show you where to go etc.... but yeah mainstream action adventure games try to have a little bit of something for everyone so they water all those things down to kind of diversify the gameplay loop but really what happens is it makes parts of the game not fun for anyone who has played a game like that before."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i like subtle hints but yeah there should be an option in every game with puzzles to turn the hints related to the puzzles off. star wars jedi fallen order is pretty subtle with the puzzle hints, tomb raider, uncharted, and a plague tale requiem were also subtle from what i remember. hogwarts wasn't too bad either."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"not only would i recommend elden ring but any of the souls games. they dont hold your hand, they have unique and interesting lore to discover and theorize about, the gameplay is extremely well done, and the environment and art for the games are insane."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"play anno 18, fantastic rts game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"my wife and i get bored with all these games too. until we gave baldurs gate 3 a try and holy shit! we thought itd be too slow paced being turn based, but we were wrooong. its so much fun!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,bg3 doesn't! so many different ways to solve situations. i was breaking some guys out of prison and was supposed to find the dudes tools. i found a path behind his room and busted the wall down with my fighter.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i feel like the two jedi games did a fairly good job of letting me get lost
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"stop playing aaa titles from ea, ubisoft etc. sunk your teeth into some smaller indie games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"if you got a switch, maybe try breath of the wild or tears of the kingdom?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,play metroid games. there is little to no hand holding.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,probably already on here but give baldurs gate 3 a try. i get fully immersed and there's not much handholding
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,the problem is that these games are open world story driven games. they dont want you to get lost in the world cos it would ruin the flow of the story. the reason why elden ring could do that shit is cos the story is the least important thing in the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"try the dying light games, especially 2. lots of jumping puzzles that you have to figure out with zero hints."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"yeah it does feel like modern gaming is trying to hold peoples hands. maybe thats why im not playing games as much in general. cant even replay marvels spiderman not the sequel, havent played yet."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"man, forbidden west was such a slog because aloy never fucking shut up. jesus christ at least let me attempt to figure it out before telling me what to do ffs. really a huge oversight in design when you cant turn hints off."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,have you tried outer wilds?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,playing the wrong games
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"play breath of the wild and then tears of the kingdom, the beauty of the games is in their freedom."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i saw your edit, and i will say elden ring is not my type of game either and i still loved it for what it did so well that it swayed me. my friends ask which souls i'm doing next and probably not. hollow knight is the metroidvania that doesn't tell you what to do but is wonderfully designed to reward your exploration"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"uncharted is what your looking for, assumed you haven't played it yet. you can get absolutely lost in some puzzles and the game's hints come after like 10 minutes of randomly running around and it's just like this you hold the arrow up for the hint, the game makes drake look at what you should focus on and that's it, maybe with a three word text under it like shoot the barrel or even just r2 to shoot. but it comes after a while. some puzzles will make you go crazy. the treasure vault in uc 1 made me rage and i completed it in over an hour's when it takes literally 230 minutes."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"try vr game, like saint sinners or soemthign nice to get lost there u have soen funlol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"try baldur's gate 3. the only thing remotely related to people hinting at how to defeat someone is either a something that comes up in discussion with npc's that you can miss so the game rewards exploration and engagement b you right clicking on the enemy and clicking on examine, which tells you their resistances and weaknesses, but it's something you choose to do. nothing else. the game doesn't hand hold you and on the contrary you can do whatever the fuck you want"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"so, elden ring? dark souls? just play all the fromsoft games dude , thatll fix all your issues!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"not to be that guy, but... baldurs gate 3,homie."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i don't know if this will help but... honestly i agree with your sentiments on those games. triple a games particularly western triple a games have lost the plot. i honestly cannot stand so many modern triple a games they are so far up their own asses in their pretentiousness its vile. o luk we have goodr graphics and biiig holly woof voice aktors we are movie now. like they aren't so much trying to make fun video games anymore as they are trying to make interactive movies. the immersion get chopped off as a result. i agree with people recommending elden ring but if your not gonna like your not gonna like it. for me i broke out of this by just completely avoiding the bs these devs and sony and ms and nintendo all tell me. i always wait to see what a game is like once it's launched and if it looks like a movie i won't like it i already know, i'm not a movie buff i prefer games. i get you wanna get lost in games but honestly it's tough these days. yeah there are really fun really good games, but those games we used to play that really took us in to another world are less common than they used to be. the only game of the top is totk elden ring and bg3. there are probably many others but they are a dime a dozen these days. alternatively you could dive in to more indie games which is what i've done. two games i can say there are crosscode and chained echoes. two very long very big rpgs"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,because you invest too much in modern games. play older games you have not played yet. 99of modern tripleand double a games are certified garbage.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,sounds like you should try outer wilds.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,years ago i worked at a games company. the publisher conducted their own usability tests and sent us the results. during the introduction they had to press the yellow y button to jump or something similar. some dumb 13 yo kid kept pressing the wrong button. the screen even had a picture of the yellow 'y' button. the feedback we received from the publisher is that it wasn't obvious enough what the player had to do...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"playing halo infinite campaign just trying to beat it, but the weapon fake cortona chick wont shut up. hey chief maybe we should check out that banished installation and she wont shut up idk why you would make a halo open world game and constantly annoy me as i ocd collect things."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"sounds like you need to branch out more as far as gaming,try different genres you might be suprised at what you find. as far as video games telling you every step of the way, not every modern game does this but most of the popular ones do. resident evil 7 was fun but it does kind of explain almost every major puzzle in the game. my advice for avoiding these kinds of games is to play rereleases of older games, they might still explain things but it won't feel like your a two year old legend of zelda breath of the wild and any game from fromsoft the guys who makes darksouls, sekiro, bloodbourne are great examples of games which don't hold your hand, almost at all. breath of the wild feels massive to explore, there are so many unique interactions that you can discover in the world and its rare that exploring any part of the map feels pointless, you might find some cliffs that look interesting only to find an enemy you haven't seen before and chest with a weapon, or you might learn that you can fish using lighting arrows, or that you can light grass on fire to create a updraft."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i felt this same way, last game i got lost in was metal gear solid v and the end of the game stunk because they basically scrapped what should have been an act three and made it end. i was never a zelda game person but i tried tears of the kingdom and was enamored with that game for quite a while. simple popup tips early in the game but so much of the game is completed with puzzles that you get wrapped up in finding the correct solution or finding your own solutions. kind of reinvigorated my feelings at games and helped!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"yes you're old. we're all looking for that magical feeling when you first played your favorite game wow for me, and you really can't recreate that feeling. few games for suggestion... vampire survivors, valheim, baldur's gate 3, and yes also elden ring"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"play something like tears of the kingdom or baldurs gate 3 if you want new games which arent going to hold your hand throughout them and have open ended problem solving. in terms of 3rd person narrative games, alan wake 2 was great, even if there isnt much margin for error with the problem solving."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"this post is exactly why people fucking love baldurs gate 3 and elden ring. a growing segment of people crave a game that isn't like what you are describing, that allows a player to get lost. you're not getting too old for games you just might not be trying the right ones anymore. i've thought many times that i might be too old, until i play a game that i actually enjoy again. they exist."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"hop into elite dangerous.  but seriously, i feel you man. i'm an ffxi player from way back  they told you nothing in that game. the community didn't know shit either. i miss the mystery. try crafting using a wind crystal while facing east on windsday, like wtf?"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,they are trying to sell the most games possible and there are more people who want there hands held while gaming. i personally hate all the things you mentioned that games do. like let me figure out how to climb this wall or get up to a high area without it being painted or a different color example being the uncharted games or similar i would say try out baldurs gate 3 the game can be hard and easy at times. there is more than one way to get past enemies.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"these games are being developed for dumb people and there is much more dumb people than you think. average attention span is also dropping because of dopamine addiction being fed by social media and treninding short form of videos. such people don't want to think for 30s, they want to turn their brain off and consume whatever you throw at them. it starts to look like idiocracy was a prophecy instead of average comedy movie."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i know that something like monster hunter will give you the basics of stuff like using the item wheels, using weapons, stuff like that. but learning attack patterns and survival skill is all you. maybe give that a shot?"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"hav you considered playing some games that make it easy for the player to get lost in them? everything on your list is explicitly intended for casual, shallow experiences easily marketable to the general public. getting lost in the game isn't really the point of them, no matter how well they are made. you're riding amusement park rides and asking where the thrill is, when what it sounds like you should be doing is going mountain climbing, or at least exploring different kinds of experience."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"products evolve like this when there's a heavy focus in qa. it rounds out the experience so more people like it. i think games before were going that direction but they could only do so much because they were still standardized the more fundamental things. it gave people the impression that they were designed more simply but they simply couldn't be any more ambitious than that. another aspect is the bigger the game is the more they have to focus on having a wide audience to make back the money. the creators can choose to maintain a specific vision, they don't have to listen to all of qa but you'll notice the higher budget the game the less personable it feels because there's someone out there who will want the very thing you don't want. and it's better to do what he wants than what you want because you'll both play it rather than only one of you. i'll still play god of war, spiderman, and horizon and on paper they're good games but my favorite games of the year i enjoyed far beyond these games but for things these games can never be. that being said there are other games out there, these are the highly marketed ones but that means very little to the individual."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"avoid aaa. to bring in the biggest number of customers they have to broaden accessibility to the point of insult for anyone that is used to game logic. i actually don't recommend elden ring. because 1, there's no puzzles really. just a couple places you need keys. 2, it's just not a game people want to play if they aren't already from fans. even with a ton of recommendations i bet you're feeling pretty passive about trying it. that's what i mean. when i want to really sink into a world i always go for the eurojank. risen series 1 can be pretty brutal but 2 is fantastic and 3 is decent, elex, gothic, games basically from the same devs over and over. they get you started just barely and then you're on your own. explore, pick away at tough enemies until you're stronger, explore some more, talk to people and finish quests, explore some more. unlike er or rdr2 you aren't really able to just go out on your own for 30 hours but you aren't stuck listening to npcs for hours either. it's a balance i find immersive and enjoyable."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i would love to hear which games do resonate with you instead of the ones that do not. the game elements you seem to dislike are all part and parcel of the modern aaa openworld framework utilized in part to make them more accessible to the casual crowd and inpart to make aaa extra money with lootboxes and microtransactions, and all of the games you listed have been openly criticized for the same reasons you dont like them the games just become mindless interactive checklists that take away your agency. im assuming you do like an open world but you do not like being told what to do with blinking lights and flashing arrows and a billion quests on a list, and, like several other people, i am going to suggest elden ring and all of the other fromsoft arpgs. its that good. worth trying, definitively, as are the other souls games and sekiro, and bloodborne. they all encourage you to learn by creating scenarios in which you almost definitively will die, and your job is to learn whatever lesson you can glean from that, adjust, and try again. the game will never tell you what the lesson you are meant to learn is, but demands you learn something. you have to rise to meet the challenge, the challenge does not rise to meet you. look into death stranding, maybe? it is a bit less handholdy than the titles you didnt like and you can turn off the million billion tutorial tooltips if they become too much. if youre good with a controller in your hands, play on hard. the whole schtick with death stranding is that the star of the show is the varied mechanics and tools surrounding the act of hostile terrain transversal as environmental puzzle. its all walking from point a to point b, but the challenge is that sometimes that walk is over five kilometers long, youre carrying 100 kilos of fragile materials, you have to find a way across four different rivers that are often too deep to wade through, half of that route is storming acid rain for the next half hour and is populated by invisible flying enemies, all of which you can get around but only if you can find a way to scale a 40foot cliff face to the south instead, and that route takes you through a camp of raiders that will want to steal your quest items, but also the raiders also have resources you need to rebuild a highway youve been rebuilding on the side, but they are heavy, so if you choose to take them your stamina depletes faster and your load is harder to physically balance and now your shoes are falling apart and now if you scale that cliff, if you slip and lose your balance, tripping once means your entire stack of boxes goes falling 30 meters down a cliff and into a river, which might destroy them all. exploration, elaborate transversal puzzles, realtime risk assessment, planning, and survival elements combined with light online coop, in that you are playing alone, but sometimes youll see a bridge that another player built in the distance, and you realize you can take that bridge to make part of your trip that much easier, and the items you deploy to aid you will aid others as well. the game tells you when youve indirectly assisted other players as well, and the feedback loop is wonderful to engage with."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,might i recommend avatar frontiers of pandora? it specifically has a guided and exploration setting so you can choose whether you want in game hints to point you in the right direction of things. i've found the game super easy to get lost in and even with guided on it doesn't offer too many hints during quests beyond highlighting the area you're supposed to be in or people you're supposed to talk to. idk if everyone else agrees but as someone who doesn't play games outside of like stardew valley and the sims 4 i think it does a pretty good job of balancing its guided versus exploratory nature
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i know there's been a ton of hype around it and maybe people are sick of hearing about it, but baldur's gate 3 was the first game in probably a decade that i completely and utterly got lost in. the depth of the game is fucking unreal and there's a billion little hidden gems and secret spots that the game does not have a giant neon sign pointing towards. it's fucking incredible."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"if you've not played the original try the system shock remake. it does a good job of modernising the game while retaining its old school design. you unlock more and more of a space station as you go and none of the objectives give you more than the name of the place you're trying to find. immersive sims in general can be good for this, prey, bioshock, deus ex, and the recent blood west generally just drop you in a place and leave you to figure things out. there's also metroidvanias hollow knight, blasphemous and bloodstained are excellent and don't hold your hand. they're pretty niche, but automation games also tend to leave you to work things out on your own for the most part. stuff like factorio, oxygen not included, and dyson sphere program have hundreds of hours of content if you can get in to them. there's also some pretty great puzzle games that leave you to figure things out. people have already mentioned outer wilds, but there's also return of the obra dinn, hypnospace outlaw, and the curse of the golden idol. if you like tactics games there's stuff like xcom, battle brothers, and battletech if you want an open and dynamic campaign. if you prefer more linear and crafted experiences there's also aliens dark descent, shadow tactics, and the valkyria chronicles games. if you're specifically looking for more open games then boomer shooters might not be exactly what you're looking for, but they tend to do a very good job of just letting you play the game. stuff like dusk, amid evil, ion fury, and turbo overkill are excellent, plus there's games like hedon and ashes 2063 which is completely free to download from moddb that have larger and more open environments with light immersive sim elements, especially in their second halves."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"there are lots of reasons why i really struggle to remain interested in most new video games, but absolutely those are two of them. ffvii remake, most recently. i mean, ultimately i hated the gameplay i love the original but have no issue with action games, even party based  just don't 'force' me to swap between characters just because you can't be bothered to design vaguely intuitive or competent allied or enemy ai patterns. but i quit during a section that had multiple 'should have been a cutscene' bits. my patience was stretched and all of a sudden, during a fight, i just decided nope. and, the game is full of utterly braindead puzzles and interactions which is doubly frustrating since it's a remake these things were far less laid out or signposted in the original. sad thing is, it ain't for the sake of the kids that most new games do that. i don't know if you'll like elden ring since fromsoft games are explicitly antiplayer which is fine, its a design choice, just one you may not like. the lack of handholding is certainly compelling and had me playing it way longer than i thought i would."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"have you considered playing good games. like actual good videogames. youre playing the mcdonalds of video games and complain that the food is mediocre. youre not getting too old for video games, you just play things you dont like for some reason. what made you think that after not liking horizon gow is a good game for you? steam has a million insanely good indie games as well as genuinely good aaa titles on offer practially at all times. this thread wouldve made way more sense if you actually asked for advice on what you are looking for in games so people couldve pointed out specific games to you."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"another less known gem is fromsoftware's new game armored core 6. it's nothing like the souls games. they essentially brought back a game from the ps2 era and modernized it. no microtransactions, no nonsense, full game all up front. on top of that, it's a fantastic game. take a look at the steam reviews, it has the review of very positive across the board"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"play some indie games mate, triple a games usually suck these days"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i know im late, but i had this exact same problem. the game that saved me and i was truly able to get lost in, was hollow knight. i am sick of these aaa games and everything you mentioned. i dont need a game to look amazing, it just needs to look nice and feel fair."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i just downloaded wh40k rogue trader. it's pretty good. kinda like baulders gate 3 but set in warhammer 40k universe. i also hear mechanicus is really good as well but it plays like xcom. as someone who's not into turn base games, i'm thoroughly enjoying rogue trader thus far. the story, voice acting, writing, gore, and the environments look great. wh40k is one of my favorite fantasy universes so i might be a little biased."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,if your taste in games is shallow aaa slop then that is kind of what you get. have you ever played path of exile?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,its just like real life. people need to be told exactly what to do. my fuck we come a long way and then we left again.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"monster hunter. they will give hints once in a while but i think you can turn them off. even if you can't tons of players seem to go 200 hours without noticing certain aspects lol. remnant games don't really hold your hand either. they are fairly linear, but lots of side paths. the map will show you what door leads to the main progression but only after you find it through the fog of war. the way you handle each fight has potential for different rewards and they don't tell you what you'll get. they don't tell you how to solve the puzzles either."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,try elden ring or any of the fromsoft games. if your kind of game is not having your handheld and having an adventure these are most certainly your type of games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,try fallout 4
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,jedi survivor lets you have the main character shut up with regards to giving hints. which is how it should be. some of us enjoy solving puzzles.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"since you mentioned elden ring. it wasnt my type of game either. but when i played it, i quite literally said to myself wow its been so long since ive gotten lost in a game like this where it quite literally feels like danger could be around every corner"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,you need to play the re4 remake
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"you can get lost in elden ring, even if it isn't your type of game. i think you want to say that easy games aren't your thing without admitting that hard games aren't your thing either. it's fine to want to avoid hard games and play medium skill games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i know you edited it for er but literally everything you want is in the game and likely your apprehension to play stems from the stigma it gets as incredibly hard but it's a video game designed to be cleared, anyone can do it...."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,maybe try dishonored or hitman? both games are similar in that you have a goal per level but have multiple toolspaths to reach it. dishonored is more story focused and basically has about two outcomes per level i.e. kill the target or find another way to dispatch them. hitman is very wide open. there usually is a fairly clear way to accomplish your task but is highly replayable. there are more rewards to receive by going back and completing the levels in different methods.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"for me, a large part of it is the anxiousness of life dating, work, finances, etc that is distracting me from getting fully immersed."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,there are plenty of amazing games outside of large triple a games. the only larger devs i buy games from anymore are capcom and fromsoft
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"aaa studios have always been bad about that, they've just gotten worse in recent years. they make puzzles easier because you can't have your customer upset over not being able to progress in your game they paid 110 forgame  season pass, and they have to aggressively monetize everything because otherwise they're just leaving money on the table. this is why they panicked when bg3 released and showed everyone that they'd been lying about needing to do any of the extra monetization to have good graphics and good writing. my suggestion? ignore the aaa games until they learn that covid is over and that people won't put up with their bs any more. if you want a game to get lost in, there are plenty of indy games out there that offer better gameplay and stories than the aaa games can offer."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"most aaa games don't draw me anymore. so ditto. similar reasons too. last assassin's creed i liked was probably black flag. liked maybe one of them after that... and it's because it has aspects similar to black flag. lol. i do weird games now. rimworld, stellaris, bg3 currently. but stuff like rebel galaxy or pathfinder km and wrath games, or even pillars of eternity. i just don't dig the god of war clones, the assassin's creed clones, or the 48th fps with hyper focused gimmick added for fully authentic gameplay or some drek...."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,try the long dark my friend
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"might not be your game but try out baldurs gate 3. if there was ever a game in the past decade plus where looking away from the screen made me reload to recap what i missed, this one is it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,you need baldur's gate 3 in your life.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i hate to say this but you underestimate the general populace. if they weren't given those answers and hand holding, they would just drop the game and call it shit. what they do need is more options, like god of war had which people are failing to mention, that tone down the number of hints and such. some of the most annoying moments in games is when you can't figure out what the fuck the game wanted you to do with maybe a puzzle or next step in a quest. there is a balance to be had in game systems but more games need to let players explore and better visually mark things of interest because there is kind of a lot going on now in games from that standpoint."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i don't like how they are adding open world elements to games that shouldn't have them like god of war, or the spiderman games. it kills the pacing in god of war when i have to row around all over the map trying to find everything, the original god of wars were more linear and you kind of just blast through the story killing god after god. spiderman is fun swinging around the city, but it is not fun taking pictures of landmarks, looking for bookbags, and whatever random things there are to do. it takes away from something that should be more focused on the story. i guess it's just games that are meant to be story heavy. open world stuff should be for games focused more on exploration."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,ive just started the yakuza series. really enjoying it. i only play when im done with everything at the end of the day at like 9 pm and next thing i know its past 1 am. im not sure if im just enjoying the story so much but never felt like i was given the answers to everything. i do start games on hardest difficulty for little bit of something tho.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"im guessing thats why people like cocoon so much. just throws you in there, no dialogue, and the puzzles are really fun and fulfilling once you get them."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i've cancelled plans to buy a few games after watching streamers play them and seeing how frustrating the builtin backseating is.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,metroid prime was the best with the option to turn the hint system on and off whenever. i thought that was going to become a standard thing in games but then the opposite happened with metroid prime 3 still telling you what to do constantly even with the hint system off.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"have you tried games like dayz, no man's sky, minecraft though bedrock is trying to do microtransactions, any of the souls games, valheim, rust, don't starve... basically any procedurallygenerated, openworld game will allow you to get lost. most of these are survival."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"you're chasing aaa big name games. those are pretty much standardized garbage aimed at reaching as wide audience as possible, thus often times boring. you're not too old, you are just looking for fine wine in the toilet forget about ubisoft, forget about ea, forget about activisionblizzard, forget about bethesda. there's thousands of fantastic indie games studios out there"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i think this is less of a problem with non triple a games. try something like return of the obra dinn, if its in your wheelhouse."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"one of the things i mainly like about botw and totk. aside from quests which you can mute, i feel like you can pretty much just chill on your own without too many distractions on the screen."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i see people make these complaints a lot, and it's always for these mainstream triple a type games. you should look for some different styles of games or games made by smaller studios even. i say this because i've never come across this issue in all my years of playing games. at least not to a point where i noticed it bothered me."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"breath of the wild and tears of the kingdom may be up your alley, though totk is admittedly a lot more intrusive with tutorial popups early on simply due to the overwhelmingly crazy amount of mechanics introduced into the game from the start."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,inb4 thread about how elden ring changed his gaming life.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,rogue trader has had me in more suspension of disbelief than any games for awhile. it does make me sleepy though. something with the isometric view. play for a bit and need a break to wake up before coming back. like reading a good book.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"try tunic. the game starts with no tutorial, no hand holding and it has amazing puzzles, great zelda atmosphere and almost no ui to bother you. just get lost in the world, figure out puzzles, and learn about story beats through level contextualization."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"maybe i was just doing well, but i hadn't noticed anything like hints in hogwarts until well into the game going through one of the trials when i was like 2 seconds from completing a room when my character started going on this long inner monologue stepping through how they would solve the problem. it was so offputting."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"you literally only mention aaa games, made to appeal to the largest userbase. of course they hold your hand."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"have the same discussion with friends. and remind how we played in diablo 2, or morrowind. you just drawing in a world with out disturbing. the game creators just presented you the whole world. and now in every game i see just casino with thats why capitalism so horrible and so distractive."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i've basically stopped playing haak for the time being because of this. the game features a mechanic where you can buy coins that make boss fights and other challenges easier, and every coin you buy counts against your final score when you complete the game. oh, and you can't turn the mechanic off. i got so fed up of being hauled up before the would you like to buy a coin to make it easier? screen when i died to a boss that i stopped playing altogether."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"going off of what people are saying here i gotta be like one of five people who dont care when a game like gowr tells me how to solve the puzzle after like 30 seconds. while it is mildly annoying far to many people in this thread are blowing it out of proportion id much prefer that rather than me get stuck for 30 minutes, and have my immersion ruined and open myself up to pandoras box of spoilers on yt because i had to look up one puzzle guide."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"breath of the wild and tears of the kingdom is the only game i actually enjoyed the puzzles. all of them make sense and also require creativity to solve them. with most puzzles in video games they require you to find some odd clues nearby that tell you exactly what to do, its just not enjoyable and more of a waste of time."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"basically, game developers are super selfconscious about players not finding every little secret on their own to the point secrets aren't secret. take any game by bethesda for instance, there should be a great treasure buried somewhere in those ruins, but nobody ever goes there for fear of the monsters that live there. anyway, let me mark the treasure's exactly position on your map! botwtotk, baldur's gate 3, and elden ring are some of the more recent games that welcome exploration. you might also enjoy kingdom come deliverance, if you welcome a more slow and deliberate experience."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i want a game that doesnt hold my hand and instead immerses me in the challenges it presents. yeah, thats elden ring no not like that lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,you should try games like gris or firewatch. try more indie games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"im one of those people who need the hand holding because i lack common sense or something like that, but id be happy if all hints were optional. in fact id love a give me a hint context button you could press to get hints instead of it being default."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"try out escape from tarkov or the souls games, it sounds like you need something more hardcore that doesnt hold your hand as much. these games still exist, certainly. i see you edited your post to deter elden ring suggestions but you will very likely enjoy that game a lot if you set aside your preconceptions of the series and genre before making the plunge. also, random tidbit, one of my favorite videos on youtube is megaman x sequelitis. arin goes on a hilariously relatable tangent about how great it is when games teach you how to play them through their gameplay itself, and conversely how horrendous it is when npcs wont shut up and constantly needlessly explain things. that video is not new and this is not a new problem for games, just to address your anymore in the end of your title, which is a word that categorically kind of irks me when it appears fallaciously in such a fashion, but i digress."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i would recommend cocoon if you like puzzle games, and tunic if you like something zeldaesque."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,this is why in my opinion fromsoft is undoubtedly the best rpg dev team in the industry. they dont mess up
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,rdr2 get your horse and ride into the literal sunset
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i think the problem is those are all games that the studio is putting a lot on so they really have to squeeze the money out of them aggressively, hence ads and sales and shit. i know recommendations can be pretty tiresome but i highly recommend games by smaller devs with great atmosphere if lower overall production resources. valheim, frostpunk, hollowkight are all games that have completely absorbed me for hours on end that you might enjoy."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"im 40 and game everyday. actually, i spend 100 of my free time gaming and when im not gaming im thinking about gaming. when i open youtube everything i watch is about gaming. all my reddit subs are gaming subs. my entire life is gaming so no, age has nothing to do with it, or at least thats the case with me. ill continue gaming every single day until im dead."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i love how jedi fallen order and survivor dealt with this. the puzzles are kind of complicated, but solveable with some thinking, but even so if you spend too much time somewhere, the game will subtly tell you that you can ask for a hint, but it doesn't push it in your face and you can ignore it. i honestly think survivor was one of the best games of the last year but because how bad it was on pc at launch everyone just ignored it, but now it runs perfectly for me. i can't not recommend that game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"play kingdom hearts from the beginning. you might appreciate dark souls 1 more than elden ring as a starting point for from soft games. still has the ability to get lost in the game and the world, but has fewer systems, and hand holding mechanics compared to elden ring, and might have a more forgiving learning curve for newcomers."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,time to venture out of your comfort zone in terms what type of games you're trying out.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i thought the same thing until i played breath of the wild for the first time. remember, this was the first console nintendo game since skyward shit definitely the worst game i've ever taken the time to beat, so it probably also helped that my expectations were far from high. but man, you get out in the world, and you can do any fucking thing that you'd like to do, at least in a kidfriendly game. it felt like the very first nintendo zelda game in all the right ways. hey, here's a world to explore, have fun. tears of the kingdom i was hoping to have a similar feeling for, but i bought it day one and never even got past the tutorial section because it's so damn tedious and many of the powerups are unintuitive as fuck and simply not fun. breath of the wild though, i bet you can get lost in that game if you haven't already. i also got ridiculously obsessed with hades, which is a totally different type of game but also isn't one that holds your hand. it's just like egoraptor said on his mega man x sequelitis video. the subject matter of video games has increasingly gone towards more goreviolencewhatever that are designed for older gamers, yet they treat the player like they don't know what the fuck is going on in the world. hey, there's a pit right there, you need to jump over it or it's going to kill you! i hate games like that, and they're definitely super popular. but if you go towards the indy scene and a select few fullbudget bangers then i bet you'll find a lot of material you can lose yourself in."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i picked up dredge the other day and it was the first time in a while that a game really sucked me in. i'm not sure why but i could not put that game down. unfortunately its a bit short but it had a small dlc that gave me another few hours of game time. it was for sale on steam a few weeks ago and ran great on the steam deck.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i have a few games that might be good for you, i'll list a few that are pretty broad and might tickle your fancy.  divinity original sin 2 great game overall and really fun to mod or with friends. it's an rpg and definitely doesn't hold your hand. great to just enjoy a nice role play and get lost in.  stellaris a real time strategy game that focuses on space exploration and diplomacy with other empires. the stories are great to get lost in and read, and the gameplay can be difficult to master. it definitely doesn't hold your hand. downsides are the dlc is pretty expensive...  aliens dark descent top down squad based tactics game that focuses on stealth and exploration. it's extremely fun and challenging, but forgiving enough for you to get the hang of it early on. plus if you like the alien franchise then you'll love this.  hell let loose a wwii shooter that focuses on communication and teamwork in a multiplayer setting. it's a fun and hard to master game that really is a gem. bit buggy at times... but definitely recommended. there's plenty of games out there that have what you seek, but... sadly they are more indy devs and not the aaa powerhouses that you have mentioned. the problem with devs now is they have to cater to a wide player base and old games that forced you to think about your actions tend to have gone to the wayside. so many people want instant gratification that it's polluted the gaming market in a bad way. anyway i hope my suggestions help and good luck finding that game you want!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,what i did is upgrade peripherals. went from 1080p to 1440p monitor and that helped me not sure why.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"as much as i didn't like the utter where the fuck do i go? syndrome that made many games basically require a full walkthrough, i feel like many games nowadays have overcorrected to the point that it's obnoxious. the things that used to be optional dialogue or loading screen tips are now shouted at you repeatedly when you probably never needed to be told more than once, if at all. looking shit up has never been easier, yet games hold your hand now more than ever. i can appreciate qol stuff like minecraft not needing you to memorize every recipe, but i hate what's happened in countless other games. old pokmon games did have me getting stuck a lot, but they've basically made the new games into playable cutscene simulators that often make it hard or even impossible to lose your way or your battles, even if you try"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"playing any fromsoft game offline is the exact experience you're looking for. i deliberately play every single one of their titles offline because i hate player messages showing up all over the environment. it takes me out of one of the key elements of world building those games are so good at doing making you feel alone against insurmountable odds. nothing takes me out of the fromsoft atmosphere quicker than a lol jump haer message in the environment hahaha. the dopamine hits come from the level and encounter design, not bullshit adhd achievements."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,you say elden ring isnt your type of game but then describe everything from soft doesnt do and what makes them one of if not the best modern developer. im so sad the marketing department decided to market the difficulty as the selling point for demon souls and dark souls way back when. not only is it not the point at all but it simplifies the game into something it isnt. and it attracts all the dork edgelord git gud pricks. more than the difficulty or the challenge the games are so immersive and well designed and feel like the only real games these days. look past the difficulty because the games youre looking for are being made by fromsoft.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"its time to get into indies. i like boomer shooters myself, they dont tell you much, often nothing at all. aaa gaming is rotten and its not made for people who like games anymore. there are plenty of fun experiences, just have to look the other way. i don't have it in me to hype any aaa game anymore. p.s. yellow paint in resident evil 4 remake could be added to the list. like, let me look at least once? use my eyes, brain? it wasnt like that in original"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"play better games. i like games with a challenge too. i hate games like the ones you mentioned as well. baldur's gate 3 if you want a challenging rpg. not sure what games you haven't played, but i tend to only play through like 2 entire games in a year. so sometimes there'll be some really good games that take me awhile to get to, like elden ring. but there's also zelda totk, rdr2, kingdom come deliverance is a bit older, but is still a great game with a lot of challenge."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"lots of great suggestions out there but i will reiterate some that i've played myself very recently.  outer wilds  incredible great exploration game. go in completely blind. i did have to look at some tutorials for a few things eventually but it's an amazing experience.  returnal  i am not a fan of roguelikes but returnal and my next suggestion are top tier. very little to no hand holding, the atmosphere and gameplay are top notch. story is ok, a little ethereal but still very fun.  hades  another roguelike but one of my most favorite games of all time. story, game play, voice acting, everything is so polished. once you start to get the system and how to play it, it's incredible. maybe these last two count more as roguelites as there is a meta progression of sorts but whatever. still highly highly recommend.  jedi survivor doesn't really hand hold you on puzzles ever, there are small hints but nothing egregious. although the puzzles are pretty simple tbh.  cyberpunk's latest release and phantom liberty. not a lot of puzzles really but i like stealth so most of my gameplay was sneaking around. usually a good handful of ways to handle a missionareabuilding. you do get op fairly quickly however so that can go out the window quickly."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,play outer wilds i promise i felt the same and this single game made me realize i still love single player games
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"this problem i see in mostly aaa big brand gaming. i'm certain smaller studios are guilty as well but this sort of handholding comes from attempting to capture a wide audience. the average consumer needs that guidance because for the most part all they buy each year are madden and cod and maybe assassin's creed. many have suggested elden ring and i will too, and the rest of the souls series."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"completely agree, couldnt have put it any better myself! i just started gr wildlands now its on game pass and literally every action you take gives a massive pop up click here for new skillinfomissions. same with far cry 5 which i also just started. the ubisoft formula is soooo tired now. i cant help but enjoy the contextual chatter from aloy  elliejoel, feel it adds a nice bit of immersion but may be in a minority!"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,recently got the anniversary edition of skyrim and feeling so good getting lost in it. i haven't engaged with a game positively like this in a long time. destiny was sucking my soul out these last few years.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i think honestly this is why many of us end up going back to rskyrim. i love it bought day one, hear me out i know im biased. yes, a lot of it is in part due to nostalgia. however, i have played this game every year, since release, my longedt breaks tend to be maybe 3 to 6 months. i have poor 200 to 300 hours into most runs. and i generally start a new character every year. and currently have two separate games, switch and xbox. are the graphics the best? nope. sword fighting? nah, slash, slahs, slash,quick swap to healing, quick swap to fire bolt, oh recast oakflesh. is it particularly hard? nope. its not like oblivion or morrowind where most the quests are not plain as day. do i build the exact same house everytime? yup? but, the game does the following right its not so challenging that i feel punished for failing and have to try something for 1 to 3 hours in a gaming session. i respect those who can play the souls games. i cannot bc 2 to 3 hours is the most free time i can get to play any number of games most of the time. so i dont want that feeling of being stuck. it doesn't always hold your hand, and it lets you go off the beaten path. and in fact the followers will sometimes acknowledge theres a cave, lets check it out. praise lydia.  it doesn't entirely hold your hand, itll hold your hand to get there buf the puzzles not so much also try reading that claw on a 17 tube tv it allows for immersion into the world by doing these things eithout pushing mt. want to add things? mods, most of them free. want it to be harder? legendary difficulty, i suggest heavy armor. need to make it easier bc you want to run a cave in 5 minutes while waiting for the gf to be finishedgrtting ready? put it on easy. if its not your cup of tea thata also fine. just what i think gives the game longevity."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"they try to make games for people who dont play games now. handholdy and simple. they dont want anyone with a short attention span reaching a certain point and giving up because they didn't look around for 30 seconds to find the cracked wall. they make games disgustingly accessible for people now, so that they can market them to everyone. some games break the mold, like elden ring was mentioned, but keep in mind it's the opposite end of the spectrum. in elden ring, you'll find that in order to progress the game you were supposed to smack a wall to unveil a hidden path that you never would have found unless you read the message on the ground placed down by a player. and some people troll in the messages left on the ground, so you might just swing at real wall, and still be just as lost."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,i think theres just an increasing idea that the general populous needs having their hand held. television and books are like that these days too  there is a definite trend toward beating your consumer over the head with your point. publishers just dont trust the general public to be smart enough to think critically anymore.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"you should check out outer wilds, curse of the obra dinn, and tunic. virtually no hand holding, with only the most basic explanation of the mechanics. but what all of those games hit is this perfect moment of wonder, where you got oh my god that's what this game is about and it's what i continue to chase in games. games are like songs. some are stories, some are meant to make you move, some are straight emotional catharsissome are blatant pandering cashgrabs but sometimes it's valuable to consider why certain songs just make you want to dance and search out those things."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,youre not getting too old.. you just havent tried alan wake ii. thatll have you lost in the game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,hmmm op have you played outer wilds?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,seriously. what you just described is why i havent played games in a long time we are talking over a decade maybe close to two elden ring brought me back to gaming. it didnt disappoint.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"all of the games you've described are modernstyle rpgs. i don't like the hand holding either. good games are still being made. baldur's gate 3 is a good example of a classicstyle rpg akin to the rpgs of the early 2000s. outer wilds is an incredible indie project that is definitely challenging in all the right ways. hades got me into roguelikes, a genre i previously avoided. corporate culture, in my opinion, is just not compatible with artistic media like games. once you start making everything about marketing trends, fiscal quarters, and only caring about paying out shareholder dividends, it becomes very hard to make a game that's actually fun and innovative. big companies don't want to take risks on new ideas when the cookie cutter games are proven to sell. i work at a game studio that's actively trying to fight against those things and it's incredibly refreshing compared to past jobs i've had. vote with your money. if we all stop buying derivative lazy games they'll stop existing. this is the main reason i'm way more willing to support an experimental indie game than a full price aaa game these days."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"maybe the taste is starting to recognize the usual safe openworld game. the games in particular listed fall under focus tested triplea developed blockbusters expected to make millions. if even one person has an issue in playtests, it will be accomodated for. back on the ps2, games were more experimental and riskier with everything from best practices to controls. now every major game is a stealthaction openworld sandbox with looting and crafting. not bad games, but they are safe and tend to be the ultimate cinematic experience that accomodates every playstyle. consider more focused indie games outside a comfort zone or double a games. tunic is a game where the instructions are in a madeup foreign language. it basically forces the player to figure things out through context clues. baldur's gate provides problems that are typically up to a player to solve. try something wildly different from the usual tastes."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,yeah i definitely think youd really enjoy elden ring and dark souls games. they are very challenging especially at first when ur still learning the mechanics and stuff. but once you get comfortable and start defeating tough bosses and progressing its such a rewarding feeling.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,not sure if you've ever heard of outward but it can be semi unforgiving. it has more of a rust meets fantasy feel to it though so i'm not sure if you'd enjoy it. recently i've been drawn into remnant 2 and bg3 as everyone else. i think we are just getting older and things don't produce the amount of dopamine as they used to.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,world of warcraft. as soon as they gave us little mini maps with ! to mark the quests i knew that we would eventually end up right where op stated. not much mystery left in video games anymore.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,yeah youre too old for aaa video games. i think the current cut off is like 25. after that your brain matures and you cant ignore the stupid adhd and money grubbing shit anymore. personally i switched to indie games and having super low expectations. also stopped interaction with pvp and cinematic experiences completely apart from watching streamers.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,we live in a world of mediocrity that allows people to sell bullshit....and people actually buy that bullshit. the only way we could come out of this is if we stopped buying bullshit but i can safely say we won't in the near future. and the only good games left are the several indies made each year by obscure companies...they rarely continue to be good. what it could have been is a regret that i have come to accept.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"maybe you are trying to hard to force yourself to enjoy games, try replaying a game that made you feel happy and lost in it and see if you feel the same, if not you are probably burned out and need a little break from gaming"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,i know what you mean. i really love persona 5 but there is a lot of dialogue and a lot of it is the characters discussing the exact same thing over and over again. like i get they were actually trying to go for realism and if you were in the situations they got into with your friends it would be all you could talk about too but im outside of the game. i dont need to read it over and over. luckily you can basically skip most convos but still. even cyberpunk 2077 was an offender but again they gave options to skip

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"play baldurs gate 3, amazing game and i cant say enough good things about it. it tells you the basics but you have to figure it out as you go. amazing game, characters, combat, story. goty for me and one of the best games ive played in years. give it a try! theres so many different paths you can go down."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,accessibility is important and games never used to have it. but its a fine line on how into avoid implementing things like this for all players and should be a game option. uncharted 4 delayed the helpful voice lines well i thought.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,this is what made me love elden ring. nothing is really handed to you. you have to immerse yourself into the world provided. i didnt even know about torrent until like 4 hours into my first play through
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,i know you said elden ring isn't your cup of tea but honestly fromsoft games imo are the absolute best games to get lost in. like dark souls is just this awesome world to explore and get fully immersed in. same as elden ring. your post pretty much describes most casual aaa arcade games. i can't get lost in them either it just feels like such chore.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"if you want some games that don't hold your hand and ask you to figure stuff out on your own, outward and stoneshard. outward is like dark souls with survival mechanicscrafting. kind of dated tbh but if you want to figure stuff out on your own it's great. stoneshard is a pixelated turn based rpg, it has an optional tutorial and limited story since it's early access but it's very challenging to start out and has a great world, the next update is going to make large scale traversal much easier."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i'm 40 and honestly, i mostly enjoy going back and playing older games. many newer games feel like they've been infected with psychologists trying to abuse us for more time and money."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i'd highly recommend outer wilds, which came out in 2019 not to be confused with the outer worlds. based on this post and a quick scroll into your recent posts, i think it's super up your alley. it's a spacemini solar system game with a handful of unique, thoughtfully designed small planets that you traverse with a jetpack and a wooden rocketship. the game doesn't handhold, neither with its puzzles nor its challenges, to the point that it never even tells you what your goal should be. clever game design means it actually doesn't need to tell you. in terms of annoying elements this game does not have, the game has no loading screens, currency, character levels, game levels, microtransactions, or mission markers. it doesn't have an excessive hud. it doesn't require you to grind resources, or even have a mechanism for collecting resources in the first place. you start with everything you need. many other space scifi games give you a gun and make you fight aliens to make you feel threatened. this game has different, but highly effective, methods. the puzzles are good, requiring thought and careful observation. puzzles are challenging and satisfying to figure out and often have multiple viable solutions. it's an openworld game, where every place on every planet is completely unlocked from the very start, and your only limitation on progress is your own knowledge which you gain by exploring. this does mean exploration and puzzles can be done in no particular order. it's easy to spoil things you should discover on your own, and since in this game knowledge is progress, i'd recommend you play it without doing additional research if this sounds appealing. i think it might be the unique experience you're looking for, and based on what i know of elden ring, i think this is probably a better fit for you than elden ring."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"everyones talking about mostly open world games, and im sure its been mentioned, but highly recommend tlou games for immersion. perfect balance of collectibles, narrative, combat, and the best storytelling ive ever encountered in 25 years of gaming."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,you just have to turn off certain hud settings and hints. most aaa games have them in the settings if you search for them. i hopped back into zero dawn and i didnt realize how much of the game i actually just left there. and i completed the story and dlc thinking it was done.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,my current go to is no man's sky. it's just the right tempo for me and starting a custom game gets rid of the sluggish tutorial. it can get old fairly quickly but when it clicks it clicks. it's immensely satisfying flying world to world surveying the life forms and hopping solar systems to see what can be discovered. if anything it's something that you will want to return to some point of time after setting it down for a while. personally i'm not one for base building but what i dabbled with is satisfying and offers pieces to create some complex layouts.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"honestly most mainsteam games just aren't that well designed. they take so few creative risks, and are dumbed down to appeal to as many possible, that they end up being stale, soulless and unengaging. starfield comes to mind. i'm just an indie gamedev but i could design more interesting mechanics with a napkin, a crayon, and 30 minutes to consider it. i just don't have the 30 million dollar budget to make the game if did, of course."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i just started replaying half life 2 and was reminded why i was absolutely obsessed with the game for years. the level design actively leads you to where you are supposed to go by context clues alone. the puzzles are only obvious if you look at it from a real world lens instead of thinking of it like a video game. and the pacing..... i'll admit that sometimes it can be a bit slow but there are so many points when you can feel the walls closing in and you just panic while looking for the next place to go. there's a reason it's an absolute classic. there are so many times when i think, there's no way this is going to work and not only does it work but it's usually the intended way to beat the encounter. from throwing exploding barrels at generators to luring combine into an antlion ambush, it's an incredible experience."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"kenshi would be a fantastic game if you don't want any answers if you're on pc anyway it's a game where you get thrown into a post apocalyptic world, in a small, mostly run down town and that's it, you have no direction, no idea where to go, what to do so you get yourself some food, maybe steal a really bad weapon you leave the town and die, that's the end of your character, and you forgot to save so you start again, try something different maybe you hang around the town gates stealing from dead guys and animals that have shown up maybe you start running in a direction and hope those same people or animals don't kill you again 100 hours later you've got a squadron of well trained guys and you've decided to go to war with the biggest faction cos they're kinda a bunch of assholes or maybe you've set up a hashish farm in the swamps and defend it against raiders maybe you've gone solo and decided swords are for the weak and you become the strongest fighter, just punching people to death it's a sandbox through and through"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"one thing i really liked, as far as immersion is concerned, was when baldur's gate 3 threw a chess puzzle at me. it was probably pretty simple but i never learned to play chess so it might as well have been a dc50 check as far as i'm concerned. i was getting ready to break immersion and turn to google when i thought to randomly change party members and, sure enough, one of the party members was a chess master and gave me the solution."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i don't mind getting frustrated or stumped at puzzles and such, but everything i have seen someone game...let's just say most people prefer to be babied it seems. i remember one time i was chilling with a friend playing a game and the minute he hit a puzzle and i do mean the exact second he encountered it he took out his phone to look up the answer. there was 0 attempt made to solve it. i've seen another guy rage quit a game and never pick it up again because he couldn't figure out the right direction to go. there wasn't a very clear walkthrough for it so he just gave up. it took me two days of picking up off an on to realize there was a mechanic he overlooked it was vampyre. you could break barriers...you just had to break a barrier but after that event the game was dogshit in his opinion."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"play older games. i get you might want to play newer releases but why not give games from a previous era a try? some id recommend are the fallout series or the resident evil series. judging by your current issues, i think these games might suit you."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"try monster hunter world. the cutscenes are a tad long, and mechanics start easy enough but are difficult to master, but you get to pick a weapon and go out into a beautiful environment where you can explore and collect and do various tasks, but ultimately your job is to go hunt big monsters. once you understand it, you can spend 15 minutes on it quickly, or play for hours, feeling immersed either way."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,you need to play botw
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,maybe try a straight up survival sandbox game without built in rp? some of them might seem simple but have complex mechanics and stories in reality while you actually play depending on how you play. you make your own rp with the provided lore. having said that most of these same games often have a 'tutorial off' menu option. i dont play fps mmo games so i have no idea in that arena. what kind of genre are you interested in?

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,what people don't realize is as you get older or just otherwise more exposed to various media including video games you inevitably won't be as impressed with the things you've already experienced time and time again. in short been there done that.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,it's like every single modern game either takes you out of the game to sell you some form of currency for an eshop. or doesn't trust the player to make a single wrong move. what is going on? you would at least think there is an option in the menu to turn this shit off... video games are mainstream now. the average person needs a lot of hand holding and complains if they miss something. there are still games that don't hold your hand excessively. but you won't find them in the aaa space.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i feel like games have had to make themselves easier to be more accessible and competitive in a generation with a lower attention span. i don't keep up with the latest releases to play myself, but from what i've seen online you basically either have everything highlighted for you, or get told how to beat it after 60 seconds if that. it's kind of annoying to me. but i still wish to find a game that does it to the detriment to the player. like, quest giver tells you to go west, but what you need is east and unless you take the time to find a map or something you wouldn't know. or have a companion tell you how to complete a puzzle, except they're wrong and just blindly following their advice gets you killed. though on one hand i'm not a fan of games that are difficult for difficulties sake. if it requires me having to have instantaneous reflexes, or to memorize one of a dozen combos to beat i won't be for it. but give me a game where the difficulty lies in me having to think. id be all for that."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,have you tried red dead redemption 2 or cyberpunk 2077
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"there are some games that will allow 'getting lost', exploring, navigating with no goal in mine. walking simulators, sandbox and survival games have a lot of that in it, as minecraft isn't going to direct you about like that or give you a ton of handholding on approaching it, nor is tavern keeper, firewatch, journey, a short hike, gone home, everybody's gone to the rapture, unreal world, project zomboid, cataclysm dark days ahead, what remains of edith finch, death stranding. miasmata is a survival exploration game where you must even use your own triangulation to locate yourself on the map before it fills out the map, like this tutorial showshttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vfdirfjrs1fi. as for the problem solving, i do agree that there's a lot of aaa games that do overdo the 'hand holding' as they want to get as many people as possible to solve the game. i wish there was a way to turn it downoff. i find a lot of small studio and indie games don't have that problem, though sometimes it can get to the point that it may need some extra hand holding as trying to figure out a solution without a guide can be frustrating. edit i haven't played the latest zelda games, but i used to love the old ones as a perfect example of 'getting lost'. the original nes game was all about exploration, and then even with maps and such added, it was still a great explore to solve various puzzles and figure out where to go and what to do when you got there."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"baldurs gate 3 doesnt give a single fuck if you do anything the correct way. it just tells you in its own time and way that you fucked up bigly. sometimes several hours later you're given the freedom to push important npc's off cliffs into unrecoverable depths and if that npc had an item you needed for a quest? fuck you, now you cant complete that quest and you know to be more careful in the future it teaches you how the game works but can be unforgivable and unbending until you learn it"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"for game developers, the idea is that the game are mainstream now, or better yet, a game sells more if it is appealing to the average person. and the average person is or they seem to think is quite stupid. another thing ive noticed is that when they say they take into account player feedback and design for user experience, what ends up happening is bombarding you with meaningless trophies because they think you need constant gratification and trying to make the game as frictionless as possible, whereas frustration or necessity is a great teaching technique. as in when you fail at a task boss fight or get frustrated that you cant figure a thing out puzzle then you start using the tools and try different things and play around to find a way."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"this started as a way to make some games more playable if they target a younger audience which is totally fine if you dont overdo it. then it creeped slowly into other games too, which, again, is alright if you keep it simple and let people look for themselves first. then everybody and their mother started playing games and so many people want everything immediatly and as easy as possible so they dont have to struggle for a single second or ask themselves if they should put another braincell into it. best example is eldenring  the whole outcry about wanting an easy mode and shaming everyone who enjoys the hard difficulty."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"you're not getting old. developers are working in ways to try to appease as many gamers as possible, but also not overbearing them with an option for everything. there's a large group of players out there who simply do not have the time to sit down and game for hours as life always seems to find a way to interfere, especially raising kids. to come back to a game days, weeks, or even months later, can be a frustrating experience for them. today's games have these things introduced in order to allow people to get back into a game without much worry. it's not a perfect system, but it's helpful. there's also the core group of players who simply don't want to take the time to play a game as much as experience it. i'm not fond of this group, but i understand their reasoning. there are plenty of games out there and some just don't want to spend too many hours just to experience it. horizon forbidden west is a great example. doing just the main quest can have the game done in about 20 hours. include the side quests, and it can easily hit 60 or more. finding the balance for everyone cannot be an easy task, but i have to admit i find the number of options increasing in the game to be more of an annoyance than a feature, one in which i do wish there was a shut the fck up, aloy option because nothing ruins the fantastic scenery with aloy repeating endlessly how she needs to get back to the base. i was also not pleased cyberpunk 2077 did the same thing. i want a textless hud, but it's just not possible because the game will always display a distance icon on the screen as well as the status in the lower right. while i was impressed 2.0 offered many more options to remove hud clutter, it just wasn't enough. as an old gamer, the games of the 80s and 90s taught me to play differently. it's not just a boomer mentality. we truly did have to figure things out because games didn't have the processing power to include what they do today. i just want the ability to disable them. it's all i can ask."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,"i just got project zomboid and i gotta say its a really cool game, very complex and no hand holding"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,sounds like you could use outer wilds
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,i randomly got into a game that isn't even finished but i enjoy mindlessly killing zombies and exploring. it's called the black masses and i've enjoyed it more than bg3. i have also had a hard time getting interested in a lot of games but this one helped
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,"like spiderman 2 fast response escenes. literally you cannot die if you dont push the buttons yes, the new games are pretty shitty, thats why i change to a different public games like crpg and tactic combat. i prefer take my time to enjoy and explore the enviroment with their own risks."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,your edit answers your question for you. you're getting watered down aaa games and not spending money on the good stuff
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,"just played the dead space remake , it's sooooo good. maybe try this"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,"this is why i like bg3 so much. they let you fuck up and they pull no punches when you do. accidentally nuked myself, my entire party, and pretty much the whole map once lmao."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,i found the solution. it's any open world game. kill everyone in it and then spend the next year or two wandering around shooting random things with nobody else around.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,i would suggest trying something that seems interesting that you dont normally like. i never really liked sim games but have been enjoying city skylines and surviving mars.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,"i don't know if its your type of thing but give outer wilds a try. i don't want to spoil the plot but in a very generic nutshell, you're a space explorer, and you're uncovering a ancient mystery trust me there's a lot more to it but i can't say it without revealing the plot. but you're basically thrown into that world with basically nothing to go off of, and you have to work your own way around the game, talking to people, observing patterns, etc. and gain context clues which lead you elsewhere. basically, its all on you where you want to begin your journey and how you want to explore. i never got around to finishing the game, because i found out it wasn't my thing, but even i have to admit, it was a pretty well done game. zero hand holding whatsoever."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,outer wilds! all i can say. one of the best games i have ever played
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"it seems you are being baited into buying games that might fit your taste aesthetically, but not mechanically. there are plenty of games that don't hold your hand or bombard you with hints. baldurs gate 3 and as many have mentioned elden ring come to mind, remnant 2 might be a good game for you as well. as for eshops, they are likely here to stay, games take up to 10 years to make these days, and cost a fortune to develop, most games of a modern quality are going to have secondary income avenues."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-14,"indie games. you are looking for indie games. welcome! i have never payed 70 or 80 dollars for a pay to win, hand holding, micro transaction funnel. aaa is trash. luckily the pc has you covered!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-14,"i would say play subnautica, hollowknight, or outer wilds. those are three of my favorite games solely based on their level of immersion. the issue is, you can totally miss things in those game and sit there wondering what do i do next?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-15,i got very very lost in red dead 2. rode around and fished. cyberpunk and drive around looking for crimes. most recent was elden ring you might just need a good game of a type that you like thats not fully of shitty fetch quests

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i was pretty torn on the story, and the world isn't super complex, but i did enjoy the emphasis on being a detective in a strange new town. i thought that was done real well. having to really read and mark your own map is always a plus for me. i also didn't mind the janky combat."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,im writing this one down! going to check it out. thanks
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"this game is really impressive considering its a budget title, the general immersion is excellent."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i love the map system. it was a full city with roads and you had to mark the crossroad to explore.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,just saw a thing where freeware just got the rights back. they're going to release a better less buggier version soon.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"frogwares has a lot of ambitious ideas about investigation and deduction systems, some of them they're not always able to execute perfectly being a lowbudget studio but i really enjoy what they're trying to do in terms of creating detective games where it feels like you as the player are doing actual investigation and deduction rather than just following map markers and watching cutscenes. they implement some of these ideas of having to ask around, investigate various records etc in sherlock holmes chapter one as well and though that's also not a perfect game by any standard i had a lot of fun playing it. also they're a ukrainian studio, so this is a particularly good time to support them by buying their games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,baldur's gate 3 is one of the few games to make me regret needing sleep

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,yeah forbidden west was annoying but she wouldnt lay everything out in detail and some of those ruins still took me a while. aloy just got repetitive with saying the same thing but it was usually vague enough. but ragnarok if i paused to look at a puzzle for legit 5 seconds either atreus or mimir would just give the answer. edit added a couple words for clarity
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"you have been looking at this puzzle for about 35 milliseconds, here is the answer you moron. how have you not figured it out yet?!?!?!? it would be find if there was an option for always help right away and that was not the default, but as it is, modern games are annoying as heck."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,removed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i wish there was an option to turn these off.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,the hints are all definitely offered like 30 seconds too soon.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"that's because a lot of people don't try to learn in video games. if it's not in your face with ! and arrows and paths, it's not a game and it's now a job. i recently learned this trying to teach my friends how to play a few games. there was no effort and out of 10 people, 7 required serious hand holding. it honestly made me quit logging into discord and just playing by myself for like a month. pure laziness taking over. edit some days i like to throw on a chill game with 0 brain power as well."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"modern? how about hey, listen!  ?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i am playing it right now, and i don't see any immediate hints, may be they fixed it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"gow ragnarok, agreed. it was beautiful, but i could not finish it. found myself wanting something else. idk it just got stale game play wise after awhile. i know the story was brilliant though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"my only annoyance with bg3 is that you can know 100 there is a secret button or door or whatever, but you can't push it if you just got unlucky and every single person fails the check. there's a quest i just never completed because the only way forward was through a hidden door, but everyone even went into camp to get others failed the checks. i even saw the door behind something, but couldn't interact with it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"definitely very little handholding in returnal. control did this pretty well also, there are a few hints offered but only after you spin in circles for a white."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,returnal is a sick ass game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,seconding returnal... the hardest part of the game is understanding how to interact with the world!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,returnal is fucking dope
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"on paper i shouldnt like returnal. im not a big shooter guy. it was the first ps5 game i completed, i just got hooked. if you get a good run, good weapon rng and progress beyond the third biome you can really start melting stuff it can melt you too. once i finally beat the 3rd boss i finished the game with only one death due to my own stupidity. the ascent to hyperion is just so atmospheric too."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,returnal was a great game and needs a sequel asap
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i hate when i'm just walking around and a random perception check passed appears and i just sit there clicking everything and shouting what did i find?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i did beat returnal and seconding this! its amazing. and i will never see astronauts the same way again in media haha
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,siofra river is definitely the wrong place to be.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"me, level 2 and wearing a diaper i bet i can solo this big ass knight on a horse. he wouldnt be here if i couldnt beat him, right?."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"seconding this. elden ring was such a breath of fresh air for the lack of direction. it's the epitome of explore and figure it out yourself. if you really need help, you can always find answers online. i need more games like this."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,everyone getting sent to caelid super early in the game was such a great collective gaming moment
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"as someone with over 1,000 hours in elden ring, i can confirm that every playthrough does feel like a new experience. even when i know where some drops are, it feels great finding new ways to get to them and planning the order in which ill get everything i need for a build."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,terrible way to know since i play mage. i'm always squishy lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,the levelling screen is a puzzle by itself. with 0 handholding
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i sank 160 hours in my first playthrough lol. shit, it took me 60 hours to realize i missed the weeping peninsula"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,op thinks its not their game but it is. once you give in to fromsoft you dont back out ever again. ruined many most? others games for me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,yeah but elden ring isnt a story driven game like the others. its meant to be explored unlike horizon and god of war which are mainly story driven games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"even then the masochist in me continue on regardless. i found myself in caelid waaaaay too early and forced myself through it. took so long to get to the bottom of the caelid tower, and even the dude outside the godskin noble would fuck my shit regularly. i just assumed the game was that difficult first from software game at the time. felt sooo satisfied when i defeated him. then went south to the weeping peninsula and was stunned to find it easy..... god i love that game so much."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,any fromsoft game is the antithesis of modern handhold game design. the earlier games are even worse for not knowing what the fuck to do or to go
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"bruh, i remember trying to beat that tree sentinel in the first area, before even exploring. i knew i could go and beat margit first, but i was too stubborn. when i finally beat that horse riding piece of work, i was so happy."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"dunno how elden ring isn't op type of game when all the other games he mentioned are third person, open world games idk if god of war is open world haven't played it is it the difficulty that makes it not his type of game? i have a feeling once he gets into it it'll be everything he's looking for."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i can't second this enough, no hand holding. the whole game is about learning and figuring things out by your self."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"you havent got long, but its all the time you need."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,just finished this. i cried. perfect ending.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"for anyone looking here, outer wilds is incredible and another game which gives a similar feel plus terror is subnautica. subnautica is very immersive for better or worse."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i can not second this recommendation enough. personally it's one of if not my favorite game of all time.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i tried to play this game like 4 separate times but everywhere i went nothing happened. i found a few places that looked like puzzles, but couldn't do anything. i followed the music, it would lead me to a person, they would talk to me, and that'd be it lol. go somewhere else, run around, try to go back to my ship, it got sucked into a black hole. got so damn lost i had to give up i guess i'm just stupid as hell."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,this is both the best game to ever exist and the least replayable game at the same time.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,can only play it once and then it lives in your head rent free forever.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,arguably the best game of all time in my opinion.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,the first time i realized what was happening before the first...event. i was standing on a planet looking at the sun and the fucking music was so epic and i was like what is happening and it was glorious and i think about it every day
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,upvote for subnautica. ill have to try the other 3 thanks for this list!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"sons of the forest too when they finish it, looks like its close."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,play terraria blind until you get pretty deep. use the game resources and ask reddit if there's a hint when you get stuck. it's a fantastic experience
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i wasn't able to understand valheim. is that game a serious grind? it felt like the loop was repeating the same thing again and again until you have enough to make equipment. compare that to terraria, which has you either playing in the rich underground or gives you constant monster action during the required grind parts. or v rising, which wants you to have a similar large amount or resource, but has more interesting travel and more interesting ways to loot. valheim is beautiful and seems like it has a lot of work put into it, so i hope i'm just misunderstanding something."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,all great games
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,1 for subnautica.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,the witness is one of the best puzzle games i have ever played. at one point i got out colored magnets and a whiteboard to work out some of the puzzles.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,have you tried tunic? its also a masterfully crafted game that you might like like outer wilds try not to spoil yourself too much
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"if you liked the witness, you should give the looker a check. it's a satirical take on the witness, it's only a couple hours long and free on steam"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"that game is a god send for immersion. to the point where if you try to play hardcore you have to start like 7 times because you die before the game even starts because of things like breaking a leg and getting an infection and dying as a child, being generally disliked enough to get pitchfork mobbed, etc. 1010 will die as an infant again"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"my only problem with this game is that it trains you to fight 1v1 all the time but keeps putting you in 1v3 situations. now, i can take 1v2, but 1v3 involves constantly backing away and parrying which is just not fun to me... it's a shame because i loved the open world, the story and characters."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,this. such an amazing game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i finally got around to kcd this year and my god, it's everything i ever wanted out of a bethesda rpg, except it wasn't made by bethesda. fantastic rpg elements and the unforgiving save system makes every decision and action have weight to them. the only thing is the combat is really clunky at first, but once you and henry get good it starts to become very satisfying."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,project zomboid is the first game that ever truly sold the oh please don't let that scratch be infected feeling for me

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i had a character last for almost 8 years in game. and i accidentally added bleach as a random ingredient. pz will fuck you raw, no mercy."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,by the time i remembered the story i was so loaded i maxed the camp out entirely and owned all the guns. the we just need the money made me crack up every time since i had like 10k or more consistently.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,its so jarring though because in the missions you need to do exactly what the fuck they say or itll restart the mission. odd game design choice imo but when games get so big i guess you can only let us feasibly do so much.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,lol the missions definitely hold your hand though
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i should really get this game. ive tried it twice. installed, played 30 minutes, uninstalled. couldn't get past the intro. but maybe it's time.."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"seriously? rdr2 is one of the most strict, guided, restrictive games i've ever played. you have to do things in the exact sequence the game tells you, in the exact order and place, and if you try to do anything creative or different it fails the mission. for fucks sake, there's a mission where a required step is pick up your hat. doesn't babysit you much, my ass"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,a lot of these are def good examples save for maybe mario odyssey if you're wanting something with very little guidance on what to do.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"botw and mario odyssey are probably the most lost ive ever in a game. and it was absolutely wonderful. nintendo really knows how to immerse their players. my worst mistake ever was going into totk with a walkthrough guide. i had completely forgotten how immersive the botw exploration was, and completely spoiled the experience for myself with totk."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i've played both botw and totk with pro hud just the healthbar and nothing else. lets you truly appreciate the visual design of the game, i barely got lost because you can ask npcs for directions, there are road signs everywhere, you can almost see hyrule and another landmark to guess your direction. not to mention you can use the sun as a guide too. there hasn't been a more immersive experience for me"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i really liked the green lights on jump platforms in doom. it helped to see where i needed to go, but wasn't immersionbreaking"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,the politics in that game alone are cool as shit
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,yeah... i remember paying that game and trying to hit a woman and couldn't. could not hit her. i had to run away and got lost. wound up finding a dwarven ruin and got lost in there too.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i played fenyx rising on switch after playing botw. i enjoyed it for the zeldaclone that it was. combat and cosmetics were both better than botw, but the world map littered with collectables did get a bit stale. still, wish the sequel didn't get cancelled."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i loved loved loved fenyx. i got it on steam and didn't have any ubisoft popups as umadaboutmaps mentioned. i'm sorry y'all didn't have the superb experience i had. i agree with you, jaded, about the puzzles toward the end being more annoying than fun. and yeah, the time fillers  addon fetish is all feeding these twin gods of game length and more profit forever."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i had the same thought. i still play aaa games fairly regularly, but most the games i play nowadays are indie games. they tend to hold your hand less, be more experimental, and just take more risks. i have been disappointed by a lot of the aaa games i've played in the last year as they have been really bland for me. admittedly, you will have more indie games to choose from if you have a gaming pc, but there's still a good number of indie games on console as well."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"this is the same problem with modern tv and cinema, writers have to craft a story that the dumbest viewer can grasp, making the rest of us sick from the clunky dialogue and intrigue with the subtlety of a screaming child."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"got is one of the best games ive played. its absolutely gorgeous, soundtrack is amazing and the swordplay feels good. and jin doesnt have something to say about every single thing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,an absolute pleasure to 100 that game. the multiplayer they added later on was also a blast. a more ambitious sequel cant come soon enough
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"1 for the botw recommendation. past the plateau, and even on it, the game let's you do what you want"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"my experience with remnant 2 was that it goes all the way round the other extreme to having secrets be so obtuse, cryptic and so unlikely to be found by just playing the game that you end up looking everything up on a wiki anyway. stuff like having to reroll the entire campaign until you get the exact combination of areas that you then have to complete in the right order and move items from one world to the other in the right places with zero indication of anything is just too much."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i agree with you. remnant 2 might be the experience that op is looking for. there's lots of puzzles and discoverables. a lot of which you won't be able to find on your first playtheough
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,hollow knight is a great one. looking forward to silksong this year
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"omigosh, yes. the indie games are fantastic. check out splattercatgaming on yt. that's all he covers. for over a decade. he's introduced me to dozens of great games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i've never been able to get onto a single souls game. they don't do anything for me.. it's also not that i mind easy games. i mind having every step being told what to do. or pop ups taking me out of a world im playing. i want to just play a video game without being interrupted every step
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i was going to say that too. i haven't been able to really get sucked into any games lately. but then i picked up bg3 two weeks ago and i can not stop. i even got my boyfriend addicted to it and it's all we talk about.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,today i'll sleep early.... is that the sun rising? 330hs and still want to play it more
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,truth. this is the first game that got me until sunup i years. probably not since rdr2.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i'm actually home with a burn out from work. and i'm trying to get my mind of things. but it's not working. i don't have anything else though. i could smoke weed and stay in bed for a month but that's not helping anybody. i go for walks and the like. but that's an hour a day at most. i just can't seem to spend the time without ending up screaming and throwing punches at the wall..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"yep, especially after you leave the tutorial area. my most memorable part of the game was early on, just exploring, sneaking past higher level enemies or finding creative ways to beat them. years of the kingdom even more where it can be extremely easy to miss how to expand your inventory, upgrading armor, expanding battery capacity and the auto build ability. also, exploring the depths was extremely satisfying early on. always a sense of accomplishment getting to the next light root."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,they downvoted him because he spoke the truth.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,people downvoting you are really missing out.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,sad but true
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"haha man i remember being a kid with a brand new windows 95 computer that came with a demo disk for a game called cyberia. literally no hand holding. the first encounter in that game is a man who ambushes you from a corner and if you dont react perfectly, and perfectly on time, he shoots you in the head and the game resets. imagine being 11 years old, experiencing gaming as an emergent form of entertainment, looking at a full size computer keyboard and wondering what button is the right button and having to repeat that section x100 times until you clicked the right button at the right time. no prompts. no controller setting menu. no game instructions just merciless trial and error. when i finally figured out what to do it was euphoric, until the next so or die moment pops up about 15 minutes later and you have to do it all over again and get good at memorizing the timing and buttons for all of your moves. then later a game called myst came out arguably the first open world game filled with obtuse, abstract logic puzzles, with no minimap, well no map at all. just exploration. do or die. need a map to remember where certain things are on this seemingly immeasurable island? grab a pencil and some legal pad and draw one! games today are definitely easier than they used to be, for better and for worse. the better less fussing with mechanics and being able be immersed in the stories. the worse a real lack of mystery and magic, when the game's mechanics aren't explicitly spelled out for you at every turn, you miss out on the sensation that anything is possible here... and there was some magic to the negative space in your imagination that a situation with seemingly infinite possibilities for solutions opened up. those were the situations that lead to many a magical school yard debates!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,best stupid horrible masterpiece i've ever played. it's definitely one to get lost in.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i love these accessibility changes. let those who want a difficult game have that and others choose their own. i liked gow ragnarok especially the auto loot thing. i always forget to pick stuff up after battles

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i'm trying. but i don't think it's 100 that. the makers of horizon forbidden west i think care heaps. and the game shows that. the story is awesome. it looks phenomenal. but it gets temporarily ruined at times by the commentary. league of legends is obviously a money printing machine. but i like it loads at times. other times i can't stand it p
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i never played this. was waiting for some reports that the stutteryness had been patched out. then came the dead space remake and i realised i never wanted to play the callipso protocol. i wanted dead space and tcp would have just been a nicotine patch where what i wanted was a ciggy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"you're playing it wrong. there's a million sequence breaks if you actually bothered exploring, in fact the game gives you little hints that you can do so. fusion railroaded you to a ridiculous extent by comparison, and dread has a very similar feel to zm."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i do want to stress that there is some jank here i think this game would have been better served as a narrative adventure in the telltale games style.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,they do get the feel right for the most part.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"yeah, there's a whole story about that. there was some major fuckery going on."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,ugh i just never wanna stop playing. haven't felt this way playing a game since witcher 3.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"forbidden west was really annoying for me, because i would be searching the area for collectables and whatnot, but she would just be yammering on and on about the puzzle i was standing next to. you just had to be close to something for her prattle on about. i ended up disabling any sort of assistance the game offered because aloy either constantly pointed out incredibly obvious shit, or was ruining the actual puzzle as i was solving it... like shut the fuck up and let me play the game, aloy!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,forbidden west is attrocious i had to turn dialogue volume down to 0 and turn subtitles off so i could get some peace and quiet from her yapping
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"well modern gaming thinks accessibility means hand holding so its no surprise. i expect this from games meant for kids, not rated m titles. i can only imagine some of the original god of war complaints today plz nerf platforming hades level too hard checkpoint go back to far"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,my favourite was when i got stuck in like a statue room in alfheim with atreus and tyr and their constant hints simply weren't helpful
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,my biggest complaint is that the hints just aren't helpful. they're either painfully obvious or absent when you really need them.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"it probably had a massive smear of yellow paint on it as well, just like every other grabbable ledge conveniently happens to have."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i could've sworn there was in the accessibility options?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,you pretty much gave the reason why devs make the games this way. a vast majority prefer to have arrows pointing where they need to go or how to solve puzzles etc.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i'll always remember the time i suggested a friend play portal around when it came out...it requires you to experiment a little to learn how things work but isn't all that hard...yet, they had zero interest or capacity in doing so, not because they weren't smart enough, but because they weren't interested in interacting with a game in a new way, that experimentation that i found so exciting back in the day was a chore to them. like...everybody has different tastes, i get that, but the fact that simply being asked to learn new mechanics was an impassible barrier was more than a little alarming. they didn't dislike the mechanics, they didn't want to even try them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"yep, mass appeal and accessibility have brought gaming to its 'marvel' era and people wonder why movies are doing worse and worse."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"those were pretty vague and riddlelike, and i at the time felt like you would go long stretches of time without her saying anything."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"and then she'd give you a very vague hint that didn't help you get through the lost woods whatsoever..... and going to that farm...ok, no one is frigging talking to me over here and telling me where the heck i cam find king jabujabu...."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,still couldn't find where to go in the water temple without help.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"yeah the hints 10 seconds after getting to an area was dumb and ironwood might have been one of the most boring sections of a game i've ever played. gotta grind out the berserker grave stones and defeat gna, i wouldn't call the gameplay against them stale i thought they were a fun challenge."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,me too. i had a lot of fun until i just totally stopped 85 through.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"you can turn those check rolls off so the game doesn't tell you when you fail them. the prompt letting you know you failed is remnant of actual dd, since you know damn well when the dm is rolling dice. you can also take a long rest and return, and you'll reroll those skill checks. failed exploration rolls are reset after a day."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i hear you, that's the rough balance of role playing. you as a player know a thing but your characters who are present there do not due to failed rolls. as players we want to use this meta knowledge, but in a game thats using rules similar to tabletop rpgs we cant always do that because our characters are not omniscient and will not find every hidden door."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"for a lot of them you can still interract with them it just doesn't highlight them, like the dirt piles. others, you can reroll the perception or arcana by reentering an area like the traps. for gale's personal quest with all the traps the game is pretty much like pick a character with high arcana to avoid traps if you talk to actual npcs."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,agreed! returnal is a masterpiece all across the board! i remember beating it before they added the biome checkpoints so you could take breaks during gameplays.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"definitely my favorite game this generation thus far between every platform. challenging, fun and rewarding gameplay. also not as insanely difficult as fromsoftware games that you want to punch a wall during parts of the playthrough"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"100 agree with this, almost 3 years later returnal is still one of my favorite games this gen. tight gameplay  controls, captivating environments  exploration, demands you learn its systems and stay on top of your game. i cannot wait for housemarque's next project."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i played demon souls when the ps5 released and gave up on it after about an hour or so. this was before i understood there was a very specific way to play souls games. nbsp elden ring looked a bit odd, and people kept referring to it as a souls game which, again, i didn't understand what that meant other than it being hard but i bought it anyway after the overwhelming positive reviews and feedback. nbsp first off it is absolutely beautiful, right out of the gate. the story was a little annoying at first, until i learned that it is supposed to be vague, and you are supposed to go out of your way to learn the lore, which again, annoying at first until i started to surprise myself with how much fun i had doing so. nbsp also, with the help of a mage build for my first playthrough, it finally helped me learn how the game is supposed to be played. nbsp honestly, this was the first time in a very long time where i initially didn't like a game, but as i kept at it it naturally became more, and more, and more, and more amazing. fucking 1010 experience and game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"elden ring made me realize how much i use ingame journals as a crutch, because unless you're checking descriptions of everything and logging the information away personally, you're going to miss plenty of sidequests and other cues. and i love it for that! a great game to go get lost in."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"to a point though, i spent 2 months traveling and came back and couldn't remember where the heck i was in the game, i've spent like 10 collective hours trying desperately to find out what or where or who i'm supposed to go to next, just keep running into mobs way too tough. people say follow the essence directions from the campfires, but those keep leading me to dead ends. i just wish i at least knew exact which major bosses i've killed and which would be a good place to go. like damn man, just give me a tiny hint, make me have to pay that person like 10k runes for a hint or something so it's costly to me. just....i need a tiny something goddamn man i'm too old and feeble to wander around another 30 hours with no feeling of progressing anywhere and you can't really look up online where to go if you don't know what the next step is in killing a boss"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i loved hollow knight for exactly this  few to no directions, next to no hints on where to go next and you can just explore."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"no, you understand valheim. it's very much a slow, slow game. much of it is even set up to be intentional time padding. thankfully, between mods and word settings, you can reduce or remove some of the time padding, but it's still very padded. lugging 18 pieces of iron out of a crypt 6 times in a row over the course of 6 hours interspersed with having to deal with your crops and hunting so you even have food, eventually having to spend 45 minutes on a boat heading againstwind the entire time, just so you can make a couple things and realize you didn't get even 13 the iron you need... and it only gets worse. disclaimer i've beaten the game and do like it, but god does it have some serious time padding."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i think valheim is what you make of it. i generally dislike games that are a grind for gear, or stats, or whatever. not my cup of tea at all. but playing valheim with a friend was one of the best experiences i've ever had gaming. it was so immersive that i was lost in the game. i wouldn't have enjoyed it nearly as much in single player  it really requires you to play with others to get the full experience, imho. the game had a sense of real risk and exploration that made the game rewarding for me. going on a long voyage, cobbling together a makeshift shelter in pouring rain before the sun sets and things get really hairy. sailing 40 minutes away from our base, then accidentally ending up too close to a biome that we had no business trying to explore yet, and nearly wiping and losing all of our gear. valheim gave me more legit adrenaline dumps than any game i've played before or since  maybe i'm weird, but it was exhilarating at times. the building aspect of the game really scratched an itch for me, too. my friend didn't care much for it, but somehow harvesting stone at a quarry and dragging it back and forth to upgrade our crappy wooden fort into a stone castle was super rewarding for me. some people don't care too much for that subsystem the building, but i could get lost in it for a long time. i put in 120 hours and wasn't even bored, though eventually i moved on to other things because we had beaten all of the content in the game at that point and more has been added, since. i can understand that it wouldn't be for everyone, but if someone had described the game to me, i don't think i would have really cared for it. it was only in playing the game that things really hit. it's one of the most memorable gaming experiences i've had. i look forward to returning to it once it's officially out of early access and finding some friends to play through it with again."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"the game sinks a lot of time in grinding so it appears longer. the truth is, once you got the materials needed it's just a matter of building new equipment and go fight the biome boss. the other time sink is exploration but that one is fun at least. i don't mind a little grind, but the grind for iron for example is just too much. pressing a button for hours is not gaming."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"if you like puzzles and want one on the go that'll make you feel like an idiot, check out baba is you. it is deceptively simple, some of the puzzles have taken me and my two very smart brothers literal weeks to figure out. it's on steam but i play on mobile and the mobile controls are great."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"the rpg elements and story are fantastic, the combat is hit or miss. 1v1s or fights with mid tier enemies is where it shines. unfortunately way too many fights turn into backpedal and counter so that you don't get swarmed..."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,the intro and even first little bit of chapter 2 is tough to get through until you open some things up and figure out how the game really works. but it is very easy to get lost in it and worth the investment.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i tried it 3 times before finally sticking with it. please go in with that its a game of immersion, slow and steady. dont go in expecting big hits of dopamine and rewards every 35 mins. its a slow game so when you sit down to play it, think of it as a western life simulator. after a while youll learn how alive the world is, appreciate the small details from the towns to the wildlife, and youll get pulled into the story. by the end of the game youll have taken a long burn of one of the best video games of all time. its an experience."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"it sounds like you just want a puzzle game. you dont like handholding, you dont like games with immersive storytelling. have you tried looking into more direct puzzle andor exploration games? how do you feel about platformers? those are typically more skill based and less handholding."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,am considering buying nintendo just to play botw
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,hahaha hahahaha hah...... yeah i'm sure also looking forward to silksong this year or like in 2026
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"have you played zelda breath of the wild or tears of the kingdom? they don't give many clues at all, and are kind of what you make of them. they are also less combat focused vs the souls games"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,you might be depressed. thats always my clue when it flares up in my life  the moment video games stop being fun
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"hey man i cant tell you what games you might like, but i can say one of the coolest and most innovating games ive played lately with zero handholding and insane amounts of immersion and atmosphere is called the outer wilds. if you like space, learning the lore of games, and exploring, this game is your dream."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i mean you just described the souls games.. maybe give them another chance. no pop ups, no quest logs, no maps. after playing a few of them it's been very hard to get back into aaa games now that they all feel like they hold your hand and are just fetch quests with pin points on a map."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"you might like sludge life  it's hard to explain, so i recommend checking out the trailer on steam, but it's a great game and has, i think, no ingame popups at all"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i could be wrong, but it sounds to me like your head isnt yet geared to relax and just enjoy the present. ive experienced this first hand as have we all and its a really selfdestructive cycle thats hard to escape from, but at least youre making an effort and not just wallowing and therefore making matters worse."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"sounds a lot like what i went through a few years ago. quit my job over the burnout, even. my answer was death stranding. it was a weird and bizarre one, being a kojima title, and does take a minutefew hours to open up, but the payoff of the rest of the game is absolutely worth it. got sucked in and it really helped for the burnout and the weird gaming blues and honestly became one of my favorite games. can't recommend it enough."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"you sound depressed. i don't have much advice for you but i do have sympathy. good luck, bro."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,do you have any creative hobbies? i split my time between making art and gaming. can highly recommend drawing as a brutally nothand holding way to blow off steam
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,thats what im saying and there was no youtube walkthroughs and guides either. you either got good or gave up lol. but damn it felt nice when youd beat it. it simply just made the gaming experience actually worth it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,shit does get a touch weird in it but the gameplay remains solid.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"exactly, and i wrote my message as someone with a down syndrome cousin. he played spiderman 2 at my house with every accessibility option on, other than deaf and colorblindness and he had lots of fun that wouldve been annoyance if not for those options or help."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,as it should. jagex purchases them not too long ago haha
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,what the? again? its already been removed and come back once
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"yeah, i enjoyed this one, but its an odd little duck of a game. it felt like there was little benefit to it being open world at all."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,im on my first play thru right now and theres so much to explore. theres so much stuff to miss. im in thorms tomb right now. i really never want to stop playing.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,i bought a wireless xbox controller that links to my pc for bg3 and you walk around using the joystick outside of combat.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,hey i can see with the eyes in the back of me head lad!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"that's because she's thinking to herself, not actually talking. if you have headphones you can actually hear the difference."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"the conversations she has over her focus the thing attached to her brain through her ear happen only inside her brain, as her mouth doesn't actually move."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,so navi on steroids?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,heaven forbid you decide to loot the area before solving the puzzle i quit ragnorak because it got on my nerves very much
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"also like... a lot of these areas aren't easy to get back to, so i really do need to grab the collectibles now, rather than complete the puzzle, get chucked into a boss fight, and end up outside again afterwards with no easy way back to a thing i missed."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,i wonder what's on that tower....i really should climb that tower....maybe there's a way up that tower....i wonder what's on that tower.....ragequit
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"holy shit ffxvi was a terrible offender of this. how long until the game let you do what you wanted to do? its not deep mechanically, there is no reason for it to be that bad. cool game though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i'm really glad the yellow paint company has work outside of resident evil
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,it always trips me out when ledge or things to grab out in the middle of nowhere is painted. like the uncharted games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i think you can turn off the yellow smear from what i recall? but it's been a while since i've played
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,shut up about the ledge! shut up about the ledge!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"the worst is when devs realize a part of the game sucks, so they have the character say, this sucks. so you feel a weird connection with them. like, no, just remove that section from the game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"no i agree. i hate it when the character i'm playing in a game is trying to tell me what i should be feeling. look, devs. if your game isn't wowing me with the visuals or writing, the main character describing it for me isn't going to either. if it is wowing me, then why the hell do i need to hear someone tell me about it? it's fine if it's a character talking to a different character, but spare me the internal monologues."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,i miss silent protagonists
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,welcome to modern game making. where they either force companions on you to keep you from being lonely or the mc can't keep their mouth shut. i've been trying to play uncharted legacy of thieves but the constant stupid comments coming out of the mc's mouth just kill my enjoyment.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"there is for forbidden west. there isnt for ragnarok. however it has been patched to take a bit longer for atreus and mimir to intervene due to backlash. wish i could turn them off completely though edit the extended puzzle timer many people are mentioning gives you more time to do timed puzzles. it does not interfere at all with character interjections for puzzle solutions, unfortunately"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,for sure. i used questie in wow because i lost interest in quests and only had a desire to do end game. it pointed me where i needed to go with pretty colors and icons. eventually blizzard ended up implementing similar in their default.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i don't mind that, i just wish they'd have a no hints option for the crowd that doesn't want it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i don't mind mass accessibility. i think its just nice when its a spectrum or customizable. there are a few games that i think did accessibility really well. tomb raider series, marvel's spiderman series, horizon series, and hellblade just a single game, but hopefully the sequel keeps it up. hellblade's was the most natural as you can make it adaptive. keep dying? it just gets a little easier. go too long without difficulty? starts throwing more enemies. video game market has ages that span multiple generations now. folks over 50 play video games and kids under 15 as well. it makes sense as a company to enable targeting as much as possible. it also makes sense as an artist who wants their work to reach as many people. edit and folks have varying amounts of time they can dedicate to a game. some folks want to experience games but can't spent hours a day just to get past one obstacle."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"you can also take a long rest and return, and you'll reroll those skill checks. failed exploration rolls are reset after a day. fucking whaaaaaaaaat?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"you know damn well when the dm is rolling dice. dm here. you know what's hilarious? telling the players hold on and rolling some dice, looking smug, and asking, okay, so... what exactly do you do? that way, they don't always know something is up. dirty little secret sometimes the players will come up with some suspicion that's so good, i'll have to improvise and throw it in."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"it's not when you know there's something there because of the failed check. it's when you know what exactly is there despite the failed check, like a sliding bookshelf with a door behind it. i will say i didn't know perception checks reset after a day though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,since you know damn well when the dm is rolling dice and a good dm takes advantage of that paranoia by randomly rolling dice for no reason.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"man talking to that cow is quite a f'ing trip, try it on your next playthrough"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"love vldl, thanks for reminding me this gem exists"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i've really been enjoying alan wake 2. i definitely felt like i had a couple times where i got stuck and had to figure it out, once i got into the dark place part. i can't remember if the hinting talking was either less helpful or just less frequent."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,that tower climb with the music getting louder and louder the close you get is amazing
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i have it on pc and it ran great. give it a shot!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"i played before they added midrun saving, by the 6th hour of a run i was nervous i would lose all my progress somehow"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,but there's that chest that ports you to the mine with the bug people in caelid. i'd have considered it a softlock if i wasn't already a souls veteran and knew that the oo strat in souls games is run for your life and do not engage
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"man, on launch day of elden ring my friend and i were in a party as we played and about 2 hours in i found the chest that teleports you to caelid. me and my friend freaking out as i got sent to the bug tunnel and eventually making it out to see a blood red sky is one of my favorite gaming memories."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"more like shit i think i stepped on another sheep, oh well"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,the funny thing is a vetern of the souls games will have that exact same thought process. my friend and i spent a good few hours fighting him when we got into elden ring.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"it was, lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"picked up armored core last raven and can confirm, it's always been like that. holy shit it's hard but that's what keeps me going. the game does not care about you and has a very high skill wall from the start."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i gave up on grim fandango because i couldnt figure out any of the contrived puzzles and i might as well just watch a playthrough if i have to look everything up anyway
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"games like that were rough for me because it didn't even feel like a puzzle was in my way. i just couldn't figure out where i needed to go next. it got to the point where i was just mashing buttons against every surface and person available to me, but nothing yielded new results."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,i loved those lucasarts games but i don't think i made it more than like 5 minutes into grim fandango because i think i got stuck in literally the first area.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i initially didn't like a game, but as i kept at it it naturally became more, and more, and more, and more amazing i had that exact same experience with ds1. played it for a couple hours, thought this game is complete bullshit. put it down for a couple years, played it again and just gutted through dozens of deaths and finally had a light bulb moment. as far as story, lore  yeah, i know some people are really into it, but the anime mythology told through item descriptions and subtle hints just isn't my speed. all i know is there are bad things that i must destroy."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"there is no way that the game is supposed to be played. the only objective in souls games is to not die. whatever play style achieves that for you is how the game is supposed to be played. and that is entirely dependant on the player. it is completely customizable. i favour a high endurance build with a light bleed weapon. often times i play through the entire game with only a dagger. i have never once used incantations in any souls game. and thats the whole beauty of souls games. they allow you to take on giants, dragons, and gods armed with just a shield and a dagger."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,the spacing in this comment got me shook
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,it's interesting but ultimately it leans a little too far into the lack of direction than i would prefer. id be happier with having no objective markers or quest log if the game made it a more reasonable task to find npcs and complete quests without needing to get lucky or look up a wiki. i tried keeping a journal for a while when i played the game but eventually i got frustrated and started looking stuff up because i like to experience story and quests in my game not run around in a circle looking for the next step in such. i enjoy the difficulty of elden ring but i like that difficulty in the combat not in trying to follow the story or understand what i am supposed to be doing.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"yes, that part i like. i do think the quest design in general is fucked tho, like you spoke to the wrong person between steps 45 despite no indication or warning otherwise so now youre permanently locked out of the quest this run, try again in ng. if i ever get to the end of the game anyways. definitely got lost in the game and have no intention of getting unlossed"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"there's definitely a level of balance that can be achieved. elden ring mostly makes exploration fun but it does an absolutely atrocious job of telling you its story. fun bosses, fun gameplay, absolutely no effort to tell you a story when they scatter things across the descriptions of weapons, armor, and modified armor pieces."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"you should be able to figure out which major bosses you've killed based on which great runes you have some may be activated, some may not, or which items called remembrances you have, as those only come from major bosses."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i'm with you. i love souls games but this one was just too big for me. i had no information even with the golden trail thing. it would lead me to a door or something i couldn't get in or a mountain and now what? i played for weeks and just decided this was not a game for me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,a few people bounce off of it. there is no right path or way to play but i'd try to at least visit every planet and explore around that usually will get you far enough to get hooked. the subreddit group is awesome with spoilers and to avoid big spoilers or walkthrough you can post in the subreddit for hints if you get really stuck.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"the first area is basically just a tutorial area for the various systems in the game. once you get the ship, the whole game opens up for you to explore."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"whenever you start getting lost and have no leads, go screw around in some planet until you find something, explore unknown signals with your signal sensor and recheck your ship log to see if there's a clue you missed."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,maybe play a little tune
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,dlc was kinda scary ngl
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i hope you fall in love with it as much as i did. try not to look anything up about it. i would trade almost anything for another whirl at that game, but sadly, its magic is lost on a second playthrough for the most part. if you get stuck, just try somewhere else is all i can say safely. good luck with your travels."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,it's one the best games ever made and can only be experienced once. so take your time walking around and don't rush. go back to the places you visited before and enjoy being there and don't google anything
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"no i didn't read it, i fuckin studied everything i came across. only guess is i went places the game didn't think i would go to first. idk."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"maybe ill fire that up again then, i played once they didnt even had a log cart, it was tedious."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,the guide is your friend the guide is a son of a bitch who always leaves the door open for monsters!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,but i have this voodoo doll...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"it also just... has very little content. i dumped hours into it until there was nothing left to do, then stepped away from it for a couple years. when i came back, it felt like nearly nothing had changed. the game has heaps of potential and one of my favorite building systems, but it's just very, very slow to update and it really hurts the experience"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i am not even being facetious when i say that the wind must be coded to be in your face unless you use the moder power.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,no ore through a teleport was a bad choice imo. it's so tedious to just sail back and forth. eventually you just make another world and warp back and forth because it's less time consuming.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"time padding yes, but definitely fits the op's bill of 'getting lost in a game' by which i assume they mean you feel immersed and lose track of time. it's a wonderful atmospheric game that constantly builds tension and forces you to think and plan."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"100. 2 of my top 5 gaming moments ever were in valheim playing with friends. normally when you die in a seemingly unfair way, it's demoralizing, but when you've got friends playing with you, it becomes a great challenge and adventure retrieving your gear. my group's first experience with the swamp was like we were defending minas tirith in the two towers. epic."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,jesus christ be praised!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,only when you are playing hardcore. normal doesn't have that
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,dying is fun is one of my favorite subgenres of games. i recently got into noita and it's very much in that vein.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,don't you ever call fucking micah my friend!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"true, as a game it rewards explorationexperimentation and paying attention to the environment."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i highly recommend buying a switch, especially if you can find it cheap. or possibly waiting for the rumoured switch 2 if it ends up having backwards compatibility.there's so many great, unique games for the platform that you can't find anywhere else. i can give you a whole list of games that you can only find on the switch that are considered some of the best games in their genres. the sheer variety in its library is one of the switch's greatest strengths. that and its simplicity. i love my pc but i feel like half my time using it is either downloading games, installing mods or troubleshooting. it takes a lot of time and it's something i have to make room for. the switch is something i can just pick up and play and it works and i can't tell you how refreshing that is."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"highly recommend the aaa games are the best there are, and the indie library is super solid as well!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,you're right about this. but i have nothing else right now.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,ive seen this suggestion come by more than once. i've put it on my wishlist at number two. right behind r2d2
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"yeah, constantly consuming leaves me empty too. i find creating can help break that cycle, if there is some creative things you want to try, do it. especially if you are tired of things holding your hand and you want some challenge."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"yeah, but im pretty sure now its because the proper developers have the rights"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,theres so many things you will only find when replaying. i totally lost it when i saw you can smear shit on your face to get into the goblin camp. the kinda option to progress that wouldnt even cross my mind
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"check out their other game, divinity original sin. very similar game. they are just so god dam good"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,only thing he's seeing with those is kratos' posterior.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,hey! listen!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i heard that someone apparently got so upset they changed the language to italian.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,both gow are offenders of this. fcking hell i mean sure make it accessible but fck me at least give the players an ounce of trust that they have at least more than 2 brain cells. dev's expectation is that all players are dumbasses.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"yeah in a way its almost condescending, part of my enjoyment comes from figuring it out. i recently really cracked into baldurs gate 3 and im not a turn based gamer or a dnd player and know nothing about either, strictly trying to branch out and check out a highly rated game. tldr its great but its quite the learning curve and the game has all the info but im expected to experiment a bit and search out some info myself. its been fun."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"uncharted i don't mind as much especially in the chase or escape sequence, but when the characters ruin the immersion by telling you its grabable its so annoying"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,eh in gow at least they justified it ingame by saying kratos' wife painted out their journey before she died
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"you can, but don't let that get in the way of people complaining."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,i simply cannot play elden ring because it has absolutely zero quest log or at least some form of help for whats your objective at the moment. you just run around and have mostly no idea what to do. imo it just ruined the whole game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i'm also learning this just now and yeah, fucking what"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"if you pet the dog scratch enough, you can summon them later, they'll tag along with the party, and they can spot things better than players can"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,another little niche tip is if something requires a strength check to turn or pull you can throw a bottle of grease before or after you fail the check at it and as far as i understand it completely removes the check.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"also, always summon scratch for an extra chance to spot things. he can't die and can be summoned against after either a short or long rest."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"nothing better than fake rolls to keep the players on their toes. another secret  sometimes we don't have an answer to the puzzle, we're just waiting for something clever from the players."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"you know it, but your character doesn't. you might not like it but that's just dd. your character keeps walking into a wall because you are pushing them there, not because they noticed something."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"you can usually interact with items despite failed checks, as well. switches still work. you can dig up items if you know where to dig. tbh i can't think of an area that's actually impassable from a failed investigation. you may be missing a step on the process some doors aren't just usable when seen. for example, there's a hidden door that can be found but will not open unless you cast lightning magic nearby. there's no door handle standard or interaction"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i dont know if thats true or not. afaik, once you miss them you cant retry them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,oh boy i wasnt ready for those images. not even sure what happened but am quite sure that killing it there was not the answer.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,that's where i'm at. i wouldn't say the puzzle are difficult but it also feels early game still.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,same plays beautifully on my pc
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"lost 5k souls in that damn mine because of that chest, that damn millipede looking thing that jumps on you is horrifying"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,that portal shaped my entire first playthrough. ran in fear from the dungeon and came across rock sling and meteorite staff
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i would go as far as to suggest that getting teleported to the bug mine without an easy way back is the games way of brutally teaching you that sometimes the correct answer is run away as fast as you goddamn can
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,thats the cave that taught me that strat.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"mos def, i had to check out online how to get out since it was my first soul game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i spent so long trying to get out of this place. and it was months later i found out that i could have just fast traveled to a site of grace or the roundtable hold. you know damn well fromsoftware knew exactly what they were doing too. everyone i hear about this experience says they never thought once about fast traveling out instead of trying to sneakrunfight their way out.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,that knight is just a gamebro looking to crush noobs!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"yep, it took me like 15 tries but i killed him naked with the club cause i got stubborn. i killed margit first try with the halberd."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i am pretty much the same as you. lightbulb moment and boom, i am suddenly destroying lesser enemies with such incredible ease i am actually embarrassed by how much trouble i was having with them in the beginning. nbsp as far as story and lore, i think it's an interesting way to tell the deeper significance of things and history i have not played a game that does this before but i am not hellbent on reading every items description for the story. i must be elden lord. that is all i care for lol."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"this is what a lot of mediocre games fear, that you'll be challenged too early and drop the game before being invested enough to get hooked and buy dlc, skins,etc so they constantly give you directions and hints and the easy way out so you don't put the game down and play something else. great games don't care, people will figure it out and become passionate enough to tell everyone about it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,lies of p did this really well by showing an npc icon on fast travel points if they had a new interaction  quest etc
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"without needing to get lucky or look up a wiki. as an example of how easy it is to miss important story beats i didn't even know who tf ranni was, because apparently i missed seeing her at the church right at the beginning of the game. i didn't stay there until nightfall, just floated in and out, talked to the merchant dude, and left. i didn't get the spirit summoning bell until hours later at the hub zone."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i like the exploration of it but quest givers should give some kind of hint where to find them next. the game kind of expects you to go and do a full relook of all the places you have visited before. for example i visited that poison castle thing before pacthes were there. how i was supposed to know when he went there.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"yeah, i agree with you. overall i loved the game but i think there should be a little more direction when it comes to some quests. just a little, not quest arrows or logs, but something. i got this one but i was watching a big streamer play the game, one that is familiar with souls games and their quests and he still missed a big part of a critical side quest !specifically the part of the ranni quest when you need to talk to her in her doll form in ainsel river. the first two ? times you do it she doesn't say anything, and on top of that, you only get the prompt to talk to her in that specific area.! !so if you don't realize that you have to keep trying to get a response from the doll, by the time you get to the next grace the prompt goes away and it's easy to miss the rest of the quest. ! most of the quests were less obtuse though, i think this is one of the worst offenders."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,but thats the thing they are not designed to be quests. those stories progress or end in different directions with or without your interference.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"my first playthrough i explored all over the place and kind of patched everything together towards the end, but if you follow the guidelines and read the notes, you can make the experience fairly linear e.g. planet by planet."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"ehhhhh, compared to modern horror games like outlast or something, the dlc is like just light horror at most. although i was pretty terrified, but that's cause i'm a big baby who doesn't play true horror genre games. i don't like it when things touch me unexpectedly, even if i can't feel the touch. lmao"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,people say dont look things up but i think its a better experience if new players understand that the game is about reading text and actually using that knowledge to progress. i bounced off it a couple times as i didnt really understand this concept as its so different from modern games using text as lore.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"if youre looking for something to happen other than yknow, !the sun exploding!, then youre not really going to find much in the game. progress is made almost entirely through learning. for me, i assumed that the goal was to !stop the sun from exploding and save my planet!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"there is no right place to go first. every location only holds part of the answer, and is usually connected to multiple other locations. there is a log on the ship that keeps track of the things you come across and can help make sense of clues and point in a general direction to find connected clues, i'd be sure to check that if you aren't sure where to go next. definitely a game that feeds curiosity and exploration rather than rewarding any specific path."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"the game is built well enough that pretty much everywhere you can go is somewhere you should go. several people in the starter village explicitly tell you next steps, and each of those steps tell you pretty explicitly where to go next, so if you want a more linear intended experience you could always just do what the game tells you to. but it's not a puzzle game, it's an exploration game. to the extent there are puzzles they are pretty much all access puzzles based on learning about and understanding the environment you're in well enough."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i never figured anything out on my own. that game was really cool but it was not for me
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"it feels like i have been waiting for the game to come out on 1.0 for years. i dont play early access games so i have been waiting for valheim, satisfactory, and dyson sphere program to come out for so long."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i don't think you can teleport from there. i think it's disabled. there's a few places like that, for example when you get eaten by the spinning blade guy that sends you to that lavavolcano place it's been very long since i played so i don't remember things well, you also can't teleport from there. i think you gotta find one site of grace first."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"yup, same. but to be fair fromsoft did made sure player would come back there because it's the only place u can upgrade weapon to lvl 3 early game. i just didnt bother and just plow through the game so i missed it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"yeah that one really frustrated me, idk how many people got through that without looking anything up. the game teaches you that if you talk to someone repeatedly and they start repeating themselves you can stop bothering them because they have nothing else to say... except this one time teehee good luck"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"eh, i still don't find it satisfying in that regard. it worked well in the souls series cause there were limits to where you could go. but in er it's so easy to go off the beaten path and now someone is placed fairly randomly on a ginormous map that you can very easily miss."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"i never actually got to finish outer wilds. i played for quite a while and was nearing the ending i think when i decided to get distracted doing weird things. i tried to chase the object that gets ejected from the solar system at the start of the game, i successfully landed on the sun after a lot of attempts, i did a bunch of experiments with time and witnessing changes in odd locations as the game progressed. i got lost those aspects. then my ps subscription ran out and i'm too poor to fit it back into my budget."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"pretty sure that's what most players assume. i mean, that's the big event happening. and then you most likely slowly find puzzle pieces about !what the nomai were doing! and that reinforces it. well... unless !you find out the let's blow up the sun plan didn't in fact blow up the sun, early on.! but man. getting to the !sun station! the first time and seeing what's there... i got chills."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"it's a shitty practice either way, but what's even worse is doing it retroactively like when ea decided to make their software a requirement to play mass effect legendary edition long after its initial release."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,i think part of the problem is that sony said the psn stuff was so they could have anticheat stuff for multiplayer so the excuse makes no sense on a single player game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,because it's a stupid requirement regardless.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,the problem is that a lot of countries don't have regions to create a psn account and thus steam does not sell the game in those regions. heck i live in eu and we use euros and i can't buy the game as the game is not aviable in my region.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,because if i saw someone get injured highfiving an electric fence. i would still be surprised to watch them do it two more times in succession
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,every game in recent history has it thousands of games actually don't.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"also, years ago, people were begging for ps games on pc, now that they're, they're complaining about free accounts, like c'mon... i mean it's an issue for countries that can't create it, but for others, can't really complain"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,psn requirement is a good excuse pc gamers will use but look at where steam is big.. none of those countries.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,my region does not exist when creating a psn account. steams says that the game is not aviable in my region. and thus i can't buy it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"it's definitely required to link your account beforehand on steam deck and linux otherwise you get a black screen. i think maybe for the users that have it working, they already had it linked before via some previous sony title."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"yeah thanks to sony's region locking, i am able to shamelessly play the game for free!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,the game is region locked. you can't even buy or gift it because of this crap.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,i mean it literally says it's required on the steam page
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,you cant buy the game if you arent in a psn supported country so it doesnt matter if you dont have to
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"first game sold 4 million copies on steam and has positive reviews, so yes, it is the psn requirement."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,i just figured i would give them some time to do a patch or two and maybe see it go on sale a bit before i buy it. needing a psn account for some features doesn't bother me and doesn't factor in at all in me waiting. i can understand why people from some countries that can't get a psn account could be upset.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"i think there is a greater plan here, we just havent seen it unfold yet. my bet is that they are going to try to get everyone used to ps signin, having an account, having multiple games in the account. then they will try to create a payment mandate for online multiplayer like they do with ps. they are certainly aware that this login is costing them, so the only way i can see that making sense is if their projected numbers are showing that cost being outweighed somewhere down the line"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"wow, if it was just that easy. not all countries have psn which is the issue."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"spiderman, miles morales, horizon zero dawn and a bunch of others did not have psn requirements. now what?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,delayed access? thats the most disingenuous way to describe the pc release that i have ever seen.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,its just an account? you make it sound like just making a psn account requires some crazy subscription lmao. and greed? if you dont like it you dont like but what is with the weird hyperbole about making a stupid account?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"yup, gow launched at 49.99 heck even the new ffxvi pc port is for 49.99 so why is an older game like gow ragnarok for 59.99?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"no, people dont want yet another sign in for a single player game. there is no reason for it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,name one reason for the existenceenforcement of those extra accounts.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,i'm not complaining. sony is willingly giving out free games! first ghost of tsushima and now god of war ragnarok that i can download for free and sony has no right to complain?! count me in!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,imagine only buying games because of hype instead of fun
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,i dont think other people making bad decisions justifies them
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,it's on steam...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,my research. looks up on steam. it does not even show on the search bar.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"lol at least lie better, 15 min? nonot even close"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,what are you talking about? you dont need to subscribe to anything.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"it speaks volumes when out of all the giant game companies, valve seems to be the best, not because of some special treatment or policies they give to gamers. they just do the basics, and treat their customers fairly. but apparently that's too hard for everyone else. valve wins by doing nothing, because everyone is too busy constantly shooting themselves in the foot."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,sony is in full greed mode. xbox left them with no competition and they always do this shit when they get the chance.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,gamers just like to cry about things

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"the reaction is surprisingly overblown. i'd be annoyed to have to create more accounts on top of the gazillion ones i already have but that's it, annoyed. it may get me grumpy for a few minutes and i move on. luckily i already made psn account since the blissful days of ps2."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,you can choose another region. someone elsewhere said they are told to do that by sony with their playstation console.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,i'm very obiviously taking about sony games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"the process isn't that simple for every country, even ones where you can create an account. a quote from one u.k. gamer creating a psn account was something i knew was necessary in advance and i was prepared to do so, until i was met with the reality of it, they said. for uk residents at least, it requires submitting a mobile phone number to verify your age just to start with, and if that fails which it did, no texts were ever received your only recourse is to submit a photograph of your face or a governmentissued id to a third party website. if you're happy with that, go right ahead."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"there's many countries that can't create a psn account, so it's a big problem, though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,i think most pc players just arent as used to getting fucked as most playstation players. so the frogs that are cooked are shrugging but the new ones arent used to the heat yet.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"name one good reason for why this crap is required now instead of keeping it optional... you know, like they did it with their earlier pc releases. what's the benefit? why do they enforce it? what's the benefit?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"you don't need to pay to create a psn account and there is no need to pay to use online content like in consoles. however, the psn is blocked in several countriee, so many people are unable to play those games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"in the words of gaben, you seem to have a distribution problem."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,have you considered moving? s
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,not possibly for linux since each game uses it's own windows root partition. it's more likely the difference is something like custom proton vs valve proton
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"i'm not saying you're wrong, but i feel like your statement jumps from a to z without looking at the rest of the alphabet in between. there's lots of reasons gow may have sold 4 million but ragnarok did not. from people didn't like gow  or found that it wasn't their cup of tea despite all the reviews of it being a relaunch for the franchise that was really good. to people liked it so much they grabbed a ps5 at launch for the sequel. putting it down to the psn requirement needs a lot more explanation than just the earlier game in the franchise moved more units."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,its really not the psn requirement which big market is it banned in? those 180 countries barely buy games or even use steam.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"not really, for me i just lost interest. been too long. i have other things to play so it can join my 2 year backlog."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,the first game has a longer wait between when it was released on playstation to when it was released in pc. i know of a lot of people who bought it again on pc because it ran and looked better than on the ps4. ragnarok had a 2 year wait and the graphical improvements are nice but not show stoppers.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,4mil in what time? if the second just came out it's hard to compare it like that. anyway my point was that there have been games that need extra accounts since the dawn of time and they haven't been struggling.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"it's so they can data mine more players. now you can tie that user to other things and know who bought your game. also, it gives them more control over offering you a license."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,ill never get scammed by these playstationxboxnintendo online subscriptions. from my perspective i feel it is like if steam started selling the ability to play games online. like what
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-14,i think well see a sony game launcher soon
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,those countries are not relevant.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"don't you know that we could have played last year by just running the ps5 version on pc! it would have worked perfectly with absolutely zero work from the devs, that guy on reddit said so!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"psn is not aviable in 121 countries. thus the game is not sold in 121 countries. god of war 1 does not require psn account and thus is aviable to buy in those regions. heck, i'm in eu and we use euros and we don't have a psn region and thus i can't buy god of war ragnarok. this is my gripe with the need of psn account."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,it's for data mining. why would you need an account for a purely single player game. if only i could go up to my sega and snes and pop in my game only to be screwed when i have to log into my game account. its dumb that companies feel this is the way.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,old? it came out less than 2 years ago lol.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"yeah, i misspoke. i meant that you need to have the psn account."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,so true!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"so true. i remember when xbox launched games live... damn, as a ps player for most of my life i was really jealous."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,probably a very high percentage judging by the generic replies i often see.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-26,lol theyre crying about this callout
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"exactly. it's like when people were buying nike's and then burining them in protest. lol they already have your money, you fools."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"no? you can buy the game, play it to its fullest, and still post a negative review because of the requirement."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"agreed, buying the game to put a review still doesn't change the fact they spent money on it. might as well pirate the game if you want to play it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,i mean if they refund it immediately after posting the review it doesn't cost em anything.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"eh, i think there's different forms of protest tbh. this is more akin to a peaceful protest. besides, like you said, you can't even post a review on steam without buying the game, but steam reviews are some of the most visible reviews because it's right on the store front. it's like picketing and making your voice known right in front of potential customers, so i say its valid. regardless, i think people should be free to voice their opinions."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,are they not? i thought gta v was getting some flak for the recent anticheat changes that break it on steam deck. people are also bashing microsoft for how they're handling xbox at the moment and their dev studios.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,people do that.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,they were already pretty mad at that to begin with
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"because we made, and these games on my pc don't require internet connection, credentials, launcher or any other nonsense.  i treat it as great success."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"it isn't just creating the account that's the issue though. some people are regionlocked out of psn but not steam. they were able to play the first game but not the second. for steam deck users, the psn requirement causes issues like black screens if your sony account isn't already prelinked. on linux, the psn sdk straight up refuses to run. they have to make their system pretend to be a steam deck in order to get it to launch, but then mouse look is explicitly disabled when that option is enabled. there's also reports from people who say that psn accounts require a lot of personal info in some areas, all the way down to ids. that's annoying for people who just want to play a single player game. you may be lax about your privacy but for others it's very important. i think it is fine if you feel like the psn requirement doesn't affect you, consider yourself lucky, but others legitimately have issues with it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,ps5 consoles are being sold in my country and the sellers are telling people to choose whatever region. which is kinda breaking the tos and thus you might endanger your account. some people don't want to risk it or are honest and want to select their region.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"you still can't buy the game, because sony will not sell the game in the region you are in, which is determined by steam. also something to keep in mind is that it's still against tos and should sony chose to enforce that rule at any point, whatever was said by a support staff member will be irrelevant, they will just say the support staff member gave you wrong information. so you are basically trusting a corporation i am kind of shocked people do that considering how anticorporation everyone seems to be these days that they won't just yoink your purchases out from under you."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,steam still says that the game is not aviable in my region and thus will not sell it to me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"i got spiderman. spiderman miles morales, horizon zero dawn and horizon forbidden west in my steam library. i could play them just fine without a psn account."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"no, account linkage is via sony servers, not via a file in a proton prefix. proton has nothing to do with it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,then consider the negative reviews. nearly all of them are about this issue.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"right so thats your reason. other are because of the require account. like not everyone has the same opinion as you, you are not a main character."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,spiderman miles morales also had a 2 year gap and still sold well and has a positive rating.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,god of war never sold in 4 mil on pc
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"yeah, but the psn is also not available in 121 countries, so lots of people are just not able to play those games. and some of the players who can buy it give a negative score out of protest."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"yeah, but the psn is also not available in 121 countries, so lots of people are just not able to play those games. and some of the players who can buy it give a negative score out of protest."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,i think people vastly overestimate how much your data is worth. i dont see them making up even a marginal loss in revenue with the tiny amount of data they are able to mine from this.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,youre one of the few. we probably got over 100m people right now getting scammed every month
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"youre one of those if its not happening to me, it doesnt matter type, huh?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,maybe you have a problem with countries who dont allow psn?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,older
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,and the protest is just free advertising for the corporation lol. saved them hundreds of thousands at least. fucking hilarious
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"and? why does sony give a shit? they already got your money and if the requirement was enough to make you post a negative review you never should've bought the game in the first place. i think the psn requirement is bullshit too, and that's exactly why i'm not buying anything from sony that has it. if people want to see change they should do the same thing or shut the fuck up."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"that sort of review bombing gets removed from the overall score by default, so the protest achieved nothing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,most companies won't care about negative reviews as long as they keep getting money. byuing the game to complain about it defeats the purpose. the helldivers 2 thing was kind of successful because steam started refunding and it was hurting sony's wallet.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"it's more like walking past a union strike pretending to care about what the union cares about, then going in and doing work and getting paid."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,ah true the region lock thing. totally forgot about that.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,there have been people doing this since ps3 days. you arent going to get banned. hell i often select japan on a burner account to download demos and stuff that never come here
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"so then you just dont buy the game and move on, whats the problem? torrent it and play for free, find another game, its just a mediocre action game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,cool. do try to play helldivers 2 or ghost of tsushima without one. see if the page store lego horizon adventures doesn't already say you need psn.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"oh, i see what you're saying. it's a 11 link, not per game login. my bad for assuming then!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"see, that's a much better argument for your claim. the counter to which could be people who weren't going to buy the game anyhow taking the opportunity to crap on sony. however, combine it with your first fact 4 million people bought gow, much less buying ragnarok on pc, half the reviews say it's due to the psn issue and you have a solid argument. thanks for the extra factors!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,one person gives their own perspective on the topic and they're now the main character?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,also a ps4 game with a wider fan base than god of war. i rebought it on steam because i had gotten it on ps4 and wanted the upgrade.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"i never said they were selling your data. i said they want to track their customers closely. more about control. edit example while this game is single player, multiplayer games can be changed to use playstation network, if needed. more examples microtransactions that avoid steam"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,i mean everyone should add access but people here think those 180 countries made up a big  of overall steam users or sales when it didnt.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,is it the country that doesn not allow psn or the psn does not deem those countries worthy?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"i have not bought the game, but i can understand someone who does not like the account requirement enough to leave a negative review, but not completely enough to boycott the game. also it could be people with postpurchase problems, i have left a negative review before because i could not continue playing a game 20hours deep because of stupid launcher stuff. i also think that you are underrating reviews. sony would absolutely not want a negative or even a mixed review score on steam, even if you think steam reviews are worthless because it does not give you info about a game, reality is that reception is important for the longterm well being of the studio."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"huh so it does. go figure. til, thanks. pivoting then, maybe it's like hd2 wherein the players that can actually buyplay the game are reviewing on behalf of the players that can't? if they're buying and playing the game anyways it doesnt cost them anything further to leave a negative review on behalf of players that cant get the game due to psn."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"companies hate bad reviews, it does hurt business. anything on steam 'mixed' i don't even bother to look further, along with a lot of other folks. but keeping eating at those 'needs improvement' scored restaurants."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"negative press and reviews do work. many helldivers players who wouldn't have been affected by the psn requirement still refunded because they heard the news. both are valid. you need the action and the call to action. also, many of my friends actually refuse to buy or second guess their gaming purchases when they see mixed reviews on steam. so negative reviews actually does prevent future purchases, which also affect the bottom line."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"thing is, steam says that the game is not aviable in the region i imagine to avoid people complaining or even a potential lawsuit of selling a game that a person can't legally play, because it require a third party account that they can't legally create due to the region not aviable, so even if i could make a psn account by selecting a different region  i would still not be able to play it maybe if i would use vps on steam and purchase it from a different region. so there is no logal way to get the game on pc. and then they might wonder why people pirate..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,i am interested in the game and would like to have a legal way to play it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,helldivers 2 doesn't require one. and your argument is... what exactly? there is no need for those stupid third party accounts. so why are they a thing?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"psn is not aviable in 121 countries. thus the game is not sold in 121 countries. thus there are less people buying it. god of war 1 does not require psn account and thus is aviable to buy in those regions. heck, i'm in eu and we use euros and we don't have a psn region and thus i can't buy god of war ragnarok."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"what are you even talking about? you can only post a review if you bought the game, if you post the review and then give thr game back your review is removed from the aggregated score. the people reviewing this game are the prople buying it. also, 4 million is the all time sales, ragnarok just released and sales figures aren't up yet. you cannot even argue that the sales are bad. i only mentioned sales figures because the person i replied originally brought it up. kindly do not hop on conversations when you don't know what is about."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,that's not what he's saying at all. he's saying one person's opinion is extremely insubstantial and doesn't provide the full picture.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,thats what i meant too. you can monetize data without selling it. but that data still has an internal value that can be quantified
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,some of the people complaining here are affected. it is relevant to us. thats why make a psn account doesnt work for everyone. i was lucky enough to buy helldivers 2 before the psn fiasco. after that they took off helldivers 2 from our countrys steam page and my brother cant buy the game anymore on pc. so we cant play together because you need a fucking psn account to play a pc game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,typically its because of unregulated policies surrounding online storefronts.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"okay, but negative reviews mean nothing to corps once they have your money. why should they care how angry or upset you are if you're still paying? you should probably remember that sony didn't budge on hd2 until people started refunding."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"yes, it does. they backtracked on enforcing the login for people that already bought the game, but it is currently delisted in several the countries that psn doesn't support. my point, which you missed because you don't know anything about the subject yet wants to opinate, is everyone knows the account is stupid, but sony is insistent on it so why are people acting surprised?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,absolutely
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,"can'tspeak for anyone else, but i neversaid they do. only that it costs customers nothing further to review about it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,i don't know anything about the subject? what? why are you like this? all those third party accounts are annoying and pointless. people don't like them.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,"yeah, and i am not disputing that, which is why you are clueless."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-27,"thats the thing about older games. they generally have a much faster 'time to play' than modern games. that is to say the time it takes from when you sit down to when you actually start playing the game and enjoying yourself. most modern games have patches, checking for updates, connecting to servers, longer initial loading due to graphics, and then once youre actually in the game it usually takes longer to actually start doing something. comparatively older games and or games that a rereleasesmodern versions of the same games are basically plug and play. you put in mario and you are genuinely playing in under 30 seconds. god of war takes atleadt twice as long as you load up the game, load the save, and begin teaversing until something happens. none of this is to say modern games are bad, just that older games were quicker to the action and so they are generally more enjoyable for the times you are looking for entertainment without preparation."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"you're definitely not the only one. i think it's super annoying and i don't understand why it's not optional for people who want it. either something to turn on in the menus, or just let you talk to the companion if you want a hint like a lot of old adventure games did. do i want sully to tell me how to solve this? let me walk over and interact with him or give me a button to call him on the radio. i don't see why that would lower accessibility at all. but the developers must have some stats that show that if a puzzle isn't spoiled within 30 seconds a bunch of people will turn off the game and never buy the next one. i just don't know who these people are."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"easy solution is to just add a separate difficulty slider for puzzles. shadow of the tomb raider has something like this where you can go into the settings and change what difficulty you want for puzzles. this option only affects puzzles, not the combat or anything else. at the easiest setting, lara will give you clues on what to do next. relevant puzzle items are marked when you use survival instincts. and anytime the puzzle has timed mechanics, you get more time to react. meanwhile, on the hardest setting, you get nothing, you just have to figure it out for yourself. as someone who doesn't really like the puzzles in games, it's nice to be able to make them easier. but likewise, for those who like puzzles and want a challenge, they can make them challenging. it's a win for both sides. and its nice that it only affects the puzzles and not the other part of the games difficulty. so i can have puzzles on easy difficulty for example, but i can have hard combat difficulty at the same time. you can choose how difficult or easy different parts of the game are."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"yes, a lot of more serious gamers hate it. however, i've watched enough develop commentary about making games to also understand that the average player is so incompetent, that they will never figure out these puzzles and will literally stop playing. like i've heard devs talk about stuff like one playtester who spent an hour running around in an area unable to progress, because they never even considered that the ladder that lead to the next area was interactable. so afterwards the devs had to highlight the ladder better, and throw some colour markers so the player would understand what they had to do. now imagine an actual puzzle and not a simple fucking ladder. it sucks, but it's unavoidable for most major games that want to appeal to a large audience. gone are the days where people would buy a game and then play it to completion no matter what, no matter how long it took and how frustrating it was. these days, half the players will drop the game on a dime and refund that shit immediately."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,horizon forbidden west did this shit constantly. they dont even give you time to figure things out she just blurts out answers instantly
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,ragnarok was so bad for that. i felt like i had at most 60 seconds to solve a puzzle before the solution was fed to me. really irritating.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"wait til you play horizon forbidden west  the hand holding is so strong that aloy often tells you how to solve a puzzle before you've even looked at it. i wish i was exaggerating, but i'm really not."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i write gaming guides for a living and keep up with frequently searched questions and topics posted for tons of new releases. the simplest things catch people out and are searched for daily. right now, the second most searched fortnite question is how to get to a location that is marked on the map in massive letters i know an editor whose site had how to jump in x game as their top guide for the week it was a button press obvious hints are so prevalent now because developers have realized the average person nongamer has far less intuition than you'd think. hand a controller to anyone who doesn't regularly play games, and you'll start to see they pick up on almost nothing that we would hogwarts legacy was a really good example. appealed to a ton of people who don't typically play games, and searches were flooded with really simple questions. i legit saw someone asking how to press the right control stick on here yesterday. resulted in some of the best traffic the site i worked for at the time had ever seen. so the reason it's so handholdy by default is to retain the attention of the average person for as long as possible. having a toggle, like you mentioned, is definitely the best solution"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i really liked how 'moss' did this, it's a cute little vr puzzlerplatformer. if you struggle, the character will subtly turn and look at relevant pieces, sometimes silently point at them or gesture to give you a hint. but won't ever speak. so it looks like they're trying to work out the same puzzle and just doing hand gestures as they think. it's very subtle, but it helps if you're stuck."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"yup, and in contrast just yesterday i was playing uncharted lost legacy, when doing a puzzle with some statues and shadows, my companion asked me if i was lost, and the prompt to ask her for help appeared over her head, but she didn't spoil the answer, just gave me the option to. that's how it should be in every game with occasional puzzles , let the player decide and think for themselves, let them choose if they want the help or not."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i don't mind it in theory but i do hate the speed at which these hints start showing up as well as the frequency. it's like... ok, you put me in this challenge and then immediately starting explaining it to me. give me a minute at least  or even better yet do some kind of count on my actions and start providing hints based off of that. like if a puzzle requires 10 interactions minimum and an average of 15 then start giving hints out after i've interacted 16 times. the other thing that drives me crazy is when it does this in games where exploration is an intended part of the experience. it's like... you put me in a rom with a puzzle and three side areas to explore that have pickups. when i complete the puzzle the game is going to automatically transition me away from this area. this is the only time i'm able to explore those side rooms but you are actively discouraging me from doing so by having the npcs comment on my apparent mental impairments to hurry me along."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"if youre really wanting a good puzzle game that doesnt really hold your hand, i highly reccomend playing the silent hill 2 remake. the puzzles in that is unlike any game ive played, both in the og over 25 years ago and in the remake. one of my favorites is the noose puzzle. theres a difficulty option for the puzzles and they radically change inbetween normal and hard difficulty"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"you have to remember that the players that come to reddit and other places are not the average gamer. a lot of gamers out there are going to get frustrated at puzzles and may quit, which through playtests is wbat devs found out and is why these hints exist. but, the devs should also program in ways to turn them off or limit how often you see them for players that don't want or need them."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i always appreciate when a game gives you the option to turn off hints
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,god of war ragnarok has a mod that removes over 1500 lines of helpful companion voice lines because of this.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i personally don't like puzzles that much in action games, so i'm fine okay with handholding to speed the process up. i'm okay with puzzles having less handholding in the side content, like the batman arkham games. main storycampaign? i'm not here to waste time with overly long puzzles."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"i always preferred the way portal did it. here's a fuckin puzzle, figure it out or stay in this room forever i don't give a shit."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i havent been able to get through ni no kuni for that exact reason. hey olli, they said they need that thing! do you remember when we saw that thing 5 minutes ago? i wonder if that might be the thing! wed better go see the thing that we saw 5 minutes ago! well need to travel there, so make sure you open a gateway to go see the thing! in case you dont remember, press pause to open your menu, then select the thing you want to use! why dont you try it now? come on, no time to waste, weve got to go get this thing that they need, which is the thing we saw that we know we need to go get! lets go do it now before we take too long doing the thing! and its all in a cutscene."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"puzzles are often my least favorite part of any game they're in, so i'm pretty okay with being able to just blow past them. that said, i can absolutely understand and empathize with this viewpoint. if you're someone that really enjoys that sort of thing, this would probably be endlessly frustrating. there really should be some sort of toggle for the folks that enjoy this stuff. it's a real shame."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,escape room games solve this by usually having a hint button. gow could easily have the kid or the all knowing head kratos carries go ah i think i've worked it out after 20 seconds and then you interact with them for them to supply their helpful dialogue.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"that's like my only gripe with ragnarok. i didn't even get a chance to do shit lol. i'll get to a point where i might actually need to think for a second, then your companion is like hey, maybe do this pointing where i need to go. and the markings on the path, combined with the invisible walls on ledges and shit lol. like what? at least make that crap optional. what also boggles my mind is auto aiming. i get it for those who can't aim well for accessibility options. but it's been turned on by default, and it's in pvp games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i remember in the original deus ex, if you stumbled across a hidden note with a password, you'd have to either memorize it or write it down. the game didn't remember it for you. i miss those days."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"tbh if you want puzzles play some specialized game like fez, return of the obra din, the witness, paquerette or tunic the only purpose those have in action games is to change the pace so they have to make sure you don't get stuck in them and believe me when i say there are very stupid people that even with all that would get stuck in those puzzles"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,play tunic. that is all.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i just played silent hill 2 and its puzzles are hard and awesome
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"hahaha i have complained so much about it recently. genshin had some good puzzles for one region a few years ago, but after that puzzles just stopped. people kept complaining they were too hard. i miss having that challenge. it sucks because there's so many avenues you can take with them if you don't know, brute force it or look it up but instead let's get them removed entirely. we just had a minigame in our flagship event this patch that was like a little 'find 58 things wrong in this area'. if you took, idk 2030 seconds between finding one and finding the next it would highlight it to you. at least companions you can mute your game. i can't give a glowing yellow beacon. i remembered reading someone saying the reason for that is because they could provide hints toggleable but then people will be too prideful or feel bad they needed a hint also why some people won't look it up when they're stuck and at the end of the day companies have to cater downward to reach a bigger audience."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i'm sure i sawread an interview with one of the developers from god of war who said during play testing, the testers would give up trying to solve puzzles after a few seconds so they had to keep adding more and more hints until it was basically solving it for you."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"hey, joker, isn't that painting suspicious? hey, joker, do you see that really obvious glowing button? i wonder if we should press it? hey, joker, do you need help feeding yourself and tying your shoes? clearly, you're a toddler with no situational awareness."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i think using companion characters, or even the main character thinking out loud, to give the player hints if stuck is a great way to handle it. however it needs to be something the player prompts with a key or at the least you need to be able to customize frequency and be able to turn it off altogether. they certainly shouldn't do it immediately. i am still perplexed by the bell puzzle in plague tale requiem where they explicitly give the answer immediately. i assumed it was a mechanic tutorial but no, it never uses that puzzle again."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,if you find that annoying then dont play dragon age veilguard its the worst at that
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,it should be a slider that affects how often they give you hints much like a difficulty slider. from never to solve it for me. there were some puzzles where i was being backseated by the npcs before i'd even touched the damn thing or finished walking into the room. i get it though. i watch a lot of twitch and the number of times i've seen seemingly intelligent people brought to their knees by a child's puzzle is too damn high.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"unfortunately, it's probably not going to go away in mainstream games, at least not for a while. in the mean time, i suggest looking to other puzzle games, like tunic or outer wilds. the zelda games also don't do this. would be cool to see a game with multiple difficulty settings though, one for combat and one for puzzles. the easy puzzle setting can have companions that tell you what's going on and highlighted sections on the easiest, one or the other for medium settings, and none for hard."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i despise how we've gone from if you can't figure it out, time to open a strategy guide to ... here's how to solve it, you don't need time to work it out yourself."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i don't even know why they do it. worst case scenario someone just looks it up. it's not like before where you have to look at magazines when you're stuck.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"so i have some special thoughts on this... i play ttrpgs, i have been gming games like dnd and the like for about 27 years now and i can offer some special insight i've gained some people are absolutely incapable of doing puzzles. like its an actual thing. they can roleplay, and do combat, and retain knowledge, but throw them a puzzle and their brain shuts off. they can't seem to look at it objectively, think outside the box etc. they won't even try things. their frustration mounts and they simply shut down and give up. so while i have the same complaint as you when i encounter the babylevel puzzles in video games, i completely understand it. if you stick a puzzle in a game mostly aimed at twitchy numbskulls, you have to cater to the lowest common denominator. when i want games with good puzzles, i go for ones specifically catered to that. games like myst, riven, the room, talos principle, or the oldschool point and click adventures like monkey island etc."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"you should play immortals fenyx rising and one of the dlcs, which was mostly just puzzles."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"qa testers likely complain that puzzles are too hard, so the devs simplify them. also many people are really just that dumb. imo devs should just remove all puzzles if they dont want to put effort into them. just make a nice cutscene or animation for the door opening or something, rather than a mindnumbing hacking puzzle."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"i agree. recently, i've been playing older games with puzzles and it feels so good when i solve a puzzle that tells me very little. it gets me thinking, gets me using my head. modern games miss out on that. i think it's partly to do with people not having the patience or attention span to do it themselves, so they just search up the answer."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,when i saw that i could up the difficulty of puzzles in the silent hill 2 remake i was real happy

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,can unironically blame dsp for this being a trend in modern gaming. there's a presentation to do with ragnarok i think somewhere which shows dspgaming footage where the developer talks about this topic.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,people on posting on reddit are mostly smart enough to think riddles. majority of casuals however are mostly braindead that can't comprehend the riddles let alone the story of most of the game they played.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-17,"yeah, definitely agree! what is the point in having a puzzle if the game is just going to tell you the fucking answer while you're still trying to figure it out."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i like it to be honest. i know it'll be an unpopular opinion but i play action games for the action, it annoys me when i'm on an adrenaline fuelled thrill ride that has to immediately stop because oh no, these symbols on the floor need organising. edit, forgot to add, that i'm no good at puzzles, i haven't got the mind for them, so even if a character doesn't tell me, i'll be youtubing it straight away anyway."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,yeah its not like there'll be a guide with huge clickbait in the title within 1hour if the game being released anyway lol

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,am i the only one who insert one of the most commonly expressed grievances about modern video game design? nope.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"games are made for everyone, not just hardcore reddit gamers. this is a very popular sentiment on reddit, but im sure these companies have done hours of market research and found that the hints are necessary to keep the average gamer engaged"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,the idea is that someone could potentially get caught up on them and then that stops progression altogether. i just ignore it because im not 5 and dont let those kinds of things bother me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,some games do this when played on easy difficulty. i can relate...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,its a common complaint with the god of war games
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"the new tomb raider games are terrible for this. lara will literally repeat the same clue every minute or so until you solve it, it's infuriating."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"the number of times i paused briefly to think about something in jedi survivor for it to remind me bd1 can give me hints... look, if i can complete myst without any hints, i can complete this!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,as someone who's bad at puzzles and paying attention to my surroundings it doesn't help me either
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,gow 2 had my favorite puzzles with zelda series not far behind.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,yeah sony games are really hand holdy for puzzles
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i don't play any games with companions in for this reason. it's probably prevented me from playing loads of great games but i don't give a shit. i want to play them, not walk through them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"im enjoying the new dragon age, but its the most hand holdy game ive ever played. itll be like find a way into x and then the game just immediately gives you way points for every step of how to get there. its like they made the waypoints in the game too good."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i heard the horizon sequel does the same thing where she just tells you to look somewhere. i do miss the ancient days of king's quest, zork, and myst where you get nothing and like it, and you need to do it perfectly to get the real ending or the final full high score, or just die if you turn the brass crank clockwise instead of counterclockwise, you pillock."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"these dora the explorer level puzzles are ubiquitous. shit definitely feels pretty patronizing, even insulting. idk if its the developers or middle managers or the executives or what, but the people making aaa titles nowadays genuinely think gamers are completely regarded."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,uncharted had seperate difficulty sliders for puzzles and combat i think. the last tomb raider i played def did. i think that's a great idea.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i don't mind help but it' really annoying when they don't give me a chance to solve it, even if it's something simple. just make us speak to companion if we are stuck so they can start yapping even worse when the your character is alone, why are you talking about the solution out loud"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"the worst one i played recently is dragon age the veilguard. your companions literally tell you what to do with every single puzzle, making you feel it was made for 5yr olds."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i think they should always add a slider to reduce the number of hints or make it so you can aks your companion directly for a suggestion. if there's a companion that is, is even more ridiculous when the characters talks to themselves like now i need to press that button"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i'm ok with it in the situations where i have a companion, because that is exactly what would happen in real life."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"yeah, look i get that even game needs a good tutorial, any game could be someones first so you always need to teach the basics, that's fine completely understandable. same with puzzles people's brains work differently some things i would find obvious could be really difficult for someone else and vice versa, so i get that you need to include hints for everything, again totally understandable. but give me options to skip or disable them, i know that wsad moves my character, i know my ability buttons i've already rebound half of them, you don't need to tell me how a pokeball works i've been playing these games since i was a child, i know what a tank dps and healer is, i know what a mana system is and i know how to reload my gun, i know what an inventory is and what a fast travel point does. i've been playing games for decades i speak the language, i know the rules, so please just give the option to skip tutorials and disable hints until i need them, you don't need to hold my hand every step of the way, i just want to play my game without being interrupted."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,you might be suprised but these things exist for a reason. the same way that all those signs and speed limits exist when driving a car. it's cause the average person is dumber then a bag of bricks or just don't care.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"we seem to get a complaint about it every few days on this subredit, so i'm gonna say no"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"it's one of the things i appreciated about the last tomb raider game. you could set the difficulty of the game, but also the difficulty of the puzzles. i mean, the actual difficulty was the same, but the character gave noless tips on hard."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i totally get what you're saying. the best implementation would be to make the hints optional. i think in jedi survivor it throws up a timed dialog box. and, if you don't click on it, no hints."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,this is just how aaa games work now
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i noticed the opposite with japanese releases and actualy complained alot about it. in monster hunter worlds i sank 50 hrs into it without knowing i could buy potions from an npc because the game never explicity showed me i could. 50hrs of farming and wasting my time when i could have just bought them this whole time. my friend responded would it had helped if he was painted yellow? i realized having worked for western devs in the past that we tend to focus heavily on accesibilty because frustration is bad, but the east tends to see that as a players lack of curiosity, it seems, and it feels like the game inavertly punishes us for not looking without the constant hand holding people would complain and not finish the game because they would be frustrated or lost. but making it as obviouse as possible isnt the solution either because we are made to feel dumb. its a very tricky balance. a good tutoial is one you wont notice at all. western devs, especialy aaa publishers want to make the most money out of their product, and capturing the widest audience possible is their main intrest, and that comes the need for accesibility."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,for the complete opposite experience play the original dino crisis. some of the ddk passwords are boggling and there 0 hand holding
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i stopped playing god of war because of it. i love to explore and just look around and find things naturally. not in gow... over here! look! there! do you see it? i think it has something to do with blah! holy shit, shut the fuck up. i'm nowhere near you and you are constantly yelling at me to solve a puzzle i haven't even found yet. i got so frustrated i stopped playing and told myself i would go back if there was an update. there was one recently, but i haven't gone back yet."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"this is a really common complaint that gained a lot of traction with horizon forbidden west, which is probably the worst offender of this i've ever played. she simply would not stop talking.  me walking around and exploring.  aloy i think i need a key card to open this door!  me what fucking door? spends the next 5 minutes looking for the door, which was 100 yards away in the opposite direction i was traveling."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"this is actually the only reason i haven't played ragnarok yet, despite getting it on day one. i heard about the extreme handholding for the puzzles before starting it, and decided navely, i'm realizing to wait for a patch which would let me turn off the assists for the puzzles. really extinguished any pull i felt to get going in it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,then you get to the shadow puzzle in lost legacy and pray for nadine to tell you how to solve it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,half the time i don't even pay attention to what they say lmao but i get the frustration. lots of games do this. but then there's also games that do the opposite. i think people say alan wake 2 had a really nice puzzle to solve and it didn't have any hints like this? then there's also remnant 2 where progress could be locked behind a music puzzle. there's a large flute contraption you have to play a specific melody on to get to the world boss and the notes you have to play are hidden in an old weathered book with little indication the book is showing flute notes and since it's weathered not all the notes are there.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i used to think the handholding in games was an insult to everyone. there simply to cover the lowest denominator to maximize accessibility. turns out the majority are willfully and proudly illiterate. even with text flashing in the middle of the screen in bold there's an alarmingly high chance it'll be ignored. audio telling you what to do is merely the latest attempt to make sure everyone can progress. i've played a live service game off and on that literally dumbed down puzzles after a certain point because players complained that reading the instructions right next to it was an undue burden. i'd argue they should go a step further. a skip or auto puzzle option. that way people who want puzzles actually get it and the rest can progress. won't happen though. why take dev time on something that caters to a shrinking minority?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"the puzzle arent there because they think puzzles are fun. the puzzles are there to force a break in the action, which can be really important for pacing. while breaking it up is good for pacing, whats much worse is taking a break for too long. so they want to make sure you solve the puzzle quickly and move on. could they design the puzzles better? yes, but then theyd be spending time on the puzzles that dont matter instead of the action gameplay that youre actually here to engage with. as action game designers, theyll take option b!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i was playing islands of insight. was learning a new kind of puzzle i've never quite seen. when it introduced new things to think about, it would force a hint to point it out. i like figuring these out on my own. it's meant to be approachable to nonhardcore puzzlers, but at least make the hints readily available, or ask if i want one. dont just stick it in my face."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"zelda is ostensibly a kids game and doesn't do it anywhere near this much. not only that but the puzzles are pretty damn simple. point the laser at the receptacle. find wisp and bring it to receptacle. i don't want wrath of the righteous enigma puzzles, but these aren't so hard that adults need clues"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,you need to play dragon's dogma 2. zero hand holding. part one is also amazing
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"imo, any kind of puzzle in any game that is isnt a on puzzle focused game should have like a button besides each puzzle you can click to skippinstantly solve it. nothing worse than when u play ur rpg or whatever and after 30h there suddenly is this random puzzle that is insanely hard or you just cant get it at this point. nothing worse than the feeling of having to google the puzzles solution so you dont skipp on contentprogress the mainstory coze you were stuck on a puzzle in a game that is not about puzzles."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"you're not the only one, there are many yt videos dedicated to this subject specifically. and yes it's really annoying, hopefully more games do it like star wars the recent solo ones do  the companion asks if you want some help and otherwise shuts up."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"its not only about puzzles but level design as a whole. i recently returned to jedi knight outcast and got stuck multiple times not by puzzles but by the fact that the right way to walk isn't highlighted or made obvious. i felt stupid not because i was stupid but because i was used to handholding level designs if its not obvious, then its not the right way. i was there and played through when it released 2002. having to reset my thought processes to the time where you actually had to use your brain made me question the modern fast food gaming style where everyone is used to positive affirmation on every step."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"honestly dragon age the veilguard is doing puzzles right! i actually have to think to figure out how to get many of the treasures, and it's because of good game design and a lack of hints! the absolute most my companionscharacter will be like is maybe something with the crystals? to indicate i should maybe look for something to do with crystals in a vast, open space, but even that is sparing. it's so nice!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,ragnarok's puzzles are infuriating because they are somehow over explained while being obtuse. i dropped the game early on because the characters were yelling at me unhelpful advice on an annoying boring puzzle i couldnt solve. i even reset back to the start of the puzzle but because i was partway through the video guides didnt help me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"this may come across as a forced reference, but i believe this is why i like phasmophobia so much. there is the empirical evidence that you gather with tools, then the softer evidence by way of the ghost's actual behavioractions. i've spent 30 minutes chasing a ghost down only to realize the game was giving me clues and info that i just didn't notice. the tools failed me, but instead of giving me a handout the game just kept signaling until i caught on. so i guess i'm saying evidence  hints. that said, there are some tools that give you hints at a steep cost."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i just hate any kind of puzzle tbh. in 95 of games its just there to pad the play time imo. not to mention its ridiculously common to come to a puzzle and you need to solve it with a gameplay mechanic that theyve not told you about or even hinted at being possible. ive lost track how many times ive finished a puzzle and said how the fuck was i meant to know that?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i've been playing jedi survivor the last few days and have been legitimately shocked at how little this game walks you through puzzles at least on the base difficulty, not sure if there are more hints on storyeasy difficulties. you can ask for a hint sometimes if you are stuck on a puzzle for a while, but 90 of the time it just gives you the most basic possible information that you probably already knew, and still makes you figure it out. i have to say i was really impressed after recently playing through horizon forbidden west which has much easier puzzles and also has your character loudly telling you without prompting exactly what to do if you don't figure it out fast enough."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i'm exploring the area and the ai is just solving the puzzle for me. 1010
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,the other side of this is not any better. as a dd dm i can tell you players are stupid. you might think you are good at puzzles but even the most simplistic puzzle can have a group of 5 people arguing for 20 minutes and still not have the answer. i am not saying that the answer as a hint is good. only that the idea of being smart enough for these easy puzzles is gonna make you feel really bad if hints didn't exist.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"in da veilguard, they are telling me what i need to do before i have even regained control of my character after a cutscene."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,the thing that gets me is how every ledge you can grab is painted. like who is climbing cliffs with a paint can in hand. i think i first noticed it in tomb raider 2015 and now its been in many more. i feel like being stuck for 2 hours only to realize there is a crack in the wall you can climb is a rite of gamer passage. lol. if its that much of an issue for some maybe a setting that would highlight grab poibts like the focus does in zero dawn. i dunno. just takes away from the experience for me.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i just started playing soma and was taken back by the fact it doesnt really hold your hand for most puzzles. i was like well this is a change. also i may have been stuck in one of the first areas for like ten minutes because i didnt know you had to break the glass with an object to escape.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i hate puzzles in games that aren't puzzle games. it's not because i'm bad at them it's because it slows down the game. even with hints, it's annoying to me. but i'd rather have hints so i can just get through the stupid puzzle, but at that point, why even have a puzzle?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"it's the worst. why even include a puzzle if you're just going to immediately tell me the solution? give me an options slider or something at least. if you haven't solved a puzzle in 51020 minutes, would you like help? sort of thing"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"this is one of the things i really liked about the original mirrors edge. a lot of the areas in the game had multiple ways to traverse them, but by default the game would highlight the way it thought you should go in red. it made the movement very fluid and it honestly felt pretty good to play that way, but it had very little replayability. you could turn that off in the settings though, and it made the game way more interesting. it was slower, because you often had to stop on a rooftop and look around to figure out where you had to go next and figure out the best route, but pulling off a great sequence and getting through an area quickly felt great when you did it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"no, pretty much everyone hates it and it has come up a lot in articles and online discussions. i know some games have patched in the option to tone down the hints. for example, i think horizon forbidden west added a setting that was basically make aloy stop giving me so many hints."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"im in the minority here and i admit it. i simply dont like puzzles. to me it slows down the pace of the game. my brain is not wired to think in the way to solve a particular puzzle. i just go and look it up online. i know others dont feel the same, so i wish developers would put an option in the settings of the game that can be turned on or off to assist players like me who are always stumped on puzzles."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i feel you, but sometimes it is important. while it should always be a toggle in the options, having a companion that simply stand there contributing nothing is also strange. god of war is a good example atreus is a clever boy so it totally makes sense that he would take part in solving riddles and even be better then kratos. and sometimes its good for proper pacing when players get stuck for too long. thinking about it, they could let the companion actually be wrong from time to time. but yeah from a gameplay perspective not even having time to solve it yourself sucks."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"spend some time in a help section for a game and you'll understand real quick just how stupid some people are. i love helping people out in games, it's often my end game. but this has the side effect of being introduced to the absolute dumb dumbs who play games. everything from not being able to match colors no not colorblind, can't read very clear i structures right in the middle of the screen, basic lack of understanding of basic game concepts running jumping climbing, and just not reading what they clicked on or pressed. that is just the tip of the iceberg. it's coming to a point where gamers are becoming the reason games are boring. everything has to be made to where a 2nd grader can sort it out because there are just so many people out there who can not sort themselves out. the worst part is that even if they are too dumb for game mechanics, they aren't too dumb to use social media and say this game sucks, it doesn't make sense or my favorite game is a buggy mess and i can't do anything in it, everything is broken. so when it comes down to it, money is the objective and those people cost the game money."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"and it's not only puzzles. it's everything. say your character has tracking quest. you follow basically a pipe into the woods because leaving the path pops up wrong way message. that's the first. you see highlighted foot prints in dirt a mile away. you get closer the character talks to themself hmmh, looks like there are prints in the mud. i should check them out. you follow the straight path to a cave entrance that is surrounded by 'thick bushes' that act as a wall so it's basically a dead end only to be greeted with another monolog the tracks lead into that cave, hmmh. good thing i brought my flashlight with pop up message or pause press x to turn on the flashlight. be mindful, it has limited battery usage and yet when you turn it on it seems like the drain is so slow it'll last you a century or if it drains fast, it also recharges immediately you turn it off. makes me feel like i'm a child but of course the game is ages of 18 and above."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i may be a part of the problem, but i hate most riddles in games. i hate searching for dumb shit that doesn't do anything, i hate using new mechanics that are only used for this one dumb puzzle, and i especially hate when you have to intuition answers because there isn't enough context clues or the answer was purposefully vague. if i come up to a riddle and have to squirm around for 30 minutes i'm so trained for it to be a bad puzzle that i'll just google it. often i am googling puzzles that i could have solved just because i don't want to waste my time. there's some good puzzles, but most in gaming are dogshit."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"it's annoying. ragnarok is a good example of that. i barely started to look around to see how this works and the boy just told me the solution. and i'm like, why is this puzzle even there if you just solved it for me before i even got a good look at it. if you must have some kind of help system then make it optional with a button press."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"mack over on the worth a buy youtube channel rants about it regularly. i usually avoid the games he rants about. the games that are worst about this also seem to very frequently have uis designed for adhd toddlers. yes, i can see that fucking quest icon on the map. you don't have to pop up a npc yelling at me to come do his quest. you especially don't need to do it every fucking time i pass by that location. imho, you should be able to turn the ui completely off and still be able to play the game. no gps, no world markers, nothing. morrowind was like that. even skyrim doesn't pass a test for this  you can do ok up until you're told to find some guy in the reach, when the reach is like half the map. you don't get vague directions, you can't ask the npcs. you just get a name and half the map to search. so you can either turn on gps and follow the gps marker right to him, or you can just leave that quest in your quest log for the rest of the game. which i would be inclined to do if every fucking quest in the game wasn't like that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i'm the opposite, i get really annoyed at puzzles in shooters and arpgs. the less time doing puzzles the better for me. i literally challenged with complex puzzles and detail oriented matching games at work. i've done enough thinking for the day, just tell me answer so i can get back to the action. i play shooters to shoot and arpgs for the action and character building, not for puzzle solving."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,not a fan for sure. you do have to realize that most of these games are made for people who want to hold forward and press attack button until they win though.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"the new indiana jones game seems to have figured out a neat solution to this problem by giving the player a camera, which amongst other things will give hints when pointed at a puzzle. the hand holding is very easily accessible for those that want it, but entirely optional if you want to be left to figure things out by yourself."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,its because youre playing triple a games that need to pander to the widest audience. if a puzzles too hard they risk making people mad. look at indie games if you want hard puzzles.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"you might enjoy the talos principle. there's technically a hint mechanic in it, however  the hints are 100 optional  if you want to use a hint you have to explicitly seek it out and solve a different set of puzzles in order to unlock it, making it a challenge in and of itself  you can only unlock a maximum of three hints in the entire game which includes something like a hundred puzzles over all  you can't even begin to unlock hints until you're already most of the way through the game  the hints only work on a specific subset of puzzles  the hints are honestly only marginally useful for most of the puzzles"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,yeah it absolutely kills the gameplay like if you need a hint system make it a menu or something. having characters just tell you what to do isnt playing a video game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,it's the same with quest markers. i remember when games did not have them and it made exploring so much more fun.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i hate puzzles and riddles in actionadventure games so i'm glad that they give me hints or tell me how to solve it otherwise i'd just look up their solutions on youtube lol

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i say this as someone who started loom at some point in the mid '90s and just found out last week that to get out of the dragon's cave and continue the game, you need to play the turn wool into gold spell backwards which causes the big pile of gold to turn to wool, and the sleeping dragon then accidently sets it on fire, flys and flys away revealing a secret exit behind him. i can understand a certain amount of handholding but obviously nothing as condescending as you described. i think a good compromise would be for puzzles that you need to complete to progress the game, there should be some mechanism to help you out if you are straggling. but there should be other puzzles that open up optional areasquestsetc where if you can't figure it out it's just though shit, thou shall not pass."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,hot take but i appreciate this feature. i dont enjoy the puzzles in these games and im likely to look up the solution anyway. the game just telling me saves me the effort. even better when games let you straight up skip them like spiderman ps4 and those lab puzzles.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,could t you just mute the tv and ignore the subtitles during these parts?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i probably wouldnt look to those types of games for good encounters with puzzles. the games you listed are mainstream triple an action games meant for a wide audience. most people i would imagine dont play those games for the puzzles so they dont want to keep people stuck on puzzle parts they just use them for pacing. maybe play some indie or puzzle focused games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i've ended up just turning the puzzles off where possible for this exact reason. usually the puzzles aren't even hard they just take longer than the hint timer. i need a design team once to give the player character a snarky response to a hint.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"hasn't really bothered me, since i've grown to dislike extensive puzzles in games. gow you can turn off, but that and horizon felt it gave you a decent amount of time before giving hints. could be worse  puzzles like in da4 where you pick up an object 5 feet away and put it in the spot lol."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,mainstream games are never going to stop doing that because they appeal to the lowest common denominator. play the witness if you want to play a great game with good puzzles and no handholding.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i think people who say this are thinking about ye olden days where gaming was a niche and nerds was a successful movie franchise. if you look at aaaaa ... or aaaaaa games they are made for as broad an audience as possible. and unfortunately for you op that's not the hardcore gaming audience that wants to be challenged. most people want an experience and many folks need some guidance. if you want challenging you should look at the indie games or just specific games that tickle your type of fancy. expecting every single highend game to not cater to a broad audience yes these hints are an accessibility thing is setting yourself up for a lot of disappointment.  realize that you may be gatekeeping by insisting that the bar should be hire  realize that some games simply aren't for you even if you enjoyed the franchise before  realize that having more people enjoy and buy games means that there is more choice and there is undoubtedly stuff for you too. you've just fallen in to a bit of niche and now need to act that way in how you approach your game purchasing. those are my thoughts on it any way.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"yeah it feels super overboard in a lot of games. personally i do like if a game has an option to turn some sort of hints like that on  sometimes im drained from work, or on the devils lettuce and my brain dont work too good. having it be the default is silly."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,you really need to know what you're doing when you make puzzles in games because they have to be simple enough that anyone can do it but also clever enough you don't insult the players intelligence. consider that zeldaoot water temple was meme because people would get stuck on it constantly

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"developers think the average gamer is an underdeveloped mouthbreather, and you cannot convince me otherwise. i dont know if its because they grew up with ign reviews where the reviewer would pretend the game was way too hard when it really wasnt. but they think that if you have to sit down and think for even 5 seconds, youll just give up. maybe they have 0 confidence in themselves and their game and think that youll just abandon the game at the very first challenge. i dont know, but man, its rough."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"runescape has a puzzle from the archaeology skill that i think handled this situation in a balanced manner. you have a puzzle in the room to try and unlock a seal on a demon being held prisoner in the middle. each time you fail and the puzzle resets, the demon offers you a hint that you can take or refuse, sort of like he's learning how it works just like you are. each time you take the hint, the hint gets more helpful. it goes from the useless hey that thing you just tried? it was wrong to that square goes in the square hole, not the circle hole, so to speak."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,legend says that the ragnarok hand holding was because of people like darksydephil being so insanely incompetant at games or anything which requires a functioning brain. even with the yellow paint as well he didn't know where to go. going for the lowest common demeanor or something.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,what games are you playing where they do that? i've never encountered that ever.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,i wish more games would embrace the old 3d zelda hint system. if you rolled up to an area with a puzzle the first thing your fairy companion would do is get your attention with a noise. from there if you wanted a hint all you had to do was press a blinking button and they give you the standard i think we need to do this to solve the puzzle! but if you never summoned them they would just stay quiet and let you figure it out yourself.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,you must've been living under a rock if you think rehashing this incredibly wellworn complaint warrants an am i the only one...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"i noticed this over the course of the warcraft expansions. when i started, you had to actually read the quest to know what to do and where to go. there would be a description like three of our machines along this coast are acting up, go repair them. and then you'd go off looking for them. same for flowers etc. you could collect you had to actively look for them wherever you went, and going offroads if you wanted to be thorough. at some point, they implemented the system where your quest goals, collectibles, everything you were possibly looking for was pointed out on the map. they also made relevant items sparkle. i thought this was nice at first, since it made things easier... but as i went on, i noticed that it mostly just took any challenge out of it. you didn't have to look around anymore, didn't have to read where to go, you'd just follow the dot on the map. it not only made it easier, it also took any character from quests. whether you had to look for the secret entrance to a cave, discern which machine was broken or simply search for the next person to talk to, it was always the same process. it took meaning out of it, and made it feel less like i was actually there, talking to people, listening to their woes, and trying to fulfill their requests. you could disable it, but by the time i found out, i was already used to not even read the texts and simply opening the map to see where to go. they simplified a lot of things over the years. i'm sure it had some logical reasons form their side i'm sure they got loads of mod requests on where to find quest locations, and it was a good addition in terms of accessibility. but it made the game a lot less unique for me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,sure just take puzzles out of nonpuzzle games entirely and let people that want them play those games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"to put this into perspective, when i was younger much younger i played a game called loom. i believe it was a lucasarts game. it was a story driven side scrolling game about wizards who cast spells by playing notes on a magical staff. it was in the days of having to write stuff down so you didn't have to remember every combination of spell you'd learnt. i got stuck on one particular part where i had to unwind a spiral staircase. the spell for twisting wouldn't work, and neither would any other spell that didn't seem relevant. i literally had to stop playing the game, because i couldn't progress further than this puzzle. i could only revisit areas that didn't help."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"ibe been designing games since the ps2 era, 15 odd shipped titles if you played killzone shadow fall or gears 4 youve likely played some of my work particularly when you are designing a puzzle its very tough to get the difficulty of the puzzle right. you quickly learn from experience and playtesting that a puzzle that seems laughably simple to you as its designer can be impossibly difficult to the typical player additionally often the broader purpose of a puzzle isnt to test puzzle solving skills of the players but to provide a pallet cleanser or moment of variety ultimately we design games for players to have fun and a too easy puzzle is a better experience than one that is too hard for a significant portion of the player base"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-17,"yea i understand what your saying. 30 years ago it wasnt like this, games were almost too hard at times... like how would you think of that! 20 years ago we got real puzzles in games, physics, the type of stuff you may encounter int eh real world and devs wanted to make you think  it was so cool.... now days however i feel they want everyone to be able to breeze through stuff, they fear alienation by frustration. lowest common denominator of problem solving skills is how gaming is built these days. and its not just gaming... tv shows, movies, hell even books spell shit out sooner now than in days gone by. i love the reward of figuring this out or better yet finding a way that works but was not intended! sadly many modern games are often more on a rail  one intended solution and exploration or unique approaches are not always rewarded."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-17,its would be much better if it was optinal in settings..like in shadow of the tomb raider.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-17,"that's something that i was able to look past in these games, but now that i played plucky squire, i am 100 as mad about it as you. you can't take 3 steps in that game without 2 different characters screaming every solution to things that aren't even puzzles. i don't want to be completely lost with no info like soulslike games, but we definitely don't need these solutions shoved down our throat."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-17,"some of those indie games inspired by resident evil have have 0 hand holding. there's hell is us that's coming out in 2025 where the dev talks about not hand holding players at all. i think games are getting better with accessibility features and other qol features and it would be nice if they added this to puzzles as well with 0 helping hints, few helping hints like highlight important text  interactable items or camera directed towards something, and then straight hand holding. because sometimes my brain is to fried or fixated on something that has absolutely nothing to do with the puzzle to figure out how to pass it and it's nice to not have to go search up a guide that may or may not exist."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-17,games should really have a separate slider or settings for handholding. i understand that it helps games to be more accessible to people who don't like or enjoy them but there are many people who also like and enjoy them. it's not even about this gamer is better than that gamer. it's really a matter of preference.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-18,"what i don't understand is the it's so that people don't give up angle. if your solution to that problem is spoiling the puzzle's solution after 20 seconds, why in god's name would you even have a puzzle to begin with? just make a game without puzzles ffs."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-05,"seriously, there's no bigger spoiler than just telling you the answer to a puzzle and in a world full of spoiler alerts they don't give you any warning"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"people also want an easy mode in souls games, don't forget. you're listing mainstream aaa games, they cater to the lowest common denominator. there's great puzzle games out there if that's what you want."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"never encountered this since most of games i play dont have this. but if i was dev, i would make it so that the ai companion would ask player if they like a hint, and only if player specifically said yes to provide hint."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"look at the achivementtrophy rarity for games, the vast majority of people buying games are pretty bad at them and might quit before the end of the first level unfortunately. devs dont want that so try to hold their hand through it. it would be nice if more games had options regarding it though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,honestly i've never noticed it on ragnarok and i was also toggling between normal and easy difficulty. maybe the old resident evil games and jrpg's trained me enough to figure out puzzles before the ai assist did their thing.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i've realized that aaa games are designed for less experienced gamers as a whole. if you want games for experienced gamers, look indy."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,it's like that because gaming is popularized to the degree where frankly a lot of straight up unintelligent people get into the hobby. i watched a leaker play ffvii rebirth this year a few days before release and this dude was so fucking stupid he struggled to find his way even with the yellow lines that we all learned to detest.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,people who want hard puzzles play puzzles games. i always find puzzles in action games annoying because they are so easy and feel distracting from the actual game

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"sometimes i cannot solve the most basic puzzles in games and the companion gives advice on how to solve them. the problem is if i cannot solve it in my current mental state i won't even understand barely cryptic advice. i want to solve puzzles sometimes, i am good at them sometimes. sometimes i cannot put the red key into the red lock, just give me a skip button so i can stop wasting my already limited time."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"the tomb raider reboots or at least shadows had 3 separate difficulty sliders. one of them was puzzles. it basically just changed how quickly and directly the game would tell you the answer. on the hardest difficulty, it wouldnt. i wish more games did that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"it's majority of gamers. seriously. they wouldn't add it if it wasn't the case otherwise. this is what happens when you need to appeal to the broadcast audience possible, you have to appeal to mouth breathers."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,its optional in the jedi survivorfallen order games if im not mistaken
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"yep, this is almost certainly it. i'm always astonished when i get an achievement for beating a level in the middle of the game and see only like 36 of people received that achievement. a lot of people don't finish games and i imagine a good portion of those are people who got stuck and never came back."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"maybe it'd be different now, but i remember being the kidteen who was just annoyed by puzzles in my action games, especially something like god of war the older ones i mean that leaned more heavily towards combat. in something like zelda i understood it, because that's not strictly an action game, but in a game like og god of war the puzzles just felt like abrupt, out of place interruptions. my attitude was that puzzles are a fundamentally different kind of gameplay than the thing i came for, and being forced to do one in a hackandslash was like being forced to do an obligatory turnbased combat section or something. that's literally a different kind of product, one that i didn't choose because i didn't want it. the impression i get is that some developers use puzzles more as a pacing tool to break up the action. they don't actually want players stopping for an extended period to think about them, just to get a breather before the next fight, and yeah, maybe market research or whatever the fuck it's called shows that most players prefer that. i do think there should be an option to turn it off though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i just don't know who these people are. i do know people who would do that, drop a game at the most minor inconvenience. but i do not know people from that group that would buy a game with puzzles."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"the new jedi survivor does this. i turned off a lot of the exploration things so it didn't just tell me where to go and it made a few of the puzzles pretty tricky. after like 5 minutes of running around and not solving it, you have the option to ask bd1 for a hint. it was pretty cool instead of the companions just telling you what to do right away."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i think probably the developers' stats arent as sophisticated as that. it's almost like they got feedback that losing isn't fun, so designed out all failure conditions in any form, including the user being too stupid to progress."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"this is my take. i'm okay with easy puzzles but sometimes i feel let down. i imagine some one who wants a challenge must feel so disappointed if even i am. why not toggle on or off? ah shit, it's been 20 minutes. i'll take the hint ffs. i want to move on now is such an obvious qol situation. maybe they know they'll just google it but that's not fun either. stopping your game to hopefully find good direction. but also oh. the hardest part of.that dungeon was an awkward half platforming situation in a game not really meant for precise jumps. the puzzle was literally to turn these tablets to match the symbols on the wall right above the gate you're trying to enter that aren't even up high and off screen when you look at it sucks. looking at you bethesda even though i love you."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"in the days of the internet, i honestly don't understand why this stuff is even an option... if some one really can't solve a puzzle without a golden arrow pointing to the next objective at every step, then let them google it on the internet. if you are afraid that some 1 of 1 of gamers are going to quit because your puzzle was too hard then don't make games with puzzles. make a game that gives people the victory screen as soon as they overcome the challenge of hitting new game..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i don't understand the point of including puzzles if the game is just going to solve them for you. hints are fine. maybe this relates somehow to the pattern on the floor. but flatout giving you the answer is just too dumb for words.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i'll say this i think the puzzles in those games are a joke and barely puzzles. they are pixel hunting at best. they are trivial and often pace breaking. modern games do puzzles really, really poorly. i'm generally happy when the companion tells me a hint not because i couldn't have figured out  because i just want it over with. honestly calling them puzzles or riddles in the first place is disingenuous."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,makes me think of the rick and morty short mysteries on interdimensional cable. would be funny to see a spoof of a game thats like that loading the game up andddd i won.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i personally like what most puzzleonly games do. you will have a hint button that you can click if youre stuck, but otherwise its all on you. i think thats a great solution if youre hard stuck and cant figure it out, click for a hint. if youre not, solve it on your own."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i don't think it'll be a button because of consoles, but not having it tied to the difficulty slider is childish."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,i think one of the things about the games that provide this as an optional thing is that its almost always defaulted to on. it takes considerable time and effort to add these lines from npcs too. and ultimately it under cuts the overall design because both systems are accounted for and it effects the design of the puzzles as a whole
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,theyre the common clay of the new west httpsyoutu.behytq7nndi?sism6kagjwj7rouvv and now games are made for them
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,i'd appreciate if it was optional. i personally dislike puzzles in every game but understand that lots enjoy it. but i do dislike that hints are forced onto everyone.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,what's cool is lara also doesn't just spoon feed you information. there's a timer from when you've solved a segment before she chimes in with a hint. and when you've been there for way too long she will then tell you the solution and i liked that. for everything i didn't solve she did when i got bored and frustrated. and always itd be a ah how did i not see that response from me.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,yes! that was an amazing feature of these games. maybe the reason more games haven't used this since then is it may require many many additional voice lines and cost quite a lot?

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"it's totally avoidable. my master's thesis happens to be about this subject. so far, according to some books i've read i'm thinking the psychology of games, by celia hodent, or learn to play, by matthew white, i can kind of understand where the devs where coming from and what they could've done better. it should've been enough to have the companion say something like do you need help with that?, and then if you go and talk to them, they give you hints that would make the puzzle progressively easier. even that is not entirely desireable, because you want your players to learn your game by playing it, not because you told them how to do so. if you have to tell your players how to solve a puzzle, yes, they will continue progressing the game, but their motivation will decrease. in summary, it's not good player experience design. not even for new players or specially for new players."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i would like options to turn up or down hints and such. also, map markers have a toggle or different types of markers. i can't do puzzles as my brain auto sorts out most details on the screen so i don't get overstimulated by everything on screen. i miss many parts of puzzles this way, so i don't like them. i also can't navigate my way out of a wet paper bag until i've been guided through it 10 or more times."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i think part of the issue is who you are choosing as a play tester. if you're constantly attempting to conquer a market that largely isn't interested in your product then you're gonna run into these issues. not every game needs to be designed for someone who's never played a game before. it felt like back in the day there were games made for noobs and games made for lifelong gamers and both audiences could mix and match but you'd know what you were getting. now devs seem to want to appeal to everyone with the same product but all that does is cause problems. for me the assassins creed franchise is a solid example of this. a huge number of the fans of the newer games in the series weremt really fans of the older games. some of the stuff og fans love about the old games is what those newer fans always hated. ubisofts focus on newer fans hasn't really helped them. if you really analyse their numbers it seems like basically swapped out old fans for new ones rather than successfully combining the two for the extra profits. you traded your long term fans for new ones who might not dip back into your products again like you could rely on with older fans who would but every release in the series
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"spent an hour running around in an area unable to progress, because they never even considered that the ladder that lead to the next area was interactable this sounds like the dev should have learned some design, and not user error. back in the day when devs actually played games and didn't actively hate the industry you could clearly see the interactable items without having to drown them in that stupid yellow paint."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"it's for people like me. i play games to destress and after long day of using my brain at work, it doesn't want to think anymore. if the game is overly complex, i'll google it or install cheat engine."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"the notes on dev commentary remind me of alan wake 2. in the night springs dlc there's a section where you're told to go to a beach. due to size and proximity, you naturally think of a certain beach especially if you beat the base game already. on the way to it you will encounter a sign that says not this beach with an arrow pointing to the other beach in question."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"catering to a large audience is faulty logic anyway, yes, you may make the next big hit that literally everyone loves... but more than likely you just made boring unfocused generic slop. niche marketing may not be as profitable, but it's more sustainable long term with a dedicated fan base. like, maybe this is elitist of me, but maybe not all people should be able to play all games, like, if a puzzle completely inhibits your progress, then sorry, it's not for you. there are people who like puzzle games and i'm certain they'd rather sink their teeth into well designed puzzles than puzzles that solve themselves so as to not alienate the puzzle haters."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i think there's an argument to be made to let people still wander about. especially if it's a puzzle that doesn't directly impact the main story progression if it does impact main story, then give a reasonable time limit after hitting a trigger before giving out the hint. and even still have the player choose to accept the hint. narratively it takes you out of the moment when your 5 yo companion tells your character whom is much older the solution to a puzzle after 30 seconds and makes me feel condescended to."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i agree with this. i once was developing a phone app where there was a map and you needed to input your address to get custom services. i had people emailing tech support because they put their email address into the map and did not know why it was not working. i had never ever considered that as an edge case to deal with.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,if you design your game based on that play tester who spend an hour running around you're going to make a shallow game that will be soon forgotten. a lot of companies have done that same mistake and ruined franchises long term. you have to accept that your game may not be for absolutely everyone with a pulse.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"i stopped playing hfw because of handholding, but recently went back to it for another try because i was craving exploration. during the intro mission i was looking to find some extra scraps and as soon as i went off the scripted path the companion was like it's a dead end. no hesitation from him, no loot in sight, just a hardcoded autoscroller in disguise. so damn unsatisfying."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"i liked the fact when hfw went to pc, one of the first mods was to shut up aloy and stop her revealing puzzle hints."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"holy shit yes this was by far the worst part of the game, you'd almost just walk into a puzzle room and aloy would blurt out the answer. gow ragnarok was a little better, they had an option to delay puzzle hints but imo every game with puzzles needs an option to disable hints entirely."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i loved hzd and hfw was good for what it was the reveal of ted faro was a masterpiece but i cannot agree with you more. let me figure it out dammit!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,didnt ragnarok have a setting to disable it though?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"its litereally why i stopped playing. at some point i was so annoyed with this and after reaching a new area, the head instantly told me the solution. and they didnt add the option to disable it, they added an option, that looked like it. you still got the companion telling you the solution afterwards."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,i enter a new area and spot a chest. i run to it and start opening it atreus maybe you need to hit that pole with your axe! memy boi in christ what fucking pole are you talking about i haven't even looked around yet
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,that was the first indication for me that ragnarok wasnt going to be near the game 2018 was. still upset about it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"i think it also breaks immersion, because somehow kratos me and atreus would walk up on an area, and atreus has inexplicably sniffed out the next step to progressing before i was even able to take in the view of the place and is trying to tell me what to do. i think there could have been some meta symbolism for it in the story, like maybe teen atreus is rushing through things your old dad self hasn't even looked at yet, but no, every single character did this, even the ones that didn't like you and didn't want to help you. that game really was the most egregious example i've seen of that, it almost felt bugged like the characters should have been speaking 5 mins later instead of after 5 seconds."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,unfortunately true. there were times i'd be admiring the environment and she'd be talking about how to solve a puzzle i hadn't even seen.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"the worst example of this i personally experienced was in spiderman miles morales. i entered a room, accidentally shot a web at a wall and miles immediately after said, i bet i could use my webs on that elevator's gears so i can crawl under it safely! i was so flabbergasted and insulted i almost dropped the game right there."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,god of war ragnarok was the exact same.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i'm in a harry potter fan group on facebook. the game attracted a ton of nongamers. the questions people were asking in the group and the things they were getting stuck on were astonishing. i think we'll forget how hard games actually are because we've been playing them for so long.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"i'd rather there was an option to go and ask the character for help, maybe, or the character at least waits a bit before figuring it out before me. i think a toggle seems too black and white because sometimes i might need help, but not every single time. i think the questions probably differ with different games, too, like i know fortnite which is also free would probably have more kids playing than god of war ragnarok"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"i recently started playing diablo 4 with a few irl friends. it isn't a super complex game or anything, but the paragon stuff gets tediously complicated. well anyway, i am unable to say it out loud, but this one friend of mine has no chance of ever figuring it out. he is just too casual of a gamer. we spend the whole session just trying to get him geared and he still can't kill stuff or stay alive. zero intuition, zero experience playing those types of game. it's not that he isn't smart enough but uh... he isn't smart enough to play that game. he does great at all kinds of other games but if a game requires any amount of reading, it might as well be in chinese because he won't read anything. absolutely no deductive reasoning ability whatsoever can be find rattling around in his skull. i think george carlin said it best. think about how stupid the average person is. now realize that half of all people are even stupider than that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"re hogwarts legacy we bought our ps5 specifically for that game. previously we were a pcandnintendoonly household. guess what button operation neither of those have? thats right pressing down on a control stick. the first time i tried it, i felt like i was breaking the controller, ha ha."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"lol, i play games pretty regularly mostly km stuff, and i also don't know how to press the right control stick if any game unfortunately uses it, usually for camera. i mean, i know where it is and how it mechanically works in an isolated context, but i don't get how you're supposed to press it if you don't have 3 hands because abandoing the 4 interaction buttons is generally a bad idea. i read about suggestions to like weirdly wrangle your hand to somehow do that, i absolutely can't."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"in other words, stop buying these aaa games designed for non gamers."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"not keen on that either, tbh. we should always have the option to turn these hints off, no matter how subtle they think it is."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"how about if you're stuck, you just be stuck and have to figure it out? what's wrong with that?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,i just want to be stuck. the witness gave me no hints past the training puzzles and no excuses and i loved it. i can already look online if i want to cheat. i don't need built in cheating.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"my companion asked me if i was lost, and the prompt to ask her for help appeared over her head, but she didn't spoil the answer, just gave me the option to. i'd love to have games like this."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"definitely this. i absolutely love puzzle games and playing the silent hill 2 remake and now playing through silent hill 1 on the ps1 has been amazing just for the puzzles alone, aside from all the other great things in those games. the contextual clues are pretty much at a bare minimum, enough for you to finally get that aha! moment but you have to really use your brain. which is all the more satisfying. long live the piano puzzle at the start of sh1, it was really brilliant. tldr op, definitely play through the sh games if you haven't already."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"agreed. always remember that most people are extremely stupid. if any one wants a puzzler without the hand holding then subliminal is definitely worth a go. it's a pure puzzler though, and not just puzzles in amongst a much bigger, varied aaa game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,smart coding would make the game react and adapt.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-17,"breath of the wild and tears of the kingdom were so good in this department. which was a pleasant surprise compared to the previous zelda installment, skyward sword, which i felt was way too handholdy."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,there's an option on the pc version.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,either they just patched the ps4 version or it's coming soon with the option to turn off frequent puzzle hints. it's worth looking into again
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,they just patched it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"it's especially odd when i assume they want you to look at the environment and appreciate the graphics, but the characters act as if they've got a gun to their head to progress as quickly as possible. atreus in the 2018 game would often be in the background just sliding around on ice having fun or playing with his knife, while in ragnark, he can instantly find out the quickest path to get past this puzzle while i start having to race to look at everything before he can comment this time. it feels unrealistic to the player and the characters."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"naw. irl you'd have that note in your pocket and pull it out instantly. i hate having to navigate through page after page of shitty menus to find that one note that looks like all the rest. maybe have the player pull the note out for immersion, but i don't want to go through more work in a game than i would irl."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,the contrast from inazuma and the mona summer island to fontaine is hilarious. the game has barely had puzzles in the last year or two. nearly everything on that side autoplays or reveals itself.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"i'm not technically against that if i've sat somewhere for 20 mins and exhausted all options, confused, but i distinctly remember getting stressed because of the companions in ragnarok. at first atreus said things before i even looked at everything, but then it started to be where i only looked at one thing, or i didn't even look at a puzzle yet, and he's starting to solve it for me. i started getting stressed walking up to a puzzle because i couldn't even compete with my npc son, who was programmed to know the answers before i could even start to think. i don't know who the play testers were, but that should be some super assisted difficulty, not normal."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,that's been my favorite feature going through the rest of the silent hill games.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-17,"finally someone in this thread who gets it lol. these aren't puzzle games. modern god of war and the uncharted series are interactive stories. the entire point of them is to keep the pace and action going forward at all times. if you want puzzle games, there is no shortage of games to explore."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"i don't even think the first 2018 game was bad with that? i definitely had time then, but in ragnarok it's like atreus' personality was taken away in favor of supplying me with answers like im paying him to cheat on a test. i don't know what happened between those two games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,that game is absurd with the puzzles. literally everything you come across is a fucking puzzle. i got sick of if really fast. never finished.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,you can reduce the hints now but its still a bit overtuned
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,username checks out
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"or maybe the issue is that the game has nothing else for you to do, or no way around the puzzle. then it isn't very sensible to have hard puzzles without hints."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"because not all difficulty is created equal. just because i want to solve puzzles on my own doesnt also mean i want enemies with 4x their normal health. i never cheat on puzzles in games, i will spend a week or more sometimes banging my head on a puzzle."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,maybe people want easy combat but hard puzzles?

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"if those games are bad, what do you consider good?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-18,this. console game design is a travesty.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i like the starwars fallen order method, after x time passes game straight up ask if you want help, if you choose no it leaves you alone for quite a long time and once the time come it asks again, at no point it instatly gives you the answer unless you request it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,that setting needed separate sliders. i wanted to press the button to highlight the pieces of the puzzle so i could see what i had to work with. unfortunately this only highlighted them very briefly then when you pressed it again because you hadn't finished panning the camera around yet lara would give you a verbal hint that pretty much solved it for you. i just wanted the glowing part!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i agree, its a very elegant solution, would like to see more of this in other games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"i feel like in the modern era of gaming there isn't a good excuse for more customizable experiences, difficulties, controllers, etc..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,i think i'm playing on easy but i can't remember picking that option. glad i did though. i just dont have enough time to be puzzled.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"i was going to say the older ps games like spyro, tr, abes odyssey, etc. were like this. turns out a bunch of designers thought people were losing interest in games if the puzzle wasnt quickly solvable. theres clearly a market for it, but options for us who enjoy the grind and difficulty of a puzzle to get that satisfying feeling of completing it after hours of trying should be available as well."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"this is why it's frustrating when people put everything down to gatekeeping. not all gatekeeping is born out of some kind of elitism or superiority complex. to a degree it just serves to maintain a certain standard of quality. gordon ramsey is gonna have a way higher standard for a cheese sandwich than i would and that's why he should be a chef and not me. it's all well and good to listen to your wider audience but you also have to realise that often times that wider audience doesn't even fully understand your product or what's made it successful and will ask for things that will ruin your vision. it's like the amount of people who play a great, narrative focused game with an amazingly well written main character and then ask the developers to let you create your own character in the sequel as if that won't immediately destroy a big part of what made the original so well liked. it's essentially profit vs product and most of the time profit wins."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,is it the majority of gamers? elden ring performed insanely well and there's like zero hand holding in that game. half the people that play it will happily use online guides to figure out side quests and how to triggercomplete them. why would other games suffer? it's not like puzzles are so crazy complex.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,the majority of gamers have no self awareness since we're making blanketed statements. not everyone has the same gamer first lifestyle. those mouth breathers are dads and moms who problem solve and troubleshoot all day. students who just spent hours studying. people with mental and physical disabilities.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"it's a consequence of everything getting dumbed down for 'qol' or accessibility. compare something like morrowind to skyrim or any modern game. in morrowind the game forced you to use your executive function to play, you had to think to navigate, figure out quests, you had to plan. now with pointers showing you where to go and what to do, they do all the work for you and everyone's brain has literally atrophied from lack of exercise, not even to mention the brain rot induced from social media. then of course trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator is another big problem especially when the low keeps getting lower by our own design."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"of course it's the majority of gamers. our collective attention span is fucked and people don't recognize that, let alone try to fix it within themselves. shortform content and hyperoptimized dopamine loops are eroding our ability to focus, push past mental discomfort and actually struggle with tasks. when people are addicted to scrolling 4second reels on their phones, of course they're not going to enjoy being forced to sit for minutes thinking about a game puzzle."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i have some games i got stuck in and left because of that. i dont want to look up solutions online personally. but there are far more games that i tried that didnt feel like what i wanted to play early on, or which i grew bored off at some point during the game. or just left because of different real life priorities."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"depending on the game this may be more or less true. uncharted, specifically, was always built in part on puzzles with shootingclimbingpuzzles being the three stools of the gameplay in that order of importance. other games not so much. but there are multiple ways to pace things. having a puzzle where the answer gets spilled out immediately seems suboptimal. you could just make an easy puzzle, or a nonpuzzle task. you've said that you didn't like the puzzles in the god of war games i actually didn't mind them and thought they were thematically appropriate because kratos was facing trials but those games had other pacing mechanisms too, like the platforming stuff or nonpuzzle set pieces where you just had to hit switches in a nontricky way. if you're going to put puzzles in the default should be to let the player try to solve them and then provide optional hints or the ability to skip them which some games also have now for people who don't want to engage. looking at a puzzle for 30 seconds only to have it spoiled just makes me feel stupid because it makes me feel like the game thinks i wasn't able to keep up. it's like a teacher who looks over your shoulder and gives you the answer while you're trying to work it out for yourself to hurry you along. i don't get anything out of it. if i need help i can ask for it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,there's nothing wrong with focusing on just action. what's the point of even having the puzzles at all then?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i have a few games i have dropped because of getting stuck on puzzles, since i dont want to look things up. but there are far more games i have dropped because i got bored or had to change my priorities at some way through them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,some games mostly single player story games are like that definitely not all games. i think thats an extremely unfair and inaccurate statement to make about games in general. there are tons of challenging and engaging games out there maybe you just havent found the right one for you yet.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i dont think it is as bad as that. newer games offer a wide variety of playstyles. but, the old games are always there as well, and they are really cheap and easy to get hold off. many old games offer really great mechanics, visuals, music and atmosphere, so if you prefer old school designs, and dont want to search out newer games that offer something similar, there is a ton of good old games that you never tried."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"but average is a subjective in terms of its magnitude. below average does not necessarily mean stupid, and in fact, given that it is fairly reasonable to suggest a bell curve for human intelligence, the vast majority of below average individuals have intelligence comparable to the vast majority of above average individuals."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"half the time they don't even register there is a puzzle, they just wander around in circles increasingly panicking and shouting at things and their characters do this as well. this is a group of five people including a law professor and two others with masters degrees."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,me and my friends were unable to progress past an elevator in a 40k ttrpg one time because none of us could figure out that the keyboard was a keyboard. it took us 15 real life minutes to actually solve. it wasn't even supposed to be a puzzle.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"that's why i liberally apply the rule of cool to all puzzles and riddles is it the solution i had intended? no, but if it was clever or close enough, i'll just allow it. they feel smart and the game doesn't grind to a halt pacing is everything tabletop"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"so for breath of the wild, i elected to finish the game without looking anything up. that game did really well without handholding, but holy shit i realized how dumb i actually am. after spending hours on the first bossdungeon forget what they're called, i finally figured it out after 4.5 hours that i had to tilt the controller. afterwards, i didn't feel accomplished, i just felt dumb. i feel like there should be some handholding for some of the key game mechanics that aren't intuitive to everyone, then build the puzzles from there. and those puzzles or mysteries should at least have clues to make you feel smart for figuring it out. there's a fine line between challenging and frustrating. i never knew shield riding was a thing. how to focus an arrow shot. how to block, let alone perfect block. i never knew i could trade in seeds for more inventory slots. i beat the game without ever upgrading my inventory, i thought it was just the default for the whole game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"the main reason is probably that most people who play games on steam today have a lot of games to choose from. in addition to a small or large backlog, and other game collections, there is constantly coming out new releases and rereleases of older games that are tempting them. if people just had a few games to choose from in practice, they would finish much more of their games. but since there is such a wealth to choose from, in many cases also for those with low income, people arent incentivized to stick to finish a game, unless they really want to, or its something that they are focusing on. this is not a problem though, having the freedom to choose from many games is not a bad thing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i dropped gow partly for the handholding, but also because the more generic combat failed to hold up across an open world game. as a fan of the original series, i liked the more arcadey style, distinctive overhead camera and i remember a couple puzzles taking a moment to solve. so the drop off in interest goes both ways plenty of players drop games that they feel arent testing or rewarding them enough."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"i agree. some lighting should've fixed the issue, or not scattering the environment with too many distracting objects. it's a level design issue."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i feel like the whole thing could so easily be solved by just adding settings for puzzles. this way, someone who's struggling with them can get hints and actually solve it, while someone who wants to figure it out by themselves is also able to do that without the constant handholding. i've sort of been on both sides, i love puzzles and figuring stuff out on my own and it pisses me off when games treat me like a toddler, but i also got an illness about two years ago which severely affects my thinking and memory so i do need help with these things more often nowadays. and it would be nice if you could adjust it at any time, since i have better days and worse days, and i guess when people get too stuck only at a specific puzzle."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"if a puzzle completely inhibits your progress, then sorry, it's not for you. sorry, but if a non puzzle oriented game has a puzzle in it that is too obtuse to be able to figure out in a reasonable timespan then it isn't that the game isn't for me, it's that the devs decided to use atrocious level design. i'm not someone that struggles with puzzles primarily, this particular part of your comment just rubbed me the wrong way. people who jump to this conclusion are dealing in a logical fallacy, in my opinion. not liking a single unnecessary aspect of a game doesn't mean it isn't for you  especially when you clearly enjoyed other parts of it, often every other part of it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i've heard they added it but it wasn't there near launch.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,did it? i remember looking for something that would disable it at the time and not finding anything. it's possible i could have missed it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"nope, they added one to delay hints but you'd still only have 30s or so to figure it out before being hinted at. source, just played it a month ago."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,the first gow was even worse for puzzle hints. at least in ragnarok they added a delay option. it didn't fix things but it at least meant i could do half of them without the head annoying me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i did this in god of war, i'd be trying to explore and look around the area and boys just like puzzle, the puzzle! here's how you solve the puzzle!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"yup. entire reason i started playing the game muted, she just wouldnt shut up anytime i was near a puzzle."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i like to analyze my puzzles and sometimes i just try random shit to give me a better perspective on the puzzle, you know, so i can glean the answer for myself. well theres a puzzle in miles morales thats pretty simple, just move a couple cranes to the right place or something. i literally moved one of them just to test it out and miles shouted the exact order to complete the puzzle. like, at least give me a chance to mess it up first!!theres been this push in recent years to make narrative focused games so excessively accessible that theres no friction at all between the player and the story. but when you look at how obtuse and unaccessible something like elden ring is, and how popular it is, you can see that accessibility is not the only thing preventing players from wanting to finish your game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"previously we were a pcandnintendoonly household.   guess what button operation neither of those have?   thats right pressing down on a control stick. the wii u and the switch both do, actually."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"they're typically designed for both, but they have to appeal to every possible audience when they have a huge budget. some games just lean too much in one direction sometimes"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,i came here to say this. tons of aa and indie titles exist with challenging puzzles. you have to sift through to find one that clicks with you though. it gets to the point where some games start requiring engineering and math at a college level to solve thing.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"how about not phrasing your question like it's a confrontation, you just express you prefer to be stuck and don't want any hints at all? what's wrong with that? they were saying they liked how another game did it, it wasn't imposing anything onto you. chill out."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"well, what if you're stuckstuck. what if you just can't get it? you'll either need a hint, or you'll go online to search for a hint. i'd rather hint be gentle and built into the game, as opposed to press the button under the statue, stupid!, which is what you'd get online. a hint rather than a shovel to the face. i'm of a very firm opinion that all of game functionality should be built into the game. which is why i utterly loathe and despise discord and all it stands for. because as soon as it became a thing, game devs started to unload things like clan support, matchmaking, etc., onto discord rather than implementing it in the game itself. i am a firm believer that if a game needs something, you should never ever have to alttab and go into another app for it. and that includes hints to puzzles in puzzle games. so i'm a huge fan of gentle nudges, within the game, by the devs who wrote the puzzles."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,"it's fine to not want hints but i don't think you need to be hyperbolic and call it 'cheating'. it's not cheating, it's a subtle hint."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"gordon ramsey is gonna have a way higher standard for a cheese sandwich than i would and that's why he should be a chef and not me. this is precisely the bad kind of gatekeeping. requiring all chefs  or all grilled cheeses  to match ramsay's standards would be absolutely terrible. not only would you lose a lot of entirely adequate chefs and cheeses, you would also lose a lot that don't happen to match ramsay's preferences but are great for someone else. and will ask for things that will ruin your vision visions are not special or particularly valuable. sturgeon's law applies. 90 of visions are shit, and would often be improved by getting ruined. even looking at the 10 that aren't shit  often there are multiple good visions. in an ideal world we would have the resources to support each of them, but in practice we generally don't. a vision being more appealing to more people does not inherently mean that it's a worse vision."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,wild you think i'm qualified to judge anyone.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"yes, i'm absolutely livid. unbridled rage, i can barely contain myself."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"yeah that's a fair point too. i never used guides, i still prefer not to. discovering things for myself and exploring mechanics is like 90 of the fun for me. i won't knock anyone who does, but that's never been my fit personally. i'm not too surprised my og comment is controversial, i think it comes off as condescending when i'm not trying to be. i just wish we had more games that didn't cater to the everything handed to the player on a platter mentality. the ones that don't mostly only exist in the indie field because almost every aaa game does exactly that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i don't use guides myself, but my perception is that there are many among those who uses guides, who only uses them occasionally when really stuck. this is obviously different from people who have them ready all the time. ding ding ding. that's what most people guides for using them only when stuck. i think that's on me you misinterpreted my posts there are very few games you need them open all the time. usually if that's the case? it's translation guides. though would jt count if you are say, testing a translation? genuine question actually."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"there is a lot of urban legends and assumptions online on this topic though. some people who bought those guides, or got them free with games as children, do assume that this is how the games were meant to be played. but i have never heard a game designer say that they intended their games to be played with guides. and common sense dictates they were not. the game guide market is something that popped up as a secondary effect of games generally being challenging back then. that was however not the main motivation for developers making games difficult. you can make theories about some companies purposefullly pushing their developers to make their games harder on purpose to sell more guides, but i havent seen any examples of this yet. the main reason why both action and adventure games were harder back then is obviously to make them last longer. neither parents, kids or older players would have been very happy if games lasted only a day or two on average."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,did i say they shouldnt?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"maybe not according to your personal definition, but i dont think it makes sense to exclude it from things which are considered cheating. for example in adventure games of the point and click, or text adventure type, the gameplay is pretty much nothing but exploration, interacting with the world and figuring out puzzlesprogression. if you just use a guide, theres not much gameplay left there. similarly for action adventure games like zelda and metroid, you could say that puzzles and exploration is 3070 of the game, and action elements the other half. if you use a guide for these i would say it is cheating too. but, that doesnt have to mean that you only can play games like these in only two ways. personally i dont look up solutions online, but it is possible to play games in a way where you make some rules for yourself that allows you to look up solutions under some circumstances. as long as you followed your own rules you wouldnt be cheating in relation to those rules, but you would still be cheating according to the wider definition of the word. at least for some people, the definition of what constitutes cheating varies a lot from person to person. pure action games makes the topic more complex however. personally i dont use guides or videos for these either, but most of the people who are really good at old 2d games, like speed runners, do watch videos of other players to get better. and in this case, using a guidevideo isnt an immediate warp to beating your objective, since you still have to execute it. it wouldnt make sense for me to call the best people in the world who are exceptionally better than myself for cheaters for using videos, but for my own personal purposes it would still be cheating in a sense."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-18,"yeah in games like zelda or mario it's all good, the person playing might be anywhere from 6 to 60 years old. but in something like god of war, where there's very mature themes and difficult boss battles, i think we'd be fine if atreus didn't point out the big lever with yellow paint on it after being in the room for three seconds."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"yeah this is an area where it is easy to be interpreted as condescending. often i approach it very diplomatically and take other viewpoints into consideration when presenting my own. other times like here, i am more tactless. which is not always a good choice. people who like to play blind, or those who like to play games after the rules we think they were designed after, can sometimes be rude and condescending. the git gud line is mostly used ironically, but not always, and is an example of how not to behave. but people with the opposite views on what works best for them, can be just as obnoxious and annoying. and project what works for them into what is best for everybody. or automatically assume that most people play the same way as they do. insinuations that people with a life and family, don't have the time to play blind, or after the rules, is also very common. what i think in general, is that it is a good idea for anyone who plays games to reflect on what makes playing them most enjoyable for them, and then perhaps make some rules based on this. because modern gaming with all the settings within games, rereleases and all the options available outside of games as well, makes having some rules something that could improve your experience. but while having some rules is good, it is also a good idea to be open to the idea of also making exceptions to the rules for some genres or special cases."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"i can see how you and the other guy misread my posts and thought i had a guide open 247 i don't think as many people really played a game with a guide 247 unless it was a translation guide or in my case was testing a fan translation. ie does the item marked x properly do y? .. i just wish we had more games that didn't cater to the everything handed to the player on a platter mentality. the ones that don't mostly only exist in the indie field because almost every aaa game does exactly that. see, one thing i would do for an elder scrolls vi would be to let you turn off the questobjective tracker. i would still have the quest givers give you directions or even say give me your map i will mark it here. it's mostly an immersion thing. i also would probably not have any puzzles in there aside from a few framed as a mini game  it would even make sense in universe that some people are playing bar games. i also do not mind putting out secrets either. i feel they shouldn't be so obfuscated that you have to find them with a guide, and if i lock myself out of something it should be obvious what i did and why."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"ding ding ding. that's what most people guides for using them only when stuck. i think that's on me you misinterpreted my posts yes it seems i did. i remembered what you said to be that you had a guide ready, and alt tabbed to that. but what you actually said was very different  which was mostly alt tab. open firefox or internet explorer. enter www.gamefaqs.comhttpwww.gamefaqs.com. look up morrowind.  so it was just me misremembering you, not that you expressed yourself ambiguously. but don't you think that you went a little far in your assumptions about how people play their games? as far as i know, there is no data on this available, and i suspect that if some exist, it wouldn't paint a picture of an overwhelming majority using guides around 2002 or before. there are also some nuances here, between people finally succumbing to using a guide after a long period, and people who use guides whenever they get stuck. your original comment seemed to imply that an immediate look in a guide was the norm for most people when encountering a problem, instead of use your executive function to play, you had to think to navigate, figure out quests, you had to plan which you specifically cited. . though would jt count if you are say, testing a translation? genuine question actually. if i tested a translation, it would be something i did for somebody else so that would have to come before my enjoyment of a first playthrough. i am a firm believer in that making rules for yourself can enhance your experience when playing games, but i am also a firm believer that being able to make exceptions based on case, is similarly important."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"ever hear of sierra online? yeah... they literally offered you ways to purchase guides in game or gave you the 900 number to call. they did stop offering you the phone number when you died in game fairly soon though... ie they stopped by late 80searly 90s the main reason why both action and adventure games were harder back then is obviously to make them last longer. neither parents, kids or older players would have been very happy if games lasted only a day or two on average. yes and no. it was a reason snesdrunk nicknamed it rigged rentals and often the driving reason. but not the sole reason. some of the reason a lot of older games have that old school difficulty is just cause design principles were different. one notable thing was that there was a lot more padding back then, but some of it may even have been due to serendipity. lacking the power to go faster"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"well since you said who wont admit that some of this shit is a straight improvement.  in this thread, i interpreted it as a reference to the main topic here, which is forced handholding. but since you seem to disagree with the interpretation i must assume that you are in favor of developers putting it in as a choice. i guess where we disagree is for games where no option is given."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"yeah, that was on me for not communicating well. if i tested a translation, it would be something i did for somebody else so that would have to come before my enjoyment of a first playthrough. i am a firm believer in that making rules for yourself can enhance your experience when playing games, but i am also a firm believer that being able to make exceptions based on case, is similarly important. yeah, the few times i was testing a translation, i was looking st the lines, then making sure they matched what they were supposed to have replaced. so i was kind of looking at a guide constantly for that. buuut i wasn't sure if that counted. especially cause it may not he considered a proper playthrough since i had to load a lot of save states to test it at different stages."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"ever hear of sierra online? indeed i have, in fact i am playing one of their old point  click adventures right now. if any developers ever purposefully made their games harder to sell guides, sierra is the first company i would think of. because selling guides was something they did, and because their games were quite hard. i can certainly imagine in my head, ken williams mentioning to his designers that the games had to be challenging enough for that reason. but so far i have not read or heard any interview with him, or his game designers which suggests that this happened. so at this point this is just a theory that you have. it is certainly not improbable that ken would try to influence them, but it is also just an assumption that you made, just like you made the assumption about most players having guides in the background when they played games back in 2002. if you have ever had any discussion with someone about politics, when they have a very different view of them than you, you have probably noticed that people very easily make assumptions about things that make the world fit in their own worldview. i am fully open to the idea that sierra actually made their games harder to sell guides, but so far i have found nothing to support this. meanwhile roberta williams, jane jensen and the other designers had other reasons for making their games hard that are obvious. i wrote the main reason why both action and adventure games were harder back then is obviously to make them last longer. but this was a simplification to keep my comment short. what i actually meant by this is a process where several genres of games evolved and took form throughout the 70s and 80s, and these genres then took a firmer and more standardized shape later on. because some games worked well and were imitated. all this led to genres like platformers and point  click games having a set of expectations towards them, both by players and developers. so for the most part, rather than people consciously thinking we must make this game long enough and designing the game mechanics after that, this was an evolutionary process that selected for games that were long enough to fulfill the expectations of gamers, parents and game journalists. i would imagine that developers frequently found their games to be too short at some point, but throwing on an extra level, area, etc, was probably more often the solution than increasing the difficulty. but that probably happened as well, as a game being difficult was generally seen as a good thing by journalists, marketers and many players back then. so it appears that we do agree quite a bit in this area. genre traditions, much smaller teams for making content, and the limited ram and data storage space, especially on consoles, made games significantly harder than they are now. there is an interesting partial exception here, which is rpgs. rpgs could recycle the assets they contained in a completely different way than levelbased action games, or graphical adventure games could, when following genre conventions so these games could be very long, without needing challenging action segments, or places you got stuck and had to experiment, like in adventure games. and when playing rpg games from this period today, i personally find them to be a lot easier than action games. especially jrpgs, which is a very standardized genre, which makes it very easy to pick up and play if you already know it. however the thinking at the time among console players in the west seems to have been very different. egm systematically labelled all rpgs as hard when reviewing them in early years, and for comparison, battletoads as medium in difficulty. but it is probably a result of many players not being very familiar with how the genre conventions worked back then. there are a few jrpgs who are noticeably harder than most from this time. dragon warrior 2 for example. but even this game is fairly easy compared to most acclaimed action games on the same console. so it seems likely to me that the designers of these rpgs didn't need to make the games as hard as action and adventure games to make them last, and therefore was incentivized to make their games easier for other reasons. yes and no. it was a reason snesdrunk nicknamed it rigged rentals and often the driving reason. i disagree that this was the driving reason. and this is simple to see, because among console games from the nes and snes era, the games that were made more difficult when they came to the west are far less numerous than those that were. another important aspect here is that midperiod nes games 8790 were generally harder than later nes games. nes games were also generally harder than snes games. in general games didn't get harder when the japanese games industry started focusing on the american rental market, they got easier. this doesn't mean that rentals didn't influence difficulty, it was an important factor as you say, but it was not the main one, when you view genre traditions and the practical need for a game to be long enough as one factor. i view them as one, because the need for game to be long enough obviously shaped how genres developed. but since we do in fact agree quite a bit about all these factors being important in influencing the difficulty of games back then, perhaps you should reconsider the view that selling guides was an important factor for shaping their difficulty. while sierra sold guides for their games, i bet that this was not something a majority of developers did, and in that case, you can entirely remove that from the equation for those developers. exploring a game on your own, solving puzzles and progression, and the satisfaction that comes after getting stuck for a little while, but then figuring things out, is something that a lot of players enjoy a lot. and i would assume that a lot of game designers do as well. if you ever have made challenges or noncomputer games for people in the real world, you know the feeling."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-16,so the leading theory on why thor's wound didn't heal in the first game kratos throws the leviathan axe into jormungandr's mouth and he retrieves it right back which basically coats the axe in the venom of the world serpant....thor's sworn enemy and who he is destined to fight during ragnarok. the wound doesn't heal because jormungandr has the capability to flat out kill thor.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"vr blows my mind now, and all ive seen is what quest 2 can do. i bought it years ago and it just sits there gathering dust. its just not as comfortable as sitting in front of my monitor with a controller. plus at that time, i had a toddler. they have no concept of staying out of the way while youre moving your hands around . anyways, i think a majority of people have never actually even tried vr. theyre probably imagining it being like having a smartphone strapped to your head. if they just had a chance to try it theyd have no choice to admit it its the coolest thing theyve ever seen. for now though its kinda uncomfortable on my head. i cant wait to play augmented reality games though. im just cautious in buying a quest 3 because im worried its gonna sit there gathering dust."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"my answer would be vtolvr. the graphics would still be mind blowing to my little kid self, but a flight sim where you can actually push buttons and interact with the cockpit, as well as full 360 free look that would be absolutely insane. edit star wars squadrons in vr mode. little kid me would think hed died and gone to heaven."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,which you running?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,i really wish i could get over the motion sickness. i have a quest 2 my friend gave me but anything that actually requires me to move around is too much and i end up getting way too sick. i do like the idea of lightweight ar glasses once that's refined more but i fear vr will never be for me as long as the motion sickness still is a problem.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"i wasn't even thinking of vr for some reason but yeah, being able to sit on my couch across the house from my pc and play alyx via virtual desktop is probably the right answer here."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"i would have waited for that period when i became obsessed with western games. i would have let myself finish red dead revolver, and then gun, which i probably played through atleast 3 times. when rockstar announced red dead redemption i flipped. must have read that game informer article over a dozen times."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,my answer exactly. this game is so freaking real. i would have been speechless for a day or two if id seen rdr2 as a kid.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"this for me but not just because of the graphics, but because childhood me was obsessed with playing games like ocarina of time and harvest moon exclusively for the purpose of riding a horse. i wouldve lost my mind being able to ride a horse around while it looked as good as it does"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"my first console was a commodore 64, i remember seeing reboot on tv and being amazed at how realistic it was. games had no real story other than a paragraph in the front of the booklet that came with it. seeing everything in red dead 2 might have broken my mind. it wouldn't have seemed possible. hell even seeing it on an hd or 4k screen would be insanity. we had crt displays with 320x200 resolution. we also got 16 colors i think, i can't remember because my monitor was black and white."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,i bet it's would be like my 11 year old self thought ff8 would be like as my first final fantasy game when it came out based solely on cut scene graphics i saw in the commercial
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,i was obsessed with crisis core on psp. i would do the same with the remake haha
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,came in to say this. i remember saving my allowance to buy ff7. i probably skipped a few launches.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,i remember showing my dad the footprints in the snow and how realistic it was
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,that's the first game that got me into rpgs.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,its funny because the new ff7 is how i saw the original when i played it as a kid. my head would probably explode if i saw this back then.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,this. i member buying the og on day 1 from toys r us
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,great answer
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,specifically the gongaga chapter.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,yep. og ff7 is my favorite game of all time. i would've been floored and gone full jackie chan head explosion meme.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,as some one who didn't really like the remake i do wonder if my high school self would have enjoyed the game more. considering final fantasy hadn't lost its identity yet i wonder if the changes in story and game play would have been more acceptable since traditional final fantasy games were still coming out.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,ff16
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"i think i'd probably stick with the og, tbh. while i do think the remakes are excellent, there's a charm to the originals that can't be easily duplicated."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,honestly i'm not sure if even childhood me could enjoy that bloated mess of shit that can't stay out of its own way. they actively destroy any point or theme that any section of the game has by trying to make every scene from the original game an entire 2 hour chapter with its own story arc. i stopped playing after the hojo at the beach turned into a kidnapping clusterfuck.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,the loss of gaming kiosks was the biggest loss to gaming stores

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"for me it was blockbuster. my mom was paying and i saw this 3d mario on the tv. at first i thought it was a commercial or maybe a cartoon show, but mario wasn't moving. i noticed a weird looking controller, picked it up, and realized this was a new mario game. every time my mom went shopping and there was a blockbuster near by i would go with her so i could play the kiosk. one time i was hogging the game and not sharing after dying multiple times and this high school kid behind me said alright you died. now give it up. i walked away saying quietly stupid high school kids."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,that was the biggest jump in my opinion. sure stuff like red dead 2 and cyberpunk push visuals but going from 816 bit side scrollers to that.....yeah it was mind blowing.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"tears of the kingdom is 100 my choice. zelda game were a staple. the top down dungeon puzzles were so amazing at the time, felt like i was really coming up with a solution. then, breath of the wild came i like it's puzzles better honestly, but still both are phenomenal and just took everything, even kinda blew adult me away really."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,i have that exact same memory! i even have the guy ahead of me that handed me the controller still ingrained in my memory. i couldn't believe i got to hold that new controller on that insanely futuristic new nintendo console! it's literally a core memory i have.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"haaaank! hank, don't abbreviate cyberpunk. haaaank!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,this was my answer. if 10 year old me saw cyberpunk in 1993 it would literally make my brain explode.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,came to say the same thing! i grew up playing atari and colecovision. cyberpunk would definitely be jawdropping to 8 year old me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"what a road cdpr did! game is great, still playing it from time to time. yo cd, w3 was great storywise, can you make combat suck less please? could be that i beat it on death march but the combat doesn't match the rest of the game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,this is my answer as well. postpl cyberpunk is damn near the exact game i used to wish was real so badly as a kid.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"i was thinking this, but i dont think young me would appreciate cyberpunk. its my favorite game now but young me would have been way more fascinated with the newest spiderman games"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"i thought similarly. the neversoft spiderman, though a great game that holds up imo, has the most simple web swinging and fairly basic combat. going from that to flying through the air at mach 5 and decimating teams of symbiotes would be astounding"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"you know, i was trying to think of some super duper graphics showoff game, and yet, the first thing that came to me for some reason was also journey."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,journey will always have a special place in my heart. the color design in that game is gorgeous.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,came here to say mhw. i remember being absolutely blown away by how you could climb the very tall tree in the ancient forest and then destroy a dam on top to send the monster falling down several hundred meters with zero loading screen. that game still feels next gen to this day.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,half life alyx blew my mind as an adult. if 14 year old me played it back in 1998 when the og halflife came out which i was obsessed with back then i would have probably shit myself. i could have never imagined such a game back then.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"re2r would've made my younger self be impressed and terrified by seeing how hyper realistic and high resolution the game is when compared to the resident evil titles i started with at the time 3, 4, code veronica x and outbreak. might get super scared at the zombies suddenly grabbing you and being unable to shake them off unlike the older games as they bite you or being hunted down by the lickers or mr. x. elden ring would've taken me like 3 to 5 hours to figure out the epicness of it... and then pull a non stop 48 hours gaming session until my head and eyes would hurt lmao. but would also be super scared of facing those enemies that teleport towards you and have multiple limbs and launch themselves at you or vomit on you as well due to how creepy they look."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,i'm sorry they are both funaddictive games.... but you would use farmville as a mind blowing example of modern gaming?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"this is actually a really interesting answer. instead of showing some modern aaa blockbuster running on a modem machine, show off doom being played on a refrigerator, or the entire nes, snes, genesis, and n64 libraries being held on a plastic wafer the size of a quarter."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"quest 3 currently, connected wirelessly to a pc. pretty happy with it, honestly. the pancake lenses are pretty nice compared to fresnels that are still on most other headsets. the price is decent."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"most people can train past it. took me several months for it to get usable. but i went from being sick as a dog after 20 mins to being able to play 4 hrs in one sitting. thing is, it's the same with most tech. i'm old enough to remember the old flickering crt monochrome amber monitors and the first mechanical computer mice being introduced. those were a pain too. my eyes were red like coals from the monitor's raster. and i had hand cramps from the mouse. it was huge and heavy, with a rubbercoated steel ball on the bottom, that you had to roll across the mousepad, and it mechanically rubbed against two rods with flywheels on them, and those flickering in front of sensors is what gave you the x and y deltas. had to open it up and scrape the cat hair and gunk off the rods all the time. it was brutal. and that's basically where vr is these days, relatively speaking. so it'll only get better. it's already moving scary fast. we went from no quest line at all to quest 3, 3 generations of a headset, in just 4 years. also most people start very young these days. kids have screens, keyboards mice, etc., in their hands by like age 34. i saw a little kid on the subway just doomscrolling on a smartphone and she was maybe 4, at most. and if you start young, you just don't remember the eye strain and hand cramps when you grow up. it's the same in vr. vr spaces are full of kids right now actually a pretty big problem, too many games have just screeching kids. but because they started young, they don't really get as much vr nausea. once vr expands, and kids start using at an even younger age, it just won't be an issue at all. it's us old dinosaurs adapting to completely new tech that hurts, but kids are very adaptable. also, hopefully, passthrough will take off. it's definitely handy and they're pushing it hard because once the units are scaled down to be light enough to be an everyday wearable, it's what's going to replace smartphones or at least move them permanently into your pocket. it's much less nausea inducing. the apps that use it currently are still mostly rudimentary, but the potential is definitely there. drop dead the cabin has a passthrough invasion mode where you set some virtual doors and windows in your otherwise real home, and then defend it as monsters try to break through. so you see your regular home environment, in color black  white on quest 2, and very grainy, but it's smooth and in color on quest 3 and 3s. oh, and did you know your quest 2 is night vision goggles? if you get an infrared light source, and put the quest 2 on in passthrough, you can see in the dark. ir isn't visible to naked eye, but quest 2 sees it fine. doesn't work on quest 3, because it's in color the passthrough only shows visible light. can still use it in the dark with ir light, it's fine for tracking, but you just won't be able to see anything real, because it only shows what human eye sees. so quest 2 in some ways was very neat. like finding my cat in the back yard late in the evening when he refuses to come back inside. put the headset on, turn on ir floodlight. don't wake the neighbors but find the cat just fine."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"for pc vr, not really, at least i don't think so. valve basically threw in the towel and gave up on vr. they still make headsets, but not software. alyx was 4 years ago, and they did jack shit since. they just announced a 1,000 headset with fresnel lenses, and i have no idea who for or how they expect to sell it, when quest 3 has crystal clear pancake lenses at literally half the price. and oculus and sony are pulling in different directions with their exclusivity bullshit. so on playstation we got psvr2 and a bunch of nice stuff like resident evil vr ports. and on oculus quest we got a bunch of android mobilelooking stuff like asgard's wrath 2, assassin's creed nexus, etc. which aren't bad per se, at least wrath 2 was pretty good, but it looks like shit compared to 2019 pc vr original. because it runs standalone on what is basically a smartphone strapped to your face. there's been some nice games. arizona sunshine 2 was pretty great, and they're releasing a full remake of the original next week you can just buy an upgrade if you own the original. lone echo 2 came out, for pc vr, and for that grievous sin meta shut down that studio completely, because they wouldn't play ball and go full android mobile like meta wants. moss 2 came out, also really good. lots of ports too. i've been playing deep rock galactic in vr and it's fantastic, there's even gesture controls, body holsters, the works. also the flat2vr guys that do ports actually started their own studio, so far they ported some trombone game and are currently working on roboquest port which looks pretty promising. next few months also look somewhat promising. this month is batman arkham shadows oculus exclusive, i think, but next month there's metro awakening, that one is multiplatform. basically metro 2033 in vr, and might be the closest thing to alyx competitor. in december is behemoth from the guys who did saints and sinners, which is vaguely reminiscent of shadows of colossus, but not really. and alien rogue incursion, but it's from a studio that did battlewake and walking dead onslaught, so not exactly known for quality. indie side of it is also doing fairly decent. still mostly loweffort roguelites, but some were quite decent, like the light brigade. quality is spotty, of course, but there's some interesting stuff happening. like sequel for into the radius, with coop this time. it is still very much early access, but looks promising. blade  sorcery finally released its version 1.0 with progression and campaign. still doesn't feel like a proper game, but it's not a tech demo any more. i wouldn't say things didn't get better since alyx, it's just the exclusivity bullshit that's hurting us now. sony has some nice stuff, and oculus has some nice stuff, but they're all exclusive to those platforms. asgard's wrath 2 is an honest 3040 hr platformerpuzzler game with some combat and very basic nonsensical story. but it's exclusive to oculus quest series. if you don't got one, you're just shit out of luck. same with sony. luckily upcoming metro, behemoth and some others are all multiplatform. also if you liked alyx, check out the steam workshop for it. there's some stunning mods for that one, including basically a whole new campaign that's almost as good as the original. and some mods were so good that they're being made into standalone games, like gunman contracts. and half life 2 was also fully ported to vr and free on steam fanmade though, not valve's work, the flat2vr guys i mentioned earlier helped publish it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"that's probably the only coherent reaction at the time bro. but go back a bit, instead of san andreas, make it vice city."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,just like red dead 1
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,gun was the shit.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"bro are we like the same person? haha i was the exact same. played those games an ungodly amount of times as a kid. they were so immersive, exciting, and cutting edge. and the first red dead when it was announced, i thought i was dreaming being a huge gta fan too. i couldn't fathom that my favorite dev would make an old western game. grand theft horse i used to joke with my friends but i was genuinely excited to get to play a rockstar western and that game was one of my all time favs. so yeah if i had seen red dead 2 back when i was a kid i don't think i'd ever come back to reality. question. do you play on pc? i heard red dead 1 was finally coming to pc and it looks great. and i believe it's remastered. the textures look very updated."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,and it's 6 years old truly goated
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,lol when i was 10 it was 98. i woulda been a mute until it actually came out
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"yeah, the remake fell flat for me too. i don't care if this makes me seem like an old stick in the mud but i wish it was actually just a remake. not a reimagining. ui and quality of life improvements... that's it. it was ff7 i fell in love with, not kingdom hearts busting through the door and dumping on your past. edit if the reddit community could just indulge me here and keep the upvotes at 7, that would be swell"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,i wonder the same thing too. my younger self might adored what he saw. i wasn't totally into ff then and it's gameplay and style wasn't a thing i took as much notice of as it was the first of it's ilk i'd ever played ff7 being the first ff game released in the uk. only thing i might have wondered is why is it multiple games? when the first was just one game on multiple discs.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"nah the remakes are a massive improvement in every possible way, and thats coming from someone who beat the original a countless number of times. if i wanted to play the same game again ill just play the original. the remakes do something new with the world and characters and its significantly better at explaining the unrealistic portions of the original game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,they still have them at both the gamestop's near me
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,i think its a pretty common experience for gamers in their 30s

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"it's funny, the 3d modeled pokemon games we get now are the kind of thing i dreamed of as a kid playing pokemon yellow, but because they happened gradually over time, there was never a point where it really felt like a big deal."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,its crazy how ahead of its time crysis was.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"exactly  i think every kid from the 90s00s thought of the general concept of pokemon go at some point. i mean even look at how popular it was when it first came out, and it still is 8 years later. as cool as some of the other games posted are, they mainly are because of their graphics, story, audio, etc. pokemon go would have been insane because of the concept. i still think its crazy!!"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,when you say red dead 1... are you talking about red dead revolver? that was the 1st red dead..... or are you referring to the first red dead redemption?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,i dont really play on anything currently  my out of date pcs power supplied pooped out on me. it could barely run rdr2. im glad its finally coming to pc though. 14 years late i plan on rebuilding since all my friends ive played with since rdr are currently pc players.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,"perfectly said. they've stretched the game so much to make it into 3 games... then instead of using any of that time to let the story breathe they turn every scene into a 2 hour chapter of the game complete with its own wacky cast, over the top caricatures of the og characters, and a boss fight. 2 screen mine from ff7? 2 hour dungeon crawl in rebirth. that's the best example of stretching. the worst is the shinra ship being turned from a tense undercover mission with a decent horror moment to a goddamn cruise ship with a card tournament."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"you realize you are getting that right? like this is a weird complaint given an actual 1 to 1 remake of the original ff7 is being made, and has already partly been released."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"man yall sound nuts, the remake is so much better"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,most stores walmarttarget have a switch demo still.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,dawww welp i'm excited for you for when you get a new build going. if it was within my power i'd help you with parts. love building pcs and to be fair rdr2 is hard to run on pc and to get running smoothly without beefy hardware. it's poorly optimized in my opinion. rockstar really shit the bed with rdr2 on pc. it's such a blurry mess unless you have a monster pc and the right settings
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,fuch rebirth. fuck part 3. fuck squenix. that card tournament bullshit was where i uninstalled the game and really wished i hadn't wasted 80 fucking quid on that shite.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"you mean what squenix are currently making? as they said not a reimagining. ui and quality of life improvements... that's it. to them, me and many others, the ff7 remakes are nothing like the original outside of characters name, locations and some story beats."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"back when revolver came out, i was the only kid in school that played it. i honestly loved revolver. it was a pretty great game. red dead 1 was better. red dead 2 is just simply one of those games that never gets old even with time. i'm on my 6th play thru of rd2."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"this is the hate they deserve. i'm hopeful to someday get a faithful remake with modern graphics that doesn't shit on the original. this turn squeenix shat is a bit like someone digging up your childhood pet, stapling it's remains to a robot dogpuppy."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-14,"no i mean exactly what i said, there is already a partly released 1 to 1 remake of the original game, that is just graphics updates with ui and quality of life improvements. that already exists. so this is a weird complaint to be upset about remake and rebirth because its not a thing that you already have. also id say the remakes are a lot like the originals. same characters its not just character names, theyre the same characters, just expanded and given more depth, its not just some story beats its literally every story beat which story beat from the original hasnt been covered that was covered in the original at this point in the story? i cant think of any, its the same atmosphere for locations, its the same conflict shinra is the bad guy company faction responsible for everything and standing in our heroes way, sephiroth is the big bad guy who the heroes have to stop from destroying the world, none of that has changed, same general character motivations, most of the same music just greatly enhanced and given more variety. like even with the new stuff, its still mostly the same as the original, just obviously with an expansion to everything and with new gameplay. but as i already said, if you just want prettier, refined, enhanced, original ff7 thats basically the same experience you have that, ff7r trilogy hasnt taken that from you."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"when people are talking about rdr2 and someone mentions red dead 1, hopefully you can use context clues. revolver is such a different game that you need to specify it if thats the one youre talking about. theyre basically the same franchise in name."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,i also detested 16. fucking stupud souls kaiju crap. only decent thing about that entire game was ralph ineson voicing cid. i'm angry now. i might have to go play some triple triad on 8 to calm down.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-15,"oh you mean the simple graphical upgrade which is the same game for modern systems, the hd remasters. okay, agreed there is that but it's not a 'remake'. what people expected was a game that looks like ff7rs, where you can wander around in 3rd person, like modern ff games but plays and has the story of ff7. i do understand your points but for everything you mention there are things missing or added that many fans just think but why? i will say that in reality, ff7r doesn't feel like a remake of ff7 but an expansion to the ff7 compilation. the pointless side story for jessie and that bouncer, sephiroth being everywhere, the meaningless leveling of weapons instead of buying or finding and equiping them, materia not having down sides like in the original. these things add up to being a vastly different game for many people. not saying ff7 takes anything away, what it doesn't offer is what was promised."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-16,"oh you mean the simple graphical upgrade which is the same game for modern systems, the hd remasters. okay, agreed there is that but it's not a 'remake'. yes, that's what you asked for. as they said not a reimagining. ui and quality of life improvements... that's it. that's what you characterized their desire as and agreed to wanting. that's what the ever crisis is. if your request is the original experience with enchanced graphics, new ui, and quality of life improvements, that's it as you put it, then ever crisis is that. what you're describing with what people expected was a game that looks like ff7rs, where you can wander around in 3rd person, like modern ff games but plays and has the story of ff7. is very different to that first request. likewise idk what you meant by plays like ff7. like has turn based combat? again you probably weren't gonna get that for kinda obvious reasons. for one thing the people making ff games make them as action rpgs not turn based anymore, for another thing that would not be popular enough to gain the wide approval with modern audiences and don't say baldur's gate 3 because bg3 has so much more in it than you could reasonably expect ff7r to have. i'd say they've done a masterful job taking the gameplay of ff7 og and adapting it to modern rpg gameplay. i do understand your points but for everything you mention there are things missing or added that many fans just think but why? i would counter, why not? you and i don't need the same things again, we already played through it ff7, we aren't gonna get that same experience again. likewise all the unnecessary fluff is almost all skippable, if you don't wanna fuck around with the side content you don't have to, it's all optional. and again i'd ask you, what's missing? again the story is the same, a player who never played the og ff7 is going to still experience the exact same things people who played og ff7 did on their first time, nothing has been skipped. i will say that in reality, ff7r doesn't feel like a remake of ff7 but an expansion to the ff7 compilation. i would agree with that. i just don't think that's a bad thing. this is absurdly more interesting of a direction to go than just doing a direct remake. we've seen direct remakes of beloved games come out, people enjoy them, but they lose relevance almost immediately because all the people who already played the original game have already experienced this, just experiencing it again but prettier isn't super compelling. i've never seen a community be more invested in a remake than the ff7 community with these, and that's specifically because they didn't just do the easy cash grab of a direct remake. not saying ff7 takes anything away, what it doesn't offer is what was promised. again, because something else is simultaneously giving you what you were promised. you're literally getting your cake and eating it too."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,i've seen some people post on here where they got the old display with the mount and signage too in their homes ha. they're cool when you're a kid but now as a parent im usually ready to get in and out instead my kids when younger would want to play the demos. now they already have the stuff so its not an issue.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"you know what, 12 and 15 were actually pretty decent. both had their flaws so did all the rest, but they were damned good games all the same. 13 can go fuck itself with a chef's knife yes, a doinky one and 14 was dull as dishwater."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,nostalgic af
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"i mean 14 is pretty popular for a reason. and let's face it, the 13 trilogy has its issues, many of them, yet they contain some of my favorite games of the series simply because they're so flawed. i like the world and story and the gameplay is pretty fun to me. it gets a lot of undeserved hate."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,the story will emotionally dick punch you
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,"i really enjoyed it, although it was tough to ignore the fact that you spent the whole game going 'omg the rats followed us and hurt innocent people.. let's go to another place with innocent people'"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,"it's an atier game from a visual and narrative perspective, which will be enough for some. personally i think the moment to moment gameplay isn't on the same level as the others you're comparing it with, but maybe that's because i'm not a big stealth game guy. still, i completed it in its entirety and am glad i did! i'd give it an 8.510 myself."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,"it is a great game, the environmental graphics are top tier."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,"amazing game, ending made me cry"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,it was my game of the year easily.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,wasnt expecting to fall in love with he first game. i was so close to kinda just turning it off and on first impression first 5 mins i kinda was meh but after the first 30 i was hooked. they really made so much of this game better in the sequel! cant wait for whats next for amicia and hugo! i kinda wanna see a new plague. birds?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,agreed. amazing game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,"good game, but bad pc performance pissed a lot of people off. have they fixed it yet ?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,i got bored after 3 hours. hopefully i'll get back to it one day.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,underrated forsure. amiciaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,"i honestly found the sequel to be annoying. like they were trying to force you to be depressed by rehashing the same points of contention over and over again. you think there's been some catharsisdevelopment in the characters, but then they're right back to square one. i knew how it was going to end about an hour into it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"part of me wants to play the first game, but at the same time, i am just never convinced enough. so much praise though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"i think the first plague tale was better from a gameplay perspective. you were doing a lot more in that game, this game has a lot more slow walkaround sections than the first. although i love the addition of the crossbow in requiem. i think the story is pretty good in both games but id still give the edge to the first one in that regard. requiem has better graphics obviously."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"i played innocence a couple of months ago. immediately bought requiem but was a bit fatigued of the gameplay. but this is a good reminder to go back and play that game again, the first one was amazing!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,neither elder ring nor god of war i liked. and this one however is a jewel for me. this saga is in my top of sagas.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,it was a pretty great game.....that ending was rough
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,very underrated series
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,"its just looked at differently because its not as famous as those other games you mentioned. but the game deserves its spot next to those games, as their equal. most beautiful story ive experienced."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"it's ok but the gameplay still feels a bit shallow to me. very beautiful graphics and good voice performances. but just like the first one, it couldn't hold my attention to the end because the gameplay wasn't interesting enough even though the story was good. i think i stopped 10 hours in."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,thanks for posting this. i really enjoyed innocense and i'm really looking forward to this.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,i see this all the timewhat do people use to determine what is appreciated vs under appreciated?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,nope. not for me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,"i'm 130 hours into the witcher 3 next gen update and about ready to move onto something else. i want to play this, but stepping down from 60 to 30 fps on ps5 is going to be brutal on me eyes!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,i will definitely check it out then
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"i just finished it. at certain times, it is a beautiful looking game. but usually like the screenshot pictured you are just walking, so you have no choice but to take in the beauty. i was kinda mixed on everything. good things and annoying things. i would still recommend it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,the graphic set up is gorgeous in my opinion. i have been eyeing this game for some time.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"eh im a fromsimp and gow was overrated, havent checked this out but only heard good things"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,what da rat doin
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,it's a shame they couldn't get some facial capture technology for the facial animations in the game. they looked especially rough in the first one. it kinda held back the performances of the cast from both which were really great. i was actually rooting for amicia's actress to win best performance in the game awards but that's because i haven't played gow ragnarok yet.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"i was playing the first on on game pass, and it left game pass before i could finish it. so now i have to buy the first one to finish it, but from what i've heard, it's an amazing play, and i've managed to avoid spoilers for the sequel so far, so maybe soon. i did love what i saw of the first one though, such a beautiful game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"good game, gameplay got very stale tough"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"nah its not under appreciated, it just couldnt compete with all those other titles at the same time. not saying i hate it, i thought it was at least an enjoyable experience, but failed to make me think about it when all those other games were options too. games of comparable but varying quality get released all the time. newer games only usually get good rep if they a. fill a gap in a release window somewhere in the year or b. release alongside a triple a game that is shit and so it gets everyone's focused and energy turned towards itself. take heart knowing people keep talking about the game so frequently, that its annoying when there are post claiming it wasnt appreciated when it clearly wasis."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"great game, finished it yesterday. weird that no youtuber that i watch talks about it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"i don't think it was underrated the story, graphics and voice acting were given heaps of praise. deservedly. it's just inherently silly to compare it to these huge budget epic games. elden ring is this massive combatheavy brutal rpg thing and has absolutely nothing in common with plague tale other than that they are both video games. what ragnarok has in common is the narrativeheavy aspect and the fact that you're playing as leader driven to protect a younger. so like last of us as well. but in terms of actual gameplay it's just nothing alike. horizon was never a serious contender for best of anything, i actually think that one got a little crapped on but that's a whole other story. i guess they're all 3rd person games, that's what they have in common? but so are like a third of all games so shrug"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-02,it would have been best if it supported 60fps..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"i always say this game spent the first half seeing how much emotional and psychological trauma it could inflict on the player, and the second half was seeing how much it could inflict on amicia as well"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,i'm playing it right now and can't help thinking i'm playing the bad guy!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-07,"i may be a psychopath, but i didn't feel anything about people dying, if anything i was glad that so many people died, most of the people on this game were evil garbage except for some people like the florist on the first town, the priest that helps you to run from the count's men during the procession, i felt more empathy for npcs on cyberpunk 2077 and they are all almost scum."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"i haven't played either game, but i notice so much more emphasis on story by players than anybody talking about gameplay outside of pvp games. wanna talk rpgs? never anybody talking about gameplay."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,i use a 3060 ti at 3440x1440 and i got a very consistent 60 fps on high settings on day 1. what were the issues?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,i have a 1080 with a ryzen 7 5800x and it ran really well for me and looked great at 1440p. i believe they have a resolution scaler built into the game that i was using as well.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"i tried it with a 1060 and 12 gb ram and it played like shit. i still have the 1060 but now have 32 gb ram and get 5070 fps on maybe mediumhigh settings motion blur, bloom, etc. off"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"i agree with you on this. it did look great, but they really tried to ram sentimentality down your throat to create an emotional ending, instead it just really annoyed me. i couldn't stand that high pitched whiner hugo from pretty early on."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,just try it. its a unique experience. i was getting bored of most aaa games feeling all the same. these two games were breath of fresh air.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"i was like you and skeptical as well. i only picked up the first game when it got a physical release on ps5 after the 2nd game was out. took me 3 or 4 days maybe and i gotta say i very much enjoyed my time with it. nothing groundbreaking but it's a good story, the stealth felt good if a tad repetitive, but yeah it was a good time. now i'm waiting for a discount to scoop up the 2nd one. give it a shot! oh also, i put the language in french because it's a french game. and the english voices annoyed me 3 minutes into it."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,"if you do, play the first game first a plague tale innocence."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"i always say this game spent the first half seeing how much emotional and psychological trauma it could inflict on the player i gave up on the endless hide and seek right at the start. no clear way forward, i lost interest."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"yeah, i'd say that the gameplay is fine but it heavily centers on puzzlesolving and stealth for the most part, which are not my cup of tea. so your mileage may vary. it's a very linear experience minus a few sections in the second game. i will say that there are some pretty unique elements to the gameplay that make it stand out  namely using the rats and the lighting system that makes for some interesting stealth. haven't played a game quite like it before. that said, while the games do build on their gameplay elements as they progress particularly the second one, it does start to feel like a bit of a samey grind in the final few hours. but the story is good enough that you'll likely want to play until the end, which is great! all in all, i'd recommend it to most gamers that like a good narrative experience. it's an experience i won't soon forget, even if i very likely wouldn't play it again."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,thank you i was unaware that there was a first game but i'll play that one first

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"closing the door on your stove will help reduce damage on your tv, it will also vastly improve the air quality."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,sometimes there isnt anywhere to place the tv! heat could be an issue but my fire place the mantel stays as cool as the rest of the room.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,happy trails
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"to each their own, but this looks like a terrible way to enjoy games. tv is way too high, too far, and the bright flame underneath is distracting. i would never place an expensive tv over a fireplace, let alone one that is burning, but that's just me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i love playing video games when its snowing outside with a nice cup of hot cocoa while wearing my pjs.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,so thats what god of war on an old ps4 looks like
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,guys that's not his fireplace it's his playstation burning its second booster getting into orbit.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,very brave to put a tv above a fireplace. i've seen some horror stories. looks distracting but still kinda cool to have a roaring fire while playing ragnarok.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,rtvoverfireplace hello. i would like to report a crime.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,don't own the console. want to play it though.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"just started this game last night, its so good!!!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,oh hey op just a heads up your tv isn't in an ideal location. just an fyi in case you didn't know. bad location because of heat and internet cowboys.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"just finished god of war ragnark yesterday, what a nice game. feels a lot like the previous part for obvious reasons, but the story carries on nicely"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,not the tv above the fireplace
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,im persistently bricked up playing it. absolute cert for goty
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,ill never understand tv above the fireplace
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,what kind of boxes are on the table? and why are they there?

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,your poor poor fireplace. covered up by a tv. total vibe killer. from mantel to mental.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"remember, the city must survi oh wait no that's a different frosty extra chilly very frosty dear god the temperature, gametm"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"personally knowing what i know about electricity and how heat can fry components, i have to wonder if that is even remotely good for the life of the tv? i mean, scientific advances occur all the time, but i know heat is an issue with my computer, and i've got to consider airflow when i'm putting it all together. i'm curious how being above a fire place, that generates heat in the whole roomhouse, doesn't damage the components? neat if it doesn't but.. i'd still be worried about it. flip side.. some day i need to play that game. lol its been on the list of games i want to play for years."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"thats a weird looking ps5, anyway the heat is the same."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,nice house dear kratos.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"hey, look at that. i ruined a very expensive tv just like that too!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"not only will the heat warp the tv over time, but the flame will also be distracting all the time."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,this picture makes me mad lol save your tv lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,adiosadios television
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,tv not above fireplace is like rule number 2 of placing a tv.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"heat is one of the biggest enemies of tv hardware, it kills the lifespan big time"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,boy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,oh god not only is your tv slowly melting but it also ruins the lighting.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,what a dummy. you never ever put a tv above a fireplace
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,looks good but won't the heat mess up the tv
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,how hot is it under that tv? that lip you put the tv in front of would protect the tv but it wouldnt be a good eye level
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,fimblewintur
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,your lunges will love it!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,im thoroughly enjoying ragnorak
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,why would you mount a tv right above a fireplace lol you're gonna be replacing that thing every year.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,this is not a vibe. this is a disaster in making
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,even the tv's gotta stay warm for fimbulwinter!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"before mounting my tv over a fireplace i did a whole lot of research and even checking temperatures with the fireplace full blast. i only ended up doing it because the mantle lowered the temp in the area the tv was by a lot. i recommend getting a cover for the top of the fireplace, below the tv. if it can push air outwards even better. from the research i did the tv will start to peel, or can even explode depending on what tv you have."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,is that a fireplace or is that what a ps5 looks like when you take the cooling flaps off?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i just got into the first norse one and have gotta say its definitely up there in my favorite games and it's not even one that i've played since the age of 6 it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,you have sinned
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,my relative is a god of war developer
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,are you the same fucker who made a post with the t.v in the same position to which damn near everyone exclaimed it wasn't a good place to keep it!? cause i swear this picture minus god of war ragnarok looks familiar.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i always worry about tvs installed like that. wont the heat effect the tv? shouldnt it be above then mantle?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"never understood why folks hang tvs anywhere but above the mantle of a fireplace. also, close the damn fireplace door before you slowly melt your tvs insides"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"why do people put their tv's over their fireplace? first, it's much too high, and bad for your neck, unless you're sitting way back. second, can't imagine the heat and random smoke is good for any electronics."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,fimbulwinter is here!!!!!!!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"people love saying that the tv is too high, me personally i think most peoples are too far away. at least for gaming."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,it looks too good to be true but i'm afraid it actually is.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,even if this was safe for the tv as you say it is it probably isnt it just looks awful. why would you have it in front of the mantle like this what a waste of a fireplace
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,yeaaaasssss
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,damn bro can i come over this is a godly living room
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"you need to move your fireplace down lower. it's currently too high and too close to the tv. is it possible to cut the floor around the fireplace and then lower the fireplace into the basement? you carrying it would be impossible, thought it could probably be done by two people."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i love how every poster is saying what ive been thinking

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,fuck that seems like a terrible place for a tv
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,"gotta move the tv over the mantle. the mantle will reduce the heat getting to it. get some tapcon masonry screws, they usually include the drill bit needed."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,hot setup
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,"well worth it for that shot, now you can put it back where it was."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,it amazes me how the storyline for this game has changed so much from its previous versions
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,op is a melt.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"for real, i'd highly recommend moving that tv op, you have a macbook and a candle situation here"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"i only opened the comments to offer my condolences to the tv. also, rtvtoohigh"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"looking at how grey those blacks are, that contrast, i wouldn't be that sad about that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"was just thinking this same thing. it's a wood fireplace, that isn't very deep, with no shelf over it to protect the tv. tv's going down."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,if i was rich i would literally buy a new tv every time just to complete that setup lol godamn
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,just like my tv
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i somehow feel it is deliberately done  the post for karma
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,agreed. im on the no tv over the fireplace team.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,imagine trying to focus on game with constant shimmering lights from the fire bellow.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"yeah, its dumb. my friend hung a 65 over his fireplace and its like stargazing trying to watch anything. oh, guess which tv he asked me to replace a bunch of caps in when it would no longer turn on."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,its actually bad for the tv. ive seen so many with heat damage from the fireplace.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i was going to say what a shocking place for the tv.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,you have passed the test... rtvtoohigh welcomes you
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"before tv was a thing, generally the fireplace was the center focus of a living room. so its become the traditional way to design living rooms but now people also want the tv in that central position as well, instead of awkwardly offsetting the furniture to be focused on a tv in the corner and a fireplace. its just convenient. i personally hate high tvs but sometimes a room isnt flexible"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"its actually a home styling nono to put a tv above a fireplace. two reasons i know of are that the fireplace mantle is often too tall for a proper television viewing perspective. also, you should be admiring the fire, not a screen."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,most older homes are designed with the fireplace to be the central focus point of a room. some people have really no other option other than to mount over the fireplace.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i think it was customary to put paintings over a fireplace but that just evolved into t v's
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"my company installs tvs professionally and usually do our best to not install them over fireplaces. the mantle is too high for proper viewing angles unless your 1214 feet away we generally only install over a fireplace if theres a nice chunky mantle made of stone or such to protect the tv, the one in ops post has the mantle but the tvs mounted belowin front of it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,it's how you get the wife to be okay with regular tv upgrades. you put it above the fireplace so the heat will ruin it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"at least in my living room, the fireplace is on the only wall wide enough to support a tv so there's not much choice. even if you have another wall big enough, you're stuck deciding on whether to face seating towards the tv or fireplace so it can make for a weird layout to have them on separate walls."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,it's something that people who aren't tech savy do because they think it looks good. all i'm imagining is all that heat fucking with the tv. people forget that electronics need to breathe as well
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,because i like toasty feetsies and the mantle is a perfect fit. although mine is electric.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,most fireplaces in homes leave a large raised raised area where the chimney is in the wall sometimes covered by plaster sometimes not. i don't think it's a motif so much as you have a raised area in an accentuated forward facing area of usually a living room where you have open wall space above. what're you gonna put their crossed swords? or more reasonably for most in a living room a tv
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,the soot coming from the fire place wouldn't be for any electronic plus it'll get in the screen making it look worse.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,it's niot really the heat that will cause the damage but the smoke will. ask any smoker how long their tv sets live for
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"just the best placement for the room, really"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,it does lower tv lifespans.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"lack of other places, in my opinion. a lot of people dont have dedicated media rooms. throw a couch and bookshelf in most rooms and what you have left is space above a fireplace."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"in many houses, above the fire place is the only place for a tv. for example, my living room is in a corner of the house, so between windows and radiators the options are either put the tv over the fire place or put the couch in front of the fire place. not wanting to burn the house down, we chose the former."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"a lot of it is just like, due to the layout of the room. but it conveniently stacks features. you already have this mostly unusable wall you often want to look at to feel cozy. why not also make it the wall you stare at the most because the entertainment is there too?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,many houses are designed in a way where it's the only place that works
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i think usually it's thst people want a fireplace and the best spot also happens to be the best spot to have a tv. so you kind of have to have the tv over the fireplace or shit just doesn't work. personally i find it annoying because the tv ends up too high. what op did here makes me feel like the tv is gonna overheat lol.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"probably has to do with space conservation and the decorator never having played a game on a tv screen in their lives. cause if they had, they'd know better."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,its the perfect way to take attention away from your fire place while ruining your tv with heat damage. the perfect two birds with one stone play.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,at least its only half way over the fireplace. however now heat on the display is something i would worry about.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i am suprised you do not ruin your tv by the excessive heat coming out of it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,its the worst place for a tv.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"my opinion here, but a lot of older houses before tvs were around were designedlaid out in such a way that there aren't any good wallsplaces to put a t.v. these homes were typically designed where the fireplace was the focal point. in these instances having a tv in front ofover the fireplace is the only option in these types of rooms. but what do i know, just a stranger on the internet!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,the heat and smoke makes the tv work better .
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,and a perfectly good fire
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,first time i've ever seen a tv that rtvtoohigh would disagree with
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"im guessing because they hate the tv. heat rises, yall. that is a spectacular way to melt components of your tv and shorten its life."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,yep
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,its a terrible idea
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"i have mine a couple feet above a wide mantle  did some heat checks with a temp gun with fireplace on and fireplace off. no discernible difference in temp around or on tv with fireplace on versus any other point at the same height in the room. its a decent size room, though, and has good airflow, both of which im sure contribute to the heat diffusion. edit to answer why there its the best available wall space given windows, lighting, and space for seating."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,they like to keep buying a new tv set every once in a while...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,my tv is over my fireplace cuz it was really the best place to view the tv but im in az and we have never used the fire place once and never will lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"exactly, the tv produces heat by itself, and yet people have a roaring fire and place the tv above fireplaces! and you know that heat is going to hit that tv screen at a high temperature, it's sitting in the perfect spot for melting."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"tv too high, too big for the size of the room, covering a mantle? need, a bigger room or a smaller tv in the corner instead."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"my guess is that since the fireplace is the center of attention in the living room, you wouldnt want to put the tv on a different place that would compete with the fireplace. imo the better question is why do people put a fireplace in a small living room? there is not enough space for both a fireplace and a tv to fit in a way that makes sense."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,"in my case, my toddler was dangerously close to pushing it over all the time. the fire never gets turned on anyways in my house though so it's a win win situation."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,along with the fan for the fireplace to heat the room it sounds like a jet hanger in there
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,fireplace is usually closed with the fan on to pump the hot air straight out into the room. max temp around the tv has never been higher than 85
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,s only correct comment. bright lightsource basically trashes the quality of the tv based on how eyes will adjust and perceive detail and contrast. literally the worst place for tv.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,aw fuck what a missed opportunity
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"trust me it isn't. chimney's surprisingly enough are built to handle a lot of heat so the wall won't even be warm, let alone hot enough to damage a tv"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i came looking for this
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"when the fires really rolling, i close the doors on it and turn the fan on to heat the room. i open it back up once the fires died down a little and its not so distracting"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,op and a community of other people would beg to differ
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"nope, never had any problems with it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,never had a problem with it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,every time
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,it does not
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,its fantastic. ill be there for hours and not notice
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,it just doesnt. its a cast iron furnace and the heat is pretty well insulated and gets dispersed through the room by an internal fan so the heat doesnt just go straight up
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,its held into that mantle by six 9 screws in place of the 3 ones they give you with the mount. its not going anywhere
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,duuuuuuude i havent finished yettttt
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"hah, most underrated comment so far"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,if another one of my posts gets stolen and posted to facebook..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,probably shouldnt have posted it on the internet if he wasnt looking for a lecture. especially reddit.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"its bearable on ps4. if youve never played ps5 or watched any gameplay videos like me, youd hardly regret not playing it on ps5"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,tv above fireplace is far worse imo
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,fortnite is goty if it was released in 2022 tbh.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,who asked?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,what?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,not pictured the whole right side where my puppy destroyed it yesterday lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,so it is fitting or its not fitting?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"its an ottoman with 4 storage compartments and the tops are cushioned on the reverse side. thanks to the puppy, theyre all table space at this point"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,its been there for two years and still works like the day i got it. i think it was warmer in this room in july than it ever will be with the fireplace rolling.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,grunts hmmm
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,bring some coors light and we goooooood
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,move the fireplace if moving the tv is too much hussle
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,idk i feel like the tv is actually at a good eye level
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,rtvjustright
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,chances are they set the brightness higher than normal. i know people who when the set up screen comes on they jack that shit all the way to the right and the side that the logo is supposed to be barely visible in is clear as day. they do this because they hate how games hide things in shadows and i want to 100 the game on my first play through and dont want to miss something
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,you're a good sport
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"ahah, a sensible chuckle."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,nice and toasty.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,"youre probably just trying to max the specs the gpu by melting it, nvidia factory style?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"agreed, i don't have a fireplace"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i'd really rather not have a tv in living room at all to be honest. but i've always been lucky to have a room to use as the tv room.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,not to mention the effect it has on the tv itself
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,hows that different than all the rgb people use these days?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"i could never. my eyes have gotten a little worse over time, i used to have all these rainbow lights all over my room and in my pc but now it's just way too distracting lol i use a desk lamp with all rgb off now"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,why do you let your friend have a tv over his fireplace?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"depends on the setup. idk about wood, but i sold gas fireplaces for a while. you could get a passive vent system that draws heat away from the wall but still pushes it into the room. our largest fireplace in store was on full blast 8 hours a day everyday for years, tv was totally fine."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,especially since it is such a large tv. it just completely dominates that space.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,well you don't want him to put it any lower...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"let me add a few more for you, heat is generally not a good thing for electronics and wiring. heat rises it is difficult to run additional wiring as you probably dont want to drill through the brick. wires also require being much longer as it is harder to place cable boxes and receivers. good luck keeping those shitty components cooled as well."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,having both going at the same time is the weirdest part.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,this is my issue. our house has no other options to put the tv in our living room except above the fireplace. were probably going to do something similar to op and put up one of those pull down mounts. honestly the only option for us unfortunately
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"if a home is big enough to have a living space that big that a large tv will fit over a fireplace, there is likely another room in the house that is big enough to be a social television space."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,"nope. you can mount flat tvs anywhere. like a picture. if you have walls, you have a place to mount."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"you know those beds you see in crappy comedys that are like a circle, and they rotate? you think they make a couch like that? because that would fix your problem on how to face the seating...."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"it looked kinda cool on mtv cribs 20 years ago, so somehow some people still do it without really thinking about it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,best placement for killing your tv yes
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,best place to melt the components of your tv and shorten its life
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"there's also oils in the ash that will discolor and destroy the tv if you ever use the fireplace. smoke damage is a thing, and you have to let smoke into the room every time you load wood into it. dumb af to put a tv there."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,please. the newest nvidia graphics cards have melting as a feature. op is a performance wizard.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"i mean that is the safest way to do it  except for your neck. i hate looking up at my tv, but if its the only place to put it, its a hard problem to solve its funny how many people here are saying why put the tv there! there is no other place to put mine either, its an open floor plan the fireplace wall is the only one without a window or doorway, basically designed so the furniture naturally faces that way too. i dont even use my fireplace right now since its fugly and im pretty sure lined with asbestos so the tv is sitting in front of it. im looking at converting it to a gas and remodeling it in general, but i dont like any options for the tv. someone here just suggested a pull down mount, maybe thats an option"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,smoke damage
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i've visited arizona. it's crazy someone would build a house with a fireplace when you can just step outside.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,smaller tv you crazy thats joke but still that tv is perfect size for that room
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"sure but my guess is most people dont put it there, they buy a house that just had it there. when my house was built tv was a new invention, so the fireplace was the center of the family room"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,what are you burning then? cardboard?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,holy shit you have hurt peoples feelings about this.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,the door is open.....
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,there's a community of stupid people?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"really, thought it might get hot from the fire"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"my man! no problems, then. i'd watch you play while drinking your liquor any day!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,i could stand here and watch tv for hours
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"grats, i wanted to do this but couldn't get the heatdistance ratio right for the size tv i wanted lol"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i guess. i havepc though so i'd like thebump up in quality and fps. u less you still don't get much on the ps5.. also why am i getting down voted. lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,nvm its roblox or genshit impact.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,nobody. the real questions is who asked for your useless input?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,bro i think we might even have the same rug and we have light hardwood floors too .
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"yes, that's why they want it back. but i say, you can keep it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,cool  er.. yeah. lol pun.. er.. sorta not intended till i noticed it?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,this is likely easier
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,you know after i wrote that i looked at it again and it is lower than i remember seeing. which just makes the fire so much closer
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,it is super low for a tv mounted above a fireplace. ive legit never seen someone mount the tv where it hangs a foot below the mantle
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"so, i dont crank it insanely high, but i play a lot of horror games and i will say i set it a little higher on some modern ones. why? because developers seem to be obsessed with this idea that dark  scary. its not scary, i just cant fucking see"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"i used to do that before i got intio qledoled tv's and monitors, if the blacks are gonna look like shit i might as well see everything. downside of oled is you can't go back to lcd."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"i'll say in his defense, dunno about ragnarok but god of war 2018 was dark as shit for me on my lg c8. i had a hard time tweaking settings in a way that let me see in dark caves without blowing out the light scenes. upgrading to a c2 which is brighter fixed that though. not sure if that's a problem on lcds like this."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-03,"yeah, i figure overclocking the tv might improve the aspect ratio?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,any place can be a fireplace! i believe in you!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i lived in a place that had a fake fire place. i still didnt put the tv above it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i was thinking the same thing. surely thay will fry the tv over time. i guess that's not a concern of his. based on ambiance.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"at that point, image on tv might start shimmering too."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,electricity  water   electricity  fire
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,shoutout my dad starting a fire inside once and melting their soundbar nearly in half
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"yep it's not, my dad did this same thing with his 75 samsung led backlit and most of the bottom middle of the tv color shifts to pink and has crazy light bleed on that same spot right where most of the heat hits after half a year."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,im no television expert but i think the heat can start to delaminate the screen. giving it that bubble look
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i had an incense burner under my tv and the heat melted the plastic over time and destroyed the front button pcb. i can imagine what a fireplace would do.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,they've also ruined a pretty nice looking fireplace
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,not even a mantle to block some of the heat.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i've yet to see rbg screens tbf
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,its not on fire
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,because hes an adult capable of ignoring me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,you probably owe your friends a solid thanks.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,simple solution to the energy crisis? the big 6 hate this 1 trick
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,yeah who wants the room to be a comfortable temperature when the tv is on?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"pull down mount is solid! out of the way when you don't need it, but in the right position when it's time to watch something. they are a bit of an ordeal to install but i did one and thought it was completely worth it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"thats not a bad idea. who wants a fire and tv at the same time? i wonder if there are automated motorized pull down mounts. my current old fireplace is an ugly pos so we just have the tv in front of it. i was looking at replacing it with something that would not generate more than 100f above the mantle, but maybe lowering the tv into position would be even better. i hate looking up at a tv"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,ive been looking at houses for two years. a lot of the older homes ive seen dont have the space youre assuming they have. living room layouts are weird in some of these older homes. the house we finally bought has little to no space for a living room set. to get a decent amount of seats wed have to mount once the fire place
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,sure. you can mount anywhere. but it can reduce the amount of good viewing angles you got by doing that.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"i am what they call an idea man. they dont say if those ideas are good or bad, but they are ideas."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"depends on the setup. i don't know about wood fireplaces, but i used to work for a store that did a whole lot of gas fireplaces. it's true that the largest ones would often heat up the wall a fair bit, but you could add a special vent kit that would draw the heat back from the wall, then vent it elsewhere above the tv so it could still disperse in the room, out the sides, or out back into a different room entirely if you want. to prove that it works, we'd keep our largest fireplace on 8 hours a day everyday for years, with a tv right above it. tv was always perfectly cool and worked fine. you could still feel plenty of warmth standing in front of the fireplace, too."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,doesn't a fireplace stop ash and oil from rising out of the fireplace and into your home? i thought that was the whole point of a chimney and all that
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"mines a gas fireplace, so if any smoke were coming back into the house, id have a serious safety issue. you shouldnt have smoke coming in regardless of type, though, unless you forget to open the flue or something, since that could indicate ventilation issues with your chimney."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,and? it's not radiating straight upwards and solely onto the tv. 80 of the heat from an open fire goes to waste up the chimney. it's fine.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"im surprised you think there isnt lol, stupid people love to get together and justify their stupidity"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"yeah ive heard that before, but its never been an issue"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,funny thing is i only have grand marnier and lunazul in the house. actually just lunazul.. i finished the grandma
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i love parties! but im also realistic.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,how wrong i was. its obviously pokemon scarletviolet on the switch gameplay 1010
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,ask yourself maybe.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,did we just become best friends??
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,op was obviously considering this dilemma when installing the tv. to be roasted on rtvtoohigh is a punishment worse than death itself. op decided to roast his tv instead.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,yea lol either way its questionable placement
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,right looks like he mounted it directly to the mantle . it should really be above so it deflects the heat .
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,if the game relies on jump scares dark can help. but yeah dark doesn't  scary by default
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,the snowy landscape and dark caves means you'll either be blinded or in total darkness. the game is amazing but i am not a fan of my flashlight on my character's hip.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,you're right. i'm going to punch a hole in my microwave and cook a log on high for 5 hrs. then i can set my tv on the stove
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,physical childlike pot toothbrush knee marvelous bright cake jar encouraging
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,smoke too
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,haha classic dad
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,bro i need the rest of that story
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i work at a internet  cable provider and your dad is one of the people who call me and tell me it cant be the tv! its only a year old ! people are great
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"television expert can't answer it, you need an expert on the heat in that room. op and fam is the only one of those."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,excellent point. thats what the rtx4090 is for.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,"yeah because tiny wood burning fireplaces are usually the main and only source of heat in modern homes  if that fireplace is significantly heating the whole room that tv is toast in days, not years."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,"no, it doesn't. that's why there's a discolored spot above every functional wood fireplace in the world. when you open the door to load wood smoke comes out."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"there are pressure changes that sometimes cause smoke to rarely come in and a lot of times its low and you cant see it, gas much lower propensity but id still mess up my neck it being up that high regardless"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,negative internet points it seems
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"fuck em, you enjoy it how you like it. i personally think k it looks cozy af, might damage the electrical components of the tv, but life is short and new tech comes out fast so who cares  reddit aparently."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"riiiight, i assume you speak from professional experience."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"just keep an eye on it, i had a tv screen warp and crack after having it above a fireplace. the switch from hot to cold many times over time did damage that i didnt notice til it went"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,youll slowly melt any solder joints in the tv over time. youll be wondering why your tv only last 5 years vs other peoples that would last 1015. it looks great placement wise but you will pay the price for having it in that location. thats why if most people put the tv above the fire place it goes above the mantle piece. they dont hang the tv from the mantle piece which is a first for me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,how kid felt after commenting these two comments
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i think the other redditor is your puppy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,yeah for sure
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"it's likely a mount that comes out and down so the tv hangs overin front of the mantle when in use, and above when not in use."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,some games do it right and other games have me constantly colliding with random shit in the environment i couldnt see lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"i think if there is a hole in your microwave, you'll definitely be cooking more than a log."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"just put some metal in there with something flamable, no need to punch a hole in it just let it melt a hole for you."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"he has a mantle, look closer... he's mounted the tv to it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,"i was home during the holidays last year and he started up a fire. they have their tv on a mantle way higher up and the sound bar they had received as a present that same christmas mounted 6 inches above the fireplace and he started up a fire, i had noticed a slight sag in the sound bar but didnt think much of it because it wasnt too noticeable at that point. but then like 15 minutes later the sound start getting spottycrackly and couldnt tell why but look a little closer and the thing was about to come apart at the right bracket lol. surprisingly it works just the same now, it just needed to cool off for awhile. so no more fires inside lmao"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"had a 51 plasma sitting over the fireplace in my mum's house for like 10 years, never hurt it. it's the most central point of the room slap bang in front of the sofa. people just get on the hate train over stupid stuff nowadays. as for the heat, if you felt the brickwork on the chimney it wasn't even warm, so there was no way it was doing the tv any harm."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"i speak from experience of living in a home with an open fireplace for 26 years, 10 of which had a plasma tv mounted directly onto the chimney with absolutely 0 negative effect..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"will do, thanks!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,probably mantlemount. its designed to be able to pull down the tv below the mantle. i was looking on getting one myself. but i dont have the room
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,you're right. those glass shards could pose some sort of danger
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,lol yes i know. but should have a mantle between the fireplace and the tv

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,ragnarok is a ps5 game lol how did it define the older console
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"top 4 is a big toss up and every body's list is going to vary based on tastes. if you do a top 10 and list only exclusives, you've basically covered the vast majority of top 4 lists. in no particular order 1 god of war 2 the last of us part 2 3 uncharted 4 4 horizon zero dawn 5 bloodborne 6 spiderman 7 final fantasy 7 remake 8 ghost of tsushima 9 death stranding 10 the last guardian"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,horizon zero dawn and ffvii remake
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,how the fuck is bloodborne not on this list. it's the biggest reason to buy a ps4. go to your room and think about what you've done.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,downvote all you want but ragnark was pinnacle mediocre storytelling. my biggest disappointment in gaming.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,also for ps4 how is last of us 2 not on here

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,i got a ps4 when ghost of tsushima came out. knowing it was going to be the last ps4 exclusive i felt it was appropriate to finally get a ps4 and start collecting that generation of games i missed out on.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,omg yes rdr2
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,ragnarok and rd2 don't belong on this list.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,one game that defined ps for me bloodbourne. its not trying to be a cinematic movie. its a game and its fun to play.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"lol i thought these were all on ps3 as well. ps4 defined literally zero for me. i will always refer to the ps4, as the 'dark ages or the 'lost era'"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"are you referring to the bloodborne box? everything else was kind of just okay. no offense, but you have the 'basic' taste on par with a white girl ordering a pumpkin spice latte i guess red dead 2 and persona 5 we're kind of neat, but nothing that blew my socks off on ps4 besides bb. honestly, crash team racing is a better game than most of what you listed it feels like for every mediocre game i played on my ps4, there was a handful of great pc releases. i'm probably not going to be buying any consoles going forward since my switch is already good for house party games"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"my comparatively recent journey with my ps4 gave me those four games i've played the most on it  monster hunter world 2020  uncharted 4 2020  persona 5 royal 2023  persona 5 strikers 2023 x200b my favorite game from that era is horizon zero dawn, but i've played it on pc."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,i think rdr2 is what defined any console gamer
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,i like your post.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"mine is by rank ghost of tsushima, horizon zero dawn, days gone, last of us part 2."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,rdr2 was cross platform. replace that with horizon zero dawn and this is fine.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i wouldnt say rdr2 since its multiplat, i played it on an xbox. mine would be bloodborne ofc and tlou 1, gow 2018 and spiderman 2018 id say were much more impactful and defining than their sequels."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,mine are spiderman ghost of tsushima uncharted 4 gta 5
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"for me its these four. rdr2 literally just a masterpiece of a game. great story, characters, setting, and everything bloodborne my first soulsborne game, the first one i actually completed too. the setting and atmosphere still gets me to this day. gow 2018 great game, the story was great, gameplay was fun. father son bonding was great. marvels spiderman probably some of the best, most fun, smooth, and fluid movement ive ever seen in a video game. plus its just the most definitive spiderman experience anyone could have at the time. still is tbh."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,uncharted ghost of tsushima  rdr2  spiderman
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"no uncharted, what a shame, those games are gold"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,bloodborneeeee x200b where nextgen update and pc port?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,now that is a hot take
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"so you only play games made by western studios. branch out, man. some amazing games coming out of japan."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,and what defined ps5 so far? for me itself aw2.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,i never owned any playstation  would you recommend to get a 4 now ? the new one is too expensive for me
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"lol interesting, didnt know any of these or play them once i read it glad that games have such a wide variety"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,infamous second son for me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"tlou, gow, hzd, fifa"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"gow 2018, horizon zero dawn, spiderman, fourth one is harder ff7r? shadow of mordor? idk."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,can you play these on pc?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,those defined gtx 1050ti 2gb for me
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,as someone who never owned a ps4 i see this as a partial loss
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"but ragnarock is ps5 game no? i mean you can play it on ps4 too but its kinda odd that it defines the previous generation, not the main one on which it was released"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"in my case was god of war, spiderman, mortal kombat 11 and fortnite"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"bloodborne is the only game i own for my ps4, and i will never ever buy another console. bloodborne is the pure reason to own this console"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i bought a ps4 in covid just to experience some of the games i've missed out. gow, spiderman, ghost of tsushima were just incredible. the feels and just pure quality was breath taking, and got me through some tough times uncharted however is overrated ass though in my opinion. puzzles? nah just fight waves of enemies on repeat"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,god of war ragnarok defined what it's like to be treated like a severe moron by a game for the first time in my life.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"ghost of tsushima, bloodborne and helldivers those are the real banger exclusives."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,why would rdr define playstation? it was on other platforms
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"bloodborne, ghost of tsushima, dark souls 3, and rdr2"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,ghost of tsushima was the final sendoff for ps4. thats definitely gotta be up there. for me it probably replaces u4 because ive never played those games
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"ghost of tsushima, god of war, spiderman1, bloodborne"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,op do you know what games are good? the most well known and highly rated games. give me upvotes edit excellent photo captures

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,ghost of tsushima is a goddamn masterpiece
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"god of war ragnarok ps4? i think you might be a little late for that, just because it released on ps4 it doesnt mean it was a ps4 era game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,my aging ps4 now only exists as a bloodborne machine
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,replace red dead 2 with bloodborne and i'd agree.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,what makes you think anyone cares?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,but rdr2 isn't a ps exclusive ?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,id change god of war for bloodborne personally and change uncharted for ghost of tsushima or death stranding
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"for me it was spiderman miles morales, the last of us ii, rdr2, and fallout 4 with the last being definitive in a bad way, in that it showed off the limitations of playstation as compared to xbox and pc"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i'd replace uncharted and rdr with bloodborne and ghost of tsushima personally, i never really cared for uncharted and i played both rdr games on xbox."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,would it be more playstation if its only playstation exclusive though?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,how old are you pony's? i was thinking people would like at least link games from the original playstation or even even ps2 cuz that's when the games really define the console what would come in the future. for playstation growing up it was a metal gear solid siphon filter tony hawk pro skater and final fantasy. linking these new age games that everyone has. psa i haven't bought a console in two decades pcmr
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,i literally purchased my ps4 just to play uncharted 4. got bored with many of the other games midway and it's lying in a corner now collecting dust.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,i wanted to enjoy spider man games so bad. truth be told though they are no where near as good as the arkham games. second truth be told both are button mashers. lol but yeah spiderman games are really boring imo.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,i literally have the same uncharted screenshot but in blue
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,didn't know that rdr2 was a ps exclusive
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,ghost of tsushima and horizon zero dawn were also fantastic.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,i just decided to play hzd because of my ps plus extra

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,for me bloodborne was massive in getting me into playstation and it's exclusive as well as from software game

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"same. i bought the ps4 to play bloodborne. ive since played rdr2, tlou, gtav and some other games, but it would have been worth it only for bloodborne. what a masterpiece that is."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,i thought ragnarok was just okay. 2018 was so much better. revisiting the same world with a rushed story and poor pacing didnt do it for me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,how is it more of a ps5 game. its a ps4 and ps5 game equally. i mean ps5 upgrades are the equivalent of the remasters that we got during gen 7 to gen 8. nothing makes it exclusively more of a ps4 game or more of a ps5 game. its a cross gen game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"in my opinion, ragnarok completed what 2018 started. and also i believe that it is a ps4 game that runs beautifully on ps5 at 120fps"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i think the op is talking about their experience, not defining the platform based just on exclusive titles. when they think back in 10 years on the ps4, these are the games they played and stood out the most."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,maybe because he played in ps4m the point of the post is to show what games made him love the ps4?

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,rift apart is one of my fav ps5 games. the remake from 2016 was just fine imo. i had never played the old ones but rift apart definitely makes it easy me to become a new fan. i just dont think a game like that has staying power when compared to some of the other franchises. still an incredible game and historic playstation franchise that deserves the respect
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i agree, but im also glad that insomniac themselves havent become any less relevant. i miss the ps2 era rc games but its hard to complain when we also have spiderman now"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i bought it cuz i was sure i would like it but bounced off it super hard, even resold it to gamestop. i just couldnt get it out of my mind, though, so i watched a letsplay just to see what i was missing. it was like something clicked. i rebought the game and just tore through it  it was exciting but horrifying, empowering but so challenging. i just needed a little basic example how to start leveling up, how to parry, etc to really get hooked. if youve seen a few installments of a letsplay and it still does nothing for you, thats fine. but maybe look up a video. after all, it went from a game i returned to my first platinum"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"it didn't click for me until this year when i played armored core 6, cause i was always trying to play bloodborne like dark souls or demons souls, which is nearly the opposite of the intended playstyle. ended up going back and beating it after ac6"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"same, played and completed it earlier this year and just found it meh. did another run through of elden ring and fully enjoyed that. sad bloodborne didnt click after hearing so much about it but it is what it is"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"respect the opinion but i think i have to disagree. the map completely changed, added more areas, gave us like 5 new worlds to explore and added more boss fights. story seemed to fit the ending they were going for but yeah maybe a tad rushed and not as fulfilling as 2018 but still pretty epic. not to mention the brok storyline in rag is one of the best ever told but you had to stick around until the end to get that. i will concede the pacing was definitely worse in rag with atreus, i cut my new game  in jotenheim for this reason. so yes, 2018 definitely better, but not by as much as you think in my opinion"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"agreed, rag was hot garbo compared to 2018."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,is it really a ps4defining game if it released during the ps5 era tho?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,bros salty he couldn't play spiderman 2.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"it ran on ps4 at a solid 10fps. yes, its on ps4 but its barely playable let alone enjoyed"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"true, if it came to ps4 it counts."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"well obviously, its the sequel lol nah, its a ps5 game that also released on ps4"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,by this logic it's a ps2 game lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i don't know why you're getting shitted on like crazy. the post says 4 games that define ps4 for me but people wanna put their 2 cents in. ragnarok was actually the final ps4 exclusive to be released if i remember correctly, which should be considered a ps4 milestone. but everyone has their own opinion on what 4 games make up their core ps4 games i guess"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"the directors of the game wanted it to always be a ps5 game but made it for ps4 as well because of the counsel shortage. they even said having to make it for ps4 limited them on what they wanted to do. so while yes, it was a ps4 game it was always meant to be made and played on a ps5."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"don't understand the downvotes, first of all this is your opinion and you marked it as such. secondly, as much as i love gowr, it really is a ps4 game that was enhanced really well for ps5, which probably will be more apparentl when we see an actual ps5 exclusive title from santa monica. and for the record, personally i would also go for gow2018 in my list of games that defined my ps4 experience, but i see nothing wrong with your take anyway"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,removed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"lmfao people really are arguing over this, i would say it's more of p5 game because it just got released during ps5 gen, but ofc it's not ps5 game per se like burning shores dlc or spider male 2, but your opinion is also perfectly acceptable as it plays up to par on ps4"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,you are just missing out. also it was the pony boy for the ps5 for a long time with bundles and commercials and shit. most people are going to define it as a ps5 game despite its ps4 roots
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,it absolutely does not run at 120fps on a ps4
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"personally, none of these games would break the top ten ps titles i like."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,ghost of tsushima was great we need a 2nd one
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,i preferred spiderman marginally
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,are you serious? sm is so much better in every way than got. ghost is just a really well polished assassins creed clone set in japan. its super forgettable.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"at this point idc about a pc port, i'd be fine with just a simple ps5 remaster"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,you plaugeridden rat!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,arguably the best ps exclusive in the past decade but sure do go off
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i think the only 2 fitting a spooderman and uncharted, because at least those were ps4 exclusive titles at launch the other two? one launched on ps5 mainly, the other is multiplatform"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"if a gow sequel is coming, then ragnarok will release on pc.. because that's their strategy for ps5 marketing"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,no one is talking about pc bro. a lot of people only have one console cute i offended the pc idiots.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"uncharted was ps exclusive at launch, as was sm. rdr2 doesnt belong here, but also thats cause its an exceedingly mediocr game with spectacular graphics and a decent story."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,who talked about xbox ?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"final fantasy 16 and spiderman 2 certainly appealed to more people than resident evil 4, at least if you look at it purely in terms of the playstation 5. apart from that, sony hasn't really offered much in the exclusives area this year. hopefully that will change next year."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,you summed up xbox in that edit tho?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,not a single sony exclusive????
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,yeah i know that. the ps5 was out. it did not define the ps4 when it came out 9 years after the console lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,ah. don't remember that bit
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-14,"true, tlou was really cool when it came out"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,they look outstanding
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-14,it is but it doesn't define playstation
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,you should really try dark souls 3 and elden ring
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,funny im the complete opposite. finished every one except bloodborne
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"funny... i got your point, but i didn't feel like that. i felt like some enemies were so overpowered that i felt it was unfair at some points. it's my favorite in aesthetics and combat mechanics, but the game left me exhausted...more than sekiro, which is way harder, but i managed to finish."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-14,"huh? bloodborne was the first souls game that you actually did have to get good for. they took out blocking, so everyone who learned dark souls the easy way like me had to learn how to parry. they also took out sniping with bows and magic so you couldnt just stand far away and kill everything. you should really try those games, dude. the only other actually hard one is sekiro because it also doesnt have shield blocking."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,right????
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-14,"that's the thing, i don't like farming, and i don't like shortcuts to defeat a boss....so i try it again, and again, and again, and fail, fail and fail....i feel like if i were to get a shortcut, like watching an youtube video where the guy is like stand here, in this square, and just swing your sword i would be cheating, in some way.... because it's the i did it! feeling, that makes it worth it. there are a lot of ways to play a fs game, and sadly, if it get's easy, i don't feel accomplishment...makes sense?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,i played elden ring for 80 hours and got bored and never touched it again. i liked sekiro but it was too hard.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i trick is i hated it. i paid full price, lost 10 then the guy i sold it to hated it and sold it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"yeah the enemy variety really made me enjoy playing the game. i was so sick of fighting the same mini bosses and enemies constantly in gow 2018. i think by the 3rd troll i was already thinking okay theyve used this guy 3 times already, are they going to introduce some new mini bosses soon? then i found out the only other mini bosses were the trolls, ancients, and valkyries. im not even sure how many different minibosses were in ragnarok, but it was definitely a lot more than 3. i also felt like combat was a bit better in my opinion. my only complaint with the game was that i wish we couldve spent a bit more time experiencing ragnarok instead of other sections like ironwood. i personally enjoyed ragnarok a lot more than gow 2018, but i know its pretty divisive and that everyones opinions are valid."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,yea its still a ps4 defining game its literally released on the ps4. hardware from 2013 still getting this game in 2021.would you consider it a ps5 defining game? i dont see why it matters if it came out in gen9 when its still running on gen 8 hardware. its a cross gen title if its running on the ps4 and still showing what the ps4 can accomplish 9 years after release then arent you arguing semantics its not black and white. its a transition period i guess the question is do you consider this a game made for the ps5 then downported for the ps4 or a ps4 game upgraded for the ps5.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,who?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"httpswww.ign.comarticlesgodofwarragnarokperformanceanalysis the ps4 story is simple  a locked 30fps. i could only find a handful of stutters when moving between sector loading points or cutscene shifts. in action the game is all but locked at 30fps and thus it feels very consistent and smooth, with this version really being the baseline for the team's aims from the get go and the fps readout backs that up. a simply stunning display of performance meaning all ps4 owners can enjoy the game without worries of it looking or performing poorly."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i played 95 of the game on ps4, upgraded to mess around with the remaining percent when i got my ps5. it ran fine the entire way through, almost no different from 2018. not sure what issues you ran into but it was far from unplayable. edit yall some bitches if you think its unplayable just because the ps5 plays it at 60 lmao, actual braindead take. clean your fans and clear space, fucking idiots"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i played it on ps4, it was 30fps. it was very playable and enjoyable."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"nah. its def a ps4 game. look at how it was built all those squeezing through cracks, climbing, and other hidden load screens to keep it one shot were for ps4. ps5 doesnt need that stuff with internal ssd."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,early development footage shows them using a dualshock 4 in midgard mishaps that was released a while ago. it is more of a miles morales kind of cross gen title than a spider man 2.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-14,"yea this is a lie httpswccftech.comgodofwarragnarokbestps4gameps5icingonthecakeamp when it comes to ragnark, from the very getgo, we knew this was going to be a ps4 game because we wanted to support the fanbase  we had so many people that had enjoyed the game on ps4. so from the very beginning, we knew, this is going to be a ps4 game. we're going to make this the best ps4 game we can make. our goal was to surpass god of war 2018 in every way possible. having the ps5 version, that's just icing on the cake."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"yup, couldn't finish ghost, the combat was just kinda bad. the lack of a natural lockon was a huge miss for me, made combat feel way too clunky"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,respect your opinion but dont agree with your take at all. it was a work of art from the visuals to the story. a true love letter to all of the old samurai movies while also having a fresh modern twist. just having stealth and assassination mechanics does not make it an ac clone.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"boring side content, mj being stupid in most of the story, alot of repetitiveness in combat and i played at launch so the game was very buggy and unpolished. i still absolutely love it though and have replayed it several times. saying its better than got in every way is a huuuuge stretch lmao"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,it's great that you can have your opinion even though it's incredibly wrong.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i quit spoderman like 25 through, mind numbingly boring combat, repetitive missions, overall was a terrible game that just looked pretty."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i mean, isn't insomniac spiderman just a polished version of the older spiderman games? lol and if people still talk about ghost of tsushima till this day, then logically, it's not forgettable."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i'm a pc player, and own a ps4. but seeing as spiderman, and horizon came out on pc, i'm not really down to buy a ps5. so a pc port would be appreciated"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"not remotely the best ps exclusive. hzd, gow, sm, tlou 12, the list goes on of way better ps exclusives. bb doesn't even have a fucking quest tab, what little story exists is nonsense, lore is scattered randomly to fill in the lack of narrative, but that's not a substitute. there's barely a moment of humor in the game, really any of the soulsbournes. the difficulty spikes about 30 minutes in and plummets the rest of the game except for specific endgame stuff. combat was solid, but also movement was clunky at times. it's a lot better with ps5 or a decent pc, but it was a ps4 exclusive and just didn't run that well, even on the pro. bosses all have the same issue with most soulsbourne bosses high difficulty at initial encounter because of a variety of moves with awkward timing and deceptive telegraphing. but limited move variety and easy gimmicks to punish most enemies, bosses included, makes the game not that hard. it's an 810, and the ability of fromsoft fanboys to ignore any and all flaws in the games continues to astound me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"nah, no forbidden west sequel in progress as of yet but fw is coming to pc early next year. their strategy is release games on pc two years after console when it makes sense"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"well yeah but they're not exclusives now, nobody is calling gtav a ps3 exclusive game anymore"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"these are the games that defined ops time with their ps4. subjective opinion, relax guy"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"er is hard to return to, it feels like you need to play it continuously. there's so much going on. sekiro is hard, but once the combat clicks, it's so satisfying. i think it's the best fromsoft game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"yeah, but that was before you made the wish. you made the wish, so now go play bloodborne."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"hes exaggerating, but the ps4 version was capped at 30fps with some dips here and there. playable for sure, but nowhere near the experience of playing it on ps5 at a stable 60fps"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"its subjective, i had to stop playing it because the 30fps felt so horribly laggy and janky, it ruined the game for me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,then how come jedi survivor has all those if its only available on ps5?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,yeah and cyberpunk was meant to be a ps4 title in development and we all know how that went the only reason these titles released on last gen is because no one could get a next gen console
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,early development early development was meant to be a dlc for the 2018 game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"you arent wrong about the game being made for ps4. thats just a fact. they need to design the game for the weaker hardware first, and frankly on ps5 the first game looks almost identical to ragnarok. but the first one was still more a more groundbreaking release for ps4."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"how is it incorrect though, it's not like the situation of cyberpunk that simply should have skipped ps4 and only release on ps5"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"my guess is because he used defined and not ,my fav games. to me, defined would be almost an exclusive or something that really says ps4. like halo defines xbox. something like rdr2 isn't defined by any console or pc. that said, i do agree, let the man like what he likes."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,1st time on the internet i see
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i enjoyed the combat personally but i thought the world was pretty but empty. i did enjoy walking into places and shouting for everyone to come and fight me at once. i was not very ghost like. spiderman was great though, the combat was amazing and it really made you feeeeeel like pete speederman"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,damn i can agree with the visuals part but got had some of the most bland and forgettable characters i have ever seen in a video game. i even forgot the main guy's name a week after finishing it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"visually, i'll agree. it was stunning. one of the best looking ps4 games. but the story was bland. forgettable. mechanically, it was absolutely an ac clone. the combat was 100 ac. the stealth felt like ac. the whole game did nothing new mechanically except i guess whatever the challenging an enemy to 1v1 was called, but that wasn't anything special enough for its own game. the game did nothing new. it was not innovative in any way. it was just very, very polished."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"ok, mj parts were a flaw. but aside from that? i played at launch and it was very polished in my experience. got was polished af, but it was dull. it was gorgeous, really one of the best looking ps4 games, but the gameplay was dull. the story was bland. mechanically, the game did pretty much nothing new. it was just an ac clone in japan."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"oh, please. what did got do new? one innovative thing about it? what did it do better than other games? cause sm was fucking awesome. it made traversing a map fun. the story was great. the boss fights were fantastic. got was pretty, but that's it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"you're entitled to your opinion, but you're in the minority. and wrong. you definitely just described got, though, which basically uses 15 year old ac combat."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"it certainly has similarities, but i'd consider it a lot better. got absolutely is just a reskin of ac. it does nothing new."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"are you kidding me? no. no it's not. the new ones are amazing pun intended and mechanically nothing like the ps2 spiderman games. they're vibrant and fun and unique. got, though, is mechanically the same as ac games. it plays the same. it does nothing new or exciting. i honestly thought it was an ubisoft game when i started playing, because it's so similar. just because people remember its existence doesn't make it not forgettable. do you remember the story? at all? none of my friends do."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"a pc port would be most ideal but i've given up on it. a ps5 remaster feels far more likely, even if it's quite inconvenient for a lot of people"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"tlou, hzd and spiderman have worse combat overall, firstly. bloodborne has one of the most rewarding combat systems ever rally system and gun parries, much better enemy design, atmosphere and lore. framerate is a technical issue, true but the combat is absurdly responsive. bloodborne has gow beat too in terms of moveset variety. it may not be as comboheavy but bloodborne leaves very little to be desired when it comes to build variety. heck it's possible to run really damaging gunonly builds for pve. bloodborne doesn't really need a quest tab, it's hardly an openworld game and it takes no time to replay for missed content. but limited move variety and easy gimmicks to punish most enemies, bosses included, makes the game not that hard. bruh, most bosses in action games in general have limited movesets. difference is that in soulsborne games you're actually forced to learn their movesets, and most people opt to not cheese bosses because they actually like to play by the rules. basically every boss ever in games are cheesable save for a number of bosses in hack n slash games, which are fundamentally different in terms of game design. finally, exploration. soulsborne games are among the toptiers when it comes to how exploration is handled. if you're the type to rely on guides for most of the exploration, sucks to be you. there's also the fact that bloodborne is brilliant as a lovecraftian horror game. in terms of raw atmosphere it rivals the scarier horror games. on top of the disturbing lore and the disturbing conclusions you often reach. combine all of that and bloodborne is one of the most enthralling experiences in gaming, something which far surpasses its cousins as an experience. old hunters' dlc is the single best from dlc and one of the best gaming expansions ever. even with its technical problems, bloodborne is an excellent case where it's greater than the sum of its parts because of how everything complements each other."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,im wrong that a cross gen title is cross gen?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"httpswccftech.comgodofwarragnarokbestps4gameps5icingonthecakeamp when it comes to ragnark, from the very getgo, we knew this was going to be a ps4 game because we wanted to support the fanbase  we had so many people that had enjoyed the game on ps4. so from the very beginning, we knew, this is going to be a ps4 game. we're going to make this the best ps4 game we can make. our goal was to surpass god of war 2018 in every way possible. having the ps5 version, that's just icing on the cake."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,youre right its completely subjective but to the 117.2 million ps4 owners who played the first game and majority of gen 8 games in 30 fps they dont feel that way.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"why are you downvoting me, i said its subjective, each to their own opinion, what the fuck is the problem with that? at least one of you could comment why? bunch of twats."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,bc its also a pc game you can install on hdd?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"i understand, but it's still one game out of 4 and i saw it more as a when i'll be older, what will be the games i played and remember the most on my ps4. again, i came here to see list of good games for both xbox and ps4 but the only thing i saw was people complaining about one choice or they aren't good games smh"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,and a few too many times for you apparently
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,haha to say ghosts of tsushima had dull gameplay compared to spiderman is amazing
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"bro what? a game doesn't need to be innovative to be a great game. what new thing did spider man bring to the table? it had fucking qtes for god's sake. don't get me wrong i really enjoyed that game and took my time getting the platinum on it for a reason but it is simply not in the same tier as got. the gameplay was fantastic as in the fighting and traversal felt super tight and didn't get in your way at any time. the atmosphere is one of the best of all time. the graphics were great, the story was phenomenal and had perfect pacing the entire way through. once again spider man was a great great game but shallow in comparison."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,you're entitled to your opinion you're wrong  spiderman is a ubisoft game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"spiderman is mechanically the same as the arkham games. it does nothing new or exciting. but i guess you don't like that comment because that 19 inches of venom is already too deep in your ass. i remember the story. i mean, it's based on a real mongol invasion. it's hard to forget if you don't have a short attention span. also you need better friends."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"can't argue with that. i haven't given up hope, but i also don't have any expectation"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"yes, but not announced. almost 1000 certain there will be another gow game as well."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,yes. but the title of ps exclusive at launch is still worth something
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,i replied to me first?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,and then shortly after you find out there is a double ape fight...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-14,my first playthrough is to this day my single largest struggle with a game but once it clicked . . .
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,why you so mad dude?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,its just whatever the current gen console is at the time is the main generation. its a ps5 game solely because the ps5 was already released at the time of its release. its just cross compatible with the previous generation.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"the majority of ps4 games were not capped at 30 fps. how can you possibly know how 117m ps4 owners feel? like i said the playability of 30fps is subjective, just because you feel a certain way doesn't mean everyone does, all your downvotes clearly allude to that. getting all worked up over it isn't going to change that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,so why wasnt it released on ps4 then?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"he didn't write that it runs at 120fps on ps4, read his comment again lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"it is, though. its so much better. got was so fucking bland. its the same exact assassins creed combat ive played a dozen times. sm is at least interesting and fun. neither is hard."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"idk why you'd ever think got is any different gameplay wise from spiderman. the gameplay loop in got and spiderman basically never changes at all. they're very, very similar."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"spiderman has the most fun map traversal of any open world game. that alone is innovative. the new york build was spectacular, and it really was charming. sm was way better. got is the shallow game. its all graphics and polish, but nothing that makes it actually great. what was it about got that could possibly make sm shallow in comparison?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"except it's not an ubisoft game? it doesn't play like one, beyond having an open world an collectables? the combat is vaguely like batman, if anything. not like assassin's creed, which got basically straight copied."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"k, so you're just a dumb cunt. fuck off. maybe i'm 19 inches in venom's ass."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,whos mad? ill never understand the reddit projection comments like yours. you dont agree with what i say so i must be mad? like i said. its weird to read my post and come out with the idea that im mad because i dont have a ps5 especially when we were talking about a cross gen title
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,cross comparable with the previous generation yes a cross gen title
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,majority of games on the ps4 werent 60fps either and if we look at sony first party exclusive games on the ps4 bet the majority will be capped at 30 fps on the ps4 lol the same can be said for you and the way you feel about playing below 60 fps. just cause you cant stomach it doesnt mean the majority cant. god of war 2018 sold 20 million copies game is 30fps on ps4 whos getting worked up? lol reddit downvotes dont mean a thing. look at the people who are getting upvoted commenting im jealous cause i dont own a ps5 despite having one since launch
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,idk just answering a question
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,honestly? they probably initially designed it for ps4 and changed their mind during the development cycle.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"it's absolutely different, at least from a combat perspective. spidermans combat is mind numbingly repetitive. ghosts of tsushima at least had you switching stances to counter different types of enemies, making you actually change up your style, whereas spiderman was just mashing one single button constantly with the occasional finisher. to think they're remotely similar in terms of repetitiveness is delusional."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"spiderman has the most fun map traversal of any open world game. that alone is innovative dude. you need to look up the definition of innovative. what was it about got that could possibly make sm shallow in comparison? all the reasons i previously mentioned. the story, world and immersion. spider man isn't shallow by itself but put it beside got and it, aswell as most other games, is. as i've said before. you are entitled to your opinion even when it's wrong."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"lol, both spiderman and ghost literally follow the same western ubisoft type open world formula. stop the cope. i could also say the combat in spiderman straightup copied akrham, though. but of course, you wouldn't like that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"hmm, maybe. i dunno, you sound kinda mad to me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"yes the game came out on both consoles you are correct. but nobody is really playing it on ps4 therefore so i wouldnt call it a ps4 title. in fact, everyone i know has played it on ps5"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"typing essays on topics that very few people agree with is generally considered to be getting angrydefensive over your opinion. that's why they said you seem mad, because you're getting very defensive over your opinion for seemingly not much reason."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,yes but its crossing backwards.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"the same can't be said for me though, i gave my personal opinion and acknowledged others have different opinions."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"you didnt answer the question though my question was, if its a current gen and pc only game, why does it have all the things that the other guy claimed only exists in previous gen games? if it was designed that way to accommodate the ps4, it wouldve released on the ps4"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-14,got any proof or you just pull that out of your ass?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"gameplay isn't just combat. it's obvious you're very biased, which is fine, just not a fair representation of what it's actually like."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"hard disagree. got combat is super easy and repetitive. its the same boring, heres your sword assassins creed dodge and hit. spiderman had all the webs, and abilities, and gadgets, and enemy variety, and maneuverability and verticality to make it interesting"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"yeah, so now you're being rude and vulgar because you think it will bother me. really all it tells me is you're a child who knows he's wrong. not every open world game is following the ubisoft formula. got strongly followed the formula. you're right. sm was obviously influenced by arkham. doesn't copy it, but definitely influenced. but got is completely just a copy of ac with a japan skin. you haven't argued this because you can't point out anything new or interesting it did. you can't comment on the story because your know it's bland and unoriginal and entirely forgettable. you're just a troll."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,thats called projection
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,do you have actual statistics to back this up cause the ps5 has sold 13 of the ps4
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,so we cant have a discussion on something that in your own words very few people agree on because in your eyes it makes us seem angrydefensive? also in what world are two sentences considered essays
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,its crossing regardless. was it made with the limitations of the ps4 in mind? httpswccftech.comgodofwarragnarokbestps4gameps5icingonthecakeamp
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"yeah but it was designed that way to accommodate the pc, not ps4  thats how i answered your question creating ps5 native software guarantees install on ssd, however thats not the case with pc or last gen hardware as such, i dont expect third party games that release on pc to really utilize the ability to fast load the same way a ps5 exclusive could"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"got's base combat parry,dodge block is way better than spiderman and had just as many tools  gadgets. the spiderman combat is way more easy and repetitive imo. and not to mention at higher difficulties, you're just spamming attack at those damage sponge enemies. it's really fun but not as satisfying as what you can do in ghost for most people."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"not every open world game is following the ubisoft formula. spiderman has surveillance towers that let you reveal an area of the map better. just like assassin's creed. at least ghost removed that and replaced it with the wind guidance mechanic, so you have better traversal of the map. come on! at least try."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"when compared to the 10 word or less answers that most of the people around you have given, especially on mobile it just looks like you're ranting with a wall of text that i bet most people won't even read."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"so the best version of it was made for ps5 but they made sure to make the ps4 port solid. not sure what youre trying to say here? the game realistically wouldve been a ps5 exclusive had the consoles not been so difficult to acquire. the ps5 had already been out for 2 years at that point, its a ps5 game that was able to played on the ps4, full stop."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,ghost was so stupidly easy it was bland. and it definitely had less abilities than spiderman. and also youre just a dude standing there. spiderman has all the verticality and maneuverability.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"does it? idk i played sm2 and it didn't have that. been a few years since 1. i don't recall got wind traversal. it had wind guidance which seemed like it was gonna be a cool mechanic that turned into more but i recall ending up just being pretty. but it didn't have wind traversal iirc. sm2 has awesome wind traversal, though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,two sentences to you is a wall of text? plus it doesnt matter to me regardless of what you think. if you want to assume im angry because of two sentences in my initial post and 3 in my second reply then go for it. just project
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"did you even bother reading the article? when it comes to ragnark, from the very getgo, we knew this was going to be a ps4 game because we wanted to support the fanbase  we had so many people that had enjoyed the game on ps4. so from the very beginning, we knew, this is going to be a ps4 game. we're going to make this the best ps4 game we can make. our goal was to surpass god of war 2018 in every way possible. having the ps5 version, that's just icing on the cake."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"you literally asked why multiple people have said you seemed angry, and this is exactly why lol, now you're getting super defensive over this too"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,i asked 1 person why. see this is projection your making up scenarios in your head. what multiple people
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"you replied to two different people asking them why they're projecting, now its 3 at least."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,yep because youre projecting your own feelings on to me. so are they. you just made up a scenario in your head and tried to apply it to me
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,i made up a scenario... which you agreed with... so i'm projecting? i think you're trolling lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,when did i agree i told you that i only asked one person when you claimed i asked multiple
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-13,"idk why these guys so salty about your opinion, mega reddit l cringe behavior here. they just want to justify buying a 500 brick. if i were you i wouldnt engage with people who have ggb goopy gamer brain."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"dude, i feel this. i just picked up gow 2018 my first game in this franchise a few weeks ago and i'm floored at what i was leaving on the table"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"gow 2018 has some issues with the early difficulty curve, in my opinion. i also played on the hardest difficulty, and some of those early fights were brutal and frustrating since you don't have all your abilities yet. i found that the game got easier as i went valkyries and niflheim as an exception. i found that ragnarok did a much better job of easing into the difficulty as you unlock abilities and keeping up the challenge as you go, so i enjoyed that curve better. it still has a lot of difficult endgame bosses, though, so good luck!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"yeah i honestly wouldn't recommend the hardest difficulty, enemies just have too much health."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"yeah, that last valkyrie took me until 5am to beat. i was so determined and yet so tired hahaha."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"yea lol, sigrun in first trying give me god of war needs your skill, you cannot beat hear without learning all her moves step by step, that's how it is, that's how you feel the god of war , after beating her in gmgow."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-14,"don't feel bad, probably took me 6 hours to beat the last valk on gmgow the first time, maybe 3 or 4 hours on my first play through on the difficulty just below that on a new game. it's just so many moves to remember and react correctly to. it does feel frustrating where you're like i knew what that move was, why did i dodge right instead of left!?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-14,"currently replaying the game on steam and i hate niflheim so much that i started my ng file without finishing the valkyries on the original file. niflheim just fucking sucks and i refuse to do it. i did all of the valkyries except the niflheim one and by extension, the last one."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-15,i didint play it i have it on ps5 is it worth it?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,why would you not have a full controller
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,at least you got to fight a valkyrie. i grinded to get the crafting materials i needed for upgrades to be able to withstand the challenge but the game never gave me what i needed. how hard was the first valkyrie compared to the last?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"ragnark fixes every problem max difficulty had in 2018. enemies are less spongy, encounters are more thought out with tools to deal with adds if there are too many, better telegraphing of attacks, better level scaling... it's insane. i honestly think 2018 is better when right below gmgow, but ragnark nails it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"omg, the last valkyrie destroyed me sooo many times! first time, i barely scratched her!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,i am interested in trying out god of war when get a ps5 in the future. i defiently will play on normal dificulty on my first playthrough. or what ever its called in this game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-14,dont forget the free dlc for ragnarok. it puts a perfect little bow tie to the game and kratos character.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"the first trilogy and other 45 games were fine on godhardest mode. but give me god of war oh no. multiple gameovers per encounter. you end up standing there tossing the leviathan axe for a solid 20 minutes. running away, do it again felt that it scaled too high at the start then finally leveled out but stayed difficult."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,for me ragnarok was more complicated to understand. gow 2018 was more about being good a parrying and landing combos without much focus on builds. ragnarok can have insane builds were you obliterate everybody
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"shame, by far the worst way to make a game more difficult bulletsponge.. in the case sword sponge enemies can fuck right off. what a lame generic ass mechanic."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"the combat system has a lot of bugs and inconsistencies, which are masked in the lower difficulty setting, but on hard, you will die in 1 hit, and the bugs are super obvious. this video goes into it. the worst one is if an enemy queues up multiple attacks, you can't stun them out of the first one. there's no cue for this, it's just luck. httpsyoutu.bepjpovlvdugw?sikq6enxku78jlxvwmt8498"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,give me god of war is the only criticism i have about gow4. i try to beat every game i love on the hardest difficulty to 100 but i just couldnt stomach gow4. a shake really because the older games difficulties were no where near as hardimo
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"i'd argue the enemies don't have too much health, but if you let them level up you're gonna be in for a bad time."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"not if you learn what gear is the best for what build you're going for and master the combos. usually when people say gow enemies have too much health it's because they rely on basic attacks and play it like a soulslike, getting a hit or two inbetween enemy attacks and playing it relatively safe. god of war heavily rewards an aggressive playstyle and chaining combosrunics, stacking tons of damage quickly, and utilizing the elemental damage from your weapons. if you try to rely solely on countering with basic combos, it's going to feel like they have too much health, but if you play aggressive and learn combos you can delete enemy health pretty quickly."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"haha! yes. it took me like 5 hours, but i was so happy in the end. good times, it was my favorite part of the game. dumb shit was i came close to killing her many times, only to die at the last moment. choked hard several times when she was 1 hit away. which is funny, because you have to chain a fury of combos on her just to damage her 1 tick of health, and she has like 10 ticks in totals. when i was at her final tick, that moment felt so lengthy. i would freeze up, and forget who i was fighting. in 1 of them, it was a draw, but she gets the win, because you still need to grapple her to finish her. the boy got the last shot. i was so furious! httpsyoutu.be4smph5hylia?sifgoguagjvgtssxhp"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-15,absolutely. i slept on it for 5 years. it brought that old school game feeling i missed so much.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,im pretty sure they mean the battery...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,it was when i started the fight
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,it won't. the fight is just hard. i mean she is one of the hardest bosses of all games that's including soulslike.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"the first valkyrie is like nothing. the vibe, and setting of the stage gives you chills walking in, because they're suppose to be imprisoned, and you're just wondering in. fighting your 1st valkyrie will give you confidence beating it. you quickly learn that there's 8 of em or so, and that not all of them are at the same difficulty. the realization that the first one is suppose to be the easiest, or at least depending on what order you beat them in. the final one sigrun, basically takes all the moves of all the ones before it, and she just feels faster. she hits you with many combinations, and she tries to fake you out bait. also her health pool is huge! it's easy to get her health down to 1 tick, just for her to kill you in the end. for a while she was called one of the hardest boss in games. i think she can still be a contender, but yeah there's far worse bosses. if you're new to combat games like this, she'll be an unbeatable wall. took me 5 hours on gmgow. i've heard some people even complain on the easier difficulties lol . httpsyoutu.be4smph5hylia?sifgoguagjvgtssxhp"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,are you sure. it's been awhile admittedly but i recall ares from the og game being really difficult.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"tbh i hated ragnaroks combat overhauls. in the first game, any playstyle is valid. ragnarok is way more focused on how you should approach each fight vs the 2018 game. i'm replaying the 2018 game again and it's so noticeable. the hand to hand and shield combat alone make the game imo. along with moves like the executioner cleave and much more varied finishers. the simon says combat of ragnarok never clicked with me as much. felt was less varied and way more linear."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"i personally liked the big variety of options you have in ragnarok, but i did feel a bit overwhelmed at times with all the potential decisions to make with gear and stuff."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"it's literally in the game just for people who like harder difficulties. theres no trophy for it, you only get a shield skin, so unless you want the hardest difficulty, theres literally no point in doing it on the hardest"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"man wtf . thanks for this revelation. i had fun with gmgow, but i do remember having a lot of bs moments, and getting frustrated. sometimes i felt like i was doing well, but then suddenly lost it out of nowhere. like the video says, the staggers just don't register or drop. so much so i do remember having many options with runic attacks, but i always chose specific ones that would be quick, because it did feel like a gamble using them, and would leave you wide open if for some reason the enemy just bursted out of the stagger. so there was only so few to choose from. more so the frustration was with how fragile you are in that difficulty, but when the enemy starts to cheat, that's so off putting. i remember my frustration with the game, and it kind of just made me feel bad. as if i was being punished for playing good. plenty of times i felt like i was doing well just to die out of nowhere. ugh. thanks for this. i always had mixed feelings about this game, but this kind of reinforces it. i think i did realize these things back then, but i never really made the conclusion. watching the video shows it very clearly that i wasn't just imagining it. how do you feel about the game? surprisingly this is the first time i've heard about this, and that game almost always gets brought up.  me. does the fandom just masks these issues??? it's never talked about... pretty much i bet!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"i did, the enemies are still extremely tanky. ragnarok wasn't as bad though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"they're still too tanky. sometimes it feels like you've done every single ultimate combo on them, and they're still not dead."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-14,the devs said they did that on purpose to give us a sense of just mash this one combo and you got it only for sigrun to smash us into the dirt
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"i can accept when im being thick as shit. i skim read it. sorry, op!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-14,"i played it on gmgow as well. but like i said, the game never gave me the crafting materials i needed for upgrades. i grinded in niflheim for a long time and gave up. where i was at, i knew there was no way i could fight a valkyrie the way i wanted to. i don't recall which items i needed, it was probably just two items, but they would've made all of my stats significantly better. enough so that i felt a valkyrie wouldn't have been any sort of problem initially. the chests never spawned anything i needed. just more of what i already had. i have gow ragnarok in my backlog now. if you played it, did they improve crafting and resource availability?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"ares took 30 tries easily for both my friend  i such an insane final fight haha cant remember if it was more a gimmick fight, or timing, or what. basically every combat encounter, even small mobs were incredibly difficult in gow 2018. was more of a hack n slash breeze save for some mini bosses and gods etc in the older games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-14,"dude, yes. it was very obvious to me since i replayed 2018 right before i did ragnarok. the combat felt so different, and i really preferred the more straightforward and powerful feeling combat from 2018. the combat in ragnarok felt underpowered and tedious to me personally."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,never had that issue. perhaps just bad gear? not playing to the strengths of your build? can't say for your experience but in my experience they give you a sufficient amount of resources and abilities to defeat enemies in a reasonable amount of time.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-14,i haven't played gowr. it's been a long time since i played gow 2018 to know what you're talking about missing pieces.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,"it was probably more so early game then anything. mid to endgame it's not so much of a problem. if you played it for a long time, you probably may as well have forgotten the early journey. the game early on is so damn hard, sometimes it feels cruel, and unfair because you just did the impossible with multiple enemies, only for the game to double the enemies you just killed. specifically one section of early game where they get ambushed by a ton of enemies, and you're just whipping out combo after combo while also not having the full arsenal of kratos, because it's too early. hell even the 1st enemies when you first start the game take forever to kill, and it's just 5 of them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"god of war, by a mile. specially since you don't care about post game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,god of war ragnarok. it's even more epic and even the story of the side characters are great. freya gets a great story.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,i was so stoked on diablo 4 and it was my second most played game in 2023. it sucks. its a huge disappointment. get god of war. if you want an unsolicited suggestion then get elden ring.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"bro, ragnorok literally just came out with some awesome dlc like a week ago completely free. the story is amazing, t he game play is amazing. everything about god of war is perfect."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"for me personally, i would play god of war ragnorok especially since you like 2018, god of war 2018  ragnorok are one story split into two games imo."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,definitely gow. no question.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,i vote god of war. i couldn't get into diablo even playing with friends
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,how is this even a question? gow.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,god of war ragnarok. the valhalla dlc is free which is respectable and its a great roguelite especially for fans of the series.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,diablo should be free to play. theres a game called path of exile 2 thats coming out and its like diablo and maybe better but it will be free to play. so i would keep an eye on that and go for god of war.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,story on diablo is mid. havent played a god of war game since 3 but they look great with a lot of cinematic story scenes. if youre not planning to do the late game post story content and dont have friends to do it with then diablo isnt fun in my opinion so id go with ragnorok
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"i haven't played gow, but if you liked diablo 3, you're gonna hate diablo 4. it's a huge step backwards in terms of gameplay and character building imagine having to put skill points into the same skill just to increase your damage output, the world is big and empty and the story is boring."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,gow. d4 is worth 20 at best.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"hard choice! if you're into story and epic moments, god of war ragnarok might be the way to go. it's got that narrative depth. diablo 4 is cool, but since lategame isn't your thing, ragnarok could be more up your alley. haven't played either yet, but heard good things about both."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"diablo 4 got boring halfway the campaign, never mind the postgame. havent played ragnarok yet but im sure its much better."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,ragnarok is fantastic and d4 is pretty mid. like mindless turn off my brain fun vs engaging story i wanted to consume from start to finish.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"if you want story, gow for sure. if you want something to come back to once a year and find something new to do, d4"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,gow by a mile
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,i played diablo 4 for 140 hours already and 0 hours of god of war ragnorak yet. i still vote god of war
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"i loved the first god of war reboot, hated the second. id go with diablo"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"if you're are looking for a compelling narrative, god of war ragnarok. it is a contained story, and it is fairly easy to platinum. diablo 4 is a live service arpg, and your money will go farther. season 2 has been amazing, and the devs are actively making adjustments to the game. if you are looking for stories and side quests, do not pick this up. the point of d4 is the endgame grind and loot chase."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,hahaha its not even close to being tje same type of game. do u want a story game or action rpg??
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,diablo 4 pay to win garbage bull shit? or a truly epic tale that just recently released a free dlc to keep playing after the new game plus plus plus plus? no contest
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"if you want to play with mates, then diablo iv. it plays xplatform and works well. if not, then gow. just an around better and more entertaining game imo."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,god of war is likely better. unless you want a time sink game but even then their are better option that d4
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,this is a quantity vs quality question. gow has a better story and game play. d4 you know what you're getting. looting and grinding. i played both and preferred gow.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"i do not care about late game diablo 4 gameplay then, god of war ragnarok, it received a roguelike dlc too for free this month . diablo 4 it's a game with seasons, a game you will come back for new contents each x months and a game that will receive extensions too. if, once you finished it, you don't really care about postgame, it's really not what you want imho and you enjoyed gow 2018, it's natural to finish the story arc !"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"bro man, god of war much better quality but it is single player. d4 less epic but you could technically play it for much longer"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"for pure story and questing, gow is your best bet. it lacks substantially compared to 2018, but still a good 4045 hrs of stuff for 100 completion."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"for story, definitely gow. though ive sunk more hours into diablo 4 for the repetitive end game loop."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,its gowr by a landslide.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,"had more fun with god of war, but getting a lot more hours out of diablo."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,i haven't even played god of war and i know it's better than d4. diablo might be worth owning in a year but right now it's lagging behind other arpgs by a lot.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,i haven't even played god of war and i know it's better than d4. diablo might be worth owning in a year but right now it's lagging behind other arpgs by a lot.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,"gowr, but it is probably going to be on ps in 36 months but still gowr. they are both just an extension of the previous one, but d4 forces you online for no good reason and as of a month ago still has server issues making hardcore ungood"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,gow has more replayability has better gameplay doesn't need an online to stay alive got the best dlc since bloodborne old hunters
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,i dislike gow's gameplay and never could get into it and i bought d4 on release and beat it. anyway get god of war ragnark it's better
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,if you want a story  puzzles with your combat then god of war  diablo iv if you just want to turn your brain off and grind with some tv on in the background
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,i got d4 of the two and would heavily suggest you go with gow.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,god of war!!!!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,anything but diablo4. worse game ever.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,god of war has an amazing story and awesome combat. you definitely won't be disappointed.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,"god of war ragnarok, for sure. this game is great"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,god of war of course
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,god of war ragnarok.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,d4 was fairly short in my experience. unless it's very cheap i'll pick ragnarok.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,"i loved diablo 3, my wife and i really enjoyed playing coop so of course we got diablo 4 when it came out. massive disappointment in my opinion. it just felt really boring compared to diablo 3, and none of the classes felt nearly as fun and all felt quite weak, they added in loads of mmolike elements to the game which make it feel like more of a slog. the storyline was moderately interesting but nowhere near engaging enough to continue playing, so we just decided to shelf the game for now in the hopes that after a year or so there will be enough new stuff to make it fun. from what i understand, patches so far have only made it worse. also, slight side note and i'm sure this doesn't affect everyone, but there is just something about the game that made me feel really sleepy whilst playing it, and i don't mean in a sense that i was bored, i mean literally something about the camera angleuisize of things, i really don't know, but it literally made me feel like i was falling asleep whilst playing. god of war on the other hand is brilliant."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,make sure you snag the free valhalla dlc for gow
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,"played both.. regretted buying diablo 4. strictly looking at storytelling, i found myself watching all the cutscenes on god of war. i was trying to actively skip any story element in diablo 4."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-31,dont touch d4 with a 39.5 foot pole!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-31,ragnarok. no question about it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,and now there's a free rogue lite mode which is also insanely good. god of war is my answer everytime.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,how does elden ring compare to dark souls 3? it's it just open world dark souls?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,i thought diablo 4 had an awesome campaignstory and had fun with the different characters.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,what if that list includes gollum and kong?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,this is what im thinking. poe2 is amazing me with each new video released. maybe i'll go for god of war and then poe2 for free
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,no one plays action rpgs for the story.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"decidedly deceptive. op, pop over to the diablo4 subreddit. the game is awesome, and is different from d3. and it is better for it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,"you are confusing diablo iv with immortal, that one is pay to win."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"it does take a lot from dark souls, but the open world begs to be explored unlike my experience with botwtotk. each dungeon that you come across has a unique boss and makes the exploration worth it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,gollum dont look too bad
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,except op who is specifically asking about story qualities
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"i know some people like it, but let's be fair it uses the same mechanics from diablo 2 but somehow making them worse, a game which is 23 years old. you can't easily change builds because you have to pay for respec. the world is empty and you frequently travel vast distances without encountering any mobs. from the technical point of view the graphics are okish, but the art direction is really bad and uninspired. there's probably some music, but i can't remember any themes. the cinematics are really good tho, so there's that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,neutral my ass
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,maybe. still ruined their reputation with me either way
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,hahahahahahahahahahahahahahajajajajhahahahahahahahahahhaha
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,"op  just talk to people that actually play the game. this guy is so offbase and speaking from a place of inexperience. i mean, saying the graphics are okish is crazy to me. diablo 4 looks like a goth horror wet dream. it is gorgeous. but, all in all, based on op's wants he should choose gowr"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,ha!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"honestly i think they were cool because we got to ride the kelpy, and also because they sorta bash it over your head that fate can be changed. if i hadnt known that previously, i probably wouldve called the ending a cop out."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"i thought they were one of the neatest parts of the story. and for people saying what was the point? weren't they there to show fate wasn't magical or concrete, that it was just educated guessing based upon previous character actions? that you weren't bound by fate, but unless you change your actions those best guesses are likely to happen?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"honestly my only complaint about that scene in the game was it took this picture for me to even get a good look at them xd i felt like the whole scene was designed so you could barely see them at alldid anyone else feel like this? i'm not sure what it was... all the darting around and attempts to be cryptic kind of cheated us out of getting a full visual. at least that was how it was for me, maybe i'm nuts."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,they want that dark crystal.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,i missed greek kratos during this part again. have you predicted this?? just starts killing them lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"source httpswww.artstation.comartworklr3d8ehttpswww.artstation.comartworklr3d8e norns god of war ragnarok this was so much fun to work on, had the chance to collaborate with dela longfish and bjorn hurri on the design of the norns for the game. we did a lot of explorations and pitches for how the scene would play out, playing with scale and the style. the idea being that they are share elements of the past, present and future of the same character and how that gets reflected on their design. this was their final design for the game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,they had only one scene and they were wrong in their predictions
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,my personal favorite scene in the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,these dudes were so shoehorned into the game's story. if you cut them nothing of value would be lost.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"the most worthless part of the story. basically just show up, get taunted by these hags, then change absolutely nothing. why was this a thing?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,overrated game. elden ring is on another lvl compared to this game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,'i murdered the hell out of your greek counterparts and one of them was goddamn gigantic.'
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,reminds me a bit of the dark crystal film.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,"last time kratos had a run in with ladies that controlled fates, it didn't end well for the ladies."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,so... urru?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,precisely. also liked that they kept things mysterious without explaining everything about them. norns and the lady in the lake.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,yeah i loved that interpretation of the norns and the the simultaneous turmoil and peace it caused the characters. it fit right into the theme.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,they were moving around a lot but i didnt have any problem seeing them. was your brightness super low or something?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,"no, they were right until kratos actually resolved to change his ways. they didnt believe he would."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,"they themselves say that prophecies aren't some grand fate, they just make predictions based on patterns of behavior. there was no grand destiny that said x had to happen, it's just that people do not change. kratos is the exception because he did change."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"the younger one was my favorite. i chuckled every time she chimed in. also kratos attempts to not grunt, he fails."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"they confirm that fate isn't fixed, that's a pretty important part of the story. especially since the greek fates were in control of how things happened."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"huh? it was like... one of the most crucial storytelling parts. it set up the whole later half of the game, thinking kratos was doomed to repeat his actions, and then showing that it wasn't...that fate isn't real and you determine your reality... did i play a different game? i felt like it paved the entirety for that discussion."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"well i think it's the theme of you chose your own fate by breaking your own cycles, but did feel very shoe horned in. didn't really as much value to that point as the characters kind of all rejected the notion."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,lmfao
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,"at least a half dozen tigole bitties, all over her damn body."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,nope! honestly i might just have been disoriented from all the motion because adhd brain so it could 100 just be me xd
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,"yes, thats what im saying, but there was a grand fate in greek mythology, i mean we saw a mural of a mortal warrior battling zeus in gow1. santa monica was putting a lot of references to the ideas they might have went with, they made a jesus reference too, they put the star leading to the place of jesuss birth, and they said that they did want to bring jesus, but thought itd be too controversial."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,the younger one trolling feya was so good
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"they confirmed what kratos already knew because he had previously overcome fate? sorry if i still think that it's a worthless detour in that case, because that's really what it all added up to."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"i get that, but still it amounts to nothing. we know exactly what you're going to do because you're so predictable. then he goes and does what he was going to do anyway, so they were right... and he didn't change anything. how was going to see them necessary at all?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,"the whole game is shoe horned in. the greek saga was six games long. i can only hope that they flush it out in the tv series. i wanted to fight god after god, beowulf, sea serpents. we got, like, fucking heimdall, thor, and odin. add in magni, modi, and baldur that's 6 gods he took on. and they weren't even that strong! when zeus and poisiden died the effects were catastrophic for greece. what did these gods even do besides drink and fight? they needed to bring the lore to life in a meaningful way. they had 9 realms to dig into and they barely scratched the surface."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,"in greece, yes, but they were in the nine realms. much smaller power level as you can see when mimir and freya are appalled at the idea of someone having the fates' power over time."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"except kratos didn't know that. the greek fates controlled time, they didn't take kratos seriously and died for their arrogance. kratos then turned that power on the gods by saving the titans. kratos assumed the norns had that power but they don't. they can only make assumptions based on behaviour."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"they informed him that atreus was in danger and where. kratos was fighting the prophecy until he realized they only told him that so he could go be the godkiller he was always meant to be to protect his son. at that point, he didn't give a shit anymore."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,well again i kind of agree.. but i think it tried to say even if you do the fated thing but for the right reasons it's different? i dno it was a bit of the game i kind of struggled with to. spent time trying to get it but that's about as close as i got. although there is a moment with loki in the ending sequence where it kinda plays out but kinda poorly.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"regardless, in ragnorok kratos says over and over how much he doesn't believe in fate or the fates. they're entire purpose is to padout the game by making you go to 3 separate caves and fight more generic enemies. just to tell you you should kill heimdall....which kratos was already thinking about doing, anyways. they're cool, but holysmokes, gowr had a lot of bloat. in retrospect, gow2018 is a much better game because it's so much leaner and focusses on the gameplay and story in a better way. ragnorok focusses waaaaay too much time on story. like 30 of the game is walkingandtalking."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"sorry, i haven't played it since it came out, but did they inform them where atreus was? because as far as i remember, they already knew !atreus was in asguard. this wasn't why they went to them, they were looking for a way to subvert the fate of starting the war. ! and if you're saying kratos had to go to them to get the fuck you energy to say hell with fate then that's also a waste of time, because kratos has always had that attitude."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,that's because he's seen how fate can be changed. as powerful as the greek fates were he managed to win. he used their power to change fate. the weird thing with your complaint is usually i hear people say the opposite. they think ragnarok was too rushed and should have been stretched into 2 games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,"yeah, i was wrong about the info part just rewatched. but i got the idea he still went there for general information about atreus. then the norn says you will learn that heimdall intends to kill your son in asgard, which is what's happening in the moment. and then, you will do what you do best. x200b kratos knows from experience that fortune tellers like these are always right. avoiding the prophecy to keep himself alive isn't a priority anymore. he's not saying fuck it, he's embracing it which leads to him being the !fucking multiverse spanning !god of war."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,"maybe the ending was rushed. i mean the actual ragnarok event was a bigwetfart. !it's suppose to be the battle between all the realms, and all i ever saw was a couple of dark elves and the same companions we've been with all game.! !and then kratos instantly has a changeofheart the moment the fight begins and goes uh, you know that ragnorok we spent all game trying to get? yeah, uh, tell him to go home. we don't want him anymore.! i don't think it should have been made into two games. but it could have, for how much it dragged on and on and on."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,"there were more than that but it gets mentioned why before. basically there aren't many left by that point. it's not the moment it starts, it's when he sees atreus react to something and remembers faye."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,"some of you are not giving credit where it's due. even if you didn't like elden ring, that game blocked out the sun when it was release. i haven't seen such an impactful release like that in quite awhile. it reminded me of launches like ocarina of time or resident evil 4. it was literally all anybody talked about for months. the gaming community was obsessed. i thought souls had already broken into the mainstream with dark souls 3, but no, now it has officially broken into the mainstream."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-07,"lot of elden ring fanboys here, i would not say elden ring will get goty. god of war may be end up getting it though they're different gen games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,ragnarok without a single doubt
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"elden ring, hands down"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,elden ring hands down. it fuckin delivered
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,elden ring is a masterpiece. i highly doubt ragnarok will beat it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,depends on what ragnarok delivers since it still has not been released elden ring had a great open world probably the only real contender for breath of the wild in that particular regard but everything else about the game felt like the usual from software game but with new issues mainly bad balancing with both weapons and normal enemies in the endgame having more damage than bosses and repeated bosses over 140 and of those just 9 were totally unique in the meaning that they were never reutilized in any way and about 32 percent of all bosses is the correct number of bosses of the game if you don't count repeated encounters wich is an obscene number of copy paste the rest of the enemies where only there to fill out the open world meanwhile god of war 2018 had a similar issue 8 valkiries that where basically inferior versions of valkirie queen sigrun and 18 troll enemies that although weren't intended as bosses by the studio many players regarded it as such because of their health bars that where only there because of the size of the trolls and the nocut camera not being able to zoom out over their heads to show their health bars ragnarok has been stated by the director eric williams as a game that will surprise the players in the amount of enemies and cast of characters it will bring the world of god of war will also be at least twice as big as the older game making it feel less linear elden ring will likely still have a bigger and better open world but it also doesn't come close to god of war storywise if what eric williams declared turns to be done correctly that should fix my biggest gripes with gow 2018 wich was already amongst the best games of all times and even won first place in the fan voted ign 26 million users bracket to vote the best game of all times where it compeated with the best games in the history of gaming so as long as they properly build upon that ragnarok could easily crush any game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,god of war ragnarok for my goty i liked elden ring itis best fromsotware soul game but god of war is more better masterpiece granphic better gona be combat better story better and more memorial i for god of war best games ever made
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,elden ring
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-02,"both games deserve the title. however cory barlog mentioned in an interview that god of war 2018 worked because they mapped out entire worlds and story for future god of war games, even before starting development on the 2018 game. if that is the case that means the story and world of gowr is going to be next level and all the story loose ends from the previous game is going to be closed off in this sequel. we will just have to wait and see how gowr improves on the gameplay...."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,elden ring cause its a game the trash industry has needed since the ps4 hit stores in 2014 and gaming went to shit. er reminds me of old xbox 360 games modernized because of its beautiful simplicity.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,gow will be a good game but it's just a safe copy of the 2018 nothing to new or revolutionary it's just a safe game nothing really changed but everyone is on the hype train and saying its better and hasn't even played it elden ring deserves goty
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,"i feel like elden ring has to take the cake here. i'm sure gow ragnarok will be incredible and a game absolutely worth playing. however, elden ring is fromsoft's best game yet in many people's opinion and had an incredibly impactful release, with very few criticisms. ragnarok might be a similar case when it releases, but it can't be more than a sequel. i'm not saying it will be worse than gow 2018  it could certainly be better  but it will lack the innovation and uniqueness required for a goty. basically, ragnarok won't win goty because it's just a sequel while elden ring is a brand new experience with a whole new world.."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,"ragnarok might get best narrative, but elden ring is a once in a generation game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"if game of the year was strictly based upon gameplay, then i would have no doubt that elden ring would win. x200b however, games are more than just gameplay these days. there are tons of factors like graphics, story, characters, etc. x200b where elden ring excels in gameplay and musical score, ragnarok comes in with a much better story, better graphics, better visuals, etc. x200b it comes down to the fact that ragnarok has wellbalanced gameplay to match its incredible story and visuals, whereas elden ring's story is kind of lacking. this is just my opinion"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,i was 100 percent in elden rings camp. but having finished god of war ragnarok last night i think it deserves it. almost never in gaming has a game delievered in every second and been so emotional and deep. its true art. still would be happy ither way.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,elden ring came from nowhere and absolutely delivered. think ill return to it soon and finish it up.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,elden ring unless they make god of war back into an actual god of war game then maybe it has a chance.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,elden ring
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,is ragnarok even coming out this year?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,"elden ring is a great game, gow ragnarok is a great movie. i think er deserves it more, but at this point i fully expect a movie to win goty again. also to whoever put er in the best narrative category, i want some of whatever you're smoking."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,who even cares? must we constantly put these games up against eachother?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,"as a person who was played both i prefer ragnarok due to the story telling and the pure enjoyment not only to the story missions but also to side quest being jaw dropping or just plainly interesting. don't get me wrong er is an amazing game, but in my opinion in terms of pure enjoyment id choose gow ragnarok. i think its also important to note the games gives different types of enjoyment. even thought they are similar the experience could not be more different. its more a matter of preference than quality."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,mw2 as well.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"same gen, they're both on ps4"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"got to also wonder how their respective release dates might affect it too. elden ring came out in february earlier this year and ragnarok only came out a month before the game awards. i wonder if elden ring will win since more people have had a chance to play it since the game has been out for so long, or if it'll have the opposite effect and more people will vote for ragnarok because of the recent hype..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,the visual on ragnarok so the same goes for get my vote
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,its not tho
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"be surprised, somehow gow 2018 which is even more overated beat rdr2 for goty."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,what do you mean only real contender for breath of the wild in that regard? neither elden ring nor breath of the wild had the best open world. good games but they are for sure not being carried by their open world.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,it's not a masterpiece it's a good game also check your grammar and spelling.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,i definitely agree due to the fact of it's popularity i think that god of war ragnarok will surely do great but not as great since elden ring sold 14 million copies in the 2nd week of it's release which is crazy!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,lol fanboy hater
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,you have no idea what you're talking about. ragnarok is transformed and just completely piledrives gow 2018 maybe try playing games before judging them?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,"i mean er was good and the difficulty level was good to keep you gripped. that being said, the story was terrible and you cant even argue that you cared about the er storyline. goty will go to either one which is good however, i imagine it will go to ragnarok because it has characters and development you can get invested in."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,sekiro is way better
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"not a brand new experience. it's open world souls. if you took out the souls mechanics established in demon souls on ps3 the game would be nothing. its just the most popular souls game, not even the best imho."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,"its literally dark souls 3 with an open world mod installed. gowr is phenomenal graphically, has an indepth story to back it up, superb soundtrack to finish off. goty is about a game that hits everything, elden ring was good, gowr was amazing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,if you base graphics off makes a great game you are a nut. smh the gaming community nowadays.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-07,are you kidding? it's just another bloodborne darks souls game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,someone who feels how i do about modern god of war. they stripped away a lot of what made the older games so great and i just cant get over that at all.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,yes
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,not really since the game launched in a pretty poor state. also didn't see that much hype for the multiplayer itself although i did see some for the campaign and warzone 2.0. edit im an idiot and forgot that mw2 2009 existed. smh.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"i meant, they're different type of games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,okay
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,elden ring and breath of the wild had fantastic open worlds and are miles better than the open world games we have now.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,"if gow 2018 can beat rdr2, ragnarok will win. er was very good but goty goes usually to better story games. er story was abysmal."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,so gow isn't a masterpiece but elden ring is?i believe it's the other way around.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"nah they're both, without a doubt, masterpieces. thinking that one or the other isn't a masterpiece is just an incorrect opinion, from an impartial standpoint."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-07,dude elden ring is a multi platform game so it's normal to sell a lot more than a exclusive.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,dude elden ring multiplatform god of war only playstation and god of war older 2018 sold 25m more then your elden ring on all platforms
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,atleast im not a sony dog
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,i have played it and if you have you'll now know its a safe copy no big jumps or changes nothing revolutionary like what elden ring attempted and succeded ragnarok took the safe way the puzzles were the same if you found something you didn't go omg i wonder if anyone else found this unlike when you discover something in elden ring sony took the safe route which is fine their formula produces mostly 9 plus stars they didn't need to change which is why elden ring deserves goty fromsoft took the extra leap and did it perfectly
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,lmao youre high
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,i disagree the story is very interesting and ingrained in the game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,what? i loved ers story same with like 90 of the er fanbase lmao.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,this is about 2022 chief.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,sekiro has no replayability.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,agree people dont even copair sekiro to er. i had so mutch more fun with sekiro than elden ring.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,yeah people say like its somthing so new lol. the combat is preety mutch the same i would argue its even worse soemtimes. when u fight some bosses as melle you get one hit in then you need to wait for the boss to do a combo witch might or might not have a follow up and then u can put two more hits in. idk sekiro and even ds3 the boss fights felt more like actualy fights like i was in a dance in elden ring i just feel like i need to wait for them to do a move and then repeat.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,"well, then you may just as easily say that ragnarok is gow 2018 with... what exactly? more characters and some recurring, some new areas some recurring, different musical themes some recurring, and some  slightly  different combat options."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,the ost is trash and thats not even opinionized. gow was ruined when the first next gen one released and was turned into some corny fatherapprentice storyline like every other boring ps4 era game. its a movie not a game. a boring walking simulator. elden ring is just like classic xbox 360 games. its a game the industry has needed since that garbage ps4 console hit stores in 2014.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-29,"he's not saying graphics alone make goty, its a combination of everything that makes a game visually pleasing. graphics have a role in that, including 2d, 3d, pixelated etc. x200b smh the part of the gaming community that can't think about game design objectively for more then 3 seconds."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,and gow is just another gow same as the game before. i cant tell the difference between the two games. maybe graphically a bit better however it is the same engine and the same gameplay same movesets.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,"yeah, you two can be bitter about it while everyone else has an incredibly good time with the new god of war. now it has actual characters to give a fuck about an not just quick time events and mediocore fighting."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,yeah man mw2 2009 not mw22 lol..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"oh, genre gotcha"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,i mean i had a lot of problens with it and i played all ds games and sekiro
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,"i didnt really like rdr2,but i think gow is far from being a masterpiece. maybe the first 5 hours of it was. the game is basically 4 hours of real content repeated over and over to pad out game time. there are like what 3 types of enemies? even bosses are mostly cloned with different colors. not to mention the forced rpg progression system that plaques the modern western game. imo gow could have been a masterpiece if it was like 89 our long."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"lol elden ring world is empty as fuck and the only activity his farming mob to get some random tressure, botw is a better but neither or great opens worlds."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,ld. rdr2 enters the chat
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,"maybe because you did not research it or got into the lore. fromsoft games story is told differently. i like it because of the fact that a lot of things can be interpreted differently. so yeah imo gow story is worse, due to the fact that it is a butchered norse mithology."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,you do have to dig for the lore its not on plate like gow
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,er has changed the gaming scene its already a masterpiece only uneducated people think otherwise once gow comes out then it can be decided if it is a masterpiece or if everyone was riding the hype
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,another thing that is better about elden ring
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,and still wont win goty or be as good and its also been out 4 years and elden ring will surpass it in sales by the end of the year
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,"hey buddy , god of war 2018 is 4 years old while elden ring is only a few months old . clown"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,ur stupid copy what about the copy paste of bosses everywhere in elden ring 9 unique bosses i think ds3 base had like 19? lol. nothing new combat wise to. i need to scroll to use fucking spells in 2022 yes perfect game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,it's also minimal and excessively vague. ragnarok actually tells you a story.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,"not everyone wants to read every scroll and tidbit of lore. most casual gamers want to enjoy the story with the presentation and narration. that's why most people say er has no story. if they narrated the story like horizon or gow, it wouldn't even be a competition."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,i forgot what it wa about?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"however, elden ring is fromsoft's best game yet in many people's opinion"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,"you can use that exact comment but used elden ring and dark souls 3, at least ragnark brought the conclusion of a fantastic story. gow has this in the bag, elden ring fan boys be damned."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,yes mate yes good point ragnarok combat has new stuff in it tell me what feels difrent from ds3 to elden ring? cause i have 400h in ds3 and the combat animations are the same.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,"and what... because a game takes the time to flesh out an entire world with staple characters, staple locations and themes... that makes it bad? that would equate to breath of the wild, gow and the last of us being deemed unqualified for goty, and they all got it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-29,"incorrect opinion, please reevaluate and try again later."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,ny other s 1 graphics are better not mutch but honestly who cares my 6900xt cant handle gow 2018 on 4k max settings. 2 gameplay is better improved 3 elden ring combat is nothing new so idk why u even making sutch a comment 4 there are a lot of problem even with controls in elden ring the pc port is dog water.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,fanboy
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,what makes you think im bitter lol. im expressing an opinion. just like youre expressing yours. imagine being that bent over two people sharing an opinion that isnt even uncommon in the god of war fan base lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,who or what even gave you the impression gow had mediocre combat? don't kid yourself for a moment thinking the new game has better combat because it doesn't it does have a better and more serious story but that's no excuse for you who probably didn't even played the old games to trash upon it and gow qtes where god tier highly regarded as one of the best ones out there
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,ok mate the old god of war had good charecters but i do agree the new on is as good.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,"there are two real problems with er, the lack of boss variety, and the lack of difficulty in certain builds. neither of which really bother me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,relocate your manhood that's an opinon of a person with no balls
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,what game do you even consider a great open world then?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,"empty as fuck. have you actually played the game? elden ring delivers not only a wide range of enemies with distinct animations and patterns but exploration is fantastic for an open world game. they've managed all of this with great combat and graphics. people just love tearing things down instead of giving credit. you don't have to like the game but you should acknowledge elden ring as an achievement, especially in today's gaming climate. please tell us all which games have better open worlds."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,eapo nah bruh you just didnt look at all
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,if a games story requires a youtube research session to fully appreciate it then it's not that great of a story.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,sorry but if u say tha gow story is worse ur just delusional
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,lol fanboy goweldenringzzzz
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,in addition to everything else.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,it's out now and i was right it was a safe copy er has over 32 unique bosses best itemization system ever made doesn't use a random loot system to populate it doesn't use a rarety like common uncommon it drives exploration forward renowned for one of the best first play through experiences in gaming its made so the player can explore on their own without guidance the most revolutionary game in years calling me stupid when you don't use facts and only emotion in your argument is for veggies who have yet to locate their manhood why try and locate your ball and your facts before going in a debate you gow fanboy go try and git gud somewhere else
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,removed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,it's a different way of telling the story
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,no one wants that
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,nop
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,"there is zero overlap between the characters, areas, and music in er and ds3."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,"jump attacks, crouch attacks, mounted combat, interchangable weapon arts, spirit summons."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,"i was following your train of thought. you said er is literally dark souls 3 with an open world mod installed, but when it comes to gow its apparently a good thing be similar to its predecessor, because the game takes the time to flesh out an entire world with staple characters, staple locations and themes"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,play with controller but at least you can play er unlike gow on pc
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,lol why? just because i have eyes i am fanboy?! i love both games have not played gow ragnarok yet but in my opinion elden ring is just a different league.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,and i just can't get over that at all
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,"i agree with you tbh, never even played the first 3 games. that being said, reviews are coming out that the boss fights in ragnarok are bigger than anything from 2018, and that is within the first 10 hours."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-07,i'm not gonna argue with ne nostalgia squad lmao
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,i also hate the controls as a pc player scrolling for spells feels very bad
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,assassin's creed odyssey
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,eople just love tearing things do idk rdr 2 has the best imo. elden ring is far from perfect do a lot of things bothered me and i had almost 400h in ds3. i couldnt even beat elden ring the second time yet. and i wanted to...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,"so having an opinion makes me delusional.. okay fanboy, we will see who wins"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,the gow community must be proud of intellectual people like you.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,i prefer god of war over elden ring and take this from someone who's done playthroughs on elden ring. elden ring only gets relatively fair when you new game  and is so grindy you back then especially needed to grind for practically everything needing runes and tons of other things especially with us having summons which is a plus i will say that we need to upgrade. compared to god of war the story falls off due to the fact that it's very vague and all lore after lore. sure it leaves it up to interpretation but also can be a poor excuse for lazy writing. god of war ragnarok has its fair share moments as well but you calling someone a goe fanboy but then reply to every single person with an opinion because you're a die hard git gud guy shows how low the bar is for people like that. all jokes aside i can see either game winning this as they both have their moments and flaws but i do see ragnarok having the edge as previously god of war 2018 bested red dead redemption 2 which was a phenomenal game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"but ragnarok also has gameplay and is gameplay driven. rag isn't a walking sim. they're both fully fledged games, it's just one has a fully fledged story that doesn't require research sessions to fully appreciate."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,i was trying to quote
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,ok sure but base combat i mean mechanically it dosnt feel all that good. jump attack are nice i guess crouch attack eh. i just wanted a bit more style combos for example not just swing swing stab stab and weapon art.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,"you said er is literally dark souls 3 with an open world mod installed, but when it comes to gow its apparently a good thing be similar to its predecessor similar in ways yes, but there's key differences. elden ring is similar to every other souls game through its combat, world building methods etc. gowr is similar to gow 2018 in the fact that it takes place in the same location, 3 years in the future. gowr is telling a cinematic journey, that's its biggest strength. x200b the difference is elden ring feels like someone took any other souls game, downloaded a few mods, slapped a new title on it, and called it a day. yes, gow is in the same universe, but the game is a continuation, the story is advancing, the world is changed. its not trying to be something different and failing, it knows exactly what it is. elden ring is being called a gaming revolution which is entirely up for debate, rather gowr carries one of the best journeys experienceable within gaming. x200b in the end, this type of argument is entirely subjective, and comes down to opinion and experience. i've been waiting four years for gowr and was incredibly excited for its conclusion. however, i only got into the souls series in 2020, so my enjoyment of the series is quite fresh and undeveloped. in the end of the day, us gamers dictate 10 of the votes visvis the awards. a panel of judges dictate the remaining 90. it comes down to which ever one they pick, but either way we all have our own 'game of the year."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,i dont like playing with controler cause its worse. second gow 2018 is on pc and ragnarok will be to bloodborn still isnt on pc for some reason. see this is what i hate people just prise this game and when u call out actuall problems like i did get a controler? seriously i need to pay 60 more to get a controller nice
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-06-08,you're not gonna argue with what you do not know a thing about kid
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,plus the late game feelt like a bunch of horse crap
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,if youve played all ds games then you should already know that controller is the only way to play elden ring.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,"lol take it from a person who loves odyssey and finished all the quests including all dlcs fuck that, u trippin? odyssey world is meaningless compared to elden ring wich i have completed also. while by the end of ac odyssey i was almost giving up of doing the same thing over and over again just to see the full kassandra arc, at the end of elden ring i literally got melancholic and kinda depressed, because me and my brother knew we were getting to the end of this mindblowing, remarkable trip, and we wouldn't see a game like this for the next years. and i don't even need to get started on breath of the wild..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,u trippin
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,"wha? lol? so when you said elden rings open world is empty as fuck, what you really meant was you just prefer an open world with map markers telling you to do repetitive boring activities or collect meaningless shit. to each their own i guess."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,pls get educated
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,man i want some of whatever you are smoking
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,i mean yes if ur opinion is dumb. ik what ur trying to say but its not right there really isnt a big story in elden ring or ds3 for example but there is deep lore in it. lore and story arent the same.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,we definitely are not
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,it's a different form of narration diehard no he called me stupid so i said git gud i don't think that's die hard git gud guy but each to their own im surprised by your opinion since i'm assuming you've played it and know that it doesn't deepen or expand the actionadventure genre in any way everything is predictable especially if you've played similar games horizon assassins creed or previous god of war games you know exactly what your in for gowr is focused on story and narrative the story is more engaging than er but that doesn't make up for the issues gow has with combat exploration and itemization unlike er players are not rewarded the same way for exploring and you often know the exact puzzles you find as well as the loot there are no surprises and you never wonder if any other player has found it since it's not unique or original whatever you found the combat largely follows the same formula of enemies popping out of every place you would expect then you have to burst through your cooldowns to eliminate and then r1 or r2 everything to death before repeating never feeling like your getting any stronger and the loot system never makes you feel stronger and doesn't change the way you play the game gow is like a marvel movie everyone will go watch it have a blast and people will keep coming back for new ones but they will never push for more they wont go that step further they have there formula and stay to it fromsoft took a much bigger risk with er and is continuing to innovate on the genre and gameplay so your opinion surprises me but whatever you had more fun with is predominantly what you will want for goty even if the other game has done all these things better however after completing gowr i had a blast i don't feel at all driven to play it again but er there are countless builds that make me what to go play the game in a different way even now but i disagree on seeing ragnark having a chance at edging er out of goty just in my perspective each to there own tho
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,also no need to try and insult me
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"well you dont play fifa with keyboard either or assassins creed with keyboard but yes it is your choice a controller is not 60 bucks, you can buy some for 20."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,"what?????? late game elden ring might be the best gaming experience ever created! the areas are fucking gorgeous, especially the one with maliketh. the bosses are incredible with a ton of unique abilities, and i loved the difficulty spike towards the end. anybody who is decent at souls games and doesnt use those stupid summons in er would agree that its the best game ever created. ragnarok takes the story writing for sure, but no game ever has set a vibe within the boss arenas like er did. absolutely outstanding game, blows my mind still to this day."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,just shut up fanboy. elden ring was a big all platform game they should have done better for pc locked on 60 fps in 2022 lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,"i cannot remember a single thing about odyssey even if i played that more recently when it was added to gamepass. and for some reason i can still remember every single location, side quest, map, mini boss, story even if it was vague af of elden ring. and im pretty sure my playtime was similar in both games. odyssey was just a very forgettable experience lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,to be fair i hate how quests were done in elden ring. i played every souls game and i think elden ring being an open world should have at least a jurnal telling you what the fucking npcs saied so ik what to fucking do. cause i googled most of them.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,there is story if you paid some attention to it then you would see that it is told from the start. why should every game have a story like movies? i mean i could watch god of war on youtube and have the same story as playing it myself. its replayability is also restricted to the fact that it is a linear story. so yes i think elden ring has a better story and not only that but also a much deeper story and lore. the npcs you meet in elden ring all have their own stories which can be continued some even tie into each others.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,the thing is its not the same fifa sure with keybord would be stupid but i like elden ring on pc i played all souls and sekiro and im good at these games with keyboard and mouse. it wouldnt be even so dificult to add an option to idk use spells with 1 2 3 4 5 right? or idk spriting on same buton as dodge
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,i just dont agree maybe i need to play once more finished ds3 7 new game and i played pvp a lot i have 400 hours finished ds 2 and sekiro to didnt finish 1 yet cause i dont have time right now. but elden ring late game i thought the balance was bad and fights feelt off not all offcurse the lion guy that hrabs you was a really good fight one of the best. but mellania is one of the most lane bose designs i fought btw the game is verry beutifle that i agree

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"i honestly like them equally, which is nuts considering the blades of chaos were with kratos during the original gamesat least a variation of them"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,oh no this is a digital painting. i am mostly a traditional pastel artist but have been transitioning my process to digital and have really been learning a lot
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"technical presentation and narrative are probably the major ways. also consistency, elden ring finished a lot weaker than it started."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"truth is santa monica studios does amazing work gow 2018 had an expansive move set and the ability to customize through armor sets, talismans, and enchantments if ragnarok is anything close to similar than it stands a chance. open world games are nice but can become exhausting, a clear linear story focused game can pull off things open world games can't, look at dark souls when compared to elden ring. if you reply to this you'll say it's weak or a cop out but in truth i just don't see you as the type to enjoy the kind of game ragnarok will be and that's fine but don't count it out because it's not your cup of tea"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"god of war is far more cinematic than elden ring. really you can't even compare the two, they come from completely different design philosophies."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"if gow ragnarok is anything like its predecessor it will feature a more engaging story, better characters, and more dynamic and balanced combat. all its really going to lose in the trade for a higher overall level of quality is those gorgeous sweeping vistas. open worlds give more choices but many options end up unfeasible for most players to take any ways. the end result is often the illusion of more choices at the cost of quality in other areas, and elden ring is no different in that regard."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"well, since i'm seeing there's a clear bias here, i'm going to follow up my last post in a somewhat admittedly vindictive way gow developers are significantly better at optimization. elden ring's optimization was and continues to be a shitshow."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"the story. gow 2018's heart is really the fatherson relation between kratos and atreus. they just need to focus on that and tell a good story, and hopefully evade the obvious clich of atreus killing kratos at the end."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"i have an opinion, but op is so fucking biased there's no point stating it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,by having a good story and a satisfying ending. we know their world building is going to be on par
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"they're vastly different games, this is a silly question. gow has a broader appeal too."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"it has a chance, sure. it won't for me, but it definitely has a chance with the gaming public."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,fromsoft games are accessible to people who like fromsoft games. i always get lost and have no idea what i'm doing. but everyone can play a linear character based game and get sucked in emotionally. if it's as fun as the first one it'll probably knock out elden ring.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,more cinematic presentation more accessible story. less bullshit side quests tighter controls better camera more spectacular and mechanically engaging boss fights axes won't suck. not bogged down with crafting trash possibly a more dynamic and interactive game world.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,being good? you don't have to be revolutionary to be a spectacular game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,why won't you answer questions about what elden ring done differently for gaming? i've played it on pc when it released and it wasn't anything other than a open world dark souls 3. it's because they gave us a horse?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,op is just a fromsoft fanboy that won't hear any critiques about his precious elden ring. he's not even trying to hide it and it comes off as quite pathetic.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"elden ring was just another soul's game. it never understood the appeal of it and i own it. god of war is gonna be a masterful art of storytelling with a with a reverence for real world mythology, not to mention the larger than life but very grounded characters"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"by appealing more to the general consumer base. god of war comes from the modern sony school of homogenization in game design, wherein old genres gradually absorb more and more dna from their more popular contemporaries until they become more palatable to a wider range of people. it's why sony's games tend to be so similar. they're trying to cast as wide a net as they can to hook people in with one game, and then keep them buying sony games by virtue of them all being similar enough to entice the playerbase of another franchise. if you liked uncharted, you'll like the last of us and god of war. if you liked horizon, you'll like spiderman and ghosts. god of war used to be a characteraction game, but was diluted into being more of a cinematic adventure game with characteraction elements mixed in with rpglite mechanics. as a pure action game it pales in comparison to devil may cry, ninja gaiden, bayonetta, metal gear rising, etc. but evaluating it on those merits misses the point. they didn't want to make a more complex action game, because then that would alienate some of the casual player base that's intimidated by that genre. to sucker in the kind of audience that played the last of us, uncharted 4 and the rest, sony dumbed those mechanics down to make it more accessible, keeping just enough depth to make the player feel like they're being a total badass, even if the gameplay really isn't all that deep."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"i haven't played elden ring yet but i played all souls like except demon's and god of war and this question sounds pretty dumb to me, i don't think you can objectively compare two games that are likely to be very different, it's like asking how could crash bandicoot beat hollow knight?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,it already has surpassed elden ring for me because i don't care about soulslikes. different strokes for different folks.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"its most likely going to elden ring. but elden ring did have what i believe to be a smaller fan base than your standard action adventure game like god of war. i dont think gow is going to do anything ground breaking, but it is going to be extra popular because the aaa titles are a little thin right now."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,it has a bigger audience who enjoy gaming and story vs people who want a challenging boss fight and find the story themselves
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"also, no i'm going to ask. what on earth that i can do different. it basically took the combat of the last 5 games in that series and mixed it with a breath of a wild open world design."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"gow can have better narrative, be more consistent since elden ring gets kinda bad towards the end, have better optimization, more immersive combat, etc. i honestly think you're incredibly biased towards elden ring. i played the whole game and the only difference between other souls games is the open world, even then it's not perfect since there is a clear issue with constantly repeating bosses and dungeon layouts. imo it hasn't defined anything in gaming, just polished the open world thematic a bit and incorporated it to souls classic gameplay, which is good don't get me wrong, but let's not exaggerate please"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"they're extremely different genres and games, they don't need to compete. just enjoy them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"im not a big elden ring fan and i love gow, but i dont think it has much of a chance to win goty awards over elden ring unless it has something really innovative in its gameplay. i imagine its gameplay is going to be more of the same which im fine with, whereas elden ring was quite innovative within its genre. er was all anybody talked about for over a month, and it has the advantage of being on xbox, pc, and ps. the lack of any straightforward story in er was a huge turnoff for me, but it seems that im in the minority. i did appreciate er for what it was, though. personally, at the end, i imagine my goty will be either gow2 or grounded i unexpectedly love this game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,it doesn't need too i can enjoy both and be content
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,beat? at what? pong?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,god of war 2018 won against rdr2 so anything can happen.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-18,in sales by end of year? no. i doubt it will track 12 month sales either. i would be willing to put it at 8 million after 12 months. they pushed it out too far for tga goty contention this year. will it be the fastest and best selling ps5 title so far? yes. will it be the fastest and best selling gow so far? yes. do the playstation loyal deserve this win? absolutely.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-18,"could? a similar defining advancement in action combat, interactive narrative or dynamic campaign structure. alternatively it could win for being the best game judged solely on polish and acting. there's no shortage of people like that out there."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-21,"god of war 2018 was a great game that the general public loved, if ragnarok fixes gow 2018 issues with enemy variety, combat variety and pacing it coulddepending on how well it is done beat elden ring. elden ring is amazing, i am still playing, just need to beat malenia and the final bossidk who it is, but the ending is worse than the rest of the game unfortunately, the snow area is not that fun to explore like other regions were. so basically, if it has better gameplay than 2018 and good narrative pacing it could beat elden ring."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,what gives you the confidence that ragnarok will pull through?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,i actually agree with you.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,i'm sorry but saying they're two completely different games is a copout for figuring out what's the better game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,do you agree that the combat in ragnarok need to be higher in variations?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"i agree, from software is messy with it's optimization. you're definitely not wrong there."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,no amount of optimization is going to make the difference between god of war and elden ring. that's just silly.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,it'll definitely win in the story department.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,that's unfortunate

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,a weak response but i don't disagree.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,i have plenty of problems with elden ring. i don't believe in the perfect video game. if you state your problems with elden ring i might even agree with you.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"well let's look at that actually. aesthetically what do you prefer, crash bandicoot or hollow knight?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,well there you go.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,good point.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,that's actually a good point however it's also a playstation exclusive until a pc release.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,thank you for that honest response.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,exactly
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,red dead redemption 2 wasn't really anything groundbreaking in my opinion.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,and that was dumb
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-18,i agree.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,thats a cop out answer. what gives you the confidence it won't.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"i never said it would, you just asked about how it could. i either case elden ring isn't my goty anyway and i i doubt ragnarok will either."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,the last game was stellar and the trailers are also stellar
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-18,beaten the game. several times.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"i mean, about the only thing they have in common is that they're in a fantasyesque setting. god of war focuses a lot more on cinematic storytelling, while all soulsbourne games focus far more on indirect environmental storytelling. both tell compelling stories, just in much different ways. gameplay wise they're both satisfying, but god of war isn't aiming for the punishing difficulty the soulsbourne boasts about. really the only way they're similar is that they do have a dodgeparry centric battle system."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,not quite sure what you mean by variation but in any case i'd probably disagree. some games are best experienced in the first playthrough and don't need to offer more than enough to keep its gameplay fresh for that much time.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"well god of war you actually have an expansive move set you can use to combo or juggle your enemies, etc. many people will find that more fun than spamming r1 or trying to do an ash of war and realizing the boss doesnt even have an opening large enough for you to get it off without getting hit."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,it's 2022 mate. people don't care about gameplay anymore. people would give a movie goty at this point.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,just not into god of war. and i'm really into soulsborne.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-18,the two trolls at the start of bloodborne have been yelling that at me for two years lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-31,did you actually play it?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-13,lol ok
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"elden ring is an excellent game, but it's also got some serious jank and underbaked elements"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-18,"its too big. its so big that half of it means nothing. they created a vastly open but abhorrent empty open word with one of the most weak storytelling narrative designs in all of modern gaming. half the story is barely fleshed out in any meaningful way. the replayability of elden ring actual isnt very high literally because the game is so big. anyone aside from fromsoft stans that somehow have 1000 hours a month to play will finish one play through and deem a second too long to commit to. the characters are pretty basic, none of them can really be connected with. what elden ring has going for it is versatility of combat and a push to discover the world a world, not necessarily a welldesigned world. questing is disguised behind lack of markers. people think oh the quests are so dynamic, but theyre all literally fetch quests. find a person. talk to person. move on. thats it. fromsoft fans love it because they love fromsoft games and they love the challenge of the combat. but games are primarily an interactive story and if you cant connect well to the characters and the story youve missed a really important part of gaming. plenty of categories aside from open world and hard combat"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"i totally prefer hollow knight but this is just a matter of personal taste, i believe it's pointless to compare two games that are so vastly different"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,i just want them to remake blood borne lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-18,"i know that everyone has its own opinion and stuff. but you can't deny that it was indeed groundbreaking in a lot of things. like graphics, open world design, physics, realism, attention to detail, enviromental storytelling, ... and even 4 years after release it still let look new aaa games look like trash."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-18,i just realized that it will do audio a lot better. full surround with 3d audio. if santa monica is playing to the strengths of the system they should have leaned hard on the adaptive triggers and 3d audio.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,just the amount elden ring achieves as a finished game. god of war 2018 was also a very finished game but suffers in variety for replay value depending on your ambitions with it due to the lack of combat choices and outcomes.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,then what will? if you say stray then i'm out lol.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,feel free to point out the contradiction. there's more that sets them apart than makes them similar.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,if it has a strong narrative or first playthrough experience it doesn't need to be replayable at all. the weaker the story or first experience the more replayability it should have to compensate.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,"of course it does? how is that related to replayability? sekiro has amazing gameplay, but its action focus gives me little reason to play it more than once. bloodborne's lovecraftian midgame twist is best experienced on the first playthrough and its gameplay is smooth and very refined so it really only needed the handful of weapon options it gave us for replayability."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,gameplay is the most important aspect of replay value. i can watch a playthrough on youtube if i want to watch the story but gameplay wise i can alternate my experience through it's depth.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,that's an interesting attempt for a comparison but we're asking about entertainment. that chocolate comparison would work better if you were referring to typing something versus handwriting something. i commend your effort though.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-17,gameplay can be good and offer limited replay value. gameplay can be bad but offer a lot of options. your definition sucks.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,i hate people who just accept this just like micro transactions. at least make the digital versions cheaper! come on! you cant tell me it cost so much to sell those. i bet there will actually be more people with less money buying it for cheap so in the end itll actually probably make them more profit. like how how mcdonalds makes billions off selling for less but to more people because of low costs. its funny because i heard sony actually got sued recently for their prices. also 10 more for ps5 version is messed up. its just slight improvements and before it used to be free. the problem is us accepting stuff like this which lets them slowly increase prices!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"because everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it. if its too expensive for you, wait for a sale. the only time there is ever a rush to buy a game is when its going to be delisted and you dont want to pirate it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"compare games now to games back in the 80's what was then a product of small teams with limited capabilities is now a media phenomenon that rivals film studios. when you calculate inflation, those old games would sometimes cost over 100 on today's shelves. when you consider the production value and price history, we're actually getting a pretty good deal for a 60 aaa game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,theres always gotta be those well actually it used to cost 100 so stop complaining people. like yeah maybe but 70 bucks is still alot of money to drop.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,trying to get someone to buy it for you or something? what is the point of this post?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,like bruh 70quid for a story game most new games are 5060 no reason to be 70 as the standard edition. this game already has so much hype there's no need for it to be that much
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"70 is 10 more than new aaa games have been for decades. i'm not saying i want to pay more, but a 10 increase after more than 20 years of steady pricing doesn't seem unreasonable."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,the original legend of zelda retailed for 49.99tax in 1986 when it launched in north america. that's the equivalent of 135.38 in today's money. please tell me again how expensive video games are.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,because the people who made it need to get paid for their work
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,its 10 more than before. new games have always been expensive. just wait like 23 months and usually it will be on sale for 1015 off.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"why are games that people poor their heart souls and minds into, costs millions, professionally done and gives us hours upon hours of content expensive? uuum reevaluate that question."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"while i wouldn't complain if games were cheaper, realistically games are one of the cheapest servicesitems you can buy."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,prices for aaa games have hardly increased for over 20 years. just wait for a sale. most games go on sale a couple months after release. or maybe you wont even want it later
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"they arent. in fact, games are much cheaper now. just like a tv. tvs are practically free now."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,sounds like you should re adjust your priorities.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"because making quality aaa games is unbelievable expensive, and they aren't running a charity???"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,years of ridiculously high quality effort is why. if you put in years of ridiculously high quality effort i would wager you could afford the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,yet people will still pay full price for a game that is basically a dlc of gow 2018 xd
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"why are games expensive, particularly aaa games? because they take an incredible amount of work from large, complex organizations. they're also a huge amount of content most of the time. based on a quick google, the god of war campaign was around 20 hours if you just hammered straight through, and up to 50 if you really got the most out of it. that's between 10 and 25 movies worth of work  animations, dialogue, sound design, music, level design, art design, lighting, game mechanics and on and on. imagine producing 25 interactive movies. red dead redemption 2 was between 50 and 80 hours, with some much detail in it's world that it's hard to wrap your head around sometimes. that game was 59.99 when it came out. 70 is a lot of money to spend on a game, i get that. but for the right game it's incredible value for money. this is why it's so frustrating when aaa games release that are broken, unrealized messes  because there is so much potential there."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,well from what the reviews say you should wait till it goes on sale
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,get a friend you trust and share accounts or the disk.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"if anything, games have gotten cheaper. i'm pretty sure i spent 90100 bucks on starfox 64 and that was in the 90s. we just got used to the 60 bucks price tag for so long and steam sales. a new aaa game is gonna push whatever the market rate should be more so with collector editions on the flip side, vampire survivors is only a few dollars and gave me over 100 hours of enjoyment."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"i feel you man, i have to wait until games go on sale to play them, usually already spoiled to hell, i bought gow 2018 in lime 2020 at 30, couldn't wait any longer to play it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"why are games so expensive? because increasingly few people work because they like what they do, and almost everyone wants to be richer and get more money out of others. and they don't give a shit if you particularly can't pay enough. that's why."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,i'm 44. gaming is cheaper than it's ever been. i was paying 4050 for games in the 90s. i think you should just buy games on sale. there's really no need to buy games when they first come out nowadays. you can find half price sales on them after a couple months nowadays. we never had that in the 90s. we also didn't have a full library of free games to play.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,its 125 on the ps5 store. wtf

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,idk man it sucks i hope you get it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-25,i hate how they don't offer refunds just cause you installed that game. very illegal in australia but they get away with it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,this most games are definitely not worth 70 bucks and you see it clear as day in how quickly they go on sale in just a few months
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,in the 90s some games cost 100 in those dollars.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,i understand but why do we not compare it with movies? a blu ray on day one will cost you 20 euros. if you add the ticket price to it it is going to be max 3540 euros. it is understandable that a big team works for years on a game. but so do people in hollywood producing movies.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,why would it matter how much games cost back in the day? the issue is now! no one gives a toss of how much it cost to you back in the 80s.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,chrono trigger came out in the 90s and that game was over 70 at launch. same with some n64 games when they came out in the 90s too. people are getting a bargain now compared to what they paid 1520 years ago.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,average redditer
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"keep in mind inflation, too. zelda 1 was 49.99 in 1986 dollars. that's 135.38 by today's money."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,this person gets it. some other nes games that came out in the late 80s were around 49.99 and you could beat them in 2 to 4 hours. imagine paying 135 for a game you could beat in just a few hours. you get a whole lot more for your money today.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,the cost of living is a joke to you huh?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"yea sure and its the consumers fault, not the ceos who take millions and dont pay their overworked employees . at least charge 50 for digital versions new. it probably cost very little to resupply"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"yeah, sony really seems to be hurting... poor sony!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"in the us, the average price of a tv is roughly 400 roughly 2000 stones412 euros360 pounds. not everyone has that money"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"yep. the original zelda on nes retailed for 49.99tax. most games back in the day would be the equivalent of about 110130 in today's money. tvs are dirtcheap now, too, you're right. an 55 lg oled55b7a was 2,300 just six years ago in 2017. i got a 65, also an lg, for 550 february this year."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,sounds like it's none of your business.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"a standard film lasts around 2 hours. an average aaa game main story takes 20 to 30 hours or longer. regardless of how you compare apples to oranges, companies will sell their games at a profitable price that most people are willing and able to pay. otherwise, no one would be able to afford the game, no one would buy the game, and the company would lose out."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,video games are still relatively niche compared to blockbuster movies. the number of people that will see the next marvel movie is many times greater than the number of people that will buy a typical aaa game. and games generally take longer to produce
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"to be honest, back then making games were huge deal, the hardware was not top notch like today, anything related to computer was hard to operate to create these files, internet was barely a thing and buying games was not easy cause you didn't had sites like steam or psn stores or any ecommerce websites. so price was huge back then because compared to today the access was not easy at all"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,that's a lot cheaper than hdtvs were in the past. my previous tv was a 40inch 1080p toshiba i got for a very good deal at 329.99tax in 2015 or so. my current tv is a 60inch 4k lg tv i got for 550tax.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,sounds like i don't care.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,thats not entirely accurate. the gaming industry is significantly larger than the movie industry and has been for well over a decade now. currently its bigger than hollywood and the entire music industry combined.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,video games are actually the biggest form of entertainment rn so its the opposite of niche
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,true they definitely had a smaller audience to sell to. gaming has grown enormously since the 90s. but back then a game like chrono trigger and final fantasy were like aaa stuff of their time. cost to make a final fantasy game on the snes was way cheaper and less labor intensive than what goes into making a modern ff like ff15 or the ff7 remake. having more people to buy the games now though helps with the cost.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,aww looks like someones triggered lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"how is it not a fair comparison? we're talking about what consumers had to pay for games, not how much they made."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,enough to respond.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"monetary wise, they also charge more than movies and have lots and lots of revenue streams built into the games and continue to support those game. because players can stay engaged more than an hour or too per purchase they get more value out of it. more people still actually watch movies."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,i am. people talking gleefully about the past as a sort of rectal lubricant to ease getting fucked triggers me. any other deep insights?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"physical media was also bigger back then. it costs 0 dollars to produce millions of digital copies compared to physical discs with boxes, yet the price remains the same. my advice to op is to never pay more than 20 bucks for a videogame."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"the biggest cost to publishers for games media has always been the license fee they pay to console manufacturers. the actual cost of producing physical games media has been under 1unit ever since consoles switched to cdsdvdsblurays. that's part of the reason game prices went down when the ps1 launched cartridges were expensive. that's why chrono trigger cost more at launch than any final fantasy on the ps1, despite the latter games being multiple discs."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"i used zelda as an example, but focusing on zelda specifically is irrelevant. consoles have not significantly increased their output in a manner which should dictate a massive unitonunit cost decrease, economically speaking. the gameboy edition of tetris moved 43 million units. super mario world, 26,662,500 units. pokemon redblueyellow eventually sold 47,520,000 units, despite being an og gameboy title, and not only remains king of all pokemon titles in terms of sales, but also beats any single call of duty's sales records. the number of games sold and consoles sold has not increased that dramatically. eight out of the twenty bestselling consoles of all time launched prior to the year 2000."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"there are other costs to physical media than just simple production. logistics and exports being the primary, once again nonexistent in the digital realm. on the topic of license fees though, why would playstation studios pay license fees when they own their publisher owns the platform? ultimately the worth of any product is decided by the individual consumer's evaluation of it, and i have to say i agree with op."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-03,"i agree. ragnarok was worst one yet. gameplay and story were classic and predictable, but it was good. however thing i hated was game was rushed, there should have been at least one more game odin seems too modern and too human, i don't expect them to act like greek gods, but they act like some sicilian mafia with modern slangs. thor and heimdall were the only ones who felt like gods. it turned into comedy. there are too many jokes and happy moments, kratos' development was too quick, it just felt like it happened over night. freya forgave kratos too quickly, it also felt rushed boss fights were awful and boring, especially odin's fight. i understand that they want to be more realistic but the price is entertainment. i excpected odin's fight to be like poseidon's, with him revealing his true form and power, killing freya or even kratos. i expected them to fight on the tree going from realm to realm and everything going nuts. instead, we got boring human fight with some magic effects and many many quirky jokes don't forget me motherfucker it felt very easy and comedic, not at all what gow should be like. not many deaths. even tho it's sad and hard, i wanted more of characters to die, even disney movies were more emotional than ragnarok. tr... game is not worst thing that happened, it was still quite enjoyable to watch, but it was very very dissapointing. everything should have been more epic..."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,let me guess you are an elden ring fan correct?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,never played it but it sucks

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,aren't you embarrassed about paying a service charge to play games online?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,do you think it is funny that 2 answers to 2 different peoples questions was rigatoni?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-09,in a era of remakes how would you feel about god of war 13 remade using the 2018 god of war engine. iv always wanted god of war 2 remade ever since god of war 3 came out. i don't know why but god of war 2 was always a 0.5 better then god of war 3 lol something about it felt more personal and epic.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-16,"i am feeling a bit the same about this game, so my question to you is, what's rigatoni?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-15,i think the same the gameplay was boring for 80 of the time the pacing was too slow and it's missing the cool finishers and gory mechanics idk it was too generic for me i had to quit it the story was mostly good though but norse stuff just isn't that cool to me man
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-31,"little late, but for me the story was ok. i do agree that the kratos development change was slightly rushed, but it turned out well. also like you said, odin fight should've been more epic, like they should have him rip his cloak off and teleporting kratos, atreus and freya to another realm would've been epic as hell to see. i just hope the next game, they could at least add more content and new mechanics to make it feel different from the last two games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-05,precisely
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,the lack of interesting gameplay challenges was kind of insulting.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,oh yes. all of them.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"1. because the level design looked better along with the more traversal gameplay. 2. this year alone for example have been elden ring, frogun and lego bricktales."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,i agree.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,mostly gameplay but the story was also really safe instead of something risky which is what i prefer.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,rigatoni
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,yep.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,i actually prefer rigatoni
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,awesome
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,ikr?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,i feel about the same really.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,i think so but not much more.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,i'm not sure what you're talking about.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,i just want a discussion.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,thanks.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,i have never liked slow cinematic scenes like following npcs.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,i am and the gameplay was really weak in my opinion.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,not relevant.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,thats relevant how?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,rent free
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"no, i was actually very disappointed with that game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,what?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,haha yeah
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-09,i would absolutely love a full remaster of all three original games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-16,just another italian dish.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-02,"plot wasn't awful, but execution was. i had fun playing it, but i don't see it as some masterpiece that people call it. humour was overused and character development was predictable and cliche... it's not bad game, but it's far from good game. i prefer greek triology, even if characters are little flat, story was more original and bosses were more epic"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,onrails hack  slash
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,i've never played any game in the series but the new ones don't look as fun as the old ones in the first place. are the old ones mostly hack 'n slash? are they... linear or level based? what about puzzles and backtracking? i'm not sure what to expect i guess.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"1. fair point 2. not heard of the last two  i'll check them out. if you have a ps5, i recommend returnal"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,"i've always found open world to be the most overrated thing in gaming. it's fine for variety but the idea that wondering around aimlessly is better, is interesting."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,"just got bricktales, a truly underrated game. would love to see more added in the future"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,i agree.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,iam a fromsoft fan myself but sure you want discussion? i have read some of your responses and your main reasoning was gameplay im going to assume you are talking about the combat how is it worse than something like elden ring?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,this is not the first post people hating on gow ragnarok and 9 times out of 10 its from an elden ring fan.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,yep
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,to answer your other question completely linear so no backtracking
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,everything is better in the older games in my opinion but it's all hack n slash.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,i tried returnal but i got bored with the level design.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,i agree.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,i'm trying to avoid comparisons for this discussion. i want to speak mainly about ragnarok without mentioning other games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,super mario bros. 3
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,cheers! i might try one out if i see it on sale once again.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,okay now i know you have bad taste
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,again what makes the gameplay bad?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,the first god of war is rough but the rest are amazing.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,if that makes you feel better. i may try it again sometime but it's not what i'm currently looking for in a game plus i'm not the biggest fan of roguelike games.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,mainly the default enemy encounters that's scattered a lot throughout the game with some combat aspects didn't compliment each other well at all and some were health sponges simply which made the gameplay stale for me. just overall a bland experience for me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"i wish you would elaborate more, like what is wrong with the encounters? what aspects of the combat didnt compliment each other. and when were enemies health sponges? i personally didnt encounter any unless they were berserkers or mini bosses that are few levels higher than me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"sorry, i'm getting a lot of responses. mainly the level design wasn't complimenting the enemies or enemies didn't compliment each other."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"the only time where i do agree that the enemies dont compliment each other is when there is a mini boss mixed in with a big encounter otherwise the encounters were properly designed and the ai is smart enough to always overwhelm you, as for the level designim going to assume you are talking about the combat arenas they are actually a massive improvement over the last game and it allows you to use the environments to your advantage and you can mix it in with some aerial attack."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,perhaps i should have done the side missions to obtain more gear but i didn't want to get constantly road blocked by tool restrictions and health sponges. anyway the gameplay is just a minor concern. what i'm truly disappointed about is the cinematics and how interrupting they are with some segments lasting almost an hour. i don't care about a qte bar brawl or slowly riding a bull through the woods. i wish it could be skipped.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-30,stop fucking quoting me every time a game gets delayed. i said that shit in the 90s when games couldn't receive updates or patches after release. just cause a game gets delayed doesn't mean it's automatically going to be a good game that's not even what i fucking meant.  shigeru miyamoto

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-30,"well halo infinite, cyberpunk and duke nukem forever are saying otherwise"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-30,it didnt get delayed. that statement that the team put up is a plead to the community to be considerate and stop spoiling people. cant even look at youtube because my recommendations will spoil me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-30,say that to daikatana
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-30,a delayed game can still be crap though.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-30,"i completely second this, the devs were trying hard to make cyberpunk a somewhat playable game i.e. completing the game without having to reload every 3rd mission because your companion was bugged but it is still sad to see that almost every big title is on launchday a bugfest that in my eyes ruins the whole gaming experience"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-30,"well lets just say it was when it released bugged i.e. story missions weren't completable, first person view was incredibly cursed you would get into a car and your arms where somewhere to your side alwys rotating when you would drive a corner, some npcs randomly falling of buildings killing themselves just to name a few that i was encountering on release day. it was crashing on most ps4 systems so sony had to take it down from the store. there are still some videos up on yt where they listed all the game breaking andor minor bugs and glitches"

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-30,the poors and master pc race lmao. i can tell youre a douche
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-30,i'd argue it was rushed. the game was launched with almost no content at all. i have heard it's made some improvements now but i'm so turned off by my early experience i have no desire to play it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-30,oh it did read like you just started playing cyberpunk. i think everyone had a difference experience since the launch on consolepc. well i can't really tell whats wrong with the game nowadays because i played it the last time around august last year. but i think there are still some youtubers that list some bugs or glitches in the game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-30,"ah. ok. on pc, it never was."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-30,"maybe. but i am a thrifty douche. not gonna throw thousands at an rgb nightmare, but have a good lil pc that can play cp at max settings, but plays on medium. and just one red strip of light, to show it's on."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,to be honest this doesnt really look that much better than the last version graphically
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,so is this going to be just for the ps5 or also the ps4..
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"this game will be undeniably great, but i can't help but lament that the gameplay looks 99 like the last game. even graphically, while still amazing, looks identical. like if you showed me a screenshot of the 2018 game vs a screenshot of the trailer, i probably couldn't tell you which was which aside from new enemies. also, this is probably going to be a trilogy, so i'm bracing myself for the game ending on an unsatisfying cliffhanger like the last one did."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"there is a god of war audiobookhttpswww.audible.compdgodofwaraudiobook1982595892, which is basically the game in audiobook form sans gameplay, where it is narrated by the va for mimir in his voice. it's pretty nice."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"yep, going have to finally buy a ps5."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,"i think they're trying to give you a lot without giving you anything, if that makes sense. give you little taste of all the little points to give you an idea but make it so that everything is still a surprise when you actually see it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,they probably dont want to give too much away. im actually shocked that they showed tyr. thats a pretty massive thing to show in a trailer
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,"ryan hurst, he played opie in sons of anarchy and was also in twd."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,kind of sounded like richard brake to me.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,"times are changing, you can only get so much better after diminishing returns. in the coming years styalization is going to be the next big thing."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,60fps bruh. makes a world of difference.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,i thought so too
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,thought it was just me and not being able to identify all the new fandangled ray tracing and shit. i'm still on last gen and haven't pulled the trigger for a ps5 yet because i can't tell the difference.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,"im pretty sure its supposed to be available on the ps4 as well, and the previous one was already stretching the limits of the ps4."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,it's on ps4 and ps5.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,surely ps4? how many people were actually able to buy a ps5 at this point? not a lot id guess.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"if you ask me, i'm glad there's only gonna be a 4 year wait for the sequel, kinda tired of some franchises taking 6 years off in order to reinvent themselves when the base premise was already great."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"it's not a trilogy. in the showcase they confirmed this game will be the finale of the norse saga. weird decision imo, seems this game is gonna have to be long af lmao"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"but this makes sense, because ragnarok is the theme of the game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,i mean god of war is awesome at blending the cinematics into actual gameplay so it kind of is
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,"when sony releases it as a trailer, live in their showcase? yeah, ill word it however they did. tale it up with them, not me if this leaves you unsatisfied lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"gameplay is gameplay, mate. more than what we got from the wolverine or spiderman 2 trailers."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"did not know this existed, pretty cool."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,it'll be on ps4 as well!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,good luck. literally impossible.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,just saw this video and told my wife i needed a ps5 finally
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,yeah i got that and appreciate it but the editing just feels really off to me. it almost feels like a first draft that was supposed to get shined up later
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-09,its probably an early game scene
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,i also thought that the 2018 game was ahead of it's peers by a longshot. i'm glad they didn't change much because the graphics were already great.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i disagree. we said the same thing 10 years ago, and boi have we been proven wrong time and time again. only reason you think that way is because at the time you just don't know better. x200b stylization at this point have become a budgetary concern more than anything."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,the original one is 60 fps on the ps5. though it looks like ragnarok has bit better lighting and reflections.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"raytracing you'll notice mostly in stuff like spiderman. it shows realistic reflections, all of the windows in that on skyscrapers reflect what's going on, even bouncing reflections between windows if 2 skyscrapers are next to each other. also look at showcase of rtx minecraft, that really shows off how it works and stuff."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"im not sure why youre being downvoted, availability is terrible right now in my country"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,halo infinite...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"i certainly think there's some things they can improve on. namely, combat. zoom the camera back so i can see who's sniping me in the back all the time. that's what i'd like to see. but i agree i suppose, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. they don't need to reinvent the wheel when they just did with the 2018 version."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,"still bracing myself for that unsatisfying cliffhanger ending. i've been here, before. i'll believe it's the end when i see it. but i wont holdout on promises. especially when sony is terrified of doing anything new or different."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,haha another cliffhanger ending for him to end up in egypt.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-10,its really not impossible. you have to use trackers and follow drops but its completely doable.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-30,"thats what i been saying. the puzzles also suck total ass both in their design 99 of puzzles are throw axe at a spot or carry this rock over there and how they can teach gameplay mechanics. in old god of wars there were puzzles mixed in with platforming to master movement of your character and timingspacing of the environment. there were ple ty of co.bat focused puzzles to teach you different skills or magic spells, get you acquainted with high damage combos to kill these enemies within the time limit. interesting dynamic puzzle design that serves as a hidden tutorial ks what's missing from the new games along with their other faults."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-30,i don't think this is controversial. different folks different strokes.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-05,i hate this franchise. highly overrated.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"i also found it boring, couldn't finish it. only reason i even got it was because the only ps4 at the time available in gamestop came with a copy of the game. it's not a game where i can't understand why people enjoyed it but it definitely just wasn't for me"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,i thought the same thing at first. ended up picking the game back up a few weeks later and i loved it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"i like the game, but felt it had more backtracking than i enjoyed."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,i think you went into a beat em up game and was upset it was a beat em up
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,i liked it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"tldr it is a slow paced, narrative heavy game and i understand that may not appeal to everyone but i think it's far from boring. personally i found rdr2 much more daunting. again, not bad or boring, just a lot to take in storywise when i'd rather be shooting things."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-30,you played on an easy difficulty if you can just spam r1 and win. is it any surprise that when you play on rartcunt settings it allows even the most rarted cunt to win?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-25,"for most of the game, you just fight boring npcs. it's only worth checking for those god battles, but there are just not enough of them"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-29,i'm playing it and i keep getting baffled why it's got such high marks and ratings. it's so boring in many ways. i'm just playing it until it's finally over. thor is so lame and kratos is a little bitch. atreus is annoying. mimir too.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-24,"i just uninstalled it today for the same reasons. many months ago i gave it a try, combat was way off from the very beginning, spongy enemies killed the game for me. i got to this whole magic bridge, jumping between different worlds, i was completly burned out. it was the first time i met new types of enemies, but it was way too late. never bothered to finish this game, it's awful design"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,agreed very much so. i think ragnarok is the same. it also lacks the context for the looting and exploring in the game like last of us
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"play give me god of war and youll see that mastering combos will help. i love games that open a combo system up to me but dont expect me to use all of it. kind of like kingdom hearts in a way. they have extensive combat to fill any playstyle in any situation. they give the option to block or parry. not good at blocking, hold it down. it will defend you but youll need to wait for an opening. but good at it? block right when he attacks and counter and now its your turn. want to retreat and still attack? you can do that. want to keep your distance but still put damage in? you can throw the axe. my issue with this analysis is that you sound as though you have no desire to self improve. yes you dont need to use all these advanced combos but if you go into a situation and just mash the attack button with no variety, you will get bored very fast. if you go in and dont try to take in the lore, the story will bore you. doing these combos finishes fights faster and lets you know how far youve come. that self improvement i mentioned earlier. you feel a sense of pride knowing that you can enter a room full of different enemies and clear the area in no time flat taking no damage because youve learned the mechanics to that degree. ive done it on the hardest difficulty and new game plus and it was so hard yet so rewarding. especially since i wore the full zeus armor where you get killed in 12 hits. its a glass cannon build. to say ive done that to other people that know how hard that is, is just nice to see."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,welcome to modern game design.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"i hate war, if that counts but the game is pretty cool."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"agreed, i also think the story is hot ass. it's just you going up a mountain, realizing you need an artifact to get rid of black fog, go down mountain, get artifact, go back up mountain, realize you're on the wrong mountain, go back down, open up a portal to correct mountain, break the portal for no fucking reason to said mountain! then try to find another way to the mountain. also you fight the sane stupid fucking troll boss like 80 times. the plot is so fucking lazy and lame that i really can't understand why everyone loves the story to the game so much. with all that said though, i thought ragnarok was actually pretty great."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,ragnarok is even worse.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"you can just hit r1 the entire game  skill upgrades are not necessary  damage sponge enemies on higher difficulties  bland combat bro your points here are so selfcontradicting. for some reason you believe that r1 spam the whole game is viable. the game indirectly tells you no by making enemies harder to kill so player would try something different. but your response to that is to complain that the difficulty is shit, lower it down, and proceed to keep r1 spam. seriously? for small reference, you can literally one shot basic enemy on gmgow by launching it then heavy axe throwing it into wall or tree. aesthetically improve the system??? honestly you have no one to blame but yourself and your high horse ego soulsbourne fans again, not surprised for ruining the game for you. there are thousands of youtube videos out there destroying hardest difficulty in case you might want to open your mind for a bit but i'm not expecting much."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,try putting the difficulty up past average. then the combos will be necessary lol. try at the game. that will make you enjoy it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,sounds like you should rather play asgards wrath
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-30,yeah it can be repetitive.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,i was tired of gow by the time the 2nd one came out on ps2! i really dislike hardmodes like that too. i'd rather have more and smarter enemies instead of bullet sponges.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,most of your complaints are fixed by playing on the hardest difficulty. the idea is that you are given less wiggle room to mess up fights and need to maximize your character's loadout better. i like how you say sekiro is your favorite game but having played that myself it suffers from the exact same problems you say the hardest difficulty of this game suffers from. it honestly just sounds like a contrarian point of view.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,then don't play it. it's not a controversial take. not everyone likes every single fucking game ever made. god dammit. give yer balls a tug.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,didn't read but imo first half was pretty good but then it started to get boring.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,youre boring
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-30,"idk how far you get into the game, but saying the game is a r1 spam and skill  upgrades didn't matter after trying gmgow tells me you didn't too far, r1 spam is literally only viable on lower difficulty, and skill  gear matters in gmgow. bullet sponge difficulty does sucks and i hate it with passion, especially on early game when you got nothing, but it gets easier as you unlock more stuff, but not so much that you can just blaze through the encounter. and honestly i enjoy gmgow difficulty a lot, especially after you defeat the more difficult end game bosses. and there's nothing controversial about not enjoying a game, even objectively good games, me and tbh a lot of people don't enjoy competitive fps game, are those game objectively bad? not really."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-22,"the worst part is that they killed literally everything about the existing god of war series in order to make it. like... why? if you're going to change literally every mechanic in the game and completely change the personality of the main character then could you please just make a new series instead, so that there's a chance that you can go back to making the kinds of games that fans already liked?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-05,"yeah i tried to like it but everything seems to be predictable and boring. i played in the maximum difficulty when i started and i thought to myself that with skill i can finish the game but damn, the difficulty in this game is done horribly wrong. i guess i'm partly to blame since i came from playing souls game wherein skills matter rather than upgrades on your character, specifically sekiro and elden ring. the challenge in this game is not something you would enjoy, fortunately i didn't have to pay to play this game. the only thing that carries the game are the story and kratos, other than that its just mundane exploring."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-22,"i don't even remember there really being puzzles in gow 2018. the puzzle chests were all just i spy or being fast at throwing your axe at stuff. also, i haven't finished the new one yet, but holy fucking shit do they need to tone down the npc chatter. we come into an area and before i can even finish my first glance at what's there, the npcs are talking about how to solve whatever the mechanics are. like, if you're not going to let me solve the puzzle then don't even put it in the game. the actual solving is the fun part, going through the motions of completing the mechanics is just the chore."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-24,you mean different strokes for different folks?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"to be fair, god of war is known for flashy and crunchy combat. i was also underwhelmed when i started. being stuck with the axe is not what fans wanted."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"from day one i wasn't a fan of rdr2. i've always found the gameplay boring and repetitive. it's filled with incredible levels of detail that for me, added absolutely nothing to the enjoyment of the game.i saw someone post a video of how realistically the npcs ate food and my thought was they should have taken that effort and put it towards more diverse story missions. you'd have to be blind and insane to call it a bad game but it does have some serious issues."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"i feel the same with rdr2. i have tried many times to get through it, but i just find myself running around and doing random stuff rather than the story. might be a controversial take, but i can't stand the combat in rdr2."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-22,"i'm playing it and i keep getting baffled why it's got such high marks and ratings. it's hard to say if it's because people have convinced themselves that the emperor is wearing clothes, or if they're too afraid to say that he's not."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-17,"ive started it a week ago, ive completed the first three mainquests and im bored out of my mind"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-30,self improvement is only a random want of the player in new god of war when it was a requirement in previous games. a good combat system in a game doesn't dump a bunch of bullshit at your feet and says do whatever i don't care. humans easily fall into the route of least resistance if it's super easy to obtain and there's 0 reason for the alternative. it's why most people only use super shotgun with gause canon in doom 2016. there's little reason to use anything else. then comes doom eternal and gives you plenty of dynamic reasons to use your entire arsenal.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-25,it doesn't
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-30,the pacing of atreus is also hilarious. when he learns he's a god he suddenly acts super cringe and edgy then is told to stop and he does just as soon as it starts. best part is when he almost dies.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,removed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"take a couple deep breaths. my issue with the higher difficulty is that it almost forces people to go the r1 spam method. obviously im exaggerating a bit here, throwing in heavies and axe tosses is expected. but the real creative shit you see people doing is not the most effective. and i dont think higher difficulty encourages people to be creative, i think it discourages creativity. you are allowed to have your opinion, and youre allowed to disagree with me, but if youre getting this defensive cause i dont like your game then maybe the ego issue is elsewhere."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,ill check it out thanks
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-25,you gotta stroke different folks
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-24,"yeah because youre stuck with the axe the whole game yep, totally"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,you are the spokesman of fans? lmao. both games are massiv hits.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-30,"it's the shooting. pull the trigger, shoot. pull the trigger, cock weapon? pull the trigger, both? i've been playing this game for a week and i still don't know how how the shooting mechanic works. i also accidentally killed someone i shouldn't bc i went to punch them and stabbed them in the neck. i've never even equipped the knife."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-22,that emperor is lame too
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-18,yh i haven't played it in weeks.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,except the last of us one sounds way better also i didn't even really take out context lol that is quite literally what the entire story is. only thing i left out really is that the reason they wanna go to the mountain is to spread fayes ashes. the baldur parts are the only cool parts of the game.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-25,ayo?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-26,"it's been 4 months but i'm commenting anyways. how revolvers work is 1. single action this is the first thing you must do, this rotates the cylinder to the next round, after which  pulling the trigger releases the hammer which also contains a firing pin, the hammer hits the back of the round, and the round is fired. everytime you want to fire, you must first cock the hammer. 2. double action in a doubleaction revolver, pulling the trigger generates two actions first, the hammer is pulled back to the cocked position while the cylinder is being rotated to the next round, followed by the second action where the hammer is released, striking the firing pin. this allows for uncocked carry and drawandfire using only the trigger. rdr2 features both of these types. in my playthrough, i simply never bothered to do anything fancy, if i needed to shoot, i just clicked a bunch. played thru the game 3x like this, lol. one of my favorite games of all time, but having gotten my playtime through, i can see why many people struggled with it. it's a long haul, but for some, quite worth it. i had one of my friends buy it on steam and he quit 6 hours in, however to my happy surprise, i saw thru steam friends that he had picked it back up and beaten it a month later."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,it really isn't. yes that's the goal of the story but that's just a plot device to push the characters into their journey and tell the real story which is about the relationship between kratos and atreus and atreus discovering who and what he really is along with kratos' past. getting his mother's ashes to the top of the mountain is not the main focal point.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"what are you saying dude. the whole reason they go on the adventure is to spread the ashes, that makes it the main point! also even if u don't think it's the main point you're seriously telling me that it's a good plot device? cause it isn't, it's awful. the way the main story progresses is dog ass that is just used to pad time. also kratos and atreus relationship doesn't even change in this game, in ragnarok it does."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"it's about the journey, not the destination, as many, many stories are. just because a character has a particular goal or destination in mind does not mean that is the main thing the writer wishes you to focus on. it's a very simple concept used in many great works. if you can't understand that i don't know what to tell hoh. i personally found the story very enjoyable, as did millions of others. if you don't that's fine but you're coming off incredibly toxic in how you are expressing it and i have no interest in continuing such an unproductive conversation."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,"lol not even toxic, the journey to get there is unbelievably boring because it's just you backtracking every where, it's honestly a very valid criticism. especially when the enemies you fight are just a bunch of re skins. these are all glaring issues people have with the game lol"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,the game is mostly linear. it does open up somewhat with side content and there are some great optional fights and quests but its not a true open world game. the combat gets way better though once you get more abilities and gear so if thats your focus you wont be disappointed on that front.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,did you playenjoy the first?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"its not for everyone. yes it gets better, but theres still too much walkingtalkingpuzzles compared to combat"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"the game does open up, but you have to look for it too. if you follow atreus the whole time, it's linear, but every time he says to go one way, there is usually something pretty sweet the other direction"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"hot take but i would say no it doesnt get better. the linear puzzles are constant and the semi open world felt like it was used as a device to just incorporate more of them. many of the side quests boil down to just completing more puzzles. you get more weapons and arrows to.. you guessed it, complete different puzzles. basically if youre tired of them now the game will be a drag."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,i had the same issue with the 2018 one but then really enjoyed it as i progressed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"i as going to ask this as well, beat me to it, lol!!!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,play gow 2018 and then ragnarok! gow 2018 was my first gow game and i was stunned! amazing combat and glorious storytelling! love it!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"are you a fromsoft stan? because if you are, you won't enjoy it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,i played it for 2 hours which 1.5 was me walking around watching a movie game is trash.!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,yea i made it about 12 hrs before it just became repetitive garbage that i kept falling asleep playing
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"i wasn't a huge fan of the game either, but i don't buy the puzzle simulator argument as most of the puzzles you encounter are solved for you by your companions before you have time to realize you're even in a puzzle section."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,the first gow in this play style for this story first came out on the ps4. just fyi. and it does get better for sure.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-24,all sony games are interacrive movies
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"i played a god of war a long time ago, i think it was on ps2 or 3, been so long."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"yeah, i was hoping for some solid exploration and combat. i'll keep trying but not sure i can get through it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,they seem to be the only ones with criticisms though. like it's ok to like both gow and elden ring guys.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"i am. loved all the fromsoft games, haven't played demon souls or bloodborne yet, but now that's a possibility owning my first playstation since ps3. it kind of amazes me the debate for goty between ragnarok and elden ring. they're both completely different games. but in my head the entire time i'm just thinking... how did people think ragnarok was gonna get goty."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-24,for sure
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,seems like we've upset the god of war fanboys lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"no, i mean the ps4 god of war. its a new story and its pretty imperative to play before ragnarok."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,i think he means god of war which came out on ps4 in 2018. youre playing the sequel to that.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"if you keep playing you get opened up to several mini open worlds with tons of exploration. plus you get bombarded with new weapons and combos to unlock so the combat definitely improved that said, like another commenter stated, you should really play the first one if you want to better understand the story. its aged very well for being a few years old"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,the race for goty is often between two incomparable games. that's why very little weight is actually given to the title.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,i've played both and loved both. gowr is superior as a complete game. it's really not even close.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,naa just got boring.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"what a pathetic excuse for being a dense moron. we arent fanboys, we just use common sense. everyone in here is stating the obvious. if you didnt play the first game god of war 2018, then why the fuck are you playing ragnarok? gow is less about the gameplay and more about the incredible story. you are absolutely ruining the story by playing it out of order. judging by your replies to others, you should probably just return the game cause you will never get into it with an attitude like yours."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"i played the first one and enjoyed it, played ragnarok but something just isnt there for me. i cant even put my finger on it exactly but i didnt finish the game and honestly dont plan to atm."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"it'd make sense to play the old one for story reasons, but wouldn't change anything for gameplay."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,how isn't elden ring complete?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-24,incredible story i am kratos i am angry i murder everything.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,a story isn't all that useful if the path of discovering it is absolutely atrocious.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"why so hostile over someones opinion though? as someone who played the first one, ragnarok to me was just overhyped. boring, linear, but beautiful graphics. i dont fault people for liking it, i can see why people love it, but if i dont like it why does it bother you and others so much. youre allowed to like or not like a game without being attacked by fans of the game. this is extremely toxic disgusting behavior in the gaming world but keep on. you got more rage than kratos himself over someones simple opinion."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,to each their own i guess. i loved it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,i think its because the main quests mixed with secondary ones is all over the place and it feels too bloated. the second playthrough is muuuuuch better if you know what to do and when to do it. just my opinion tho
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,i loved it but the atreus missions threw off the pacing. i can see why people have complaints.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,the story is the most important part of the game lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"ill say this i immensely enjoyed the first one, but cant continue the second one for the reasons you listed. regardless, it baffles me that you wouldnt start at the previous game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,i never said it wasn't. it's just not as well done.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"why come on rgaming and bash a game you cant get into? you dont enjoy it, return it and be done with it. stop complaining about shit you have complete control over."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,something just didnt click for me this time around. cant even tell you why really. its like a bunch of little things added up and i didnt care that much all of a sudden.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"honestly not really, the gameplay is the most important part of the game by far."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,can't carry a game into being good with just a story.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,everything is done way better besides the story. elden ring just doesn't hold peoples hand.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"while i agree with this, it goes both ways, if you like something stop making stupid posts about omg i love x game guyz or x game is great! over and over. while op comes off really dumb, there are people who have legitimate criticisms for games that the subreddits circlejerk eachother off for. either both are allowed or none of it is."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,his post didnt bash it. he simply asked if it got better. gaming reddit is to discuss games and opinions not just say how much you love your favorite games
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"when you watch a tv show, what do you pay attention to?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,if you usually play games that dont focus on a story i can see how youd feel that way lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,gameplay is always king
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,if you believe that then you should drop the game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,yeah. the graphics are better huh. the platforming is just so amazing in elden ring. that clunky combat is laughable. i still enjoyed the world and that's why i enjoyed it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,this guy gets it
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,a story isn't all that useful if the path of discovering it is absolutely atrocious. this response suggests otherwise. so do all of his other replies that have been downvoted.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"that's a stupid question, god of war is a game, not a tv show. and if we're being honest, while the god of war games have good stories by video game standards, compared to movies, tv shows, and books, it has a mediocre at best story. the gameplay is what ultimately makes it worth playing, the story is just a bonus."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,goes for games in general. progressing through a story isn't all that interested when the journey to get through it is boring.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"elden ring looks way better. but maybe the comparison i'm seeing is from pc to ps5, but combat in elden ring isn't clunky. you might just suck."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,i've really upset the gow fanboys. it just feels like a basic ass game. i feel like you have to be deeply involved into the gow story to even enjoy it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"im talking about his main post, but yes, no need to talk bad about it to people who like it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"thats your opinion, chief. and are we talking about all games still or are we back on god of war. because gameplay is more important than story in all games is a different statement than just gow."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,do you like reading?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,then dont be surprised of you dont end up liking it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,compared to gow combat it is most certainly clunky. also. let's not start with insults. makes you sound adolescent. it's ok for people to disagree with you.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,i loved the first gow and played it like 3 or 4 times thru. ragnarok did not do enough for me. couldn't make it thru.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,"this post is about god of war is it not? don't try to move the goalposts. unless you're implying that your original comment was saying that story is more important than gameplay in all games, which is even dumber than what i thought you were saying. i think it's safe to say that gameplay is more important than story in 99 of games at least. even heavily story driven games, the appeal comes from the fact that you are controlling the character, selecting dialogue choices, role playing, etc. not only that, even the games with the best stories in gaming, don't even have that good of stories compared to books, movies, and tv shows. if you only care about story and not gameplay, then why even play games at all? you can find way better stories in other mediums"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-19,i hated the desert area. everything else was awesome.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-21,"can't wait to try it, looks amazing!!!!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"this is literally me and i cant find a working solution, im so pissed"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,i'm literally on the last mission and the cutscene at the very end is muted. i can hear music and sfx but no dialogue. frustration doesn't even describe how i'm feeling rn. i've gone the whole game and the climactic moment is ruined.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,had an issue with cutscene dialogue and subtitles being gone. i just manually saved and reloaded and it fixed it. regular game dialogue has been fine but just fyi. i'm playing on ps5.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"i have this on ps4. all audio worked fine until it just suddenly stopped during cutscenes. i'm probably about halfway through the game, to where a guy gets dragged into a cave and thats where it stopped for me. there is still audio just walking around and stuff, which is stranger still. don't know what to do to fix it. this sucks though. and as for mono audio and voice boost, both were off. i can turn voice boost on but it will not let me turn on mono audio, it is a dark gray."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,open ps5ps4 settings. go to sounds and set 7.1 to 2 channel sound and it will be fixed.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,i downloaded the game last night on the ps5 and have the exact same issue. have audio for everything but the character dialogue
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,this is so lame.... obviously the gameplay is fantastic but without the dialogue the story is kinda ruined. i'm with ya ps4 friend
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"i have this problem exept it's for certain sound effects. the sound of the mystic gates when you activate them, the mechanical noise of the svartalfheim trains and other ambient noises. it's annoying and i cant find a fix."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,it sounds like a problem with the sound settings. do you have a a av receiver?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,fix i foudn was rebootign the game

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"oh fuck yeah! so i use a receiver for my sound system and i just plugged to hdmi directly from tv to ps4 and it fixed it. not as loud and epic but now i can actually play with dialogue! hope this helps, good luck!"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"switch audio format to bitstream dts, it worked for me"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"i had the same issue. i closed the game, applied the patch then started it again. issue is gone for now."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,i can hear all sounds well but the dialogue feels like the characters are talking to you from miles away . any fix for this? i'm on ps4
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,"i'm having this issue as well audio being delayed or not playing at all, i'm playing it on a base ps4 tried the suggestions in the thread, unfortunately still not resolved. does anybody have an update on a working solution, is sm even aware about the audio being bugged?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-02,mine is the opposite i can hear all the voice but there is no sound effects anr it's really annoying can anyone help?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-20,"this happened to me just now  tried everything above and nothing worked except closing the application and opening again. spoilers warning i was at the part when atreus comes back from asgard the first time, the subtitles and audio and music were all silent but kratos grunting was working lol. the app and ps4 are all updated too. odd."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-24,"hey, i got the same issue for last of us. seems like there is a fix for ps5, but out of all the forums and reddit post still havent found a fix for ps4. thought id let you know that youre not alone. and to also ask if you ever found a fix?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,not sure if you are still having the same issue but for me it was changing my tvs audio format from auto to dolby. for some reason the ps was not being set to the correct audio stream using auto.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,this is my exact position right now too
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,did u get it fixed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,mine cut out at the same part. and my mono is also off and grayed out. ive tried loading earlier saves and still nothing. im pretty upset about it!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,do you mean sound and screen settings?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"i have it at random large bits of the game, breaking a large statue, bridges collapsing. fucking annoying."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,what worked for me is i turned music and voice down to 8 and left sfx at 10. fixed it for me but i don't know how it'll work for others. edit also switched the audio settings on my ps4 to bitstream dolby but there was no change after doing this only after i turn down the volume on music and voice. just putting in case both need to happen
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"sorry, i dont know what that is. in the settings, all the audio settings are at 1010, default"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,i have a problem where one sound would just get stuck in loop and i would hear it untill i reset or die
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,i tried that. thanks for the help though
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,how do you do that on ps4?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,are you on ps4 or ps5?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,yeah it worked on my ps5
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,this worked. i had the same issue where the dialogue sounded very faint and far away and i could barely hear it. weird because i played through the main story with everything working just fine but after that i had this issue. this is great advice and worked instantly. im on ps5
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"this worked for me. odd thing is that my audio worked fine until the postgame, i went in a specific room and everything got muffled with kratos and mimir, but this fixed my issue. i even was able to set it back to the original settings and it remained fixed after i followed the instructions. thanks for the help"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-10,this and dropping ingame volume settings worked for me. ps4 vanilla with extended storage. trust me i tried everything else.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-29,worked for me as well. thanks!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-10,switch your audio settings to bitstream dts. lower in game audio less than 9. poof.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,"my tv only has pcm and raw options, and ive tried both, neither fixed it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-02,thank you so much. this worked for me
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,settings  sound  audio output change hdmi device type to  av amplifer then scroll down and change number of channels to 2 channel.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,that's when i get the audio glitches as well. like i can still hear their foot steps and character audio but everything else is dead silence. kinda awkward lol happens randomly as well. doesn't always happen but does happen pretty frequently.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,this worked really well
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,and in the ps4 audio settings?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,also i'm using headphones. not speakers
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,ps5
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-12,"thanks for responding i tried your solution and it still doesn't work properly, i'm going to wait on the next patch, if it's not fixed by then i'll just sell my game. i don't have this problem with gow 2018 or rdr2."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"that's literally not there. thanks for the help, but there is no sound setting, just sound and screen, and when i click on audio output settings, there is only the option to change the audio format from linear pcm to bitstream dolby or bitstream dts"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,this worked!!!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,"yeah exactly, really annoying are there any fixes known for the ps4?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,what would i look for? the audio is fine in other games and every other aspect of the audio in gow besides dialoge
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"i'm on ps4, there are different setting options"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,ps5 settings. go to controller ps button homegear icon in upper right corner of screen. then soundaudio output. then follow the steps the previous poster mentioned.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"i have a ps4 pro and was having the same issues. i fixed the issue by going into the god of war settings under audio and subtitles at the very bottom you'll see mono audio and voice boost. my settings were off by default, turning them on fixed the voice issue. my hdmi system settings are dts bitstream if that matters."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,i haven't seen anything. i actually have it for the ps5 but just have been looking everywhere for anyone with similar problems. i know the last patch notes for both didn't mention any fixes for it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"i've got the exact same problem, i'm gutted, on ps5, i can't believe it seems not many people are having this issue, i have no idea what the hell to do, maybe post a video of it and tag santa monica"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"im not a hundred percent sure, maybe check how to enable 3d audio on ps4?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,i'm on ps4
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,thanks this fixed it!!!!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,turning off mono audio and the new updates fixed it! i can finally play
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"thanks for the help, i tried that"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,"this sucks, i'll just have to wait or replay the game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"are you on patch 2? also, have you tried turning high frame rate mode off?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,it worked?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"no, sadly"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"you do more optional missions because you need gold to buy better equipment and more experience for your skills theres also the reasons of side quests expanding the world  characters which are also important for a story driven game.  kratos is fragile 3 hits of any mob and youre dead. the thing about higher difficulties is that the enemies hit harder. you also have to strategize to prevent yourself being swarmed, using all your weapons, the various attacks with them,  using atreus  freyas attacks as well. every enemy also has attack patterns that can be predicted.  kratos is weak you need to hit a mob a lot to kill it. again, higher difficulties mean tougher enemies. they will hit harder  will take more hits.  kratos doesnt defend well 3 hits on the walltype shield and it will open your defense in the next attack. so you were overreliant on your shield. anyone who has played a soulsborne game will tell you not to do that. hell, anyone who has played breath of the wild will tell you not to do that! this also says that you never learned to parry. a lot of this stuff is more of an issue with you than it is of the game."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"my point is that playing gow on god of war difficulty is frustrating, irritating, boring, and feels unrewarding! then don't do it! those difficulties are in there for people who want that optional experience, if you're not enjoying it or don't want to do it then just don't. not every aspect of every game is going to be engaging or rewarding for you, nor is every difficulty level going to be balanced in the way you want it to be and that's fine."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"if you aren't using the ranged spear attacks to constantly detonate spears on enemies you're gonna have a rough time imo i did 100 it on gmgow difficulty and the only fight i got extremely frustrated on was the final valkyrie fight that unlocks after defeating odin, everything else was manageable if you use the right combos of gearrunicsabilities... and get really good at dodging... most bosses telegraph every attack they have, some just don't give you much time after the telegraph heh the part i 100 agree with is beating it on that difficulty isn't worth it. there's no trophy, no message, no acknowledgement that you put yourself thru it lol... that's where i think they dropped the ball."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,plays on super hard complains that kratos dies quickly complains that enemy are harder to kill bro....
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,yeah i think higher difficulties in a lot of games just aren't balanced very well
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"honestly i think you may just need to practice, and or look up some build combat tutorials online. it seems most of the things you mention here arent actually issues the game has, seems like you might just be button mashing or not know how to utilize kratos moveset. the thing about taking 3 hits on shield is technically correct for that one, but if you do the shield attack it resets it thats the entire purpose of that shield kratos can dodge multiple attacks in a row, especially if you dont roll but just dodge more than once. also after being hit, its impossible to be stunlocked to death he is not destabilized you can also use rage to cancel any stunned animation or if an attack breaks your guard. you certainly can destabilize enemies using the correct attacks, a single light attack wont work in most cases tho in gmgow. spamming runic attacks wont work in gmgow because after 2 or so they get a temporary shield against being stunned by them, wait 5 seconds and do it again boss fights are in mostly smallish spaces, but are still easily manageable. group fights are usually in open areas with verticality and places to jump in and out of the action, way more room for fights than in 2018. runic attacks will stagger most enemies, and there are perks that will raise your defense when using them specifically for the issue you mentioned, but if you cant space to make sure you wont get hit pick short but still damaging runic attacks, theres a bunch. red attacks are most definitely reactable, i think that is likely an issue with your reaction time. i really dont know what your talking about randomness and luck deciding if you win a fight, its quite literally about knowing an enemys moveset and watching for openings, or staggering them into oblivion when possible. as for kratos being weak thats most definitely an issue with your build lol, you can destroy bosses with the right setup and being prepared for the fight. having pre fight buffs would make no difference, it would just be an animation at the beginning of the fight lol, you dont need buffs when your already strong and have defense lol. i wouldnt want kratos to have to use a million buffs like in nioh anyways. the point is hes already strong, and is in the game if you use his kit properly. the games you mentioned dont have buffs either.. at least odyssey, ive never played botw. both are completely different games and genres tho and arent really comparable, but gow combat is much more in depth and better than both imo. also what you said you didnt in ac odyssey to a higher level boss would literally also work in ragnorok.. if your just using basic light attacks,your making the game harder for no reason."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"so basically the same problem the last game had, it just cranks up the health and damage numbers on the enemies but lacks any kind of tool to deal with this. so the game plays basically the same as on lower difficulties, but it just takes longer to kill anything. it's boring and not a good way to design difficulties."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,git.....gud?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,i think two words will answer this skill issue
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"oh great, another gmgow is bad post, yes, we already know damage slider and spongey enemies is bad difficulty design, but the reality is different devs have different way balancing the game and unfortunately gow is like this. if playing gmgow takes out the fun from playing, please lower the difficulty, theres nothing wrong with that, play at the difficulty that is fun for you, i play both game at gmgow, yes, its frustating and unrewarding ingame, but its anything but a luck based, boring experience for me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,it really seems like the problem you're having is that you're not good enough at the combat to play on those higher difficulties. there's nothing wrong with that. lower the difficulty if you can't play it at the highest.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,im stuck in gow and i dont even wanna try again its so frustrating.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"i loved gowr, but i do agree op some of the combat mechanics were frustrating."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"play elden ring or any of the souls games, etc if youre really looking to be humbled. the three examples you used are more story driven games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,ive thought since the first of the new series came out that if they just moved that damn camera back 4 feet from kratos they would have the perfect game. i hate the cinematic style camera trend lol.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"yeah 2018 has these issues too, the games themselves tho arent worth the price tags tbh. i enjoy them for what they are but overall theyre monologue walking simulators with repeat mobs for action. my largest complaint is the bloat of side content which as you said iirc that doesnt overly reward you for your efforts much anyway because you still get 2 shot by most berserkers especially and thats playing on the fucking lowest difficulty. theres almost no balancing in these games and its frustrating as shit. im a godi want to feel like a fucking god."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,removed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"i'm not a skillful player but if you wants to beat gow on gow difficulty level, means you're a well deserved god of war.. definitely it's not something achievable by anyone who just put in hard work.. not anyone can be good enough to be god of war and i'm sure someone actually beat it before have fun achieving that, balanced is enough for me"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,normal mode is how the developers intend the game to be played. that is the mode most tested b
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-26,"you think that's bad? try beating lamulana guideless on hard mode and without using the gun. you will probably not be able to finish the game. your points are all valid, it sucks when you can't even get a weapon skill off. i already struggle with that on normal. but i think that if you play on hard, you gotta power through. there is no excuse if you voluntarily choose to be extreme. you always have the option of doing it on a lower setting to destress a bit, or you need to get your shit together and find a strategy, no matter how much cheese is involved. anyway you seem to have done it regardless, so good job! i do not have nerves of steel like that."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-25,sounds like u need to.. gitgud
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-26,its heavily focused on parries and incentives mastering it for a huge advantage. boggles me that someone would go on give me god of war without at least attempting to learn it along the way rather than just using the blocking shield. and on that note they couldve double tapped to reset shield charge and make it work but as you said this is a player issue not fully grasping the situation and diverting the blame towards the game instead.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,i wouldnt if i knew how bad it would be. other games i play on higher difficult i dont have this feeling
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"yeah, i use the spear whenever seems possible. practically beat muspelheim challenges with it lol i fought the valkyrie 3 times to check on her and thought of finishing the berserkers before going after it. she seems have a beatable logic but i haven't passed her 50 to see if she changes anything. for the berserker i mentioned in the post i will kill it when i get some free time. i wish i had more usable skills available to crack them up thought."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,i am not complaining about that. just read the damn post
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"not the responder, but i did and beat it in about 52 hours. both gow 2018 and ragnarok on gmgow, and i concur, it mostly sounds like an issue in your level. not that i'm accusing you of anything, but learning the enemies pattern is integral in succeeding in the mode. gmgow is a mode that tests all your limits, reaction times, strategies, skills, runic skills, and your partners freya and atreus. throughout the game, admittedly, i got frustrated at certain parts, but that was mostly the hell walker with the 2 axes, i hate that b and the 3 boss fight in alfheim. most of the other things i handled pretty well, even the trials is muspelheim. in fact, i used my build in 2018 and installed runic and cooldown which helps me immensely in becoming spammy against enemies. the king and gna were up there with the hardest, but back in gow 2018, i died 50 something times to sigrun and eventually beat her after coming back. my tip is to play kratos in gmgow difficulty as the strategist he is. on gmgow we know we're at a disadvantage, but to me, accomplishing and overcoming bosses and mods is the rewarding part, because we know we are supposed to struggle. i also didn't use that shield and focused solely on parrying which made most enemies manageable if not a joke at times. perfect parrying to me has always been better than straight up blocking. playing games like ninja gaiden, sekiro, wo long, nioh, monster hunter has given me insane reaction time. i say take time to play other extremely difficult games to build your reaction time. but that's my two cents. hope this helps in some case."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"out of curiosity, did you beat gow in gow difficult?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,there. finally a good comment. thanks
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"you didn't read the whole thing, did you"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"other than that the main difference i see is that you enjoyed those you succeeded in, and didn't enjoy the one you haven't i don't get this part at all. i have succeeded in the 3 games i mentioned aco, botw and gow. the main difference between them is that gow was the least fun of them and i just wanted to share my reasonings behind my opinion."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,i already beat odin on god of war difficult level. read the post dude
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,i used them exactly of that reason. they are similar to gow but very hard difficult is rewarding instead
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,you obviously didn't even bother to read any of the post
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"either i have skill issues i concur, it mostly sounds like an issue in your level. not that i'm accusing you of anything or the game has issues throughout the game, admittedly, i got frustrated at certain parts you can't have both ways. but we are on point as you mentioned that you got frustrated with certain fights. now, don't you agree that it would be a better experience if we had more usable skills?  defensive like a protection against side attacks  long jumps to avoid swarms  passive auras those skills probably wouldn't be used in normal difficulty but could be nice at higher ones. again, my problem is not how hard it is but how it harms the gameplay."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,absolutely not.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,odin isn't as hard as the berserker you're unable to beat. read your own post.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,yea i can see that.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,i meant that you cant tell me that i am not good enough to play on higher difficulties if i have already concluded 98 of the game on the most difficult level there is. i am complaining that the playthrough was bad experience because of shitty skills available. it will still be bad when i beat 100 and i will. i wrote this post for maybe someone will read and create a better sequel.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"well i stopped at them complaining about the difficulties, it kinda spoke for itself."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,every criticism you gave about kratos in combat is mostly a you issue.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"same, the game is superb. and even if you arent keen on the gameplay. the story, narrative, character interactions, dialogue and graphics are top tier."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"the problem isnt how weak kratos is, but the lack of tools to circumvent it"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"out of curiosity, did you beat gow in gow difficult?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"again, that's a you issue. he has all the tools he needs to circumvent the difficulty on the highest level. because a lot of people have beat it on that level without as much issue as you're describing. it could be your armor, runes, etc."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"i did give me no mercy. if i ever get around to playing new game plus, i'll probably do give me god of war. but what i played it on has no bearing on what you're saying. a lot of people have beat it on the highest level of difficulty and don't feel like kratos is too weak, too slow, etc. that's a you issue."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,i get it. you are not good enough beat it on gow level. imagine trying a 100? good on you that you realize it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,maybe i'm not. i'm not sure yet. i haven't tried it. but i didn't make a post complaining about how hard the game was. that is all you.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"yeah, when you get up to 98 in gow difficulty you can tell yourself that you are as good as me. at that time i will definitely have already 100 it because you know i am good."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,you sound pathetic. i never said i was as good as you. i never discussed my skill level at all. it sounds like you get your selfworth from your ability to play video games on hard difficulty. that's pathetic.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,that is the point. ive decided to write my experience with the game. you come and say that i am not good enough. my skill should not be debatable since i stated that already beaten it up to 98 of what one can do in the game. it is obvious that i can get to 100. i came here saying that it could be a better experience overall. and then i sound pathetic? grow up dude
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,"if the difficulty level you're playing a game on is frustrating, boring, difficult, unrewarding, then you're playing on the wrong difficulty level for you. but you seem to feel required to play on the hardest difficulty because it makes you feel superior. that's the part i find pathetic. i don't care what difficulty i play on. i want to enjoy the game i'm playing. if i was playing on a hard difficulty and the game was more frustrating than enjoyable, i would lower the difficulty. you seem to be unable to do that but instead complain about the game mechanics that you are frustrated by. when i say maybe you're not good enough for the highest difficulty, i don't mean to say that you're unable to beat it. i mean to say that you're unable to beat it without thinking it's frustrating and boring. but if you enjoy being frustrated and bored, then by all means keep playing on the hardest difficulty."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,the premise of the god of war difficulty is that the player must have godly reflexes bla bla bla and that is what i bought the game for. imagine not being able to complain about something you bought so the company make it better next time.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,pleasantly surprised by the design choices so far.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,just glad they didnt make him look like thor does in movies and every other medium
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,the book? there are so many books about norse mythology.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"also accurately depicting thor. red hair and big red beard and fat. thor was a glutton and most commonly known for it, but being the most loved god next to baldur, everyone just accepted it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,mjlner  mjlnir
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,"i mean, he looks much more menacing than hollywood thor. mcu thor just looks like a pretty boy that decided to hit the gym a few times because he broke up with his girlfriend."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,more like they made the book design after gow. the book came out in 2019 while in gow post credit scene you can already see the hammer and that was in 2018
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,"why is nobody talking about how stupid his outfit is? yes, its shocking that hes fat instead of toned and muscular but why is he not covering his nipples and huge gut? how is that keeping him warm or protecting him? is that how the original mythology was or something?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,let me make one thing clear i kinda am not a fan of thors gow r looks tbh never did but aye thats me
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,removed
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,thats a great book!
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,he's a god. what make you think he can't look however he wants to.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,close? theyre identical
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-13,"the book? what? that aside, first time seeing this, wasnt what i was expecting. but i dont hate it. my biggest problem is there i dont really get any intimidation from him at least with this picture. he looks too chill? idk baldur at least looked pretty deranged odd interpretation as well but i loved it. curious to see how he is displayed in the game"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,i'm so happy someone else mentioned it.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,"marvel thor is essentially a different character altogether than the one from norse myths, probably the least accurate version even. so all the complaints that this thor design doesnt fit into the image marvel incepted into everyones heads is nonsense"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,"people who want him to look like chris hemsworth are weird. dude rapes, mutilates, probably eats newborns for fun. he's a hedonist. maybe he's too full of himself to believe he needs to be in shape, because any he's ever faced have been an easy time for him."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,y'all got it all wrong. he needs to look like a scrawny bugeyed alien with advanced technology. indeed...
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,yes this way its distinct and has its own identity.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,he can drink the whole ocean worth of mead if you tried no wonder he has a beer belly
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,i don't get why he was so beloved. after reading some norse mythology i think he was a dumb jerk.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,he looks like a pirate and an angel had a baby
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,first part on point.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,... or both are based on previous imagery.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,why does he need to be warm? he is a god
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,"so i would suspect it's a fashion statement from the devolopers. his clothesarmor are very similar to kratos from gow 4 and ragnarok trailer. also thor is the god known for his strength, if any of the norwegian pantheon is going damn near naked into fimbulwinter it's thor and skadi. skadi is a completely different thing though."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,"shut up, hes got the armbands, the belt and the hammer. that is thor"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-01-20,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,cause thats how he was described in the real mythology edit well maybe not as fat but i think itd make since seeing how feasts and drinking was a big part of norse culture
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"cause thor is depicted as a dude who loved killing, eating and drinking a lot also in the previous game mimir literally calls him a fat dobber so this depiction is perfect."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,considering thor once drank an ocean or half of an ocean depending on the interpretation it's safe to assume he's pretty fat.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,you cant steal the design when its the legit mythology lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,deleted
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,have you seen a movie called avengers end game?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,this new look is so refreshingly intimidating.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,"bc youre reading it without knowing the historical context. thor was the peoples god bc he cared about their plight and he had an occupation, he was a smith. and as far as him being a dumb jerk he isnt the god of thunder, he is the thunder. he is the storm. you cant reason with a thunder storm, its part of its nature."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-17,no that's literally the hammer design made by the artists of god of war 2018.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,"from what i understand of this thor from what we learned in the first game, he seems like the kind of guy who could not be bothered for any armor because he is convinced of his invincibility. the kind of guy who doesnt even wear a shirt because he doesnt want to share his ale with it. the kind of guy whose stare alone begs you to stare a second longer or become the new home for mjolnir."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-01-20,you did lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,in some myths he looks just like that
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"i'm talking about the hammers likeness to the book cover, not anything else. the hammers design is not legit mythology as it just has a bunch of weird patterns on it that aren't actual runes or commonly found patterns within norse mythology."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"do you also realise he is said to have resurrected his goat after eating it, wouldn't exactly be weird if he didn't gain that much weight or any at all lol if he can do that. at the end of the day i think it's kind of weird to just sort of throw one god under the proverbial bus when he's consistently being described as mighty and most powerful of the gods especially odd when all the other gods in the game series pretty much have been depicted as being more impressive and dare i say, god like."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,"ah, that's a good explanation. i can also understand that people felt safe with him because he protected them from giants and other foes. but before reading the mythology, i always thought he was some kind of wise, but usually his solution for everything was smash hammer."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,i just looked old illustrations of him they they flucated between hefty and fairly muscular
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,wiat so in endgame they actually made him look more accurate during the final fight?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"that's literally what the hammer looks like in mythology. maybe the pommel is a bit more elongated but as far as the hammer head goes, it's spoton."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,yeah wisdom is odin and freyas department. theres actually a story about how odin disguised as a boatman was insulting and messing with thor and wouldnt let him cross the river. it started as a back and forth insult match and ended with thor violently describing what how he will bash the boatmans head in if he ever comes over.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,"yes, the basic shape does exist in a lot of depictions, but the handle and markings are just taken straight from the design on the book cover. but like i said, the book design might've been made by the same artist or maybe the design is some sort of open source asset that they were allowed to use without infringing on any copyright issues. also if you look at old rune stone etchings the majority of them don't have that design, so technically i guess you could say that design isn't necessarily historically accurate."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-12,"yeah i've heard about that story, unfortunately it wasn part in the book i read"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,toothuman
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,i was playing this yesterday. wish it didn't get cancelled
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"loved the right stick combat system. even through all its flaws and controversy, this game will be a classic to me."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,one of the lead designers came to my college when i was there as i went to school near the studio. was only a couple years before they went under. i actually still have my silicon knights tshirt i got from him.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,loved too human. played it obsessively. had 2 or 3 maxed out characters. made sure to get the digital copy when microsoft put it up for sale briefly a few years ago. it's now one of 3 games i'll never uninstall.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"i remember when this released, a short time after you got to play with the devs for a weekend. they were really nice. shame the series didnt pan out."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,i loved this game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"kinda scary when you realize the demo was a more polished experience than the final release. neat ideas apparently lashed together with bubblegum, thoughts, and prayers. small wonder it was one and done. 1 for crispin freeman voicing baldur iirc."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"just note op, you have a rare game on your hands. all unsold copies had to be destroyed due to a lawsuit over the games engine."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,dont you just run around endlessly on this game?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,that game was unplayable when it came out. let alone now
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,it was okay... i had fun going through it once.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,that's a strange correlation.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,think i grabbed this when it was a feebie
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,toot human? when did it come out?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"controls are a mess, but it is fun. the world buildingconcept was solid. wish they could have had a refined sequel."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,i think people are forgetting this company was sued so hard for stealing assets that their company was obliterated.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,great game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,is this the game that got swallowed by uncharted 2 release?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,i was so excited for this game for a few years i believe then i played the demo and was super disappointed and never bought it. might not have been a demo might have been gamefly.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,loved this game so much as a kid
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,this is my gaming guilty pleasure. i played the hell outta this game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"the real baldur, i loved that game shame about the sequel though"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,this was such an underrated game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-22,i hated this game
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,tooth u man
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,i do love the 23 second unskippable death animation of a valkyrie slowly descending and pulling you up to valhalla every single time you die
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,it definitely seems a bit weird
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"oh wow, that sounds really cool"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"yeah, i heard the company didnt make a sequel because they got assblasted out of existence for stealing assets. i guess you cant expect too much of the game if that happened to the company immediately after the game released. but hey, if crispin freeman is there, it can only be so bad, right?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,it does
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,i don't know if i'd consider it rare. there's so many in circulation you can find it on ebay for around 7
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"idk, ive never played it. i got it from my brother about ten years ago"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"it's weird it would remind them of a game that old, but too human's about norse mythology and has baldur as a major character like he was in god of war 2018, so i could see it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"ah, nice. my brother gave me my copy"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"yeah, ive heard that a lot. i checked the manual for the controls and it definitely looks a bit odd, thats for sure"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"fuck around dyack tried to blame epic for th's technical failings and sued them. find out epic took offense at this, won the suit, filed countersuit and snapped the company in half. fantasy empires and dark legions will remain indelible parts of my childhood. rip sk, victim of hubris."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,it got swallowed by being terrible in every way.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,toot human.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,dont die?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"whelp, i paid 25 too much then damn."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,this is exactly why
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,ayo is that the new mirrors edge?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,have you played this game?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,i remember this being in the bargain bin for one or two bucks. someone totally got you.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"damn, that sucks bro"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,damn bro. rip lol
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"definitely curious how they handled baldur as a character in too human. i really love the broken, psychotic mess we got in gow2018 it was hard to truly hate him even when he was actively trying to murder kratos and atreus, once you learned why he was that way. i just couldn't get into the gameplay of too human coming off of devil may cry and god of war, the rightstick melee combat was too different for me to get my head around. conceptually, though, it sounded cool as hell."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"sure have, love it. ill admit dying is pretty common although playing as beserker which most people do is guaranteed death in late game unless youre incredible. commando and champion have it easy imo. i guess the problem is class imbalance?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-21,"ok, so i just played a little bit of it. its definitely weird, but it makes combat flow nicely. i just would prefer the usual"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"it just gets old quick, and losing a minute in waiting turns to losing an hour. but i am happy to own this piece of gaming history."

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,it's probably been said before but egypt has an abundance of gods to slaughter. kratos deserves a nice tropical vacation away from the freezing norths.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,"i have doubts if they can ever replace kratos in this series, especially with someone like atreus. the entire series is kratos."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,"imma be real with you guys, i thought ragnarok was great but i also thought ragnarok felt super rushed when it came to norse gods. i understand they didnt want to make another trilogy and stretch out the story past its means but they built up so many characters, especially on the norse side, that ended up either not really doing much or just feeling underdeveloped by the end like thrud and sif just because they didnt want to make a trilogy. feels like the impact of these deaths and occurrences was lessened because they were just speedrunning both the setup of corruption outside of mimirs stories in the first game and the downfall that comes from it. like we meet and were supposed to care about thors family but by the end theyre kind of just relegated to a small support system for atreus and will probably not come back the next game since they finished what they needed to with norse myths. also playing as atreus kind of sucked ass after the third section. i play god of war for kratos, not some emotionally unstable furry smh"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,how is atreus supposed to tell himself how to solve a puzzle 0.5 seconds after he's seen it?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,"if they were going to replace kratos they would have manned up and killed him in ragnarok instead of subverting the audience with it's sugar coated ending. however, even killing him wouldn't have meant much since he could just wake up in various other religious afterlife's or be reincarnated. its pretty obvious that they will never replace kratos. meanwhile, they are probably going to kill freya at the onset of the next game. kratos needs to be pissed about something..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,"i like how it ends, but i miss atreus' commentary in post game. i feel like there's definately potential for lokibased games, but also we have kratos' next story. he is still a god of war, but now he's more like how they described tyr compassionate, merciful, looking for peace. i honestly thought thats where they were going, having kratos take up a new god of war's mantle. that being said, he has a drive to rebuild in midgard, and i think he will actually be a god to people instead of to himself. odin asks if he even knows what its like to be worshipped and loved by mortals, and now he will. i think his story leads him to being a new god who rebuilt the world in the ashes of ragnerok. i'd like to see that story. god of war has so much potential still, i hope this isnt the actual last."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-14,next in line will be  god of mischief  loki
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-14,"atreus will most likely end up in a new domain, piss off a couple of new gods and off to another adventure with kratos to kill some more gods. i doubt kratos would be put to the end for atreus any time soon but both will be used for the story like ragnarok, mimir on the other hand has a deal he has to hold up so we'll see how long before he gots that job to do. replacing kratos with atreus if it ever came to that would be a make it or break it decision for gow, they'd have to build him to be even greater and likable than kratos which would be the most difficult thing to do"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,doesn't look like an end to me.

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,"never played a god of war game, but i really want to see him go after the christian god just to see the drama that would unfold."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,i got the platinum and i must have missed where that was the end of him. because it sure didnt look like the end of kratos for me based on those final scenes.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,nice drawing. i've never seen the allure of this series
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-15,freya looks very young here
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-16,there definitely will be a game in a god of war universe about atreus. but i dont think they will name it god of war. and i am sure there will be more games about kratos. people like money.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-24,"this games story was such a pointless, conflictlacking bore. thor, odin and all of asgard were talked about as bloodthirsty psychos in 18 and they were all just boring nothings in ragnarok. it was such a lackluster experience, i still cant even believe it."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,"they had the egyptian gods at the end of god of war 2018, on the mural at the end"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-24,the entire game was just kratos being a chillnon violent dad. at this point itd make 0 sense to kill any gods.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,i simply would not play it if they didnt have kratos. its like halo without masterchief or super mario without mario.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,my thought as well
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,"if they make an atreus game they should call it god of mischief as atreus is loki, the norse god of mischief, that way kratos will always be the protag of the god of war games."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-15,it was rushed and it felt like they sort of tried to maximize their audience and be more child friendly by giving the story a more disney cartoon tone and adding in a lot of hand holding
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-14,"i feel like atreus will probably go missing in egypt or something, and then kratos will go out in search of him."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,i know in 2018 gow they mentioned egypt and japan
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,"if he goes after one god, he goes after him all. youll know what that means, or you wont."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,in jotunheim? thats pretty exciting. but i honestly don't see how they can top this norse gods arc.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,they also had the eye of horus on the shrine that showed all of the different cultures symbols of war
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-24,unless atreus gets himself into trouble during his quest to find all the marbles.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,halo reach was and is still fantastic. same with halo wars.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,"so, kratos's creed?"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,"i don't think it would top it, just be an additional campaign that's also good."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,yup. that's what i'm referring to
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,"i agree, halo reach was great, but it wasn't halo 4, it was a separate offshoot. they still kept masterchief in halo 46. if they did a son of war offshoot, sure, but as long as they dont retire kratos."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-14,"halo reach was incredibly mediocre imo but it wasn't because of the protagonist, it had to do with gameplay, visuals and voice acting. at least the level design wasn't total dogshit like halo 4"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,"yea, except less cookie cutter hopefully."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,like dlc? either way i expect a vocal minority to crap on it if it doesn't live up to their hype. if it adds to gow ragnarok like the witcher 3 dlcs did then i would be very pleased.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-15,yeah but halo 46 sucks
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,and less fetch quest and filler missions. assassins creed always looks so cool in the trailer but when i play it im just so bored by all the filler content. that game does not respect your time.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,"no, i mean a sequel game using the next engine i assume unreal 5 living up to hype isn't the same as topping it for example, modern warfare 2019 and modern warfare 2022 were really fun campaigns, they didn't top previous campaigns, they just were also good."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-15,100 truth

Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,i fanboyed a little when i saw that gow thor had a dad bod just like marvel thor. shame he's evil or whatever.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"he's the.strongest of the gods but also immortal. you know how podgy strongmen get in their 40's an 50's, imagine what they'd look like if they lived for milennia after that"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,holy shit! youre right! cant believe i didnt notice that. everyone noticed that
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"yea? well, you know, that's just like uh, your opinion, man..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,you may be the first person to make that connection
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,i absolutely loved all of the god of wars. the gameplay definitely went from more of a devil may cry to an insane new tomb raider type feel to it. was very happy with the series as a whole and enjoyed many hours of all of the titles even the one for psp was good in my opinion even with its limitations. couldn't help but laugh when i saw the posts about the new gow and how the first thing i thought of was this depiction of him in thor raganrok.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,getting older then skyrim jokes
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,fat kratos
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"he looks silly in the concept art but it's literally just concept art, we have no idea how badass he'll look in action and they've been nailing everything so far so i have faith in them."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,fat dobber thor
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,real thor?
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,no wonder if you keep a hammer with a volt number as big as the planet besides your belly
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,or whatever don't you remember he wiped out the entire race of giants
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,like the mythology marvel wasn't first
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"is he sleeping? no, i'm pretty sure hes dead..."
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,was i really? or are you just saying that  someone said everyone was already thinking it. i thought i was being original.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,baldur being the best case of this as he initially looked like a twink until he punched kratos through the roof.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"more like hiccup's dad, stoick the vast"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,he looks helpless in the concept.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,"if some dumbass believe the fat white bearded guy up there is real,thor exist and is real.the fat one,not chris hemsworth sexy thor"
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,minor details.
Reddit,Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-11,that was when i knew there was no way i was going to stop playing until its over. what a scene.
